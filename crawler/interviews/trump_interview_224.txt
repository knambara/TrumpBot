<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Begin Video Clip] They're talking about coal mining and we're talking about the miners being put out of business and totally put out of business. And as you saw Hillary wants to put them out of business. Wants to put the mines out of business. Wants to put a lot of things out of business. And we're not going to let it happen.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So, we have a lot of mining equipment behind us and around us, and we have a lot of equipment that's not being used because the mines are in very bad shape. [End Video Clip]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I know the criticism of Secretary Clinton about mining. It erupted, I think, in March. But back in November, she did put forward an energy program that I think -- I think perhaps more people might have thought it was not so anti-miners. She did have a program. I'm curious for you. Do you have any sort of concerns about the environmental impact of mining?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And do you have any concerns about the danger to the miners who work down below in these mining -- in these mines?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, the miners want to work. And they want to do it. That's what they love. In fact, I've asked them, you know, in West Virginia, where we had such tremendous turnout and tremendous returns. I spoke with the miners. That's what they love to do. And the safety now is really, you know, they have really brought it to a new level.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So it's really wonderful from that standpoint. But that's what they want to do. They want to be miners. And Clinton said not so long ago, as you know, a few months ago, she wants to put the miners -- you know, she wants to put the mines out of business. And it's ridiculous. Then she tried to retract it. But it was a little bit late.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And if you remember, she was sitting around the table with a beautiful mining family, a man who is a miner. And she was not very successful. And she certainly was not very successful in West Virginia. That, I can tell you. No, she is looking to put them out of business. There is no question about it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I know the miners are very unhappy with her, but just on some sort of broader perspective, in a Trump presidency, would you be focusing on other alternative forms of energy as well? I'm wondering, sir, of what your short program is on this.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> All forms, yes. All forms of energy. I want everything. I mean, frankly, you know, coal, clean coal is really a new thing that really does work. And you look at China. What they're doing with coal. They are using coal, and I doubt they are cleaning it. In fact, they are not cleaning it. But they have technology now that's wonderful.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're just not being able to use it. We are having a tremendous hard time with the environmental protection agencies and all. Federal is putting -- look, putting a lot of different kinds of industries out of business. But, in particular, when you get to energy and the coal and even natural gas is having tremendous problems, we could be energy independent.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Energy independent within a very short period of time. But they won't let that happen.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, George P. Bush, the son of Governor Jeb Bush has endorsed you. And that's -- a member of the Bush family. But at the same time, Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins, she says she is not going to vote for you. So tell me your thoughts about -- you are getting some Republicans inside the tent, but some Republicans are leaving the tent.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I'm very honored by George P. Bush. I thought that was really terrific. I saw it. And I watched the statement. I thought it was really terrific. I don't know Susan Collins at all. I know nothing. You know, I don't know anything about her. But she came out, but, you know, people don't talk about all the people that are supporting me. We have tremendous support in Congress.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have tremendous support in the Senate. Jeff Sessions as an example. I mean, we have tremendous support in the Senate. And, frankly, you look at the polls the way they are tightening up. People are starting to get it. And then you look at what's going on with Hillary, with selling government and, you know, all of the things that have come out today on the front page of a lot of the papers and you look at what she is doing in terms of pay for play and play for pay and all of the different things and they name it different.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, all of the different things she's doing. I'm telling you, it's starting to come out. And look at the way the polls are tightening up. And they are tightening up very fast. And I think a place like Virginia where I am now or a place like as an example Pennsylvania. I think Pennsylvania is going to be very strong for us. Now, she is spending tremendous numbers of dollars.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, tremendous amounts of money on ads. Like I just got here and they say ads are all over the place and I haven't done that yet. We will be doing it, but I haven't done it yet. We have been very successful in raising money from small donors. We're getting $61 a shot. Last month we raised $82 million.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We haven't done it yet. But i will say this. I think we're doing very well and we have a long way to go.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. Let me turn to the debates, and they're just being set up. I mean, they are being arranged. I happen to like the sort of the concept of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, where there is no moderator. But that's just me. I'm curious, you know, do you have any sort of thoughts on how it can be -- the debates can be more effectively done for the American voter?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> How would you like to see them done?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I just like to see a fair moderator. That's all I'm looking for. Because, you known, we have a lot of very unfair people treating us as Republican and as conservatives. If you are a Republican and a conservative, you get very unfair treatment. Look at what the "New York Times" said the other day. They practically admitted it. I mean, I have never seen anything like that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They practically admitted it. But you look at the unfair treatment by the media. It's incredible. But the good news is people understand that. People know it's unfair. And I think that maybe we'll reverberate and we'll see what happens. But no, I want to do the debates. You know, I did very well in the other debates.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Obviously, otherwise, I wouldn't be sitting here. And I think we are going to have very good debates. I do think this. I don't think they should put them opposite NFL games, because I think that's really unfair to do that. And, you know, I -- probably, Hillary Clinton would like that. But, I don't think they should be opposite NFL games.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I want to see a fair moderator. And whatever else, we'll look at. But certainly I want to do the debates.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. What about the format? And what about selecting the moderators? Are you going to -- I mean, what's sort of the impact? What are your thoughts on that? Are you dealing with the debate commission now? I mean, any part of this?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have just started. In fact, I think Rudy Giuliani will be working with them, and Paul and a couple of my people. But Rudy will be very much involved in terms of that. I just think we should have them similar maybe to what we did with the Republican debates except there will be two people instead of ultimately there were 17, I guess.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In the end, we had what, 17 people we started. We actually had two stages. So we don't have to worry about that. But I think that debates between the two of us would be very good. I think it would be very interesting. I think it's going to be very revealing for the public. And I look forward to it. But I would think something like what we had with the Republican debates, or what they had with the Democratic debates.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I thought that those debates, you know, they had Hillary and they had Bernie, and they were standing up, talking, and I think that's probably about as good as you are going to do. You want to have a fair moderator. That's all.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. You mentioned the swing state polls, and I looked at the Quinnipiac polls. It's close in Florida and Ohio, which of course is very important to the Republican ticket. Pennsylvania, not so much. The one I saw was about, I think about a 10-point difference. But what is -- do you have a ground game?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Have you already gotten started on that? What are the plans there?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We do. And I think we're going to do very well in Pennsylvania. I was a little surprise to see a 10 point gap in Ohio. We're doing well in Florida. We're doing well. But we haven't really started yet. You know, we haven't started any ads. She is spending a fortune on ads. I mean, I literally came to Virginia and I had five people say all you see on here are ads.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And the ads are false ads, by the way. They are ads that are just absolutely in many cases. Many of the things they say are absolutely false. Not 100 percent, but much of it. And I will say that I think that's disgraceful. And they know it's false. They know it's false. They're putting on ads where they know some of the things that they are saying are wrong, but they put them on anyway.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But we haven't started that process yet and we will be starting it pretty soon. I think Pennsylvania with the mines, with the coal miners, with the steel workers and with how poorly those elements of business are doing -- and, you know, I think we are going to do very well in Pennsylvania. So I was a little surprised.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now, Pennsylvania hasn't been won by the Republicans for quite a while, but I think we are going to win Pennsylvania. I think we are going to win Pennsylvania easily. Hillary, again, you look at -- you have a lot of miners in Pennsylvania. You have a lot of steel workers in Pennsylvania. Look at what's happened to steel production in Pennsylvania.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look at what's happened with the mines of Pennsylvania. They're really becoming nonexistent. And she is totally against them. So I think we are going to do very well in Pennsylvania and all over the state, not just with the two industries I talked about.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You have never run for office before. This is the first race you've ever run. What has surprised you the most to date about the process?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How smart the people of this country are because they are reading false narratives, they are reading false newspaper articles and seeing false things on television. I mean, really, a really biased reporting. And, you know, here I am. I'm sitting here in a very close race, what will be and what already is shaping up to be a very close race.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The people are so smart. They get it. They really get it. And they are seeing it more and more. And I think they are going to get -- I think they are going to get a great lesson. And it's not a fair situation. It's a rigged situation. In a certain way, it's rigged by the media, if you think about it. Now the other day in North Carolina, I was there yesterday.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And we had amazing crowds in North Carolina as you probably noticed. But we were talking about voter I.D. Voter I.D. was -- seems to be eliminated in North Carolina. I think that's, you know, very unfortunate. Voter I.D. That means -- does that mean that anybody can just go and walk in and vote? That's very unfair.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's very unfair. So, we'll be working on that situation with the governor of North Carolina who is, I think, going to be asking for a stay. But, when you see that you don't need identification to go in and vote, or a proper identification to go in and vote, a lot of states fortunately have been upholding it. But in the case of North Carolina, they didn't. So, that's a problem.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But, look, you know, when I look at the media, how one-sided it is, how biased it is, it's incredible. I mean, it's incredible.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, thank you very much for joining us. And I hope Secretary Clinton joins us as well. We have invitations out for her to join us as well to talk about these issues.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you very much.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> And the real first question is, where do you start the movie of your decision ...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, I saw that.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> ...to run for president? Because that is a big deal. A lot of internal/external stuff, and we'd love to hear your monologue on...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay. I thought it was very interesting. I saw that.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> ...how you did it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Where do you start the movie? I think it's actually – and very interesting question – but I think the start was standing on top of the escalator at Trump Tower, on June 16, which is the day – Bob, you were there, and you know what I mean, because there has... I mean, it looked like the Academy Awards. I talk about it. There were so many cameras. So many – it was packed. The atrium of Trump Tower, which is a very big place, was packed. It literally looked like the Academy Awards. And...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> But we want to go before that moment.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Before that? Okay, because that was really...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Because, other words, there's an internal Donald with Donald.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> Maybe late 2014 or – before you started hiring people?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, but that was – okay, but I will tell you, until the very end... You know, I have a good life. I built a great company. It's been amazingly – I'm sure you looked at the numbers. I have very little debt, tremendous assets. And great cash flows. I have a wonderful family. Ivanka just had a baby. Doing this is not the easiest thing in the world to do. People have – many of my friends, very successful people, have said, why would you do this?
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> So is there a linchpin moment, Mr. Trump, where it went from maybe to yes, I'm going to do this? And when was that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah. I would really say it was at the beginning of last year, like in January of last year. And there were a couple of times. One was, I was doing a lot of deals. I was looking at very seriously one time, not – they say, oh, he looked at it for many – I really, no. I made a speech at the end of the '80s in New Hampshire, but it was really a speech that was, it was not a political speech. But because it happened to be in New Hampshire...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> And that guy was trying to draft you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he was a very nice guy. But he asked me. And he was so intent, and I made a speech. It was not a political speech, anyway, and I forgot about it.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> And that was the real possibility? Or the first...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well no, the real possibility was the Romney time, or the Romney term. This last one four years ago. I looked at that, really. I never looked at it seriously then. I was building my business, I was doing well. And I went up to New Hampshire, made a speech. And because it was in New Hampshire, it was sort of like, Trump is going to run. And since then people have said, Trump is going to run. I never was interested. I could almost say at all, gave it very little thought, other than the last time, where Romney was running. And I thought that Romney was a weak candidate. I thought that – I thought Obama was very beatable. Very, very beatable. You know, you had a president who was not doing well, to put it nicely. And I looked at that very seriously. I had some difficulty because I was doing some big jobs that were finishing up, which I wanted to do. My children were younger. And four years makes a big difference. And I also had a signed contract to do The Apprentice with NBC. Which in all fairness, you know, sounds like – when you're talking about "president" it doesn't sound much, but when you have a two-hour show, primetime, every once a week on a major network...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> So when did it go to yes?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So – okay.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Because that's – having made, you know, we all make minor decisions in our lives.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> This is the big one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Big decision. Yeah, this is a big decision. And I say, sometimes I'll say it in the speeches. It takes guts to run for president, especially if you're not a politician, you've never ...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> When did it become yes?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What happened is, during that time that I was just talking about, I started saying I'd like to do it, but I wasn't really in a position to do it. I was doing a lot of things, and I had a signed contract with NBC. But I started thinking about it. And the press started putting me in polls, and I was winning in the polls. In fact, the day before, I was on Meet the Press the day before I announced I wasn't going to do it, and I got signed for another two years of The Apprentice and everything else. Which, by the way, I don't know if you saw, but The Apprentice is a big thing. I made two hundred...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> You made a lot of money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah. You were shocked. Remember this crazy man, Lawrence O'Donnell – he's a total crazy nut – he said, Donald Trump only made a million dollars with The Apprentice. I said, a million dollars? You know, when you have a show that's essentially number one almost every time it goes on, you can name it... So anyway, when they added it all up – and these are certified numbers, because you have to do certified numbers – it came out to $213 million. Okay? That's what I made on The Apprentice. That's just – and that's one of my small things. That's what I made. You know? So it was put at $213 million, and it was certified. And your friend Joe in the morning said, there's no way he only made... They had a big fight, and O'Donnell, Lawrence O'Donnell started crying. I never saw anything like it. Do you remember? He started crying. [Laughter] He actually started crying. But that shows the level of hatred that people have. But what happened is, I made – I had a very, very successful show. And they put me in polls, and I was essentially leading right at the top, without doing any work. Not one speech, not one anything. But any time I was in a poll, I did very well in the poll. Anyway, I decided not to do it. NBC called and Mark Burnett would call, and I did see if I could get out. I had another year on the contract. Because you're not allowed, because of the equal time, you're not allowed to have a show...
<Bob Costa> <Negative> What happened between 2011 and 2014?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that's what – I mean... Between 2011 and 2014? I would say, just thought process. Only thought process.
<Hope Hicks> <Neutral> A lot of deals.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, I mean, I was doing – but in terms of this, only thought process. So what happened, but during this period of time, I said, you know, this is something I really would like to do. I think I'd do it really well. Obviously the public seems to like me, because without any...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Who are you saying that to? Your wife?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> To myself.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> To your family?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> To my family, but to myself.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> To yourself.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, to myself, and ...
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> This is interior dialogue.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is thought process. And I'm saying to myself, you know, look, they put me in these polls. I'm number one. In fact, I said, I'm probably the only person ever to announce I'm not going to run for president when I'm number one in the polls. Because I remember the week that I announced that I wasn't going to run and that I was going to – that basically NBC extended me for quite a period of time. And the week... Oh, this is my son Don. Bob and Bob.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> I know. At least I know one Bob. How are you? [Introductions]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So during – and I spoke to Don, I spoke to my children about it. But during this period of time, I said, you know, I think I could probably do very well if I did it. But I didn't do it because of contractual obligations, because I was finishing up things. Actually, this is one of the things right now. This started afterward. This started, we're actually a year and a half ahead of schedule and under-budget on this hotel. So what happened, Bob, what happened is ... But during this period, I started really thinking during this period of time. And then Romney was a very, very failed and flawed candidate. He did a very poor job. Because I always felt that was a race that should've been won. I think in many respects that's an easier race than the race you have now. And Romney did a poor job. And we all go back to work. Then about a year before June 16 – that's the day that I announced – I started really thinking about it very, very strongly. But the show continued to do very well. You know, 14 seasons, that's a long time. But it continued to do very well.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Can you isolate a moment when it kicked to yes?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll tell you a moment.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Because that's what Bob and I are looking for.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you a moment when it kicked to yes. Because it was a monetary moment also. So you saw that it made a lot of money because it was certified. Now it's much more, because I also have a big chunk of the show. We chose Arnold Schwarzenegger to take my place. Okay? And hopefully Arnold will do well; who knows? But there was a moment in I would say February of last year, so that would be four months, three, four months before I announced, when Steve Burke, great guy, of Comcast – the head – came to see me with the top people at NBC. And they wanted to extend my contract. And I said, Steve, I think that I am going to run for president. And if I do that, I'm not allowed to have a show. In fact, when I did Saturday Night Live recently, it was a whole big deal: I'm not allowed to be on, and they actually had to give certain periods of time to other candidates that were running. It was a whole big... So. I disagree with the equal time provisions. I think they're very unfair. But nevertheless, you have them. So I said, Steve, I can't have a show if I run. I can't be having a show, so I'm not going to run. He says, no, no, no, you're going to do it. I said, Steve, I'm going to ... And they actually went to the upfronts and they announced that The Apprentice – in fact, you had a problem with it, because you were hearing that I was going to run, and then they announce that they're going to renew The Apprentice with Donald Trump. And I remember he called one of my people, maybe Hope. But he called one of my people and said, wait a minute, he's going to run, but he just announced he's doing The Apprentice. Do you remember that problem?
<Bob Costa> <Positive> Sure. I remember.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't announce it. It was NBC, they so wanted the show to be renewed.
<Bob Costa> <Positive> But what we never understand is, I would just love to know - before that meeting with Burke, I just never heard you talk about it in a vivid way. What was going through your mind with the country? With this moment in your life? That you said to yourself, I'm going to tell Burke I'm going to run for president.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, okay. Sure. Okay. Prior to that, I just felt there were so many things going wrong with the country. In particular, because I'm a very natural person when it comes to business, I assume – I mean, I've done really well, and I do have an instinct for that – and I felt that we were doing some of the worst trade deals ever. And then you look at what's going on in Iran with the beginning of negotiations of that disastrous deal. You know, look, it could've been a much better deal, Bob. They could've walked a couple of times. They could've doubled the sanctions for a couple of days and gotten the prisoners out early. They could've done so many things. To give the $150 billion back was terrible. So it was a terrible deal. It was a terrible negotiation. It was negotiated by people that are poor negotiators against great negotiators. Persians being great negotiators, okay? It's one of those things. You might be Persian. But the Iranians, frankly, are great negotiators. The deal was a disaster. But I would see so many things. And it would make me angry.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> What made you angriest?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say in my case, more than anything else, the stupidity of the trade deals that we have with China, with Japan, with Mexico, with other... Because that's something that I see. And I didn't know that it would hit such a chord, because it's hit a chord with a lot of ...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> So when did you tell somebody in your family or your circle, I've decided to run. Other words, I've pulled the switch.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I would tell my family about it all the time. Don is one of my sons, and doing a really good job. He's involved very much in this job. .... Don and my family, I would talk about it a lot. I would say, I can't believe they're doing it. And another thing would happen. I own a big part of the Bank of America building in San Francisco at 1290 Avenue of the Americas. I got it from China. Meaning Chinese people had it. It was a big thing. It was a [war? ward?], it was actually a [war?].
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Did anyone recommend no? Did your wife, or did your son?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh. Yeah.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Did anyone say, dad, Donald, don't do it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think my wife would much have preferred that I didn't do it. She's a very private person. She was a very, very successful – very, very successful model. She made a tremendous amount of money and had great success and dealt at the...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> What'd she say?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She was, she said, we have such a great life. Why do you want to do this? She was...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> And what'd you say?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said, I sort of have to do it, I think. I really have to do it. Because it's something I'd be – I could do such a great job. I really wanted to give something back. I don't want to act overly generous, but I really wanted to give something back.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Well, that's the important moment, when you say, I have to do it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, I had to.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> That's the product of the endless internal dialogue.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she's a very private person, and very smart person. I'm sure you've seen a couple of interviews that she's done. She's very smart. And there's no games. You know, it's boom, it's all business. But a very smart person. And considered one of the great beauties.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Did she give you the green light?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And she said, why are we doing the... Oh, absolutely. She said, if you want to do it, then you should do it, but... And she actually said something that was very interesting. She's very observant. And she would go around with me. And look, I've been around for a long time at a high level. That's why you were up in my office in, I guess it was '89, I can't believe. So that might help you with your check. Check '89, '88. But I've been around a long time. She said, you know if you run, you'll win. I said, I don't know if I'm going to win. She said, if you run, you'll win. But if you say you're going to run, they're never going to – people are not going to believe it. Because people were let down the first time, I will tell you. They really wanted me to run, and I would've beaten Romney. They really – they wanted me to run that time. So for the most part, the polls didn't include me. And then one poll included me, and I didn't do that well. I was down at like three percent. I said to my wife, I don't think I can run. I'm down at three percent. Boy, that's a long way to go up. And she goes, no, no, no, you're only at three percent because they don't believe you're running. If they thought you were going to run... I said, no, no, the poll said I'm going to run. She said, no, no, they still don't believe it. It doesn't matter what the poll says. The poll can say, you are going to run, Donald Trump is going to absolutely run. It was very interesting. Sort of like - I called her my pollster. She said, no, no, they won't believe that. I don't care if they put it in, if they put it at the top of your building, I'm going to run. They're not going to believe it unless that you go out and announce that you're going to run. And she said, I hope you don't do it, but if you run, you'll win.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> So it was an evolution. Let's turn to ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it was an evolution.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> Let's turn to the presidency. You're nearing the nomination ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then the big thing, by the way, the big thing was standing at the top of that escalator, looking down into that room – which was a sea of reporters, of which he was one, but a sea – that was as big as anything we've had. And getting up and saying, all right. And I remember. I took a deep breath. I said, let's go, to my wife. And you know, we came down. Pretty famous scene, the escalator scene. Boom. And we started, and we talked illegal immigration, and it became a very big subject, and that's where we started.
<Bob Costa> <Positive> As you near the nomination and you look ahead to the possibility of being president of the United States, how do you conceptualize presidential power? And how do you see the job of president? This is something that's nearing, right now, for you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. So first of all, I have to get there. Because I view it as a highly competitive process. I've been, it's very interesting, I've done very well up until now. I've taken out a lot of people. We had 17 people.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> Let's say you're the president, though. How do you see the office of the presidency?
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Other words, what's the definition of the job?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. I think more than anything else, it's the security of our nation. That's always going to be – that's number one, two and three. After that, many things come into focus. It's health, it's healthcare. It's jobs. It's the economy. But number one – and I say number one, two, three – is the security of the country. The military, being strong, not letting bad things happen to our country from the outside. And I certainly think that that's always going to be my number one part of that definition.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Any... Before coming over, Bob and I have had lots of chats. And we were thinking about this, that you are running for the nomination in the Republican Party.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Which is the party of Lincoln and the party of Nixon. .... And so we have this party that you are running to be the nominee in, and it's got two heritages. Lincoln and Nixon.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true. That's true.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> And why did Lincoln succeed? Thought about that at all?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think Lincoln succeeded for numerous reasons. He was a man who was of great intelligence, which most presidents would be. But he was a man of great intelligence, but he was also a man that did something that was a very vital thing to do at that time. Ten years before or 20 years before, what he was doing would never have even been thought possible. So he did something that was a very important thing to do, and especially at that time. And Nixon failed, I think to a certain extent, because of his personality. You know? It was just that personality. Very severe, very exclusive. In other words, people couldn't come in. And people didn't like him. I mean, people didn't like him.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> And he broke the law.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And he broke the law, yeah. Yeah. He broke the law. Whether that's insecurity...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> I mean, you listen to those tapes, and he's a criminal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Whether that's – right. And he broke the law.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> And time and time again, break in, get the FBI on this, get the IRS on.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure. Sure.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> I mean, it is an appalling legacy of criminality.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> And at the end, the day he resigned, an amazing day, he gives that speech which is kind of free association about mom and dad.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> He's sweating. And then he said, "Always remember: others may hate you, but those who hate you don't win unless you hate them, and then you destroy yourself." The piston was hate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, and he was actually talking very much about himself, because ultimately, ultimately, that is what destroyed him. Hate is what destroyed him. And such an interesting figure. I mean, you would know that better than anybody. But such an interesting figure. And such a man of great talent. I mean, Nixon had great potential, great talent. Unfortunately it was a very sad legacy in the end. It turned out to be a very sad legacy. Such an interesting figure to study. I think...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Do you take any lessons from that? Because what did is he converted the presidency to an instrument of personal revenge.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> You're my enemy, I'm going to get you. I'm going to get soand- so on you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. No, I don't. I don't see that. What I do see is – what I am amazed at is, I'm somebody that gets along with people. And sometimes I'll notice, I'll be, I have the biggest crowds. Actually we've purposefully kept the crowds down this past week. You know, we've gone into small venues and we're turning away thousands and thousands of people, which I hate, but we didn't want to have the protest. You know, when you have a room of 2,000 people, you can pretty much keep it without the protesters. When you have 21 or 25,000 people coming in, people can start standing up and screaming. What has been amazing to me – I'm a very inclusive person. I actually am somebody that gets along with people. And yet from a political standpoint, although I certainly have a lot of fans – you just said hello to Senator Sessions. Cruz and everybody wanted Senator Sessions as much as they've wanted anybody, and he's a highly respected guy, great guy. And we have some – and he endorsed me. We have some amazing endorsements, some amazing people, but I'm amazed at the level of animosity toward me by some people. I'm amazed.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> But you're going to have to overcome that, Mr. Trump, if you're going to be the nominee and the president.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think you may be right. I think you may be right.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> I think this is such a pivot moment for you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> You're nearing the nomination. The presidency is possible. How do you – you say you get along with all these people. How do you...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I say in my life I've gotten along with people.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> Understood.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This is the first time where I've had this.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> How do you expand your reach right now? How are you going to do this at this moment in the country, where there's all this anger that you're talking about? You think there's a lot of animus toward yourself. How do you expand your reach, your appeal, right now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, let me tell you the biggest problem that I have. And I talk about it a lot. I get a very unfair press. I'm somebody that's a person that understands when I say – when I say, I say what I say. But I really do get a very, very unfair press. And a lot of times I'll be making a speech, as an example, in front of a – in Orlando, where you have 20, 25,000 people show up in the sun at 3:00 in the afternoon in an open venue. And I will be saying things, and Bob, it won't be reported what I say. It will be reported so differently.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> So how do you - so regardless of your view of the press, how do you navigate the...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, the problem with my view of the ...
<Bob Costa> <Negative> The candidate has to get beyond all these different obstacles.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, you're right, but if the press would report what I say, I think I would go a long way to doing that. Now, there is a natural bias against me because I'm a businessperson, I'm not in the club. Okay? You understand that. I'm not in the club. I'm not a senator, I'm not a politician. I'm not somebody that's been in Congress for 25 years, and I know everybody, I'm somebody – I'm very much an outsider. I am also somebody that's self-funding my campaign, other than small contributions.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> But the press likes outsiders. I mean...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the press doesn't like me. For the most part.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> And would you blame the problem on the press, on the media coverage?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I but I think... I do say this: my media coverage is not honest. It really isn't. And I'm not saying that as a person with some kind of a complex. I'm just saying, I will be saying words that are written totally differently from what I've said. And I see it all – in all fairness, the editorial board of The Washington Post. I was killed on that. I left the room, I thought it was [fine?].
<Bob Costa> <Positive> But what are some concrete steps you could take right now to project a bigger presence, a more unifying presence? Regardless of your view of the press, which is noted. How do you take steps now to really become a nominee?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think – it's a great question, and it's a question I've thought about a lot. I mean, I think the first thing I have to do is win. Winning solves a lot of problems. And I have two people left. We started off with 17 people. I have two people left. And one of the problems I have is that when I hit people, I hit them harder maybe than is necessary. And it's almost impossible to reel them back. .... So [a famous athlete] calls me up about a month ago, right after I beat Rubio. And I beat him by 20 points. That was a big beating. Don't forget, he was the face of the Republican party. He was the future of the Republican party. So [he] called me up. And he said, "Hey Donald, could you do us all a favor? We love you. Don't kill everybody. Because you may need them on the way back." You know, you may need them when you go to phase 3, or whatever phase you're looking...
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Because here's what – what Bob Costa and I were talking about, and we appreciate this moment to really get into these things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just thought it was a great... You know, especially...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> No, no, exactly. Having done this, reporting, so many years – too many decades – that I've thought about, what's politics? All politics, all successful politics, is about coalition building.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's true.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Do you agree?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. I agree. I agree.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> And if you look...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I think you have to break the egg initially. In other words, I agree with you, but when you're coming from where I'm coming from – I came from the outside. By the way, I was establishment. I was an establishment guy until I said I'm running. And then when I said I don't want anyone's money, that drove everyone ... I mean, outside of the small contributions, you know, the stuff... But – because – and even – the reason for the small – we get lots of little contributions. What does it amount to? Six, seven million dollars? And we sell paraphernalia, we sell the Trump shirt and the Trump hat, little stuff. But it still amounted to like six million dollars, seven. But I'm in for about $35 million. But I don't want any money. Bob, I have turned down – I would have made – Bush had $148 million. I would've had five times that much if I wanted to take it.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> But you said it: sometimes you have to break an egg.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sometimes you have to break an egg.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> And haven't you broken enough eggs?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, if that's the question, I think I have two more left.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> And... Okay, but at this point of – as you – Bob Costa, from his perspective of knowing the Republican Party....and the question is, how do you coalition-build, how do you un-break those eggs?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So that's the question.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> I was struck by your comment about Senator Cruz. It seems like you're not working as much as I would've thought to bring the party together.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm looking to win first. I really believe that once ... My life has been about victories. I've won a lot. I win a lot. I win – when I do something, I win. And even in sports, I always won. I was always a good athlete. And I always won. In golf, I've won many club championships. Many, many club championships. And I have people that can play golf great, but they can't win under pressure. So I've always won.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> But Bob's question is right at the heart of this. Because you said about Senator Cruz, I don't want his support.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, is that what you're referring to?
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Yeah. And he is, whatever you may think of him, and whatever battles you've had, he represents the Reagan conservative...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think he represents Reagan.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> Some people think he does.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> That's how he's selling himself.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. Well, maybe now how he's selling himself.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> That's perceived. And if you're going to be the nominee, you need the conservatives in the party.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Well, but I also need the outside people, and I'm definitely now the outsider. Cruz is interesting. We got along very well.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Initially?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would make provocative statements, and he would say, I agree with Mr. Trump. I mean, he was above all. But I kept saying, I wonder when he will attack. Because ultimately, assuming... Because I've been at the center of the dais from day one. And even the other day, NBC came out with a poll, I'm at 48 to twenty-something. You know, that's a national poll. So what happened is he was, could not have been more supportive. And in fact, he made a speech, he was making a big speech in Washington, and he didn't have that many people going. And he called me and he said, would it be possible for you to come? I made it outside of the capital, right in front of the capital, and I came and a tremendous number of people came and it was very successful. We shook hands and I left and that was that. But I got along with Cruz, Cruz, great. But I always said, Bob, and you were there, I said, at some point, this is going to end. Because people would say, you're the only two.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> Right. And at some point the nomination battle ends.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. And at some point the nomination.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> Maybe I'm mishearing you, but I feel like you're almost comfortable being the Lone Ranger.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am. Because I understand life. And I understand how life works. I'm the Lone Ranger. And I said the other day – I watched Cruz as he tried to be as politically correct as he could be. And they say, well, will you support? And I watched him during the debate, and he said yes, and Rubio said yes, and everybody said yes. Because that was the thing to do. We have to support the party. But I watched him struggling the other day, struggling so hard, to not use the word "no" when asked about will he support Donald Trump. At the same time, not wanting to – wishing the question wasn't asked. Because he didn't want to do anything that would be offensive to the party, let's say, and to standard politics.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Can I just say for...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But Bob, what I told him...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Yes sir.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What I said is that, I watched that, and I said, look, he doesn't have to support me. It really doesn't matter. I don't want to make his life difficult.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> But can you be president and be Lone Ranger?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Um...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> I mean, as we were talking about Lincoln – if we may.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Lincoln's second inaugural, he's won the war, he has broken more eggs than any president ever.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He broke a lot of eggs.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> And he comes out and in his second inaugural he said, "Malice toward none, charity for all, bind up the nation's wounds."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Other words, he's saying, let's go back and coalition-build between the North and the South. Isn't that a moment you're going to have to face?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Totally, totally.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Or is that not right now, this moment?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think it's now.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> You don't?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because I think I have to win before I can do that. Look, I've had...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Might that not assist in the winning?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because you have two people that want to win also, and they're not going to be changing their ways.
<Bob Costa> <Positive> What does it look like, though, when you pivot to the general election? Let's say you win the nomination. How does that coalition-building, that unity message – what does that look like? How is Trump the unifier different than Trump the primary battler?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay. As you know, certain polls have me beating Hillary Clinton, but I haven't focused on Hillary Clinton yet. Okay? And I say that all the time. I have not focused on her. I've only focused on the people that are ahead of me, and right now I have two people. I don't have to think about whether it's going to be Hillary or somebody else. I'd love your view on what's going to happen with Hillary from the other standpoint, okay? Because that's really going to be a very interesting question. And it seems to be heating up, which is almost a little surprising, because it looked to me like she's being protected. But my family said to me – and Don has said this, and Ivanka, and my wife has said this – be more presidential. Because I can be very presidential. I jokingly say, I can be more presidential than any president that this country has ever had except for Abraham Lincoln, because he was [so good? sort of?]. Right? You can't out-top Abraham Lincoln.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Isn't that what people want to see now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah. Yeah, but they said... Yes.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> In the Republican party, I mean....there is a lot of angst and rage and distress.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A lot. Record-setting.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Record-setting.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I bring...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> And you have to tame that rage, don't you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, yes, but I bring that out in people. I do. I'm not saying that's an asset or a liability, but I do bring that out.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> You bring what out?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I bring rage out. I do bring rage out. I always have. I think it was ... I don't know if that's an asset or a liability, but whatever it is, I do. I also bring great unity out, ultimately. I've had many occasions like this, where people have hated me more than any human being they've ever met. And after it's all over, they end up being my friends. And I see that happening here. But when my wife and Ivanka and the rest of my family, for the most part – Tiffany, my daughter, she's a very smart young woman, she's up at University of Pennsylvania doing great – and she said to me the same thing.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Be presidential?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Be presidential. Now...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> When did they start saying this to you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they really started saying it before the last debate. The last debate. And if you noticed, my attitude was much different in the last debate, okay? But I said, wait a minute. According to every single – you know, Drudge, and all of the polls, they do these online – they have polls for everything. They do debate polls. And you know what I'm talking about.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hundreds of thousands of people vote. I won every single debate. Every single debate. And I was rough and I was nasty. And I was treated nastily by the other side too. And then Rubio went, you know, Rubio went Don Rickles on me, and all of a sudden he became cute and he started getting extremely nasty. And I had to get even nastier to him. Now, what happened – and then started with the Little Marco. Come on, Little Marco. Little Marco over here said this and that. And he didn't want to – he didn't stop that, he didn't stop that because he was told, oh, he should stop. He stopped that because I was outdoing him. But here's the thing.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> We understand the history of this. We followed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right, but here's the thing.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> So is it...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Wait.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay, so my family comes up. Don. My daughter Tiffany, who's a great kid. Ivanka. My wife. And we were together. They said, be presidential, dad, be presidential. Last debate. I said, wait a minute. If I get hit, I'm going to hit back. That's not going to look very presidential, because I hit back and you hit back. I said, I'm going to give it a shot. And I was actually – you know, the last debate was actually a much different debate...
<Bob Costa> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...in terms of my tone. And I actually got my highest ratings on that debate.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> But I'm just struck by – we're asking the questions about "being presidential." So many other people have asked, can Trump pivot, can he shift to a different kind of tone? And correct me if I'm wrong, but my view, listening to you, is you actually don't really have that much interest in changing too much.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Not yet. Not yet.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> But it seems your natural inclination is to fight...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> No?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> My – yes, always to fight. My natural inclination is to win. And after I win, I will be so presidential that you won't even recognize me. You'll be falling asleep, you'll be so bored.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Really. But when Ted Cruz said what he said, and then you said, I don't need his support.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't need his support. I don't believe I need [it? his support?].
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Now what would your family say to you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, what I said is, I don't need his...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> What would a president say? What would Reagan say? What would Lincoln say if the opposition came and said whatever they said, and then you said...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well Bob...
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> ...hey look, we are going to bind up ...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> ...not the nation's wounds at this point, the party's...
<Bob Costa> <Positive> You think maybe you do need Cruz's support? Maybe you do need it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think – I have the people's support. I have a tremendous group. And by the way, let me just, before we get off that one – because you were saying about Cruz – it wasn't like he embraced me.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> No, he didn't.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It wasn't like he said, oh, I will endorse Donald Trump. He is so wonderful, and if I don't make it he is somebody that I think would be fantastic. Well, he didn't exactly say that, Bob. He said... He was pained having to answer the question.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it wasn't like I'm saying, I don't want his support, as he says great things about me. So I had no guilt whatsoever saying it. I do believe it. I believe – I always [?].
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Do you think you're going to be at a point where you're going to have to call him and say, Ted, I need you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll never have to call him. I may be at a point where I call him, but I never will...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> And what would you say? If you won the nomination, would you call him and say...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would call him to say congratulations on a great job. Because out of 17 people, you beat 16. Okay? Which is pretty good, to put it mildly. You know, we had a lot of talent. When I first ran, and this is where I had some doubts, because what do I know? I didn't know most of these people. Although I'd been very political. I'd given a lot of money. I gave $350,000 last year to the Republican Governors Association. I was a member of the establishment, if you think about it, and very high standing because of...
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Could you say to Ted Cruz, Ted, the coalition-building is going to begin right now. I need your support and help and advice.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think I'd say it that way, but I would be able...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> How would you say it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...to get along with some of the people that I was competing against. Now, I will say this: some of the people that I was competing against, I'm not sure they can ever go back to me. I was very rough on Jeb. I was told when I first started that Jeb was the preemptive favorite. He was going to ...
<Bob Costa> <Negative> Right. But you don't have a strategy for these Never Trump people? You would think if you're the nominee, you would have to find a way to bring Bush into the fold, to bring a Rubio into the fold.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think – look...
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> Do you have a strategy for that at all?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that's overrated, what you're saying, about bringing them into the fold. At the same time, I think I would be successful with many of them. I don't know that I'll be successful with Jeb Bush.
<Bob Costa> <Positive> Right.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> How about Cruz? What would you say to him, Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think I would...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Because this is really – I think this...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, I understand.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> We get pivot points, and we're going from a phase of ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think Cruz and I could get along very well. I actually think so. We got along very well for six months.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Would you say, I need your support?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We got along very well for six months when I was attacking everybody.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Right. But now you're going to have to reach out to him, aren't you, if this is going to work?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we'll have to see what happens. I don't think now, Bob, because he wants to win and I want to win. And I guess Kasich wants to win, although Kasich's only won one out of 28, right? That's not so good.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> Our big picture is more Reagan in 1980 competes against George H. W. Bush in the primary, puts him on the ticket.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, and got along. And truly disliked each other.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> And put him on the ticket.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> Considers him to be part of the team, team of rivals. Could you have a team of rivals in a general election?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would never want to say that now. Right now, I just want to win. And I don't want to say who's going to be – as an example, people are saying, you should pick so-and-so as vice president. It's just too early for that. In my opinion it's too...
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> You have a few names on your mind about VP?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do. I do have names.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> Can you share one or two?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd rather not do it now.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> One or two?
<Corey Lewandowski> <Negative> But Dr. Carson's come to the campaign, and Chris Christie's come to the campaign, and they were rivals in the past. And they said there was one person...
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Corey, that's a good point.
<Corey Lewandowski> <Positive> ...who we believe is going to make the country great again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very good point.
<Corey Lewandowski> <Negative> And look, nobody hit Dr. Carson harder than Mr. Trump did. It was very fair, and he made a very impressive speech in Iowa.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The only thing I did with Dr. Carson – because I respect him a lot – but I just talked about his book. Because he wrote things in his book, and all I did was quote from his book. Because, you know, it was tough stuff what he wrote about himself. He wrote about himself. It's an amazing story. And he...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Without names...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...understands that.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> ...as vice president, what would be the role and responsibilities of your vice president, should you be elected, should you win the nomination?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the number one role is to be a great president if something should happen. Okay? That's always got to be the number one role for a vice president. After that, I would say, frankly, somebody that can help you get elected. And then thirdly, somebody that helps you with the Senate and with the House. So it would be a political person. In other words, I don't need to have another great businessman come in and – I don't need that. What I do...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Somebody who knows dreaded Washington, perhaps.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Somebody that can walk into the Senate and who's been friendly with these guys for 25 years, and people for 25 years. And can get things done. So I would 95 percent see myself picking a political person as opposed to somebody from the outside.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> And would that person be integral to the governing team you would have in the White House? Go to all meetings, have total access?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I would... Sure. Sure. This would be a vice president – I would like to have somebody ... For instance, somebody like Ben Carson. When Ben Carson came to me – not necessarily vice president – but when he came to me, he called, he said, what you're doing is amazing. It's a movement. And you see that. When I announce I'm going to go to Tampa three days before, and we go there three days later, there's 25,000 people in the stadium that houses the professional sports teams...
<Bob Costa> <Negative> No, it says a lot that – you are acknowledging that you don't want to have another outsider as part of your team.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> You need an insider.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Somebody like Ben Carson, he never once said to me, could I have a position?
<Bob Costa> <Negative> He doesn't fit that model.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no, he doesn't. But he will be absolutely somebody that I'd love to have involved with us at a high level, at a very high level. Chris Christie. Chris called, he said, I'd love to be involved. And I said, that's great. I've never been a big one for endorsements. Although Tom Brady loves me in New England; I think that's why I got 50 percent. Okay? Tom Brady loves me. [Laughter] That helped.
<Bob Costa> <Positive> So sticking on this presidency theme for a second, I don't think a lot of people know that much about how much you value discretion, loyalty within your business.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great loyalty, yes. Great discretion, great loyalty.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> But it's different when you're running the federal government.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's...
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> And one thing I always wondered, are you going to make employees of the federal government sign nondisclosure agreements?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think they should. You know, when somebody – and I see it all the time... And I don't know, there could be some kind of a law that you can't do this. But when people are chosen by a man to go into government at high levels and then they leave government and they write a book about a man and say a lot of things that were really guarded and personal, I don't like that. I mean, I'll be honest. And people would say, oh, that's terrible, you're taking away his right to free speech. Well, he's going in... I would say ... I do have nondisclosure deals. That's why you don't read that...
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> With everyone? Corey has one, Hope has one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Corey has one, Hope has one. Did you sign one?
<Hope Hicks> <Neutral> Of course.
<Corey Lewandowski> <Negative> Steven has one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Steven has one.
<Corey Lewandowski> <Negative> [Don? Donny?] has one.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Negative> I don't got one. I'm in the middle of the book. [Laughter]
<Corey Lewandowski> <Negative> [Donny?] has two. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know, I forgot, he's the one I'm most worried about.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Negative> I'm not getting next week's paycheck until I sign one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have a very, very, very prominent businessman who's right now got a person – he's involved in litigation, terrible litigation with somebody that worked for him in a very close level. And I said why are you...
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Do you think these are airtight agreements?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, totally. I think they're very airtight. They're very...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> And that no one could write a book or...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think they're extremely airtight. And anybody that violated it – let's put it this way: it's so airtight that I've never had... You know, I've never had a problem with this sort of thing.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Let us ask this...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By the way, this man called me, he said, how is it that you don't have – as famous as you are? And I sent him a copy of the agreement. He said, this is genius. And he now has people that go to work for him. I don't like people that take your money and then say bad things about you. Okay? You know, they take your...
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> But it's so different when you're in the federal government.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's different, I agree. It's different.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> But you are recommending nondisclosure...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I tell you this, I will have to think about it. I will have to think about it. That's a different thing, that I'm running a private company and I'm paying people lots of money, and then they go out and...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> The taxpayers are paying the other people in the federal government.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure. Sure. They don't do a great job, and then you fire them and they end up writing a book about you. So it's different. But I will say that in the federal government it's a different thing. So it's something I would think about. But you know, I do right now – I have thousands and thousands of employees, many thousands, and every one of them has an agreement, has a ... I call it a confidentiality...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Say you're elected president. Would one four-year term be enough?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would say the following: I have seen people make the statement for Senate and for other positions, government - because I've been a very political person over the years, I've gotten as many zone changes as any human being on earth, probably, including the entire West Side of Manhattan from 77nd Street to 59th Street. A very successful job. I would say that every time I see somebody make that statement and then they're feeling good and doing a great job, and they run, they lose because of that statement. So I would never want to say that four years... I would never want to limit myself to four years. I think I can do a tremendous job in four years. One of your questions, I noticed, is what would be your first 90 days in terms – and we'll talk about that next.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, so I think I can do a terrific job. And I think this: if I'm doing a terrific job, and if I'm feeling well, I would say I would continue to go for the extra four years. Because again, I don't want to put that burden on myself. If I'm doing a good job, I should be allowed. And I only say that because you know, Bob, I've seen so many people say it. Even for local positions. And if they decide to then go, they always lose because they make that statement. So I don't want to say that. But I think I will be able to do a fantastic job in four years.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Real quickly, at the Post editorial board interview, you referred to the $19 trillion in debt, and then you said the U.S. is "probably sitting on a bubble."
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, a bubble.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> What bubble?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think we're sitting on an economic bubble. A financial bubble. I think if you look at the stock market...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> In the stock market you mean?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Or do you mean...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well first of all, we're not at five percent unemployment. We're at a number that's probably into the twenties if you look at the real number. That was a number that was devised, statistically devised to make politicians - and in particular presidents – look good. And I wouldn't be getting the kind of massive crowds that I'm getting if the number was a real number. People are extremely unhappy in this country.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> And so is the bubble – it's not a housing bubble.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, I'm talking about...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Or a real estate building bubble.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm talking about a bubble where you go into a very massive recession. Hopefully not worse than that, but a very massive recession. Look, we have money that's so cheap right now. And if I want to borrow money, I can borrow all the money I want. But I'm rich. If a person that wants to put a lot of people to ... And I don't need the money. I don't have to borrow. I don't even call banks anymore. I use my own money to do things. If I want to borrow money or if another rich person wants to borrow money, you can borrow money at, like, LIBOR plus nothing. And you're paying one and a half percent interest, it's crazy, and they'll give you all you want. If somebody is a great, wonderful person, going to employ lots of people, a really talented businessperson, wants to borrow money but they're not rich? They have no chance.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Bubbles are scary to economists.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, bubbles are scary.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Fed, used to say, there may be a bubble out there but you don't know it's a bubble until it bursts. Is that true?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. That's true. I think that's true. I think you had a lot of signs, because you had all those exploding mortgages. I told...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> And you say there are signs now.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ...people.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> We're "sitting on a bubble."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay, so I made many speeches for different groups on success, where people would pay me a lot of money, I gave it to charity. People would pay me money for speeches on success. So I would do that, before this. And I would tell people, don't invest that, don't go – I was pretty good at prognostication, at telling people what to do in terms of ... Now, I'd talk about success, but I'd say, this is a bad time to invest. I also said, this is a good time to invest.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> What is it now? Is it a good time to invest now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I think it's a terrible time right now.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> You really do?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> Why is that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because the dollar is so strong. Our country is in – you know, it's very interesting. There's a couple of things good about strong dollars, but there's some...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> So your tip, stock tip, is to get out of the market? Or avoid it now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, my stock tip is that the market – I believe we're sitting on a big bubble. So you take a look at what's going on. You have – think of it – you have cheap money that nobody can get unless you're rich. You have the regulators are running the banks. Not the guys that are being paid $50 million a year to run the banks. I mean, when you look at many of your friends that are running banks that are being paid $40 and $50 million, yeah, they're not running the banks. The regulators are running the banks. You have a situation where you have an inflated stock market. It started to deflate, but then it went back up again. Usually that's a bad sign. That's a sign of things to come. And yeah, I think we're sitting on a very, very big bubble.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> So the Wall Street people are going to – when we publish this – are not going to like to hear the possible president say...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I don't care about the ... I know the Wall Street people. I know the Wall Street people probably better than anybody knows them. You know, the Wall Street...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> You don't need them either?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No. You know, I don't need them. No, other candidates need them, by the way. Ted Cruz needs them. Ted Cruz borrowed millions of dollars for his [PACs?].
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> But doesn't this go back to the coalition? I'm sorry.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the way, and didn't disclose on his personal financials that he was borrowing money from Goldman Sachs and Citibank and didn't – and paying almost no interest. He had an interest rate that you would've been proud to have, and he didn't disclose it. Which nobody made a big deal out of. You did a little bit. But no I do, I think we're sitting – it's precarious times. Part of the reason it's precarious is because we are being ripped so badly by other countries. We are being ripped so badly by China. It just never ends. Nobody's ever going to stop it. And the reason they're not going to stop it is one of two. They're either living in a world of the makebelieve, or they're totally controlled by their lobbyists and their special interests. Meaning people that want it to continue. Because what China, what Mexico, what Japan – I don't want to name too many countries, because I actually do business in a lot of these countries – but what these countries are doing to us is unbelievable. They are draining our jobs. They are draining our money. They are taking the money out...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> So you are really pessimistic, to say the least?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm pessimistic. Unless changes are made. Changes could be made.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Could you fix it? Next year, if you became president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I can fix it. I can fix it pretty quickly.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Okay. Tell us that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When I was at your editorial board meeting, I talked about NATO. And I'm not a world expert on NATO. But I have a natural instinct for certain things, okay? Like I said, keep the oil. Well, now ISIS has the oil. I said a lot of things. I said in my book about – written in 2000 – mentioned Bin Laden in a paragraph or two. And that was two years before the World Trade Center came down. And I'm not a politician, I was...
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> So what's your instinct, your plan, for let's say first 100 days, how you turn this all around?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay, well, I say this. Look: we are making, and we have, some of the worst trade deals in the history of trade. We're now making one, Trans-Pacific Partnership. TPP. A disaster, that deal is a disaster.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> You know lots of experts, supposedly, disagree with you on the trade issues and so forth. Feel...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah. Oh, I was against NAFTA.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> And there's a lot of analysis, and a lot of data.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was against NAFTA. NAFTA's been a disaster. I mean, frankly, I'm a big Ronald Reagan fan, but I disagreed with him on trade. I thought his trade policies were terrible.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> So the first 100 days, what would you do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. I would do a number of things. I would, number one, I would start negotiating great trade deals using – I know the best people. You know...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> You think that can turn around in 100 days?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, it can't, no, but I would start the negotiation. No, these are complicated transactions. Part of the problem with the TPP is it's 12 countries. Okay? And you should do individual country deals. It's 7,000 pages long. And each one of those countries has studied this thing, photographic. We have congressmen, they don't even read these agreements.
<Bob Costa> <Positive> But this is a – that would be driven out of the executive branch, that kind of negotiation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. It's a bad deal. It's a bad deal for our country.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> What about legislation? What about economic legislation?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I know, but it's a bad deal for our country. What I would do – and before I talk about legislation, because I think frankly this is more important – number one, it's going to be a very big tax cut. Because the middle class has been... And Larry Kudlow and numerous people have liked very much... You know, I put in a plan for tax cuts, and I've gotten some very good reviews. I would do a tax cut. You have to do a tax cut. Because we're the highest-taxed nation in the world. But I would start – because I noticed your question briefly – boom, what would you do in the first 90 days? I would immediately start renegotiating our trade deals with Mexico, China, Japan and all of these countries that are just absolutely destroying us. And they have been for years. It's an incredible tribute to our country that we can lose billions – hundreds of billions – of dollars consistently, year in and year out – and still even survive. We have rebuilt China. We have rebuilt it. I mean, you look at what's going on in China. We have rebuilt China singlehandedly. Now, they've done okay with Europe too, but...
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> So renegotiate trade deals and have a tax cut. That would be your first 100 days?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Renegotiate trade deals and renegotiate military deals.
<Bob Costa> <Positive> Real quick on trade deals...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And by the way, and renegotiate with NATO. And renegotiate with Japan and with...
<Bob Costa> <Negative> On trade deals, dealing with a company, on your business deals, when you study them, it's dealing with people and corporations.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm negotiating over 100 deals. We're negotiating 114 deals.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> But aren't deals with countries and foreign leaders different than the kind of transactions you do at the corporate level? And how do you make that transition?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> Because you can't say to a country, I'm going to sue you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. Well, you know, it depends on what your definition of "sue" is. We will be able to make great trade deals. It'll be good for the counties, it will be good for us.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> How long will it take? A year? Two years?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It will go... Yeah, I would say within the first year a lot of it will be done.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Sir, in listening to this...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you have to be able to walk. You have to be able to ...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> ...and covering lots of presidents, if I may go back to that experience.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Trying to understand them. Reagan was Morning in America. And it's almost like you're saying, at least for a while, morning in the ditch. That we are just not going to be able to get out because of these trade deals, because of your pessimism about the economy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, we are losing $500 billion a year on trade deficits with China. Okay? We've been for a long time, from 200 to 500. We are losing hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade. You look at Japan. They send their cars in here by the hundreds of thousands. You go to Los Angeles, you look at those docks, and these cars get driven off those boats at 40 miles an hour. You've never seen anything like it. They just come pouring into our country. And yet when - you talk about an imbalance, when it comes to us selling to Japan? They take very little.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Where's the optimism to get out of this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I have great optimism.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> You do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh. Oh, okay. With all of that, I'm an optimistic person. You know, "Make America great again." ....
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Oh yeah. What's the...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Make America great again. That's actually a very optimistic – you know, that's not – some people say, oh, that's so – because they hate the word "again." I said, no, no, you don't understand. We're going to make America great again. People view that as very positive. Do you know, workers... You can have that. [?] question. I dictated this out pretty much.
<Corey Lewandowski> <Negative> [?] we have [something else?] [downtown?] in 15 minutes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know what, we can delay that meeting for 20 minutes. I love this.
<Corey Lewandowski> <Positive> I know, but it's a very important – and it's respectful. I just – we set it up, and...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Could you call them up and say could we delay half an hour?
<Corey Lewandowski> <Negative> I can, but we promised these guys an hour, [they have?] an hour and 15.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Do me a favor?] Call them back, tell them we'll be 45 minutes late, is it okay? Only if it's okay. If he can't do it...
<Corey Lewandowski> <Negative> I don't know. Let me find out.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay. Because I'd like to finish with these guys.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Thank you. We appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So just so you understand, mine is a message of great optimism. We can fix it.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> But not everyone thinks that, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. Not everybody thinks that. Some people don't understand that.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> So here's – Bob had a – Bob was in New Haven, Connecticut the other day, and he met a maid in a hotel who identified herself as Mexican. And one of the things she said was, "He does not like me."
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Meaning you. I asked her about you. What do you think of Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Was she here...
<Bob Costa> <Negative> And she said, "All I want is my dignity."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. I'll give her great dignity. Let me hear the question – you may not know the answer.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> What do you have to say to her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Was she here legally or illegally?
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> I asked her, and she would not say.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That means she was here illegally. Okay. So here...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Possibly. And she says... Trump, I asked her, I said, what do you think of Mr. Trump? And she said, "He doesn't like me." She took it personally. And then she said, "I just want my dignity."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I understand that.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> What would you say to her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you what I'd say to her. Number one, she was probably here illegally. The polls are all showing people – Hispanics – that are here legally like me very much. In Nevada, you saw the poll, I'm leading with the Hispanics. People that vote, people that therefore are here. I'm leading with Hispanics. People that are here illegally maybe feel differently and they do feel differently, but people that are here legally, Hispanics that are here, they don't want their jobs taken. And they know I'll bring jobs back from China. I'll bring jobs back from Japan and from Mexico and from all these countries. You look at what Mexico's doing, Bob. Mexico is the new China, smaller level. Mexico, what they're doing to us on trade and at the border is unbelievable. Okay? And I was right. When I got up and made that initial speech in Trump Tower on June 16, and I talked about illegal immigration and the problems, that hit a nerve. You know? Because...
<Bob Costa> <Negative> It's not all economic. Because some of these people we encounter on the campaign trail, whether it's an undocumented Mexican maid or it's a Muslim, one consequence of your campaign has been they feel isolated in America. And you may disagree with the reason they feel that, but that is how they feel as a consequence of your message. How do you speak to those people who think you don't want them in this country? Including legal Muslims.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am a person that's going to bring this country together. I'm a person that's going to unify the country. President Obama is a divider. He is not a unifier. When he first got elected, I didn't have great feelings for the fact that he was going to do well. But the one thing I thought, he would be able to unify the country. African-American, white, I thought that he would be a unifying factor. He has not been. He's been a great ...
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> But Bob Costa's right, Mr. Trump, that you talk to people and they feel you're not a unifier.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know. They feel that now.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> And you say you are. The question becomes... I mean, this is one maid, but I think there are a countless number of people out there who, in essence maybe they could not put it in this articulate way, they want their dignity, and the question is, how are they going to get it from you if you're president?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well again, so I asked you the very important question, was she here legally or illegally?
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> I don't know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because if she was here legally, I think you would find that she would like me very much. In Nevada, where you have a huge Hispanic population, when they did the exit polls, I won with the people that are Hispanic in the state of Nevada. But not by a little bit, by a lot. I think that's a – it's an important question to ask. I will give people back their dignity because I'm going to bring jobs back. Our jobs are being taken away from us like candy from a baby. Our jobs are being ripped out of our country. Carrier announced – I talked about it the last month, because I thought that was in particular bad. Maybe because I buy a lot of Carrier air conditioners. But...
<Bob Costa> <Positive> People understand the economic argument. But people – I think what she was looking for, and others – is do you have empathy for the immigrant experience? You think back to your grandfather coming over in 1885.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right. Totally. I do. I mean, totally. I mean, ultimately we're all immigrants, okay? I have total empathy. At the same time, we need borders, otherwise we don't have a country, and we have to be – you have to come into the country legally. And that's been a big theme of my campaign, and for the most part, I think it's [hit? a hit?].
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> But this maid doesn't have a lawyer, I suspect. And she came to the country, we don't know. And she didn't do anything that put her in the position she may be in, you're right. And what she's saying is – and I was floored by what she said, quite frankly. "I just want my dignity."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Well.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> And a giant question, pulsing out there, is how do people get their dignity that you seem to be quite critical of? Illegal immigrants...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No. I'm ...
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Well, you are critical.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, illegal immigrants, yeah. Just so you understand, I want people to come into this country. I want to make it much easier to come into the country. But they have to come in through a legal process. Were you able to do that, Corey? Huh?
<Corey Lewandowski> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have a meeting with – sort of an important meeting.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Yeah, the foreign policy people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well actually we already met with them. We just...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Oh you did? How'd that go?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It went great. [Lewandowski speaks inaudibly]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd love to keep it going. I actually enjoy this. I'll probably end up ruing the day. I'll say, how could they have said that stuff about me? But I do really enjoy this, both of you guys.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> I understand that. And you know, these are such serious questions, and you are answering them with – you're being straight about it. I appreciate that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Here's what – I think I'll do really great. With the African-Americans. And a lot of people think that. And you know that a lot of people think that. But I think I'm going to do great with the African-Americans. I think I'm going to do great with Hispanics. I'm going to bring jobs back to the country. I'm not going to let people take our jobs. I'm not going to let people go – I'm not going to let factories and Nabisco and all of these companies – Ford – we're going to build here. We're going to keep the jobs in our country. And we're going to bring jobs back to our country, Bob. And that's going to ...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Understand. Let me ask, this is a really...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Jobs is a very big answer, because that's going to give...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Of course. Although this maid has a job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right. But dignity. And maybe she'll have a better job. She'll have more options.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Okay. What would be the most challenging situation that, say you're president, or the next president, might face? And this is a serious issue. I asked President Obama this a number of years ago. And he said, what I worry about most – sitting in the Oval Office, and I think he really meant this – I worry the most about a nuclear weapon going off in an American city.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> That is the game-changer.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's funny, it's very interesting. I'm surprised he said that, because I heard him recently say that the biggest problem we have is global warming, which I totally disagree with. Okay?
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> But he told me...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Sat there. And I thought, you can read between – do you agree with that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's very interesting. I have... I absolutely agree. I think the single greatest problem that the world has – we have an ISIS problem, and we have – but the single greatest problem that this world has is a nuclear, the power of nuclear. The tremendous power. You look at Hiroshima and multiply it times a thousand.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> And he's, President Obama's having this summit now, right here in Washington, down the street. And he is a strong advocate for eliminating nuclear weapons entirely.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Would you agree with that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, if it's done in an equal basis, absolutely.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> You would.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the problem you have now... Done on an equal basis. The problem you have now is you have Pakistan. And you just see what happened in Pakistan. It's not like, you know, that's a perfect situation. You have India. You have so many countries now with nuclear already. You have some very bad people trying very hard to get nuclear. So I think that's something that in an ideal world is wonderful, but I think it's not going to happen very easily.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Would you pick up the baton on that effort on his part?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would love to see a nuclear-free world. Will that happen? Chances are extremely small that will happen. Look, Russia right now is spending a tremendous amount of money on redoing their entire nuclear arsenal.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> When you look at foreign policy...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, I love that. But from a practical standpoint, not going to happen.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> Did you read Jeffrey Goldberg's article about Obama's foreign policy? Regardless, in The Atlantic, Obama gave...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> On The Atlantic, okay.
<Bob Costa> <Positive> So one of the quotes Obama said in there is, "The notion that Russia is somehow in a stronger position now in Syria and Ukraine than they were before they invaded Ukraine or before he had to deploy military forces in Syria is to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of power in foreign affairs. Real power means you can get what you want without having to exert violence." That's Obama on global power. Do you agree?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think there's a certain truth to that. I think there's a certain truth to that. Real power is through respect. Real power is, I don't even want to use the word, fear. But you know, our military is very sadly depleted. You look at what's going on with respect to our military and it's depleted from all of the cuts. Hey, as a real estate person, all the time I'm getting listings of bases, Army bases, Marine bases, naval bases. I keep saying, how many bases do they have? I'm constantly getting, it's crossing my desk, do we want to buy a base in Virginia? Do we want to buy... And I see it all the time. We have to strengthen our military. It's so vital to do that. We have to strengthen our military. By the way, we have to take care of our vets. So vital. But we have to strengthen our military. Now, one of the things that the Washington Post treated me very badly on, when I talked to you about NATO, we're spending too much money, and we're not getting treated with respect from the 28 countries that we're dealing with.
<Bob Costa> <Positive> This comes back to the Lone Ranger point. I think even globally, you're comfortable being the United States president...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> Not being [so entrenched?]...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't say I'd get out of NATO. I say it's got to be ... First of all, it's obsolete. Our big threat today is terrorism. Okay? And NATO's not really set up for terrorism. NATO is set up for the Soviet Union more than anything else. And now you don't have the Soviet Union.
<Bob Costa> <Positive> Well, you don't have a great belief in these international institutions.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because we seem to get ripped off by everybody. We seem to always be the one that pays the bill and gets the least. And we're going to stop doing that.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> But you're talking about reform of NATO, aren't you, rather than ...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, I'm talking about reform.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> You're not just saying, let's move out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm talking totally about reform. But you have to be – in order to get reform, you have to be prepared to walk. Otherwise you can't get reform. For instance, the Iran deal. Had John Kerry stood up from his chair when they kept saying no, no, no, no – he didn't get anything. Had he stood up twice – once or twice – from his chair and said, sorry gentlemen, we're leaving, and increased the sanctions, you would've had a whole different Iran deal.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Okay. One really important question.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> A couple of years ago, I had a breakfast with one of the leaders, heads of state, of our best allies. And I asked him about Obama. And he was talking off the record, and he said, "I like him. He is smart. But no one in the world is afraid of him." Do you agree with that? And in a Trump administration – are you formulating a new doctrine of you better be afraid of me?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, I don't want people to be afraid. I want them to respect our country. Right now, they don't respect our country.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> But do they respect you if you kind of ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People have respected me. My life has been a life where I've been respected. I want them to respect our country. I want them to respect our leader. But I want them to respect our country. Now, you could use...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> How do you achieve that, sir?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Through the aura of personality. Through having the goods. You know, so Muhammad Ali is a friend of mine. He's a good guy. I've watched many people over the years. Muhammad Ali would get in the ring and he'd talk and talk and scream and talk about the ugly bear, and this, that – you know. And then he'd win. And respect is about winning. We don't win anymore. I see it in my – we don't win anymore. And he'd win. I've seen many fighters that were better than Muhammad Ali, in terms of talking. I've seen guys that were so beautiful, so flamboyant, they'd get into the ring – and then they'd get knocked out. And guess what? It's all gone. Let me just say: we don't win anymore.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> So do you want Putin to be afraid of you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I want Putin to respect our country, okay?
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> And what would he respect?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all, it's sort of interesting. He said very good things about me.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Understand.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You saw that. He said, Trump is brilliant and Trump is going to be the new leader and all that. And some of these clowns said, you should repudiate Putin. I said, why would I repudiate him? He's not going to get anything. Because I've been through this stuff before. But he said very positive things about me. And I say to myself – and I say to people – wouldn't it be nice if we actually could get along with Russia? And if we could get along with these people? China takes advantage of us. Look at what they're doing in the South China Sea. They're not supposed to be playing that game. Okay? Look at what they're doing. That is a lack of respect. When they're building a massive, like nobody's ever seen before – they're building islands in the middle of the South China Sea for a massive military complex. Beyond runways. I mean, this is a complex. So what I'm saying is there's a tremendous lack of respect for our country. And I think for our leader.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> But what does Putin respect? The former KGB lieutenant colonel? Force. Power.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think he respects strength. Okay? I think Putin respects strength. And I've said it before, I think I will get along well with Putin. Now you never know. I don't say that – only a fool would say, "I will," but I feel that I will get along well with Putin. I feel that if we can get along with more countries, that's a positive thing. That's not a bad thing. Some people – for instance, when Putin came out and he wanted to bomb the hell out of ISIS, we had people standing on the stage, we don't want that, we want... Let me tell you something. If we have somebody else dropping bombs that cost a half a million dollars a piece on the top – if we have somebody helping us, that's not so bad. You understand that. That's not so bad. But I had people that I'm running against saying, like, that was a terrible thing. It's not a terrible thing. We have a situation in Libya where a friend of mine is just saying, so, we had Gaddafi, he killed the terrorists, he ran his place. Not a good man. Same thing you could say with Iraq, with Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein was a plus-10 at killing terrorists, that's one thing. If our presidents would have gone away and gone to the beach, the Middle East would be a far better place than it is right now. I don't say it would be run by nice people, but you know, it would be a far better place. The mistakes we've made in the Middle East are so astronomical. Now here's the thing: ISIS is now ... A friend of mine who's very much involved in the energy business, ISIS is controlling the oil now in Libya. How did we let that happen?
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> So just turning back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And by the way, that oil? That is a great oil, and it's a lot of oil. And they're controlling it.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> We were looking over your 1990 book, Surviving at the Top.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> And thinking about, what would happen if Trump's president of the United States? And you – this is a line from your book, then: "The same assets that excite me in the chase often, once they are acquired, leave me bored. For me, you see, the important thing is the getting, not the having." If you get the presidency, you are going to have it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, but see, that's not the getting. The getting, for me, is to make our country great again. The getting – that's just a part of it. The getting the position is not the real getting. For me, the getting is – and that's when I'll say, congratulations everyone, my job is finished. We will make our country financially strong again. When you have 19... I had a woman come up to me. A wonderful woman. I said this one or two times in the speech. She said, Mr. Trump, I love you. You're so incredible. I'm voting for you 100 percent, but could you stop saying you're going to make our country rich again? I said, I understand what you're saying – it doesn't sound nice. But without being rich again, we can't be great again. I am going to make our country rich again. We are, the thing I didn't like about the Washington Post, they didn't put down my real statements as to Japan and everything else. They make it sound like I want Japan to have nuclear weapons. I don't. And by the way, other people have said this too. I don't mind taking care of Japan. But they have to help us out more, monetarily. We can't protect the entire world. You look at our military budget, it's massive compared to any other country. But what are we doing? We're taking care of the military needs of all these countries. And these countries are much richer than us. We're not a rich country. We're a debtor nation. We've got to get rid of – I talked about bubble. We've got to get rid of the $19 trillion in debt.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> How long would that take?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think I could do it fairly quickly, because of the fact the numbers...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> What's fairly quickly?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I would say over a period of eight years. And I'll tell you why.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Would you ever be open to tax increases as part of that, to solve the problem?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think I'll need to. The power is trade. Our deals are so bad.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> That would be $2 trillion a year.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but I'm renegotiating all of our deals, Bob. The big trade deals that we're doing so badly on. With China, $505 billion this year in trade. We're losing with everybody. And a lot of those deals – a lot of people say, how could the politicians be so stupid? It's not that they're stupid. It's that they're controlled by lobbyists and special interests who want those deals to be made.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> So we want to go back and tell our readers about this interview, and we'll run the transcript of it, I'm sure. When does the coalition building begin?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You're talking now again?
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> For Trump.
<Corey Lewandowski> <Negative> [?], do you want me to cancel the other meeting? Because he has a hard out, and we're already late.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let me give you this final answer, and then if you want we can meet again.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Yes. Okay, that's great. Is that...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ....Phase two. We'll call it – at least treat me fairly in phase one, but phase two.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Of course.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The coalition building begins – I believe – when it's decided who wins. Hopefully I'm going to win. The coalition building for me will be when I win. Vince Lombardi, I saw this. He was not a big man. And I was sitting in a place with some very, very tough football players. Big, strong football players. He came in – these are tough cookies – he came in, years ago – and I'll never forget it, I was a young man. He came in, screaming, into this place. And screaming at one of these guys who was three times bigger than him, literally. And very physical, grabbing him by the shirt. Now, this guy could've whisked him away and thrown him out the window in two seconds. This guy – the player – was shaking. A friend of mine. There were four players, and Vince Lombardi walked in. He was angry. And he grabbed – I was a young guy – he grabbed him by the shirt, screaming at him, and the guy was literally... And I said, wow. And I realized the only way Vince Lombardi got away with that was because he won. This was after he had won so much, okay? And when you have these coaches that are just as tough as him but they don't win, there's revolutions. Okay? Nobody... But Vince Lombardi was able to win, and he got – I have never seen anything like it. It was such a vivid impression. You had this big powerful guy, and you had Vince Lombardi, and he grabbed him by the shirt and he was screaming at him, he was angry at him.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> But to do that – a colleague of ours...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, to do that you have to win.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Yes. But David Maraniss, a colleague of ours, wrote the book on Vince Lombardi.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> When Pride Still Mattered. Right? What Vince Lombardi did, he got to the point of winning by building a coalition of 11 players on the field. He couldn't have a guard and a tackle who were not part of the team.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay, let me answer this way, because I think it will be a very positive ending. Because I agree with you. Ultimately, I will build a coalition. I think it's too soon. I really do. I think it's too soon. Now, I may be wrong. But this isn't something I needed to do. This is something I want to do. I want to give back, and I'll do a fantastic job. And I know politicians. I know them all. They're only talented at one thing: getting elected. Now, you have some that have certain assets, but they're talented at one thing: getting elected. Raising funds, and getting elected. Okay? And when I first ran, Charles Krauthammer said, and this was before I had run, and he was sitting there – I told you this story. He was sitting on Fox. And he said, this is one of the most talented fields of senators and governors and people running for office in the history of our country, and certainly since World War II. Now this is about two months before I'm announcing. And I'm saying to myself, wow. That's tough. You know, here's a guy must know. It's tough. They also said I wouldn't run and I ran. But I said, wow, that's a big statement. I said, all right, but I'm doing it. Then I decide – top of the escalator – I said to my wife, come on, let's go. Deep breath, went down, did it. Okay. Now I've defeated those people, most of them. I've defeated them. And I say, really? Meaning to his statement. Really? Not a lot of talent.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> So we have on the media, which you are quite critical...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Media treats me very unfairly, and very inaccurately.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Okay, and the question is, why? And if I may, Richard Nixon, something he said that I think Bob and I agree with. He said about the media, what it does, the media looks in the mirror instead of looking out the window - and gather facts and listen to other people – they're more interested in themselves. Is that part of the problem?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think they're more interested in hits. I did a thing the other day with – on CNN – with Anderson Cooper. I don't know if you saw the rating. Give him the ratings, if you have it. Do you have the ratings?
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> We saw it.
<Hope Hicks> <Neutral> You have them, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They were through – I just got this. They were through the roof. Here. Mine was through the roof, meaning my hour was through the roof. Now, that's good and bad. The bad is they want to cover me too much, and they write things that maybe they shouldn't be writing. But those were phenomenal. Won the evening, beat everybody, etc., etc. My segment, not the other segments. The other segments did all right, but my segment was one of the highest-rated shows in a long time and beat everybody on cable – beat everybody on television that night. So you'll take a look. That's good and it's bad. The bad is they want to do nothing but cover me. They write stories that are – that don't even make sense. I'm just saying, I wish I could be covered accurately and fairly by the media.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> By why, then? Is this ideology, is this partisanship, is it laziness? What is it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it could be some laziness. Today they want the clicks. In the old days they wanted the ratings, or they wanted to sell newspapers. Today they see if somebody clicks. So they do a story on me and they get clicks all over the place. They do a story on somebody else, it doesn't matter. All I can say is this. I wish I could be treated fairly by the media. And if I was treated fairly by the media, I think you would see a very big difference in coalition and coalition building and a lot of things. But with that being said, I'm not ready to do coalition building. But when I do – I tell that Vince Lombardi story- if and when I win, it will be really easy to build up a coalition. One other thing. I told you this. We are getting calls from so many people that you speak to, you speak to, that are saying, oh we don't like Trump, we've got to stop Trump. They're calling me. They're talking to you and they're calling me. Because they think I'm going to win.
<Bob Costa> <Positive> Well the next step is getting them off the phone and out into the public.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, but we're already – look, we already have... Chris came in, and Carson came in. We already have a lot of people. We are getting calls from people that you're writing about, or other people are writing about, and I'm telling you, names that you wouldn't believe. Bob, you – the greatest skeptic probably of all time – even more than you. That's only because he's older than you. He's seen more. People that you wouldn't even think about would be calling are calling. They want to make a deal. They want to come on board.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> But you know what they tell us? We call the same people. Or I've been calling the same people. You know what they say about Trump? So much promise, political talent, yet he seems to have a blind spot. When he's ahead, he seems to pull back. That's maybe not the view you have, I understand – but that is how a lot of Washington[ian?] people see it. They think you get so close to the nomination, and then things happen...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can only say this: my whole life has been about winning. My whole life. I've won a lot. And one little example? This building. This was one of the most sought-after buildings in the history of the General Services Administration. Owned by them for many years. The landlord to the United States, right? Every major company – almost everybody – I don't have to – obviously, look, the best location in Washington. Right between the Capitol and the White House.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Great building.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The best location, best building. The walls are four foot thick of solid granite. Amazing how they were able to lift it up. I mean, frankly, amazing. This is before they had cranes as we know them today. Unbelievable place. And it will be one of the great hotels in the world. Everybody wanted it. Every hotel company. Everybody. Pritzker wanted it. Who's closer to Obama than Pritzker? Hyatt wanted it. They had the Jewish Museum all lined up. They had everything all lined up. .... They own Hyatt. Hyatt didn't get it. The reason I got it was because I have an unbelievable balance sheet - because they wanted to make sure it got done – and because of the fact that I had a great concept.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> But let's...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But think of it: I got it in the Obama administration.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Understand.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And people say to me, Bob, how the hell did you get the most sought –after real estate asset perhaps in the history of the GSA – and you understand what I mean by that.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Of course.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, they have land in the middle of nowhere, nobody cares about it. They say, how did you get the most sought-after asset perhaps in the history of the GSA?
<Bob Costa> <Negative> And your political allies say the same exact thing. They appreciate that part of your profile and your skill. They talk about it all the time. All we're saying is, they also – they're concerned that you're hurting yourself along the way as you get close to the nomination.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well don't forget, they've been concerned about that 10 times during the course of this last...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Yeah, but here's what's going on, we think. And it has to do with psychology. And one of the things you learn, being a reporter, being a builder with your background, is that everyone is concerned about themselves. And what Bob Costa is saying, these people feel disrespected. They feel that they've not been given their dignity.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They will be loved. At the right time, they will be loved.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> And they want in.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, I know.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> And what, to use your term, you've built a wall to a certain extent. You've said, I am the Lone Ranger. I am doing this on my own.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, at the right time I want them in.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Okay, but...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I just think it's early.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Okay, but suppose you needed to do that sooner.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'd be capable of doing it. I just think it's ...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Will you call us the day it starts?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I will.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Because that's...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And some of the people that are calling me – and maybe I should be calling them – but some of the people that are calling me and calling him, in all fairness, and calling others, too. One called you. But some of these people that are wellknown, and people you've – that would be very interesting to you. These people want in. And I'm taking them in. They're going to come in.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Maybe you have to reach out, then.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Because to a certain extent, I should be calling them, they shouldn't have to be calling me.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Yes, exactly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're right.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Because it's coalition building.
<Bob Costa> <Positive> Right, that's the key thing. You're always talking about people calling you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I'm going to be doing that very soon.
<Corey Lewandowski> <Positive> I do think it's fair to say that we have not publicized a lot of our D.C. outreach for specific reasons, and I don't think the media is aware of that.
<Hope Hicks> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Corey Lewandowski> <Neutral> Including the foreign policy meetings that you have done, including the private meetings we've done.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we had a good meeting this morning for foreign policy, you know, and we've had some pretty good meetings.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> We're not questioning the organizational [?]. We're just saying...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, at the right time. You know, it's an interesting statement that Bob...
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> You love talking, though, about how people call you, but we often don't hear about Trump calling ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No?
<Bob Costa> <Negative> We know you called McConnell once or twice.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I should be calling them.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> More.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I will be calling them. As soon as I feel that time is right.
<Bob Costa> <Positive> And it goes back to the point about VP: you do acknowledge there is a limitation you have in this town, in this political place of Washington.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sure, sure. I've been a very political person all my life.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> Understood.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've been on the other side, but still I've been very political ...
<Bob Costa> <Negative> Different. Donor and a politician.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've gotten unbelievable political things done: zoning. This building. Bob, how did I get this building?
<Bob Costa> <Negative> When you call a senator up now, and you pitch yourself, you're nearing the nomination, what do you say to them? When you're calling them cold?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well first of all, I do call some people that have just lost. Meaning, you know, they supported Rubio, they supported this. And we've dealt with... Honestly, a lot of people are calling me, but I should be calling them. And in a pretty near distance, right now, already, I'm going to start calling them. But I love the point you're making. This is a point that you're making, but it's a point I agree with. I should be calling ...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Yes. Because we have – it's not making – Bob Costa and I are making it because we hear it from people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. They don't know how to get in.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> There is the sound of silence. And yeah, exactly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then they get vicious. At the right point, I'm going to be calling them. One thing I'm going to do...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Who's going to be the first call?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will be call... That's a very good case, I better not tell you that. I'll let you know when I make it. Okay? [Laughter]
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Okay. And we have to have phase...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> One quick thing I'm going to do, a lot of people are saying, oh, the judges... To me, the judges – because there's going to be a lot of them in these next four years. We've got one already that was unexpected in Scalia. So the judges are going to be important. You're going to have either super-liberal judges, or you're going to have conservative judges. So important. They don't know me well enough. Well, what kind of judges? I'm going to do something. It was my idea, and I think it was a good idea. And I spoke to Senator Sessions and I spoke to other people, and I'm getting names. The Federalist people. Some very good people. The Heritage Foundation. I'm getting names, and I'm going to submit a list of about 10 names, 10 or 12 names, as judges. I'm going to announce that these are the judges, in no particular order, that I'm going to put up. And I'm going to guarantee it. I'm going to tell people. Because people are worried that, oh, maybe he'll put the wrong judge in. Like people – my sister is on the court of appeals. Very smart. She's a very smart, very highly respected person. Very smart.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> People keep trying to get her to talk, and she won't.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know what?
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Does she have a nondisclosure agreement? [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's fantastic. She's the exact opposite of me. People say, is she really your sister? She's a brilliant person. Highly respected. When the press calls, I say, listen, they want to do a great story. They actually had a nice story about her in the Washington Post recently. But she doesn't want to talk to the press, because she feels as a judge she should not be speaking to the press. Something very nice about that. She's right.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> I disagree, but...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> As a judge. No, but as a judge.
<Bob Costa> <Neutral> As a reporter, he disagrees.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, as a reporter. But there's something nice about that. She feels ...
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> But it's not just the individual calls, it's the message of inclusiveness, that it doesn't come through.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Bob, I've been hit very hard.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> Here's the problem I think you may face. You start an inclusive message, you turn that corner – let's say you're the nominee and you say, you know what? I'm going to tell Woodward who I called. I'm going to start being a unifier. But maybe so many bridges have been burned within the party that not everyone's going to be willing...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's possible, but I don't think so. I've been here before.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> And you may say to yourself, I wish I had built relationships sooner.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don't forget, I've been hit hard. I went in one of 17 and they hit me harder than anybody. And I hit back very hard. Harder than they hit me. Jeb: low energy. Little Marco. Names that were devastating. I think the low energy Jeb, all of a sudden you see him running down the street to try and show he's got high energy. And it wasn't him, and it became worse. I hit back very hard. I am telling you, almost all of these people that you would never think would ever – will want to come on board. But I've got to win first. That's why I told you that Vince Lombardi story. Because I think it's a great story. Anyway, I have to go. Let's do it again.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Okay. When - should we do it tomorrow? [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Just treat me fairly. Treat me fairly. .... Actually the truth is these were very interesting. Nobody has asked me these questions.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right, it is a big finale tomorrow night of The Apprentice. Donald Trump joins us on the phone. It is a big deal, three hours though, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, can you believe that Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I mean, that's a lot to ask people three hours.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know they think I'm Howard Stern or something. Three hours of live, so it's not something I'm looking forward to.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, live, ooh.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And throughout much of its life some of it's taped, you know from previous week.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A lot of it's live, most of it's live, and it's a lot of live. You know last year it was two hours and I had 41 million people, so they figured intelligently. Let's go to three hours instead.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I mean isn't that amazing? I mean like, Donald Trump was always very famous but --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But you know people said why is Donald Trump famous?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> This is a rock star kind of thing.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But this is a -- this TV show has really captured the imagination of the people. And I don't know. It's weird that NBC now has back in an entire night on you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, it's a bit amazing, actually and not only an entire night, I guess from what I learned in the last year you know, I know nothing about television until about 12 months ago.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Now you know everything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now I know sort of like, if you ask me about the ratings I talk about demographics, I talk about things I never even heard of before. But you know not only is it is that the week it's their Thursday night which is their big night.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] Was it's been amazing.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That was a Monday night.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I was watching on the Barbara Walters special the 10 most amazing people or fascinating people.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Or intriguing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Intriguing people.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That was funny, man.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well it was wild.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It was wild. Did Donald Trump on. And then, of course, they bring in Melania,
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Ah-huh.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They talk about marriage
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> The Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nice. Didn't she look good on the show?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She looked amazing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to tell you after watching that show I immediately started losing 15 pounds.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I mean let me tell you something, I was shocked to see that all the people you invite to your wedding, you didn't invite me.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What you don't know if you were invited yet, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, really.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I told you -- [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because the invitations haven't even gone out the most part.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, because in the press release it said you know this one's going that one's going this one's being invited.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, Really. I didnt know that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Really I didn't. We didn't put out a press release somebody got a whole of a list. And they put you know like names on and hundreds of names and you know what I did. I'm building this incredible ballroom at Mar-a-Lago and it's one of the better things I've ever built. And, you know, the first thing is the marriage always. But it is a way of highlighting that Boehner.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> So it is going to be on TV?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, with the television networks want it, you know simply for one reason, Robin. And you know the last wedding that was on television was Lady Di and Prince Charles. That didn't work out too well, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well listen --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You said it was a disastrous marriage.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes it was.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was a total catastrophe.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> Its all right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now everybody tells me you know the sort of interesting. Everybody tells me that you play my tape with A. J. As one of your five great moments in the history of the Howard Stern Show.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And that's true.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do you consider it that?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People love that tape. They always call me, "Could I have an A. J. Tape?"
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But get back to your wedding for a second.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want to get off that chat.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, you did? Well, you know, here's the thing, I like -- I thought for a second because I went to your last wedding.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You did. You really killed me in the last one.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I did and I said your marriage would last six months.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Not only that but you're wrong it lasted three years. But you know I think you know [Inaudible], you know the story when I turned on television. See most people go back and immediately make love.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> When I went back to the suite with Marla I turned on the television to see the news reports.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That you had already made love to her a million times.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was like, by that time I should have known better, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, you didnt.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Just forgot that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You didn't need a honeymoon [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Actually she was a very very nice person. Think what happened actually I found that out a little bit late.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You got to throw that in.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Very nice person.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What happened, I turned on the television and there's Howard, Robin. Every station had Howard, they didn't -- Everybody. I even heard your dear friend, O.J. Simpson, can you believe it a month before he killed his wife.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. You do -- [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A month before he absolutely killed his wife and without question, killed his wife. But there's Howard saying, "There wasn't a wet eye in the house."" [Inaudible] That killed me. You know what that was? And Marla was crying the whole evening. But Howard said
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, Howard came back and he said you know what. Nobody knew Donald at this wedding.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It was a room full of people who didn't know each other or Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thats true so we had every celebrity in the United States but I didn't know any of them.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, were saying there was a lot of like business guys who Donald does business with. But you know you know I mean there was a lot of like tourist type. I said this is crazy this is not an intimate moment
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, you said they were high rollers from there from the casino.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> There were.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have to say though, you had a great time. I mean, you had the wedding at the back of your book.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. But there were a lot of high rollers from the casino and stuff and I said, "Wait a second
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't think so.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I feel bad.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean. This one is different this one is being handled with great style. Actually, I'm just showing up. You know Melania is handling this wedding.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And I'm just showing up.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Now, it was funny to me because I'm watching this special and Donald sit there talking about, you know, the reason he loves. But I got to play the clip. You ready? [Inaudible] Let me play, cause this is the best.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I got to play you for you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You got to do this.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I got to play this. You really -- I don't think you watch this one. You need to hear yourself because this is getting crazy. Listen to me.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> How do you know this one is the right one?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She understands me better than anybody has ever understood me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Woah! [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it is true out, Howard. It is true. But you know-
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is that really true?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, I've been with her almost now six years, I've been saying five, but almost six years and it's been the best six years. It's been the best years in the business for me. I've never done better in business I've never done better in anything, even the television show. I mean, I do this I do this television show and it turns out to be a monster. And you know it's just been an amazing time. [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> But, Donald, she's not a good luck charm.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> How could you understand?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there is something about, you know, the woman behind the man and the man behind the woman, I really believe that. Hey, I've known friends of mine who were with certain women and they were very successful, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. And then they ditched that woman for another one and they became failures. And I say, you know take a look at Andre Agassi. I love Andre Agassi. Right. He's with Brooke Shields who is a wonderful girl. He's with Brooke Shields. She joined in.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] number 293, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He meets Steffi Graf he goes to number one. Now tell me that the woman stuff didn't have something to do with that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Alright, let's continue your conversation with Barbara Walters. Hold on.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She gives me my space. She knows when I come home it's in worse all the time.
<Melania Trump> <Negative> I'm not the person who is nagging [Inaudible.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now she's not.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Not yet.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that is yet to be seen. We will see. I don't think so.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> She doesn't nag you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's terrific, Howard. Well, you know, you know Melania.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, you know one thing I like about her is she does keep quiet. I like, you like to talk and you like to be the center of attention and she allows that.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Well she doesn't speak English.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes she does.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, she speaks beautiful English actually.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Although, I'm worried about the accent thing.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Very accented English.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I guess I'm into the Eastern European stuff, you know
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You really are.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it always happen.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes, you have.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean for some reason there's something about the European that does it for me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I bet Ivana was quiet until you married her.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah. That's true but that's scary.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Then she became a know it all.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's a scary fact.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She's like, [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what I always love about you, Howard. You always stuck up. When they were killing me, when the press was killing -- You know I always said when you leave, you get killed. In other words, if you're the leaver Right. You always get killed.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Everyone's angry with the guy when he has to leave. Isn't it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now this -- this moron ex-governor we have Mario Cuomo.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> His son not only got dumped by the wife but he goes out and says, I want him back, I want it back, please help me. You know, this next -- When you leave -- And everyone feel sorry for him. You know, that's one way of doing it but I don't choose to do it that way. But when you leave you get killed by the press, you know that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Wait a minute, Donald. Donald, you had them skiing together on separate mountains in Aspen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I thought I could -- I thought I could get away with that, you know. You haven't seen how big the mountains are in Aspen? Who would have believed like this to ants, two little ants, were on mountains this print mountain, Robin?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And you did.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who would ever believe they get to see each other?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> When people interview me about you all the time because they know I know. [Inaudible] You had your wife on one your mistress and the other for him.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> That is too funny! And he is skiing back and forth.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know it was a story I've never told about that mountain but it was sort of a horrible thing because I was up at this restaurant there must've been 2,000 people having lunch it was like about 12:30 and somehow I'm standing there putting on my skis and I'm with one or the other, I didn't know who, the other one comes over and they start screaming at each other, I love him, I love him, don't you understand, I love -- They're both screaming that I love him. And this big fat bald guy is standing next to me, the guy was like 325 pounds and I'm standing there mortified. Everybody is looking like a thousand people are watching these two women screaming at each other and this big fat guy is looking at me and he said, "Mr. Trump
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh well, you're a smart guy. What made you think y-you could get away with that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, mountains are very big, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible] evidently.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know they're very, very big and this day -- this was a tough day, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But when something like that happened-
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is not a day that you want to happen.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> When something like that happens to you, right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you then go like-like all of sudden.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Where do you go? Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> The two of them are staring at you. Who do you go often?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They weren't staring, Howard, they were screaming at each other.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But then when the screaming is over, do you go back with your wife or do you go back with your girlfriend?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well that was a tough decision.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Because you know there's no future with the wife. So you might as well be [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it was tough -- Let's put it this way, it was a very tough day in Trump land.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What did you do? Tell us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I actually, sort of, went with some friends and I'm not a drinker.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't believe in drinking but that was the closest I ever came to having a drink.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> Once you do your part you pick up another broad down at the lawn.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's the best way, you know. Somebody said what you're to do now is go for the good looking one over in the corner.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And you've been absolutely faithful to Melania for four five and a half years.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Of course.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow. [Inaudible]. Of course.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> Evidently the mountain was big enough for Melania. [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Do you -- when something like that happens you immediately send him expensive gifts so you just don't even like do you -- or do you get mad at them. That's a cool move.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know what happened? [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Positive> How dare you embarrass me. Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How dare you embarrass me on the mountain like this, in front of so many people. What I didn't know is we had all the paparazzi up there because somehow they knew about it. Now, what the hell -- I think I was the only one that didn't know that these two were on the mountain. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I bet eventually you trade her in for Lindsay Lohan this Melania.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What do you think of Lindsay Lohan, Howard?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I think she's hot.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There's something there, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you have to like freckles. I've seen a -- you know a close-up of her chest.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And a lot of freckles. Are you into Freckles?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm not into freckles, but you know the red hair thing I like. I like her I like her on the cover of Entertainment Women.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because there's something cool about her.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> A little Ann Margaret thing going.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Her name is very cool too. It's a great name. You know, I'll tell you what, Leonardo DiCaprio.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Call him Bill Smith.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Is he a movie star?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Absolutely not.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. He was born with one of the greatest names. You need a name Lindsay Lohan is sort of a good name.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, does the father wreck. Does that bother you a little bit?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, I'm just thinking Howard Stern, boy, I beat the odds with that name.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, but Howa --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Although, you did beat the odds.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You really beat the odds.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Howard feels that the father being a wreck is a good thing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. Yeah. Oh, yeah, because first of all, if the father is a rock like the way he is, D
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You imagine the sex with this troubled teen?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, you're probably right. She's probably deeply troubled and therefore great in bed.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Back in the day when-
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How come the deeply troubled women
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, deeply, deeply troubled, they're always the best in bed.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Because they're looking for love, they're looking for positive affirmation. They're looking for a father figure who will love them and tell them they're wonderful and they'll never be enough, no matter how many times you tell them they're beautiful, no matter how many times you tell them you love them. They want to suck it up more. They would drain you like a vampire into your head caved in if they could get more love.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have a friend Howard, who's actually like a great playboy. I mean, he really is. You know, I don't say this about men, this guy does very well.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What is the guy's name?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He only -- I can't tell you. He-he's you know very.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He's married?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He runs silent, run deep [Inaudible] like a submarine.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Howard, he will only look for a crazy woman. He says, "Donald
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> The desperate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think -- What is this guy all about? But if at some reason what I said is true, I mean, it is just unbelievable.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> I could tell from the -- [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You will not be with them for the long term, but for the short term, here's nothing like it.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> I could tell it from impression who it is Roberto Duran.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. That's very good. And he was good on my show, I tell you what, that's various club, that already was the star, Howard
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yep. He was the star.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That crazy guy was the star.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I tell you who is looking good and I hate to say this to you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I knew -- You know, I always thought your daughter was hot but I saw some recent pictures, mad on.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know that Ivanka was always the most beautiful of all the girls and she was always the smartest. I mean she was, you know, like this great A-student at the Wharton School of Finance which is the best business school in the world.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And I should have done her.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And she only went -- [Inaudible] That would've make me feel great.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I should have done it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, that would have made me feel great if she came home and said, "I'm in love with Howard Stern."
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, my goo-.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> There's still time, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know what, it's true. You have no idea what that does to a paren't. When I met my girlfriend she called her mother the next day and said, "I've met the most wonderful man."" She tells me this
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Colin Farrell.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> The Colin Farrell. She goes, "Howard Stern."" [Inaudible] Mother hung up on her. Didn't talk to her for three days. [Inaudible]."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I got to know Beth, and Beth is you've got a winner. How is she doing? All right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She's doing great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's good.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And -- and -- and you met Melania's parents?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I met Melania's his parents. Did they hang up the phone or they were happy?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But you know her father wasn't feeling that well for a little while.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I said well, what's wrong? And she looks -- she says, "Well
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And you Melania is still making love as often I mean -- I mean this marriage thing concerns me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. Absolutely. Absolutely. There's no question. How come I always get myself in trouble on this show, Robin? [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> What is wrong with you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Be honest. You know that once you get married you lose interest. I know that about you. And -- and I don't know how many times -- Like when you fir-.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know I love the marriage. I mean, marriage is like really great. I just like it. I think it's good. I don't know if it's security or whatever it is, but -- But what? I think it's good. If it works. I mean if it doesn't work it's a total catastrophe. It usually doesn't work.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But here's the thing. When you first met Melania you were probably making love to her at least once a day, at least.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Probably right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's right. And now, I would guess I don't know for sure. I'm going to say you down to two times a week if that. [Inaudible.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And I'm going to tell you something, I've been thinking about this.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You've been thinking about it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, for him. Because he's getting married, as the sex life diminishes, a guy starts to go, you know it's okay because I'm satisfied, and I can concentrate on work and you start to rationalize, and then it happens.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You want that heat, you want that sexiness, you want that every night hot of air.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Let me ask Donald something because this is something I've heard that happens, once you get engaged the sex heats up again.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> Oh, yeah?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did that happen?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I -- I don't know.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How don't you know? [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you know I'll tell you, Howard, what I will say is this [Inaudible] when you go on television like for instance, I had this guy Mark Cuban on and he failed.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. So I don't know -- I don't -- I don't imagi --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So he did horribly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, he fell terribly.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Terribly.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He had, you know what he drew?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> An embarrassing failure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, he drew flies.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Then you had Branson, then Branson go on this idiot from England.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No personalities.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> Branson might have go-. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know he's got it at the worst. I mean, the guy was the worst. And he goes on and they all want to be like the imitations, right? The clones. So they go on, they fail. Now, as you know my show is number one in every single major category.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The hottest show on television. So, as Harvey -- You know I-I have so many different friends, but movie people. The people from Miramax and they all say, "Donald
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I said, "Excuse me."" You know I'm negotiating a concrete contract with somebody
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm hearing one case of a star. The other case of dealing with this, like mob influence concrete company. So you know, I like the star stuff better. No actually, I feel like the real estate stuff better, but that's okay.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Wait a second, what -- [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So what happens is, but you know whether we like it or not. You have to have a show and you are the star of the show. You're a star I guess, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So women come up, the most beautiful women you've ever seen.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now the good news I own the Miss Universe pageant, so I get used to a good looking women. But the most beautiful women -- I go out to do Jay Leno Show.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And women come up to me, gorgeous actresses well-known actresses, and they look at me and they say, "I had no idea how handsome you were
<Howard Stern> <Positive> They want you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then you know they're full of crap when they say and your hair is absolutely beautiful.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> There you go
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. See, when they start to-
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Hey, take it easy there, Donald. We're not at that other place yet.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right. That's right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So what happens is I go -- I go through this, and I have hundreds and hundreds of people coming up to me, and I've really been a good boy. I have to be honest with you, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now let me ask you this. When that happens to you and the chick comes on to you, which -- which happens you reported to Melania? Because I know that if you do, it gets him hot again.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> It keeps her excited. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I really don't. I really don't. And you know what happens. And this of course has never happened to me, but 100 come on to you, right? And you turned them all down. Then the 100th first comes on to you and you say, "Okay
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And then you're going to divorce.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In other words, you're a good boy for 100
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then the chemicals kick in. You know the wrong chemicals, those crazy chemicals we go through walls, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Were you go through a building.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well you do things that are like, inappropriate, like you know skiing on mountains with two different women.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay. So those chemicals kick in again. Absolutely no control over and your bad. And what happens you break up or you can get a divorce with somebody, so you know it's a tough situation. [Inaudible] I've been very good how I really behave myself.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No kidding.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Not easy.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But you know you become more tempting the more you're locked up.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well maybe. I mean you know, there are those that say that you're more attractive after you get married.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That's what I'm saying. One you -- [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So what are you down to?Is she down to two times a week now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to say, but it's very good. But here's the thing-
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Very good. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Robin. Robin's saying is right. There- There are women that find you more attractive when you're married.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's true.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's a whole sexual deal that who knows what the hell that's about.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What if Melania gets fat, would you divorce her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely not. No, she can get fat, I like a woman that's a little chubby.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, you don't.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's not true.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I don't like skinny skinny stuff. I like, you know, like if she gained 10 or 15 pounds I'd love it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Alright, If Melania got in a car accident, lost her hand. Would you stay married to her?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I got a bad one.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Would you stay married to her.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely, Howard.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> That dioxin guy over the U. K. If she got a hold of some dioxin and her face blew up like that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I don't know what will happened to that guy. [Inaudible] You know, I was looking at him. Like a year ago. He was sort of a good looking guy, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then I turned on the television. [Inaudible] I see him, I said wow he's got a problem.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, he does.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Of course, they tried to poison him. You know they don't play games over there, Howard. We think of them like, you know we think politics is rough, because somebody raises their voice over there, they get it. That's right.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> They poison the guy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So over there you get in your airplane and you don't know whether or not you ever landing.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Damn right. Donald Trump. Watch the three-hour season finale of The Apprentice tomorrow night at 8 o'clock on NBC. My daughter called me she goes, "I got to see it. I want to be in the audience for that."" She never asked me for anything. And I said
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Which one.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> The -- Emily.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Is your daughter going to be at -- in the audience? Yeah. You know it's going to be at Lincoln Center this year. Last year we had in the studios of Saturday Night Live, and they had like 400 seats and the tickets were gone for $10,000 a piece. Wow. They were being scalped to 10,000. So this year we went to Lincoln Center and it's true, you can't get a ticket. I've got everybody calling me drive me crazy trying to get a ticket, it's at Lincoln Center and actually next year we'll probably going to [Inaudible]. Y-you won't believe this, the next season. They're thinking about Radio City Music Hall for the fina. Where Lincoln Center, and the tickets are the hottest tickets in the country, you can't get a ticket. Now if your daughter doesn't have a ticket you have to let me know. But she's got a ticket?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She's got a ticket. I had a bag [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So why don't you and Robin go tonight. Tomorrow night. Why don't you bring Beth?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Because, I-I'm because I've got to work.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So what, Howard? What [Inaudible] You get so much money now? [Inaudible] Because this deal is unbelievable.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I could slide back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, Robin, I'm thinking about going into the radio business. This new deal is unbelievable. You know there was a story I said at you the next Howard Stern the Donald Trump is the next Howard Stern.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I couldn't even compete. Joan you're on the air.
<Joan (Caller)> <Positive> Hi, good morning, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hello, Joan.
<Joan (Caller)> <Positive> Listen, I want to be refreshing and honest your hair is disgusting [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What is it. It's disgustingly what?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, she doesn't- She doesn't find you attractive.
<Joan (Caller)> <Positive> Yeah, but I do find his bank account very attractive. Which you like to do me Donald?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, it's a man.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, man.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh man.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It could only happen on your show. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now that really does grosses me out. [Inaudible] Uh, that's gross.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> There. He's not going there.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> There are couple of things that I want to ask Donald about. [Inaudible] I know you're going to say, of course you took the free wedding band. But --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, I got more heat over this. I have all these diamond companies that come to me. You know all the best ones. And they throw diamonds in my face like I'm a dog.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They throw them in my face. Millions of dollars. Diamonds, diamonds all in my face. Guess what? I'm a good businessman. I take up. And then I get killed in the press with taking the diamonds. Who the hell would -- They throw millions of dollars worth of diamonds. In fact I'm, thinking about giving Melania a 10 different rings. [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> But it's like they're marrying her, not you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's very unfair.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So in other words, they say to you, take the ring for free because it will be publicized
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They just want the publicity.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I see so who-whose ring did you end up going?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know which depending on which one I'm getting after the karat.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're thinking about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm negotiating for the most expensive one. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And your point is that, anyone who was offered a free diamond would take it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Why not.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But you don't make that your wedding band.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No but-but-but Robin but they can't take. I want to pay and they won't let me. Please this is a token of our affection.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, listen. Good luck with the three-hour season finale, not like you need it. Everyone's going to be tuned in.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> The Apprentice is tomorrow night at 8 o'clock on NBC. And I'll be waiting for my invitation. Where is the wedding going to be done? At Mar-a-Lago?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It'll be in Florida in Palm Beach at Mar-a-Lago and it'll be terrific.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And then when I go, what do I do? You put me up there-
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know, will work that out. That's not going to be tough.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Where am I going to -- where am I going to stay in, at Mar-a-Lago?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You'll stay at Mar-a-Lago. You'll stay anywhere you want but just at the best place to stay in Florida at the Mar-a-Lago club.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Does Robin have a shot of being invited to your wedding?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I was gonna say, I really want to be there. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Would you actually go all the way to Florida Robin?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Absolutely. I'm more likely than Howard
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know the one thing about this wedding, Howard. I've got more people calling me about this wedding and so I haven't heard of for like 10 years. Celebrities saying one of them called up, a big celebrity. Donald, no I didn't you know even think about inviting. Very big. He said, I'm providing the chef for the wedding.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I say, "What?"" I want to give you the greatest pastry chef in America. I'm providing him for the wedding. Now I'm saying to myself he's providing me with a chef and I'm -- I'm not even inviting the guy to the wedding
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Now, how many people you think are going to be there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I wanted to keep it down to 400.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It's going to be a zoo.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it's going to be a mad house. And you know they all -- You know this, Howard. The networks all want it to be live.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So why don't you do it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm thinking about it, why not?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I mean, I don't think I would go if it's on TV.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why? Because you're so shy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, I mean, I don't want to be a part of it. I mean I feel like a jerk. [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't like it, you know, cheapens the wedding. [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You wouldn't want that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. It does though, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It does. I'm telling you I think it's some -- something's got to be private.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That's what I'm saying, this should be a personal thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd like it -- I tell you what, I thought the most beautiful wedding, seriously, was Lady Di walking down the deal and here's Prince Charles walking into this incredible cathedral, because you know say what you want about the English nobody does pomp and circumstance like the English, no body.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Where's Melania now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She is in bed.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Wearing what?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Very little.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow huh.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, very little. But Lady Di -- Howard -- Lady Di -- [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She must be good in bed. like I don't even know if she's going to marry you. I mean you could have any checks so she must be doing tricks. God knows what she's doing.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah. What is she doing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she is good and she's a good girl.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Favorite position with Melania then I'll let you go.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Favorite position?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Normal. I'm a very normal guy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Normal. All right. There you go.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know I'm not into the kinky stuff. I'm like a really straight normal guy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And you never tie her up.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I'm not into that stuff. I'm not into, you know, being a brain. I have friends you know Donald it was so incredible. I eat her, I pound her, I'm saying you know what kind of an animal is this.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You're not choking her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm not I'm not into beating people up.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You never pull her hair?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't pull her hair.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You don't choke her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Have you ever spanked her?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm not into jokin'.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Have you ever spank her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, if I did it's very likely.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right. All right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's not my thing.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Hey, Donald Trump. Watch the three-hour season finale of The Apprentice tomorrow night 8 o'clock on NBC. Don't miss it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thanks a lot, Howard. Thanks, Robin.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Bye
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Bye.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thank you Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He make them call me Mr. Trump on the TV show.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, why not.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Well I think they-
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You have people to do it, do it. They got people anyway. We have to take a break. We'll be back right after these words. [Commercial Break]
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> Donald Trump sits alone. He hasn't slept in 48 hours.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> At six A.M., perched high in the bronze-coated jewel of his empire, Trump Tow-er, he's bent over a mammoth Brazilian-rosewood desk, scrutinizing spread sheets.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> No insomnia, no gnawing worries.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> Pressure, he surmises, sipping an iced Coke, "doesn't upset my sleep," a standard four hours nightly.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> I like throwing balls into the air - and I dream like a baby.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> Three hours later, blond hair marshaled, he announces, with standard chutzpah, his seven-and-a-half-billion-dollar bid to gobble down the nation's premiere airline, American. On the strength of his $120-a-share bid, the stock vaults from $16 to $99. The 43-year-old billionaire, who owns huge blocks of American Airlines stock, smiles broadly.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> A week later, with the market tumbling 190 points, he withdraws his offer, per-haps temporarily. Despite some reports that insinuated his American raid was only cardboard, a ploy to rattle up his stock, Trump stares into space:
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> Nope. I want it.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> Yup. If it's the best, and it's for sale, Donald Trump's stomach begins to growl.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> He captured troubled Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi's onyx-and-gold-plated yacht for a mere $29,000,000 - now it's worth $100,000,000. Then he bought the Eastern Shuttle for $365,000,000 and transformed it overnight into the Trump Shuttle, complete with comfortable cabins and stewardesses rustling in virgin wool and pearls.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> A year earlier, he had bought the Plaza Hotel for $400,000,000 and is now lov-ingly restoring her without a name change. Her make-over will be supervised by the Czech mistress of Trump's kingdom, Ivana, a former Olympic skier and fash-ion model.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> At home, Ivana presides over a 100-room Trump Tower triplex, recently expanded from 50 rooms ("Better closet space," she jokes). Trump, proud of the salmon-marbled atrium of Trump Tower, where no expense was spared, says, "I bought the whole damn mountain! You've never seen that color before. Ivana suggested it because it makes people look better."
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> The couple also has a 47-room country house on ten acres in Greenwich, Connect-icut, and the well-publicized 118-room Mar-a-Lago Marjorie Merriweather Post estate in Palm Beach, their commute time shortened by the 727 jet and the French-made military Puma helicopter.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> The Trump Princess, or the Khashoggi "boat," as Trump now calls it, has gotten cramped, so a Dutch shipyard is confecting not a Princess but a full-fledged Queen costing more than $175,000,000.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> Such ostentation, despite a catalog of charities and good deeds done for sick kids, has predictably yielded a rich crop of snipers. Spy Magazine, the New York-based humor monthly, cheerfully carries on a scabrous vendetta against the Trumps, comparing them to. Dickensian monsters. Time did a cover story on the decay of Atlantic City and chided Trump for helping create a crime-plagued ur-ban blight divided between welfare cases and high rollers. On the Upper West Side, Manhattanites attack him for his proclaimed desire to build an enormous complex, Trump City, complete with a 150-story skyscraper; Phil Donahue charges that Trump's casinos pillage the gullible; an aide close to outgoing mayor Ed Koch calls Trump "the most arrogant s.o.b. who has ever stepped onto the earth."
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> Ah, well. To be young, blond and a billionaire.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> It doesn't seem to matter. The most daunting entrepreneur since the Astors, Vanderbilts and Whitneys, Donald John Trump has made his "art of the deal" work - not just for making money but for crushing adversaries, too.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> Case in point: Merv Griffin. Ten months after Griffin bought Trump's Resorts International Inc. for $365,000,000, for which Trump had paid $101,000,000 the year before, Griffin found himself holding a busted balloon. Not only had he inherited the hotel-casino's $925,000,000 debt but he embarrassingly had to re-port first-half losses of $46,600,000. There's now talk of a possible bankrupt-cy for Merv and a possible lawsuit against Trump.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> Looking beyond his one-billion-dollar Taj Mahal opening in Atlantic City next month, Trump has plenty to consider. There are rumors of his building casinos in Nevada and his buying Tiffany's, NBC, the New York Daily News or the Waldorf Hotel ("I've got to have the Waldorf," he coos jokingly into the phone. "I can't sleep without it"). And the Presidency? No, that takes an election, and it is clear that Trump is not that patient. Too much to do!
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> The billion-dollar baby was born in the exclusive Jamaica Estates in Queens, New York, on June 14,1946, to a mere millionaire, real-estate developer Fred Trump, who had racked up his $20,000,000 fortune building low-to-middle-priced homes and apartments in Brooklyn and Queens.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> Among the five little Trumps, only Donald seemed to have a passion for mortar and bricks, riding around construction sites with his father - "who ruled all of us with a steel will" - and showing younger brother Robert, now a low-profile V.P. in the Trump organization, who was boss in their 23-room house.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> At the age of eight, little Donald borrowed Robert's cherished toy blocks, glued them together into one giant skyscraper and never returned them, thereaf-ter exercising his fantasies about changing Manhattan's skyline.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> His father, who harped on the importance of "knowing how to make a buck," re-garded mop-haired Donald as "rough and wild," shipped him off to the New York Military Academy in Cornwall-on-Hudson and, some say, forever instilled in him a gnawing sense of inadequacy that fueled the boy's ambition. There followed two years at Fordham and two years at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Finance, then a few years diddling in middle-income housing until, at the age of 28, Trump delivered the punch that launched him. Taking a hard look at Manhattan's troubled fortunes, he fastened onto the bankruptcy of the Penn Central Railroad as his ticket into the big time and nimbly plucked options on Penn's Hudson River railroad yards, now the site of New York's Convention Cen-ter, and its 59-year-old Commodore Hotel, now the Grand Hyatt.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> The coup was in his persuading bankers to lend him $80,000,000 and in talking politicians into awarding him a $120,000,000 tax abatement.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> Persuasion, hype and chutzpah thereafter defined the Trump style, welded to a scrupulous management technique.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> In 1979, at the age of 33, he snapped up the Fifth Avenue site of the old Bon-wit Teller for $20,000,000, won a $140,000,000 tax abatement and three years later finished Trump Tower, a 68-story dazzler that includes a six-story atrium and today draws 100,000 visitors daily, with residents such as Johnny Carson and Steven Spielberg.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> Amassing a fortune his father never dreamed possible - a cash hoard of $900,000,000, a geyser of $50,000,000 a week from his hotel-casinos, assets thought to total 3.7 billion dollars - Trump soon became as captivated by mys-tique-making as by money-making.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> As the snooty ads running around New York proclaimed, "Everything does seem to be very Trump these days." There are his residential buildings, Trump Parc and Trump Plaza and the soon-to-be-finished Trump Palace; Trump Castle in Atlantic City and the soon-to-be-finished Taj Mahal; his book "
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> The Art of the Deal," written with Tony Schwartz, which held on to the number-one spot on the New York Times best-seller list longer than any business book since "Iacocca"; his high-rise board game named - you guessed it - Trump (reported to be a flop); his upcoming TV game show - you guessed it again - "Trump Card"; and the bike race named Tour de Trump, which, as he points out, sure beats its old name - Tour de Jersey. And - well - you get the picture.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> Vision is my best asset, he says without a shred of modesty. "I know what sells and I know what people want."
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> Along the way, Trump even found time to attend the 1976 Montreal Olympics, mar-ry his match, Ivana Zelnicek (who has vowed never to look a day over 29), and produce his own little Trumps - Donald, Jr., 12, Ivanka, eight, and Eric, six.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> Notwithstanding the good fortune that seems to have attended Trump's business moves, he and his family have not escaped life's darker side. While sis-ters Maryanne, a Federal judge in New Jersey, and Elizabeth, an administrative as-sistant for Chase Manhattan, have found their niches, Trump's older brother, Fred, hated the real-estate business, became an airline pilot, took to drink and died an alcoholic in 1981 at 43.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> Trump was also recently shaken when, last October, three key executives died in a helicopter crash; the boss reportedly narrowly missed death, deciding at the last minute that he was too busy to travel. "I never realized," says Trump to-day, "how deaths outside the family could have such a profound effect on me. It's a tragic waste." As for himself, he's fatalistic: "I work, I don't worry and I protect myself as well as anybody can. But ultimately we all end up going to hopefully greener pastures."
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> To check out his present-day pastures, we sent New York Daily News celebrity interviewer and syndicated columnist Glen Plaskin to talk with him. This inter-view had long been in the works, including two earlier starts. But Plaskin fi-nally got Trump to sit down with him over a period of nearly 16 weeks. His re-port:
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> For our first session at Trump Tower, after being visually frisked by a troop of basketball-player-tall bodyguards, I entered the inner sanctum. There was Donald Trump, as he would be for most of our sessions, slumped behind the cin-namon-colored desk, slung comically low in his chair, clipping his fingernails. I think best this way, ' he'd deadpan.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> As the weeks went by, I found I liked poking through the hooded dare-me eyes with rapid-fire changes of topic, watching for surprise. Often he parried with rehearsed answers, but we spent enough time together that we entered genuinely fresh territory. When I asked for his stand on abortion, he frowned, pouted and asked me to turn the recorder off. He didn't really have an opinion - what the hell was mine? It was a very human moment. Supervising his office like an exceedingly well-run vaudeville show, executive assistant Norma Foerderer would wander in with another gold-framed magazine cover to put up on his wall - or with a seven-pound cheese-cake or a stuffed skunk. Trump would take calls during our interview - never for more than a few minutes - that invariably ended with, `OK, baby, you're the greatest.' Then secretary Rhona Graff would walk in, bearing little yellow slips of paper an-nouncing calls waiting: down-on-his-luck financier Adnan Khashoggi, asking to have lunch; a hotel executive, dickering to sell yet another big hotel . . .By the time Duchess Fergie called about borrowing his brand-new accident-proof helicopter, and Don Johnson to borrow his city-size yacht, I was dizzy.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> To get away from it all, we began our first session hovering above the East River in the cobalt Darth Vader helicopter. Donald Trump was strapped into taupe leather, good-naturedly hyping his empire below.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> You aren't known for being shy at promotion; let's start by playing a little game. Trump Tower is?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The finest residential building anywhere.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> The Taj Mahal in Atlantic City is going to be?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The most spectacular hotel-casino anywhere in the world.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> And the Trump Shuttle will be?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Easily the number-one service to Washington and Boston.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> Your apartment sales are?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The best. Trump Tower and Trump Parc have seventy percent of the top sales in New York per square foot.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Simple: People know they're going into a building where no expense is spared, where the level of materials and finishes will be the best, where the location will be the best. Many European and Japanese investors literally give their subordinates instructions to buy apartments only in Trump buildings. A Japanese investor just paid me twenty million bucks for seven apartments he's turning into one.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> OK. But here we are at the start of a new decade. How do you respond when people call you ostentatious, ego-ridden and a greedy symbol of the Eight-ies?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Rich men are less likely to like me, but the working man likes me be-cause he knows I worked hard and didn't inherit what I've built. Hey, I made it myself; I have a right to do what I want with it.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> With so much poverty on the city streets, isn't it embarrassing for you to flaunt your wealth?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There has always been a display of wealth and always will be, until the depression comes, which it always does. And let me tell you, a display is a good thing. It shows people that you can be successful. It can show you a way of life. Dynasty did it on TV. It's very important that people aspire to be successful. The only way you can do it is if you look at somebody who is. PLAY-BOY: And for you, sitting snugly inside the one hundred and eighteen rooms of your Palm Beach mansion
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People understand that the house in Florida is business. I use it very seldom. I could be happy living in a studio apartment.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> Oh, come on.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean it; the houses, the planes and the boat are just investments. I paid twenty-nine million dollars for the Khashoggi yacht; two years later, I'll be selling it for more than one hundred million dollars and getting a bigger one.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> Why in the world do you need a bigger yacht?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't. But the Khashoggi boat is worth more only if I sell it. This new one will - believe it or not - be even more spectacular and bring tremen-dous acclaim to Trump properties in Atlantic City.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> What is it that attracts you to all this glitz?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have glitzy casinos because people expect it; I'm not going to build the lobby of the IBM office building in Trump Castle. Glitz works in Atlantic City, and yet the Plaza Hotel has been brought back to its original elegance of 1907. So I don't use glitz in all cases. And in my residential buildings, I sometimes use flash, which is a level below glitz.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> The what does all this - the yacht, the bronze tow-er, the casinos - really mean to you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Props for the show.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> And what is the show?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The show is "Trump" and it is sold out performances everywhere. I've had fun doing it and will continue to have fun, and I think most people enjoy it.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> Do you think the ones who hate it are jealous?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They could be whatever - but the vast majority dig it.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> Cal-vin Klein, who doesn't have a fraction of your wealth, has often said he feels guilty about his. Do you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's not overriding, but I do have it.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> You don't sound guilty at all.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do have a feeling of guilt. I'm living well and like it, I know that many other people don't live particularly well. I do have a social conscious-ness. I'm setting up a foundation; I give a lot of money away and I think peo-ple respect that. The fact that I built this large company by myself - working people respect that; but the people who are at high levels don't like it. They'd like it for themselves.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> Do you see yourself as greedy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think I'm greedy. If I were, I wouldn't give to charities. I run the Wollman Skating Rink in New York City for nothing and I gave away the roy-alties from my book. I give millions for charity each year. If I were really greedy...
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> You mean like Leona Helmsley, the convicted hotel queen?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, like Leona Helmsley. She is a vicious, horrible woman who systemat-ically destroyed the Helmsley name. I know Leona better than anybody does but Harry [Helmsley]. If Harry had one fault, it was giving her too much leeway.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When I was twenty, Harry was the big guy in town. I once drove my car down the street in Manhattan, saw him at a corner, stopped and introduced myself and of-fered him a ride. When I pulled over on the left side of the street, with traf-fic on the right, he asked me to get out of the car so he could get out on the left side. I thought to myself, This is a highly conservative guy. He never would have evaded taxes on his own. But Leona pushed and pushed him. He needed that money like you need fifty-six cents in your pockets, I'm telling you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Also, Leona was not a great businesswoman but a very bad one. She sold me the St. Moritz Hotel and a few years later, I made more than a hundred mil-lion dollars on it. She ran that hotel badly. She set the women's movement back fif-ty years. She is a living nightmare, and to be married to her must be like liv-ing in hell.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> On the other hand, your wife, Ivana, is doing a great job running the Plaza, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have told Ivana, "Whatever Leona would do, do the opposite. [Laughs] Be nice to everybody." And she is nice, anyway.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> Was it simple greed with Leona?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Much more than greed. She's out of her mind. Leona Helmsley is a truly evil human being. She treated employees worse than any human being I've ever witnessed and I've dealt with some of the toughest human beings alive.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> What do you to stay in touch with your employees?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I inspect the Trump Tower atrium eve-ry morning. Walk into it. . .it's perfect; everything shines. I go down and raise hell in a nice way all the time because I want everything to be absolute-ly immaculate. I'm totally hands-on. I get along great with porters and maids at the Plaza and the Grand Hyatt.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've had bright people ask me why I talk to porters and maids. I can't even be-lieve that question. Those are the people who make it all work... If they like me, they will work harder . . . and I pay well.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> You lost some valued employees in a recent helicopter crash.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. I lost not only brilliant, key players in my company but true friends - and I couldn't believe it. At first, I was shocked, called their wives, just kept functioning . . . My own sense of optimism and life was great-ly diminished. I never realized how deaths outside the family could have such a profound effect on me.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> What did you think when the shock wore off?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Pauses] It's a tragic waste. I was also angry in that it was an event that I didn't want to happen. Here was this press conference, a very mediocre event announcing a minor boxing match. I told these guys that they didn't need to go, but they wanted to be there... They gave their lives for something so unimportant. It's been a rough time. [Pauses]
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> What do you think of rich people in general?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Rich people are great survivors and, by nature, they fall into two cate-gories - those who have inherited and those who've made it. Those who have in-herited and chosen not to do anything are generally very timid, afraid of los-ing what they've got, and who can blame them? Others are great risk takers and produce a hell of a lot more or go bust.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> As Merv Griffin did? After buying Resorts International from you, the company may be facing bankruptcy. What happened there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Merv is a good guy who I have really just gotten to know; we were both judges on the Miss America Pageant after our deal. I don't want to bug him, but prior to buying Resorts, he was telling everybody what a great deal he made and, by inference, what a bad deal Trump made.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> But, in fact, you didn't make such a bad deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, let's just say he didn't out-Trump Trump. He has a huge amount of debt. But he is very efficient and has very good PR people. Business Week wrote a story titled How Donald Taught Merv the Art of the Deal. I was angry. And equally angry when People and Time magazines, with no goddamned research and no knowledge, incompetently reported that Merv had bested Donald. Can you imagine? They didn't do any research. They just listened to PR people. Well, now they know the truth and have asked about following up or correcting stories. I said, "Forget it - it doesn't matter."
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> What satisfaction, exactly, do you get out of doing a deal?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love the creative process. I do what I do out of pure enjoyment. Hope-fully, nobody does it better. There's a beauty to making a great deal. It's my canvas. And I like painting it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I like the challenge and tell the story of the coal miner's son. The coal miner gets black-lung disease, his son gets it, then his son. If I had been the son of a coal miner. I would have left the damn mines. But most people don't have the imagination - or whatever - to leave their mine. They don't have "it".
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> Which is?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It is an ability to become an entrepreneur, a great athlete, a great writer. You're either born with it or you're not. Ability can be honed, per-fected or neglected. The day Jack Nicklaus came into this world, he had more innate ability to play golf than anybody else.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> You obviously have a lot of self-confidence. How do you use that in a business deal?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I believe in positive thinking, but I also believe in the power of nega-tive thinking. You should prepare for the worst. If I'm doing a deal, I want to know how bad it's going to be if everything doesn't work rather than how good it's going to be. I have a positive outlook, but I'm unfortunately also quite cynical. So if all the negatives happened, what would my strategy be? Would I want to be in that position? If I don't, I don't do the deal. My attitude is to focus on the down side because the up side will always take care of itself. If a deal is going to be great, it's just a question of, How much am I going to make?
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> How far are you willing to push adversaries?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will demand anything I can get. When you're doing business, you take people to the brink of breaking them without having them break, to the maximum point their heads can handle - without breaking them. That's the sign of a good businessman: Somebody else would take them fifteen steps beyond their breaking point.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> What if your pushing results in losing the deal?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Then I pushed him too far. I would have made a mistake. But I don't. I push to the maximum of what he can stand and I get a better deal than he gets.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> An-other aspect of your deal making is how you handle the media. You managed to suppress an unflattering TV documentary about you funded by your arch-nemesis, [New York businessman and publisher] Leonard Stern. Do you also claim victory over him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Total victory, yes. But I don't want to dwell on triumph or defeat.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> That may sound magnanimous, but, in fact, you're known to ex-act re-venge on people you think have tried to pull something on you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think I'm fair, not tough, in business. But if somebody is trying to do an in-justice to me, I fight back harder than anybody I know. When somebody tries to harm you and your family, you have an absolute right to fight back.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> Do you hate Stern?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. Stern is a nonentity to me. He obviously dis-likes me enough to spend close to a million dollars trying to make a negative documentary.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> You have a lot of enemies in New York City, among them a group that opposes your building a huge Trump City on the Hudson that will include the world's tallest building - on the theory that it will ruin the West Side and cause unbearable congestion. What do you say to them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Point one: There were more people living on the West Side of New York in the Forties than there are today. Very few people understand that. Point two: Trump City is going to be an architectural masterpiece. Point three: The city desperately needs the taxes, the housing and the shopping hat will produce bil-lions of dol-lars in revenue. Yet that community group [West Pride] fights eve-ry job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Those people fight the sale of fighting. I honestly believe that if I proposed an eighty-acre park, they would come out and fight me. Selfishy, they like what they have and don't want to give it anybody else. We need another Rockefeller Center - especially now that Mitsubishi has bought most of the one we had.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> Among other things, West Pride claims the largest building in the world would cast a mammoth shadow across the West Side, blocking out light and wrecking the ambience of the neighborhood.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Angrily] Every building casts a shadow, for God's sake! I want this job to be dramatic. I strive for that. I don't want it to be contextual, blending into everything else. It shouldn't be like getting a haircut and telling the barber I don't want anyone to know I've gotten one. I am competing here with the state of New Jersey, which is sucking the lifeblood out of New York City. They're beating us up. Trump City would take the play away from the development of the New Jersey waterfront. There will be nothing in New York to compete with Trump City! PLAY-BOY: So you're going to build it, come what may?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll build it, though it may not be now. I'll wait until things get bad in the city, because every city in every nation has its ups and downs. If I had tried to get the zoning for Trump City in 1975, I would have gotten everything I wanted, because the city was absolutely at a low point. I may now wait for construction to stop, for interest rates to go up - then the city will desper-ately need Trump City.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> You often say that the key to your success is being a good deal maker and a good manager. Why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've seen great deal makers go down the tubes because they haven't known how to manage what they've had. Take [Saudi financier indicted for a felony] Adnan Khashoggi: He was a great deal maker but a bad businessman. Time will tell if Merv is good manager. He is going to have to be.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> When you were growing up in Queens, your father was supposedly a harsh taskmaster. It has been theorized that your father instilled in you a great sense of inadequacy. True?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's one hundred percent wrong I was always very much accepted by my father. He adored Donald Trump and I've always known that. But I did want to prove to my father and other peo-ple that I had the ability to be successful on my own.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> You've often said that your father made you work as a teenager and taught you the value of the buck.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My father never made me work. I liked to work during summers. I don't understand these teenagers who sit home watching television all day. Where's their appetite for competition? Working was in my genes.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> Still, your father was one tough son of a bitch wasn't he?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was a strong, strict father, a no-nonsense kind of guy, but he didn't hit me. It wasn't what he'd ever say to us, either. He ruled by demeanor, not the sword. And he never scared or intimidated me.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> Your older brother, Fred, who died from heart failure bought on by acute alcoholism, had a more difficult time with him, didn't he?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Take one environment and it will work completely differently on differ-ent children. Our family environment, the competitiveness, was a negative for Fred. It wasn't easy for him being cast in a very tough environment, and I think it played havoc on him
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was very close to home and it was very sad when he died ... toughest situa-tion I've had. ...
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> What did you learn from his experience?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Pauses] Nobody has ever asked me that. But his death affected every-thing that has come after it. ... I think constantly that I never really gave him thanks for it. He was the first Trump boy out there, and I subconsciously watched his moves.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> And the lesson?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I saw people really taking advantage of Fred and the lesson I learned was always to keep up my guard one hundred percent, whereas he didn't. He did-n't feel that there was really reason for that, which is a fatal mistake in life. People are too trusting. I'm very untrusting guy. I study people all the time, automatically; it's my way of life, for better or worse.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am very skeptical about people; that's self-preservation at work. I believe that's, unfortunately, people are out for themselves. At this point, it's to many people's advantage to like me. Would the phone stop ringing, would these people kissing ass disappear if things were not going well?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I enjoy testing friendship. ... Everything in life tome is a psychological game, a series of challenges you either meet or don't. I am always testing peo-ple who work for me.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> How?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will send people around to my buyers to test their honesty by offering them trips and other things. I've been surprised that some people least likely to accept a trip from a contractor did and some of the most likely did not. You can never tell until you test; the hu-man species is interesting in that way. So to me, friendship can be really tested only in bad times.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I instinctively mistrust many people. It is not a negative in my life but a positive. Playboy wouldn't be talking to me today if I weren't a cynic. So I learned that from Fred, and I owe him a lot. ... He could have ultimately been a happy guy, but thing just went the unhappy way.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> How large a role does pure ego play in your deal making and enjoyment of publicity?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will send people around to my buyers to test their honesty by offering them trips and other things. I've been surprised that some people least likely to accept a trip from a contractor did and some of the most likely did not. You can never tell until you test; the human species is interesting in that way. So to me, friendship can be really tested only in bad times.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I instinctively mistrust many people. It is not a negative in my life but a positive. Playboy wouldn't be talking to me today if I weren't cynic. So I learned that from Fred, and I owe him a lot. ... He could have ultimately been a happy guy, but things just went the unhappy way.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> How large a role does pure ego play in your deal making and enjoyment of publicity?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Every successful person has a very large ego.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> Every successful person? Mother Teresa? Jesus Christ?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Far greater egos than you will ever under-stand.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> And the Pope?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely. Nothing wrong with ego. People need ego, whole nations need ego. I think our country needs more ego, because it is being ripped off so bad-ly by our so-called allies; i.e., Japan, West Germany, Saudi Arabia, South Ko-rea, etc. They have literally outegotized this country, because they rule the greatest money machine ever assembled and it's sitting on our backs. Their products are better because they have so much subsidy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We Americans are laughed at around the world for losing a hundred and fifty billion dollars year after year, for defending wealthy nations for nothing, na-tions that would be wiped off the face of the earth in about fifteen minutes if it weren't for us. Our "allies" are making billions screwing us.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> How do you feel about Japan's economic pre-eminence?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Japan gets almost seventy percent of its oil from the Persian Gulf, re-lies on ships led back home by our destroyers, battleships, helicopters, frog men. Then the Japanese sail home, where they give the oil to fuel their facto-ries so that they can knock the hell out General Motors, Chrysler and Ford. They're openly screwing us is a disgrace. Why aren't they paying us? The Japa-nese cajole us, they bow to us, they tell us how great we are and then they pick our pockets. We're losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year while they laugh at our stupidity.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The Japanese have their great scientists making cars and VCRs and we have our great scientists making missiles so we can defend Japan. Why aren't we be-ing reimbursed for our costs? The Japanese double-screw the U.S., a real trick: First they take all our money with their consumer goods, then they put it back in buying all of Manhattan. So either way, we lose.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> You're opposed to Japanese buying real estate in the U.S.?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a great respect for the Japanese people and list many of them as great friends. But, they if you want to open up a business in Japan, good luck. It's virtually impossible. But the Japanese can buy our buildings, our Wall Street firms, and there's virtually nothing to stop them. In fact, bidding on a building in New York is an act of futility, because the Japanese will pay more than it's worth just to screw us. They want to own Manhattan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Of course, I shouldn't even be complaining about it, because I'm one of the big beneficiaries of it. If I ever wanted to sell any of my properties, I'd have a field day. But it's an embarrassment! I give great credit to the Japanese and their leaders, because they have made our leaders look totally second rate.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> A group of Japanese visitors to New York was recently asked if there were anything in the U.S. they would like to buy. The answer: towels.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's fair trade: They'll take the towels and we'll buy their cars. It doesn't sound like a good deal to me. They have totally outsmarted the American politician; they have no respect for us, because they're getting a free ride. Of course, it's not just the Japanese or the Europeans - the Saudis, the Kuwai-tis walk all over us.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> The Arabs also spend plenty of money in you casinos, don't they?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They lose a million, two million at the tables and they're so happy be-cause they had such a great weekend. If you lost a million dollars, you'd be sick for the rest of your life, maybe. They write me letters telling me what a wonderful time they had.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> You have taken out full-page ads in several major newspapers that not only concern U.S. foreign trade but call for the death penalty, too. Why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because I hate seeing this country go to hell. We're laughed at by the rest of the world. In order to bring law and order back into our cities, we need the death penalty and authority given back to the police. I got fifteen thousand positive letters on the death-penalty ad. I got ten negative or slightly negative ones.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> You believe in an eye for an eye?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When a man or woman cold-bloodedly murders, he or she should pay. It sets an example. Nobody can make the argument that the death penalty isn't a deterrent. Either it will be brought back swift-ly or our society will rot away. It is rotting away.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> For a man so concerned about our crumbling cities, some would say you've done little for crumbling Atlantic City besides pull fifty million dol-lars a week out of tourists' pockets.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Elected officials have that responsibility. I would hate to think that people blame me for the problems of the world. Yet people come to me and say, "Why do you allow homelessness in the cities?" as if I control the situation. I am not somebody seeking office.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> What about using your influence in Atlantic City to help the disadvan-taged?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everybody has influence, but it is a Governmental problem. I take out those ads to wake up the Government about how Japan and others are ripping our country apart-
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> Wait. Doesn't it seem that with all your influence in Atlantic City you could do more to combat crime and corruption and put something back into the community?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, crime and prostitution go up, and Atlantic City administrations are into very deep trouble with the law, and there are lots of problems there, no question aboutit. But there is a tremendous amount of money going to housing from the profits of the casinos.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> As somebody who runs hotels, all I can do, when you get right down to it, is run the best places, bring in as much money as possible, which in turn goes out for taxes. I contribute millions a year to various charities. Finally, by law, I'm not allowed to have Governmental influence; but if they passed legislation that allowed me to get more involved, I'd be very happy to do it. In the mean-time, I have the most incredible hotels in the world in Atlantic City. The Taj Mahal will be beyond belief. An if I can awaken the government of Atlantic City, I have performed a great service.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> We've talked about building low-income housing; what have you done about that in other locations?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I did that during the years I worked with my father; I did build both low-income housing and housing for the elderly. And now I'm going to be build-ing more of it. The problem is, that stuff never gets written about.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> On the other hand, you were invited to consider building a luxury ho-tel in Moscow a few years ago. What was your trip to Moscow like?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was not long after the Korean plane was shot down over Russia. There I am up in my plane when my pilot announces, "We are now flying over the Soviet Union," and I'm thinking to my-self, What the hell am I doing here?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Then I look out the window and see two Russian fighter planes ... I later found out, guiding us in. I had insisted on having two Russian colonels fly-ing with me - I felt safer, and my pilot doesn't speak great Russian, which is putting it mildly, and I didn't want problems in radio communications.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> Once you got to Moscow, how did the negotiations go?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I told them, "Guys, you have a basic problem. Far as real estate is con-cerned, it's impossible to get title to Russian land, since the government owns it all. What kind of financing are you gonna get on a building where the land is owned by the god-damned motherland?"
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They said, "No problem, Mr. Trump. We will work out lease arrangements."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said, I want ownership, not leases."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They came up with a solution: "Mr. Trump, we form a committee with ten people, of which seven are Russian and three are your representatives, and all disputes will be resolved in this manner."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought to myself, Shit, seven to three - are we dealing in the world of the make-believe here or what?
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> What were your other impressions of the Soviet Union?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was very unimpressed. Their system is a disaster. What you will see there soon is a revolution; the signs are all there with the demonstrations and picketing. Russia is out of control and the leadership knows it. That's my problem with Gorbachev. Not a firm enough hand.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> You mean firm hand asin China?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it. Then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength. Our country is right now perceived as weak....as being spit on by the rest of the world
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> Why is Gorbachev not firm enough?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I predict he will be overthrown, because he has shown extraordinary weakness. Suddenly, for the first time ever, there are coal-miner strikes and brush fires everywhere - which will all ultimately lead to a violent revolu-tion. Yet Gorbachev is getting credit for being a wonderful leader - and we should continue giving him credit, because he's destroying the Soviet Union. But his giving an inch is going to end up costing him and all his friends what they most cherish - their jobs.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> Besides the real-estate deal, you've met with top-level Soviet offi-cials to negotiate potential business deals with them; how did they strike you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Generally, these guys are much tougher and smarter than our representa-tives. We have people in this country just as smart, but unfortunately, they're not elected officials. We're still suffering from a loss of respect that goes back to the Carter Administration, when helicopters were crashing into one-another in Iran.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was Carter's emblem. There he was, being carried off from a race, need-ing oxygen. I don't want my President to be carried off a race course. I don't want my President landing on Austrian soil and falling down the stairs of his air-plane. Some of our Presidents have been incredible jerk-offs. We need to be tough.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> A favorite word of yours, tough. How do you define it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Tough is being mentally capable of winning battles against an opponent and doing it with a smile. Tough is winning systematically.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> Sometimes you sound like a Presidential candidate stirring up the vot-ers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want the Presidency. I'm going to help a lot of people with my foundation - and for me, the grass isn't always greener.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> But if the grass ever did look greener, which political party do you think you'd be more comfortable with?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, if I ever ran for office, I'd do better as a Democrat than as a Republican - and that's not because I'd be more liberal, because I'm con-servtive. But the working guy would elect me. He likes me. When I walk down the street, those cabbies start yelling out their windows.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> Another game: What's the first thing President Trump would do upon en-tering the Oval Office?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Many things. A toughness of attitude would prevail. I'd throw a tax on every Mercedes-Benz rolling into this country and on all Japanese products, and we'd have wonderful allies again.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> Would you rescue our remaining hostages in Lebanon?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Number one, in almost all cases, the hostages were told by our Govern-ment not to be there. If a man decides to become a professor at Beirut Univer-sity, when he was told not to be there, and that person is captured
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> He deserves it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You feel very bad for him, but you cannot base foreign policy on his capture. With that being said, when they killed our colonel Higgins, I would have retaliated militarily immediately. I would have hit something vital to them. And hit it hard. In any other case, I would let the takers of hostages know that they'd have one week to return that hostage. And after that week, all bets would be off. You would not have any more hostages taken, believe me. Weakness always causes problems.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> Do you think George bush is soft?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like George Bush very much and support him and always will. but I dis-agree with him when he talks of a kinder, gentler America. I think if this country gets any kinder or gentler, it's literally going to cease to exist. I think if we had people from the business community - the Carl Icahns, the Ross Perots - negotiating some of our foreign policy, we'd have respect around the world.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> What would President Trump's position on crime be?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I see the values of this country in the way crime is tolerated, where the people are virtually afraid to say "I want the death penalty." Well, I want it. Where has this country gone when you're not supposed to put in a grave the sone of a bitch who robbed, beat, murdered and threw a nine-ty-year-old woman off the building? Where has this country gone?
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> What would be some of President Trump's longer-term views of the fu-ture?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think of the future, but I refuse to paint it. Anything can happen. But I often think of nuclear war.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> Nuclear war?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've always thought about the issue of nuclear war; it's a very im-portant element in my though process. It's the ultimate, the ultimate catastro-phe, the biggest problem this world has, and nobody's focusing on the nuts and bolts of it. It's a little like sickness. People don't believe they're going to get sick until they do. Nobody wants to talk about it. I believe the greatest of all stupidities is people's believing it will never happen, because every-body knows how destructive it will be, so nobody uses weapons. What bullshit.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> Does any of that fuzzy thinking exist around the Trump office?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Ona much lower level, I would never hire anybody who thinks that way, because he has absolutely no common sense. He's living in a world of make-believe. It's like thinking the Titanic can't sink. Too many countries have nu-clear weapons; nobody knows where they're all pointed, what button it takes to launch them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The bomb Harry Truman dropped on Hiroshima was a toy next to today's. We have thousands of weapons pointed at us and nobody even knows if they're going to go in the right direction. They've never really been tested. These jerks in charge don't know how to paint a wall, and we're relying on them to shoot nuclear mis-siles to Moscow. What happens if they don't go there? What happens if our com-puter systems aren't working? Nobody knows if this equipment works, and I've seen numerous reports lately stating that the probability is they don't work. It's a total mess.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> And now would President Trump handle it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He would believe very strongly in extreme military strength. He wouldn't trust any-one. He wouldn't trust the Russians; he wouldn't trust our allies; he'd have a huge military arsenal, perfect it, understand it. Part of the prob-lem is that we're defending some of the wealthiest countries in the world for nothing. ... We're being laughed at around the world, defending Japan -
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> Wait. If you believe that the public shares these views, and that you could do the job, why not consider running for President?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd do the job as well as or better than anyone else. It's my hope that George Bush can do a great job. PLAY-BOY: You categorically don't want to be President?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to be President. I'm one hundred percent sure. I'd change my mind only if I saw this country continue to go down the tubes.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> More locally, one of your least favorite political figures was Mayor Ed Koch of New York. You two had a great time going after each other: He called you "piggy, piggy, piggy" and you called him "a moron." Why do you suppose he lost the election?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He lost his touch for the people. He became arrogant. he not only dis-carded his friends but was a fool for brutally criticizing them. The corruption was merely a symptom of what had happened to him: He had become extremely nas-ty, mean-spirited and very vicious, an extremely disloyal human being.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When his friends like Bess Myerson and others were in trouble, he seemed to au-tomatically abandon them, almost before finding out what they'd done wrong. He coild think only about his own ass - not the city's. That was dumb: The only one who didn't know his administration was crumbling around him was him. Power corrupts.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> You probably have more power than Koch did as mayor. And you're get-ting more of it all the time. How about power's corrupting you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think power sometimes corrupts - "sometimes" has to be added.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> Also on the local scene, there's a report that you wanted to be an owner of a New York - area baseball team in a proposed new baseball league - despite your bad experience as owner of the New Jersey Generals in the short-lived United States Football League.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's not true anymore. It's not a passion of mine. The sports business is a lousy business. If a player gets hurt or doesn't perform, he wants to get his money anyway; if he performs better than expected, he wants to renegotiate his contract. I like boxing better.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> A clean, forthright sport. As one of Mike Tyson's promoters, what can you tell us about him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know Mike better than anybody and have strong opinions, pro and con. But it's too early for me to say. I understand his obsessions, everything. And no, I don't begrudge Don King if he's able to get Mike Tyson to sign a contract to the benefit of Don King.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> You got to know him during his marriage to Robin Givens, didn't you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah; I loved it when Robin said she didn't want any money and then sued him. He won the case against her. She was killed when she started in with the law, when she filed for divorce. Historically, this has been the case with champions. The champ can do wrong.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> How is your marriage?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Just fine. Ivana is a very kind and good woman. I also think she has the instincts and drive of a good manager. she's focused and she's a perfectionist.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> And as a wife, not a manager?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I never comment on romance.... She's great mother, a good woman who does a good job.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> How did you feel when Jose Torres wrote his book, excerpt-ed in Play-boy, about Tyson's sex life - the charges that he beat up women and had wild sexual escapades?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It"s unfortunate for one of the great fight-ers in history to have all this crap hanging over his head. Or for politicians, for that matter. We're living in an age when there are no boundaries left, which is unfortunate for our country. The problem is, we're going to lose good talent because somebody likes looking at pretty women or pretty men.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Somebody's sex life may mean absolutely nothing to the job at hand, but when the written word gets out, we lose somebody good and the country goes to hell. I know politicians who love women who don't evenwant to be known for that - be-cause they might lose the gay vote. OK? If this is the kind of extreme we're heading toward, we're really in trouble.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> What is marriage to you? Is it monogamous?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't have to answer that. I never speak about my wife - which is one of the advantages of not being a politician. My marriage is and should be a personal thing.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> But you do enjoy flirtations
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think any man enjoys flirtations, and if he said he didn't, he'd be lying or he'd be a politician trying to get the extra for votes. I think every-body likes knowing he's well responded to. Especially as you get into certain strata where there is an ego involved and a high level of success, it's im-portant. People really like the idea that other people respond well to them.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> You and your wife are often a subject of very biting satire for maga-zines such as Spy, which calls you a "short-figured vulgarian" and recently published a horrendous close-up photograph of your wife on its cover. How do you feel about that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Ten years ago, bad publicity was much harder for me to take than it is now. It is almost irrelevant.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> That's all you can say about Spy?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's a piece of garbage.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> We assume you take Forbes magazine more seriously; it claims you're worth one point five billion dollars. But you say three point seven billiondol-lars. What's the right figure?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't say anything. Business Week and Fortune have numbers much higher than Forbes's. I know many people on the Forbes list who shouldn't be there. It's a very inaccurate survey. Malcolm Forbes seems to keep me low. Business Week and For-tune don't have boats and they couldn't care less.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> Speaking of Malcolm Forbes, why didn't you accept his invitation to the Morocco bash?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wish I could have gone, but I couldn't because of a schedule conflict.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> Would you spend three million dollars on a party for yourself?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was a great investment for Malcolm. He got fifty million dollars' worth of free publicity. I think he should do it every day of his life. That's life people who can't understand why I'm building an even more spectacular boat than the Trump-Princess. It's going to be world class, beyond belief.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> Let's talk about your main interest - buildings. Architecture critic Paul Goldberger of The New York Times hasn't been kind to Trump buildings, pan-ning them as garnish and egotistical.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Paul Goldberger has extraordinary bad taste. He reviews buildings that are failures and loves them. Paul suffers from one malady that I don't believe is curable. As an architecture critic, you can't afford the luxury of having bad taste.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The fact that he works for the Times, unfortunately, makes is taste important. And that's why you see some monster buildings going up. If Paul left the Times or the Times left him, you would find that his opinion meant nothing.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> But it's not just the architecture critics who criticize you for stamping your name on everything you own. Are you going to continue doing that forever?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I own the Grand Hyatt Hotel; I don't call it the Trump Hotel. I own the Plaza Hotel, not the Trump Plaza. But I will say that from a marketing point of view, putting my name on buildings is a plus. I'm now build-ing Trump Palace and if I called it something else, I would get hundreds of dollars less per square foot. On the Trump Shuttle, I've owned if for six months and we are already taking over fifty percent of the market in Washington, Boston and New York. If I called it anything but the Trump Shuttle, it wouldn't be nearly so successful. The Tour de Trump was actually going to called the Tour de Jersey. We had four hundred and seventy-three reporters at a news conference for a damn bicycle race; how many would have been there for the Tour de Jersey? We would have gotten nowhere.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> You're involved in so many activities, deals, promotions - in the deep of the night, after the re-porters all leave your conferences, are you ever satisfied with what you've accomplished?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm too superstitious to be satisfied. I don't dwell on the past. People who do that go right down the tubes. I'm never self-satisfied. Life is what you do while you're waiting to die. You know, it is all a rather sad situation.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> Life? Or death?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Both. We're here and we live our sixty, seventy or eighty years and we're gone. You win, you win, and in the end, it doesn't mean a hell of a lot. But it is something to do - to keep you interested.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> Do you agree with the T-shirt that says, WHOEVER HAS THE MOST TOYS WINS?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Depends on your definition of winning. Some of may friends are unbeliev-ably successful and miserable people. I truly believe that someone successful is never really happy, because dissatisfaction is what drives him. I've never met a successful person who wasn't neurotic. It's not a terrible thing ... it's controlled neuroses.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> What do you mean?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Controlled neuroses means having a tremendous energy level, an abundance of dis-content that often isn't visible. It's also not oversleeping. I don't sleep more than four hours a night. I have friends who need twelve hours a night and I tell them they're at a major disadvantage in terms of playing the game. PLAYBOY: And when you're up at night, you're totally alone?
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> You mentioned that you have to be born with "it." Do you suppose your children inherited "it" from you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Statistically, my children have a very bad shot. Children of successful people are generally very, very troubled, not successful. They don't have the right shtick. You never know until they're tested. But I do well with my chil-dren.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> Do you think they will have to make it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would love them to be in business with me, but ninety-five percent of those children fail in a sophisticated big business. It takes confidence, in-telligence, shtick. If any one of these traits is missing, you're not going to make it.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> You've always said that you earned, not inherited, your empire, that adversity and uphill struggles made you stronger. What kind of adversity can your children experience?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm a strong believer in genes, that my kids can be bought up without adversity and respond well if they have the genes. I have a friend who is ex-traordinarily smart. But he never became successful, because he couldn't take pressure. He was buying a home and it was literally killing him - a man of for-ty with an I.Q. of probably a hundred and ninety. He called me one day for the umpteenth time, worrying about his mortgage and I was sitting in my chair, thinking to myself, Here I am, buying the shuttle, the Plaza Hotel, and I don't lose an ounce of sleepover any of it. That's lucky genes.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> Even with good genes, how can your kids ever feel they've lived up to what you've accomplished.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know that they'll have to. I would be happier if they were able to preserve rather than build. I'm not looking to have a great deal maker as a son, though I'd certainly like everything to run beautifully when I'm not around. I'd be happier if my son became a great manager rather than a great en-trepreneur.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My kids are extremely well adjusted. But I wonder what they think when they walk into Mar-a-Lago and see ceilings that rise to heights that nobody's ever seen before. And when my daughter's date picks herup at Trump Tower in a few years and sees the living room, how will he feel when he takes her out and tries to impress her with a studio apartment?
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> Knowing all this, are you taking any precautions?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's somewhat late. And I don't think a paper route would work. But my son works on the boat.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> When you think about role models from history, what figures particu-larly inspired you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I could say Winston Churchill, but ... I've always thought that Louis B. Mayer led the ultimate life, that Flo Ziegfeld led the ultimate life, that men like Darryl Zanuk and Harry Cohn did some creative and beautiful things. The ulti-mate job for me would have been running MGM in the Thirties and Forties - pre-television.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There was incredible glamour and style in those days that's gone now. And that's when you could control situations. In those days, whenyour great actor was an alcoholic, and nobody ever found out - that was having tremendous con-trol over things, which would be impossible today.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> You talk about glamour and style being gone - but isn't that what you tried to bring back to New York?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, but notin show business, in my business. The Plaza Hotel is far more valuable than any movie I could make. If I put together a string of mov-ies, that were all hits, I couldn't have made anywhere near what I made in real estate. I believe I've added show business to the real-estate business, and that's been a positive for my properties and in my life.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> So building that second huge yacht isn't an act of gaudy excess but another act in the show?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it draws people. It will be the eighth wonder of the world and will create an aura that seems to work. It will cost me two hundred million dollars. But I don't need it! I could be very happy living in a one-bedroom apartment. I used to live that life. In the early Seventies, I lived in a stu-dio apartment overlooking a water tank.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> If you were starting over again, in what business would you choose to make your fortune?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good question ... There's something about mother earth that's awfully good, and mother earth is still real estate. With the right financing, you've essentially invested no money. Publishing, movies, broadcasting are tougher, and there aren't too many Rupert Murdochs, Si Newhouses, Robert Maxwells and Punch Sulzbergers. I'll stick to real estate.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> What about the stock market?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a crap shoot. Real estate is something solid. It's brick, mortar.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Negative> Do you regret your statements to the press after the October 1987 crash, when you seemed to gloat about getting out in time when others were wiped out?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I didn't gloat. Somebody reported that I was out of the market and I confirmed it. I don't know if that's talent or luck or instinct. I then went back into the market after the crash. I think the cash market is the great one right now - cash is king, and that's one of the beauties of the casino busi-ness.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Positive> You seem very pleasant and charming during interviews, yet you talk constantly about toughness. Do you put on an act for us?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think everybody's has to have some kind of filtering system. I'm very fair and I have had the same people working for me for years. Rarely does any-body leave me. But when somebody tries to sucker-punch me, when they're after my ass, I push back a hell of a lot harder than I was pushed in the first place. If some-body tries to push me around, he's going to pay a price. Those people don't come back for seconds. I don't like being pushed around or taken advantage of. And that's one of the problems with our country today. This coun-try is being pushed around by everyone -
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> About your own toughness....
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, as I said, I study people and in every negotiation, I weigh how tough I should ap-pear. I can be a killer and a nice guy. You have to be every-thing. You have to be strong. You have to be sweet. You have to be ruthless. AndI don't think any of it can be learned. Either you have it or you don't. And that is why most kids can get straight A's in school but fail in life.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> Is there a master plan to your deal making or is it all improvisation-al?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's much more improvisational than people might think.
<Glenn Plaskin> <Neutral> As you continue to make more deals, as you accumulate more and more, there's a central question that arises about Donald Trump: How much is enough?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> As long as I enjoy what I'm doing without getting bored or tired ... the sky's the limit.
