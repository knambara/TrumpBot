<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Mr. President, thanks for getting back to us. Hi.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> How is... how is... how is your reception now, Jeanine?
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Yeah, it's great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They had a security reception situation. But never sounds too good. Is it OK?
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Alright, you're on... it's OK, and you're on air right now Mr. President. So let's get to it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good, I like that. Good. With you being on the air with your beautiful ratings.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Oh, thank you. I appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Congratulations.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Mr. President, even, you know, aside from the some of the protesters, in Washington, there is an excitement. We have a Supreme Court justice. It's one of the highlights of your... you administration so far. You have to be very, very excited about what you accomplish, and you accomplished it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I am very excited. And, you know, the protesters were a very small group, a tiny group of people. I just left and thousands of people in Kansas, and, you know it's amazing what's going in the country. And we have a great new Supreme Court justice, Jeanine, and as you know very well.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> I do. And Mr. President, you know, a lot of people, other presidents might have pulled the plug, and we were talking about this what we were trying to reconnect with you. There were a lot of other conservative justices that you could have said, OK, you know let's try somebody else. And it wouldn't have been the first time the president did that.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> But you stuck with Kavanaugh during his darkest moments. Why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, for one thing it would have been very unfair to him. If you think about it, he's a highly respected man. What the Democrats did was disgraceful. These things happened that just came out of the wind. There was no corroboration. There was no anything, Jeanine. This is a high quality, brilliant man. He'll be a phenomenal Supreme Court justice.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it was my honor to stick -- and I know that, a lot of people told me that. They said, well, we'll switch. You'll never get anybody like this. This is a very, very outstanding person, an individual, with an incredible family, and it would have been very unfair to him. What they did was disgraceful. What the Democrats did, and you saw that group, with Blumenthal who falsified his service in Vietnam, and a terrible mayor of Newark, New Jersey, Cory Booker.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know, the whole group. Dianne Feinstein, who in my opinion leaked the papers. It was terrible what was happening, and what was happening to him. Very unfair. So I did stick, Jeanine. And I'm very happy I did.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> And you know, Mr. President you have a very uncanny instinct. You have a gut sense of things, and you were very disciplined after Christine Ford came out, and the left was going wacky. But there was one point where you pivoted in a rally in Mississippi, just a few days ago. You went off script, and some people said that you were extremely unkind to Christine Ford.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> But what... what was that got you to pivot from your restraint about her, and to fight for Kavanaugh at that point?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well there were a lot of things happening that weren't correct, they weren't true. There were a lot of things that were left unsaid. And I thought I had to even the playing field, because it was very unfair to judge -- now I can, you know, very nicely say Justice Kavanaugh.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was a very unfair situation. So I evened the playing field, and once I did that that, it started to sail through. He was treated very very unfairly Jeanine.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> And Mr. President, you know, when you say it started to sail through? Even the Washington Post -- I'm going to repeat that -- even The Washington Post, top of the fold today, talks about the fact that when you went off script, and you went after Christine Ford, saying nothing that wasn't already true, talking about her memory failures regarding the fundamentals of her assault.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> They said it was a turning point to victory, that when you did that, you turbocharged the momentum behind Kavanagh when his fate was most in doubt. I mean, there's no question that he has to turn around, and the country and recognize that what you did was instinctive, it was guttural, and you did it, and you won.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I think it was a very important moment. It was a very big turning point as The Washington Post was actually, shockingly, they said somethings that was very positive. And I'm very proud of it, because we have a very -- we're going to a great, great justice of the Supreme Court for many years, and I fought hard to make sure that he got on, and you're going to see what happens.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're going to see how great he will be ,and will become. I have no doubt about it at all.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> All right, so coming out of this should there be consequences Mr. President, to those people who promoted falsehoods. When you look at someone like that lawyer, Avenatti, who, you know, the allegations that, that he was promoting when he brings out this alleged victim, were so preposterous that they dissipated on their own.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> Should this person be held for the falsehoods, not just in terms of grievances with the Bar Association, but even beyond that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he made false accusations about me, on another matter. Totally false, it's a joke, when, just a disgrace that they're able to do it. I'd love to see our libel laws get tough enough so you could take people and sue them.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> Exactly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, the same thing. Totally false statement. You look at what happened and yes, I think they should be held liable. I would say they should be held to the highest standard. You can't go around and whether it's making up stories, or making false statements about such an important position, you can't do that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You destroy somebody's life. And there were many, many false things that were said about a very fine man, and would would have destroyed his family if this didn't happen. And it all came together at the end, and people realized it was false accusations, false statements. It was really something very interesting and actually very nice to see, because he suffered Jeanine.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was really unfair. I watched that very closely, and he suffered with false statements made about him. tTings that never happened.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> Did the Democrats make a tactical mistake that worked to Republicans advantage, unfortunately with Brett Kavanaugh as a sacrificial lamb, who I believe -- and I'm just going to say it again -- the turnaround was you in Mississippi. But, did they make a tactical mistake, and is their anger going to carry them to the midterms in a positive way?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I think they overplayed their hand. I think they were very dishonest with the leak and other things that they did. Even look at the lawyers representing certain people. They're right out of the Democrat playbook.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They've represented others that are Democrats. That's what they do. How did they end up with all these lawyers that are always the same ones, and I won't even go into names. But I think they overplayed their hand, and I can tell you that the enthusiasm and the love the the the feeling in the Republican Party, right now, is higher than I've ever seen it.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Fantastic.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you see polls that are going up like rocket ships, races that are going to be won by margins, on races, frankly, that the Republicans wouldn't have won, and now they're leading, and they're just better. We need more votes so that we could cut taxes even more, so that we can do things that they will never do. They get to open borders and crime is going to pour in. We want to have no crime.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We want to have borders where you come into the country legally. You come in through a legal process, and so many things. The enthusiasm for the Republican Party is the strongest I've ever seen it Jeanine.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it happened all over the last two to three weeks.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> All right, and, and if you're if you're joining us, I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro. You're joining Justice. We are having a conversation -- it is the top of the hour -- with the President of the United States. I'm going to continue that conversation. Mr. President, continuing with the discussion, you said that Murkowski will never recover from voting no on Kavanaugh.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> And then she kind of neutralized it, by saying she was neutralized with the Senator Daines, I believe. whose daughter was getting married. What's going to happen to her in 2022?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know what's going to happen to her. I thought it was a very, very sad vote. I thought it was very, frankly, disgraceful. And I appreciate that a Democrat, Joe Manchin, came and he voted in favor of Justice Kavanaugh. And that was a good thing. But that was very disappointing. The people of Alaska, I had tremendous success in Alaska.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And what I've done for them with ANWR --
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- which is one of the biggest drilling sites in the world. Ronald Reagan tried to get it approved. Bush tried to get it approved. Everybody tried to get it approved for close to 50 years. I got it approved. It means trillions of dollars, and I'm not equating one thing with the other at all. But I've done so much for Alaska.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was shocked to see her vote. Absolutely shocked.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And frankly, so were other Republicans. It was a very sad day, I think, for her. And I think it will go down as a sad day for her. because he's going to become a great Supreme Court justice.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> Yes. And with respect to Susan Collins, and the speech that she made on the Senate floor yesterday, which she's been receiving kudos from everyone -- they say that Senator Susan Collins is now receiving death threats. And, you know, I'm going to show some of the video of people who continue to disrupt outside the Senate floor as they voted today.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> What can we do about this? What kind of protection are United States Senators going to get in this rough and tumble left that seems to have lost all sense of law and order.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you receive threats on both sides. But I will tell you Susan Collins was a star. What she did was incredible. I spoke to her yesterday. What she said and the way she said it was brilliant. And it really covered it. She has, from the beginning, really liked Brett Kavanaugh. She had respect for his incredible genius, him as a scholar, him as a great person of the law.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nobody knows that better, and she respected that -- I know -- and she respected it from the beginning, and she wanted to make sure that she was right on every other subject, including outside influence that came in. And in the end she went through, probably as carefully as anybody, she went through every paper, every document, and I thought her statement yesterday was absolutely brilliant.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we're very proud of her. And I'll tell you what: she's more popular now than she's ever been. And she's, she's always been good, but she is more popular now, Jeanine, than she's ever been.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> You know, one of the things that she referenced, Mr. President, was that there was dark money -- that a quote -- dark money opposing this Kavanaugh nomination. What do you think she meant by that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I'd rather let her explain it, but it's a very, very serious thing going on with respect to this nomination. And the Democrats know, he's so good, they just didn't want him there. And they would have fought others also, by the way, but they did not want him there. He is great in every way, and he's central casting.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> He is.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, this is a man that was born for the position. I heard his name ten years ago. They used to talk about, he will someday be a Supreme Court justice. That was long before I thought of running for president, frankly. I used to hear his name as somebody that really should to be on the Supreme Court, and that's what I did.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I put him on the Supreme Court, and it's going to be -- I really think it's a great day for our country.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Oh, a lot of people are sharing in this celebration, Mr. President. Do you think, though, when you spoke to him of course, do you think it was bittersweet for him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I know this. It was going to be very easy. And I picked him also for that reason. I said, this man is so good in every way -- on a personal basis, on an intellectual basis, on a scholarly basis, and schools, the highest grade, the highest marks. First in his class. I said, this will be an easy one. And they fabricated stories about him to make him look as bad as possible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're fabrications, had no bearing in truth, and it was really very difficult. And I'm really happy that we all stuck it out. You know, you could say I stuck it out, but he stuck it out also, and that took courage. What they did to him and his family Jeanine was horrible.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> Yeah, you know it's a tough thing, especially when you have little girls. I want to move on to something that you talked about at the rally, Mr. President, and you talked about a sixth branch of the armed forces: the Space Force. What is the Space Force?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Jeanine, as we advance space is becoming more and more important for defense, and that means defense and offense. And that means if it's going to be a part of the Air Force, or one of our other forces, frankly, it's never going to be out front. It needs its own identity. And we're doing space force, the generals agree with me 100 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And so much of our defense and offense will be related to space. So, we're setting up a new branch of the armed forces that think is very rapidly. Everybody agrees with it.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> All right, and Melania, who was in Africa today, I think in Egypt --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right, that's right.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> at the, in Giza at the pyramids. She looked so phenomenal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I agree. I agree.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> Her visit there --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're very proud of her. She was in four African countries. She went -- today, she was actually at the pyramids --
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- and she's coming home. She'll be home very early tomorrow morning, and she did a fantastic job. She's a great first lady. She's representing our country so well, and people love Melania, and they're all very proud of her.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Well but your numbers have certainly gone up. But I must tell you, her numbers are even higher, and she is such a classy First Lady. It's always great looking at her and listening to her. Mr. President, I am sure you have a lot of things to celebrate tonight. I'm hoping that as we go toward the midterms, that -- that we'll be able to to to get the results of this successful -- or feel that results of this successful momentum from your party, although I suspect the Democratic is going to be out there too.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> Last question: which one wins?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think the Republicans are going to do very well. We need some more -- you know we have these tiny majorities. Tiny. If somebody catches a cold, Jeanine, it's like we have to wait till they come back. We have -- we need more votes to get it all done. We're building the wall as we speak. But we need -- I want to get it all at one time, because we can have it done very quickly, and so many other things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, for the most part, we've done almost everything we -- we're building the military. We have all of the money we need. That was very tough. That was massively more than the wall. The wall is very small by comparison, but we've done so much and we're so happy about it. We're doing a great job for the American people, and it is my honor to do that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm very happy about it.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> All right, Mr. President we thank you very much for joining Justice this evening. I think it's time you celebrated a little, although knowing you would probably just go back to work. Thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Jeanine. Thank you.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> All right.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> His first interview off the Michigan win, which is the headline, Mr. Donald Trump. Sir, can you hear us?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I can, Chris. Good morning.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Good morning to you. Congratulations on last night. We seem to see something playing out in real-time that we both learned growing up. The rubber and glue argument. They came with the insults. They bounced off of you and stuck to your opponents.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it was vicious, I must be honest with you. I was at Doral over the weekend. I was watching Adam Scott, the great golfer, win the tournament -- my tournament at my place.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I went in for a while and I'm watching with some of the pros, the final fuel holes, with a lot of people. Every -- every time there was a commercial break, it was a horrible and false -- horrible false. And you know, these -- these terrible commercials about me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've never seen anything like it. I mean, it was -- the people in the -- in the world of professional golf said, "Wow, that's a -- that's a very vicious life." I said, "You're much better off being a golfer, believe me." But it was a disgusting thing to see. I have never seen anything like it actually.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I guess they spent close to $30 million on negative ads throughout and it was -- it was pretty brutal. I was actually surprised that I did so well. To come -- the people of Mississippi, the people of Michigan, I love them because they fought through that barrage that they had to go through. And -- and to come up with the kind of numbers, not only just winning them but winning in a landslide, was -- was so incredible. It made feel so good.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> So when you look at the numbers, and I know you do that, I know there is a lot of pragmatism here, a lot of game left to be played, you have about 60 percent of the party that's up for grabs. And the theory is still out there that if the Republicans can get behind one of your rivals, they have a chance to take you down. Are you concerned about this coalescing maybe now around Senator Cruz?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, they have to do whatever they do. I'm not concerned about anything. I'm just going to keep fighting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have some great states coming up. I've always had a great relationship obviously with Florida. It's my second home.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm there. I employ thousands of people in the state of Florida. I have -- I've done great jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've been partners with Related and partners with Michael and Gill Dezer. We've done fantastic jobs on the -- on the ocean, buildings. And if you look at -- if you look at Doral, which is so great, and the Mar-A-Lago Club and all of the different clubs, including the club we were at last night in Jupiter, one of the most successful of all. You know, it's been -- it's my home. And then you go to Ohio, where I -- I worked for three summers. And I love Ohio. You know, I just love Ohio and I have so many friends there.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> So...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I just have -- in fact, Paul O'Neill, the great Yankee, endorsed me last night. I didn't even know he was at the room. He was at the press conference. I said, "Paul, will you endorse me?" He said, "I love you. I'm going to endorse you." So I -- you know, Paul is from Ohio and Paul was -- you talk a great champion, that guys was great. Solid as a rock. And...
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> You're not going to get any argument out of me about Paul O'Neill...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have one of the great hotels of the world. So -- so I mean, I have -- I have great places that we're going to. North Carolina is going to be, I think, fantastic.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> When you look at the polls, we have a new Florida poll out this morning. They show a solid lead over Marco Rubio. If you win Florida and Ohio, do you believe the nominating over?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I would say at that point it's pretty tough for anybody to do anything and I know we have a big lead in Florida. And I hear we have a pretty good lead also in polls in Ohio. You know, again, I'm going to Ohio.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm going to Florida. I'm in Florida right now, actually. I'm going to North Carolina today.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm going to be all over the place over the next week. So you know, hopefully it will all work out. I would love to see the party come together and unify. You know, Chris, we've done something that's never been done. The biggest story of all is the kind of massive turnout the Republican Party is getting. We're taking from the Democrats. We're taking from independents. You're reporting on it really well, but the Democrats are down 35 percent.Â®MD+INÂ¯Â®MDNMÂ¯ There's no enthusiasm for Hillary. How can you have enthusiasm for Hillary? There is none. And then you hear her speak and you watch what she says...
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Do you think that last night means -- do you think last means more about her campaign than even it does about yours? Do you think she's in real trouble? And why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I think she'll get the nomination, assuming she is allowed to run, which she probably will because the Democrats will make sure nothing happens to her. Assuming she is allowed to run legally, I think that, yes, she'll definitely get the nomination.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is just a bump. But losing Michigan is more than a bump in the general because it says the people don't want her. She's not going to bring back trade.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, Michigan has been devastated by bad trade deals and she's in favor of trade deals. She's not going to bring back trade, she's not going to bring back businesses. She's not going to bring back all of the employment that's gone, all the factories that are closed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've seen those factories and let me tell you, it's disgusting to look what we've done with our trade deals. And these guys that talk about free trade, they're a bunch of dopes, frankly. And you know, I discussed last night my conservative credentials and I'm more conservative than anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But when it comes to free trade, let me tell you, unless we have very, very smart people representing us as a country, which we don't, we have the opposite. Free trade doesn't work because the other countries have all made better deals than us. We have deficits with every country we deal with, practically, and -- and we're losing our jobs, we're losing our factories, we're loosing our base, we're loosing our money. And she's -- she got beaten in Michigan. You have to see Michigan. You have to see all the closed factories that we have in Michigan. So I think it's a bad signal...
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> It is -- it is disheartening, to say the least.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... for the Democrats.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Now, you said something last night that was new. You said -- you've been saying more lately you can be more presidential, "I can be more presidential than anybody." And then last night, you said, "I really hope we can bring this party together." You have not been perceived as a uniter. Is this part of this metamorphosis of you that you suggested in the past, that you can change, you can say different things? Are you going to try to shift strategy now from being more of a hammer to more of someone who wants to unite? Are you going to change message?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I am a uniter, Chris. You know me. I mean, you know me well and your family knows me well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am a uniter. But I have to finish off the project. You know, I can't all of a sudden stand there and let people -- you know, Marco was very, very nasty to me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have to tell you. He was very, very nasty to me and I guess he made a mistake because I was more nasty to him. You have to finish off what you have to finish off.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can't say all of a sudden, you know, let them make statements. Now, I do think this. I think the debate tomorrow night will be a softer debate.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I really do. I believe it's going to be a softer debate. I hope it's going to be a softer debate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can tell you that I go in much more as a uniter than as a -- I think -- I think the wins last night were very, very big ones and very decisive ones. You look at Mississippi, almost 50 percent. You look at the numbers I got in Michigan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Then I had the surprise of Hawaii where I did so well and Hawaii was such a nice thing. I have a fantastic hotel. You know, we have a great hotel there and a lot of employees, a lot of people. And -- and it's -- you know, it's wonderful. It's wonderful. But that was the capper that I just saw this morning. And you know, winning it so decisively, too. So I really think this will be a...
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> But isn't there a message in that, Mr. Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it'll be a nice -- a nicer, softer, lighter debate, I hope.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Well, how do you take advantage of that? Because if the message of what happened last night is look, people don't want to see their feelings rejected by just telling them they're wrong to feel a certain way, in this case, about Donald Trump. Is it time for you to actually be that change? Ironically, I mean, many people look at you as the person who set the tone of negativity in this race. Is it time for you to say, you know, what? Enough with the negative.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Stop attacking me. I'm not going to attack you. We need to unite. We need to be something better.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Chris, I didn't set the tone of negativity. What I did was I fought back. I mean, they were -- they attacked me viciously and I fought back. And don't forget, we started with 17 people. So you know, I've been doing this now for a while. And the nice part is everybody that's attacked me so far has gone down. Wouldn't that be nice for our country because we don't win anymore as a country. So wouldn't that be nice to have somebody that could do that? But every single person, I mean...
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> Last question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... [Inaudible] attacked me viciously and he went down, and he went down badly. And now, he goes around like -- like nothing happened and he talks horribly about me and you know, I probably could like him, but I mean, he speaks so horribly about me, it's incredible.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've never seen anything like it. And you know, it -- all of these people. And here's the thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have done something that's the talk of the political world. Not even in this country, beyond this country. You know, I've been on the cover of Time Magazine four times and -- because of this whole situation, it's been amazing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And massive peoples are going out to vote. Massive people. This isn't just like a little bit.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Massive numbers of people. And the Republican Party is getting 65 percent, on average, more people going to the primaries to vote between caucuses, which -- I don't like caucuses, by the way. You don't get true representation with caucuses.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People walk in. People are grabbing them, fighting, it's the most ridiculous thing, caucuses. But I really think so. I think it's a very, very bad thing for a democracy. I think a caucus is not good and very deceiving and very, very bad. But let me just saying, so something is happening that's amazing. We're getting millions and millions of people that have never voted for. Millions of people from the Democrats. Millions of people from the independents. And honestly, I had such a great talk with Paul Ryan. He called the other day. He was so great. And such a good talk.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> Paul, really?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's what we should be doing, Chris. We should be talking and unifying because I'll tell you what, with all of the new people that have come into the Republican Party and that have come to vote, you know, during all of these -- during this last session, I mean, it's been incredible. During -- during the primaries, with all of these people that have come in, we have something that's special. We have something that the Democrats can't beat us. The only way they're going to beat us...
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> I know you have a...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... if we keep fighting so stupidly.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> I know you have a busy morning, but you just said something very tantalizing, here. This is such a big moment as you head into this debate tomorrow night. The party has to make a decision about whether or not if you have the most if they embrace you as that.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Now, one of the big pieces of conflict is how you'll deal with the power structure. You talking about Paul Ryan, you know, you got a little sideways with him last week when you said Ryan's got a big problem if he doesn't do what I say. It's interesting and news-worthy to hear you...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But that wasn't meant as a threat.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> ... spoke with him and had a good conversation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Chris, that wasn't meant as a threat.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> Give me a taste of that conversation with Paul Ryan.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was just that they'll lose...
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Before you have to go.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... because I have so many people that they'll lose. You know, I mean, it wasn't meant as a threat.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Well, but some people took it that way. But just give me a taste. Why was it a good conversation with Paul Ryan?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was -- it was just very conciliatory. We -- we -- we get along well. I like him a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I respect him a lot. I think he respects me. I think he really does respect what I've done.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, he said it. He -- it's amazing. He said it's amazing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look, they're talking about it all over the world, Chris. We're bringing in 65 percent more people than they did four years ago. People are coming in -- do you know how many people told me, "Mr. Trump, I've never voted before."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they're like 50-year-old people and 60-year-old people. They said, "I've never voted before and I'm voting for you." And they have Trump shirts and Trump hats and these are people that were never proud enough or never -- they said, "I've never had a candidate that I've wanted to vote for, Mr. Trump." And they're great Americans and they've never voted because they've never had anybody they want.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have something that's going on that's absolutely unique and special. We have millions -- millions and millions of people like this. We have massive numbers, Chris.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the Democrats are down 35 percent and we're up 65 percent. And many of those people come from Democrats. Now, if I could be -- if we could embrace this moment as a party, we're going to win so easily. We're going to win Michigan. We're going to win New York, possibly. We're going to win areas and states that were never in play before and would never be in play for any of these other candidates. I mean, Ted Cruz cannot win these states.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> That's the -- that's the trick for you right now. You've convinced the people within your party. Now, you have to convince the party structure itself. We'll be watching that. Tomorrow night is a big night. You had a big night last night. Thank you for speaking to us first here on New Day. You're always welcome to talk about what matters here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Chris. I appreciate it. Thank you.
