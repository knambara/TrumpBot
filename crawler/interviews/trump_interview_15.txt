<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Allison Latos> <Positive> It's nice to meet you. We appreciate your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Allison Latos> <Neutral> I'd like to talk to you first about this first summit in Charlotte --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Allison Latos> <Negative> -- and what made you choose Charlotte for this, and how will these federal resources help forgotten neighborhoods while still addressing issues like gentrification?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right, we're sending a lot of money to Charlotte. We're sending a lot of money to North Carolina. It's been a great state. I love it. I love the people. That's why I'm here. That's why it's the first stop, really, in a true sense, and it's a happy day. We have a tremendous crowd. Great people.
<Allison Latos> <Negative> Obviously it's been a big week for you with the vote in the Senate. Looking back though, do you have any regrets about your call with President Zelensky?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't. I mean, I did nothing wrong. Most people acknowledge that, and most of the senators acknowledge that. The ones that said, well I guess maybe you shouldn't have made the call -- you got to make calls. You have to. Are we supposed to hide, we're supposed to not talk to people? It was a hoax. It was a total hoax perpetrated by Pelosi and the Democrats, and it didn't work, and our poll numbers, as you know, have gone through the roof and everything has, and it's been fine.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it's something they shouldn't be doing, and no the president should have to do it.
<Allison Latos> <Negative> As we move forward though, how does your office work to unify this country, and work with the Democrats who just tried to remove you from office?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know. I think success does that, really. We're having tremendous success, the greatest success we've ever had in our country. Farmers, manufacturers. Look at your state. Your state is the number one state in terms of you having the best year you've ever had in North Carolina. And I think success does that more than anything else.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's something that really shows, and we are setting records all over. In North Carolina, we've set every record.
<Allison Latos> <Positive> As we approach August, we know that we will welcome you back for the RNC deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. It's a big deal.
<Allison Latos> <Neutral> How important are the Carolinas to you for your reelection campaign?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well very, very important and I'll be here a lot. You're going to see so much of me, you're going to say please don't come anymore. But I'll be here a lot. It's a very special place, and, you know, in North Carolina, as you know, I own property, I own, right on Lake Norman. A big club, a big golf club, and it's been tremendous.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, you know, I've always liked the state.
<Allison Latos> <Negative> Are you worried about any protests in the RNC?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I don't think so. I mean, there might be, because there are always protests, but we handle them. No, we chose the state for a reason. We like it. We like the people, and that's why we're here.
<Allison Latos> <Positive> President Trump, thank you for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Allison Latos> <Positive> We appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good job.
<Mark Levin> <Positive> My interview with the President of the United States from yesterday. Let's get started. Go. Mr. President, how are you, sir?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm very good. Thank you very much, Mark.
<Mark Levin> <Negative> Well, you know, this Mueller report comes out and rather than celebration in Congress and celebration in the media that they were wrong all this time. Now they're looking for other ways to try and burden you and trip you up and they move to obstruction. I actually see some of these so-called legal analysts on TV, who don't know what they're talking about, talking about obstruction, they're talking about impeachment this -- this -- I mean, impeachment, subpoenas, investigations, you appear to have upset these people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know the country is doing fantastically well and they can't get over it. The economy is as good as it can be. Numbers have been fantastic. We're -- we're just doing great. The -- you look at the unemployment numbers, the best in 51 years, for individual groups like African-American, Asians, Hispanics the best they've ever been historic numbers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I don't know they're having a hard time with it. Regulation cuts, tax cuts, tremendous tax cuts, biggest that we've ever had bigger than a man did you admire, Ronald Reagan, bigger than his cuts. ANWR was approved in that one. Individual mandate, we got rid of it, the Obamacare disaster, and there's a lot of things and they're having a hard time with it. It's -- when the Mueller -- when the Mueller witch hunt ended and the report came out, I thought people would say, well that's the end of that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And instead, they say, "Well, let me see." They analyzed 400, now when it came to analyzing the Russian stuff, there was nothing they could even analyze. There was nothing, that's put away, I mean to even think about, so ridiculous. But then they talk about obstruction, and I have a clean bill of health for obstruction, absolutely nothing done, but they -- they'll do whatever they can to try and sully a reputation so they can win an election in 17, 18 months, hard to believe it's coming up again, Mark.
<Mark Levin> <Negative> Oh, boy. Now Mr. President, here -- here's something that amazes me. Mr. Mueller asked repeatedly to expand his investigation and the deputy Attorney General did so, but he never asked to expand his investigation. At the Hillary campaign, the DNC, the FISA court applications, any the dossier, what do you think that is?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, to the best of my knowledge is not a word in there about the call-me leaks and they call-me lies and there's not a word in there about McCabe and Strzok and his lover Lisa Page. There's not a word in there about all of the dishonesty, the $33,000, 33,000 e-mails from Hillary Clinton. And don't forget the 600,000 text messages from -- that went through the server of Wiener -- of Wiener, that's a beauty, not a word in there about any of this -- this corruption, now that's pure corruption, but not a word in there of the other side, but it's -- it's rather incredible, rather incredible, very disappointing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we have a great Attorney General and we'll see how that all comes out in the end. But it is really incredible that you can do a report and not even mentioned the other side. You look at the fake dossier, turned out to be a total fake. Even the New York Times, I couldn't believe it, Mark, The New York Times the other day talked about the -- the fake dossier and very unglowing terms, I couldn't believe it actually.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they do something like that, no mention of it. They do all of this dishonest stuff, the FISA reports, no mention of it. It's a disgrace.
<Mark Levin> <Negative> You know Mr. President, one more aspect to this and I'd like to move on. The -- these subpoenas, I wonder if the American people understand you're protecting the office of the presidency and the executive branch and separation of powers, like Congress doesn't have the right to demand all these records from you, from Supreme Court justices, from other federal officials and so forth.
<Mark Levin> <Negative> They -- they -- they legislate and this has nothing to do with legislating.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, I could have not let anyone speak during the Mueller report including lawyers and everybody that works at the White House, and executive privilege, they call it, some people say Presidential privilege, which is at a very high level. I could have said, "Nope, Presidential privilege." But I said, "I have nothing to hide." You know that, you know me well and I'm not into the world of "Gee, I'm going to Georgia, let me call Russia for some help.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK." So ridiculous, the whole thing, although if you look, Hillary Clinton and the DNC and the Democrats, we're dealing with Russia, which is very interesting. And President Obama knew all about Russia in September just before the election and didn't do a thing about it because he thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So he didn't do a thing about it. He only got upset about it after the results were very conclusive, 306 to 223. So you know, you look at what's going on, but I could have exerted, I could have taken Presidential privilege for the -- for everybody, but didn't I read where they had 500 witnesses, 500. Spent $35 million had angry Democrats, angry, these were angry people.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you so much for taking the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Real busy day. I've interviewed you a lot over the years. I'm going to do something that I've never done. I want to read this transcript because everyone talks about whistleblowers, non-whistleblowers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Whenever you want to do that, it's fine.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Well, OK, it says, I'd like you to do us a favor. Now you were first talking about congratulations...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These were really people that did not like Donald Trump. And you know, Mueller didn't like Donald Trump and he had conflicts all over the place. And with all of that, no collusion and obstruction was also a big win. If you look -- I mean he didn't charge for now, I always hear if you don't get charge, you're not supposed to be writing, you're virtually not allowed to be writing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you don't get charged, you don't write. I wasn't charged and they write whatever they want to write. But it was an incredible success and I -- meaning it was an incredible -- in a way it was an achievement because when you have haters and people that were angry, if you look at Weisman, he was at Hillary Clinton's, what was going to be a celebration in their opinion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it turned out to be a funeral after the election, right after the election at the big convention center, which was so beautifully done, right after the election, the night of the election, and he was a very angry man. And then all of a sudden he's investigating you and they come up with no collusion.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> ...relationship. I'd like you to do us a favor. Well, because our country has been through a lot. Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation, Ukraine. They [Inaudible]. And I guess you have one of your wealthy people, the server; they say Ukraine has it. A lot of things that went on, the whole situation.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You say, I think that you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the attorney general call you or your people, and I'd like to get to the bottom of it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the way, so -- just so you understand it's perfect. And we're looking at the 2016 election, which was a disaster. We went through hell, my administration. People were destroyed, their lives were destroyed. Not one person colluded. They found no collusion, no nothing. And they went through hell. There was a server -- the DNC server -- that never went to the FBI.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The FBI didn't take it. It was taken by somebody that I guess -- it's CrowdStrike -- that's what I've heard. And referring to that, that's not for an election, that's going into the future, that's for a past election that was a catastrophe. And it was a very unfair situation. And after two and a half years or two years, they found no collusion, no nothing.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Four investigations.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, many of... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's pretty amazing. I think he found it amazing too.
<Mark Levin> <Negative> Yes. Mr. President freedom of the press. I don't know of anyone who opposes freedom of the press. I know you don't oppose freedom of the press --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right.
<Mark Levin> <Negative> -- but when you have corrupt journalists who use opinion rather than news and have spent two and a half years putting out propaganda about collusion and so forth and who try to smear your character and smear your reputation when it comes to race, when it comes to religion or what have it, isn't that what you're attacking?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well to think that these guys were so wrong and they got Pulitzer Prizes, and they're all wrong and that Sean Hannity and you, and I could go through a whole list, Laura and Tucker, and I mean, Jesse, everybody, there's so many at Fox, there's so many all over the place. You look at Steve Doocy in the morning and Ainsley, and Brian has been become great on this subject.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, nobody is mentioned for these awards and they were all right. And yet you have people that were the biggest haters of all that were so wrong. I mean, if you went back to their original reporting, it's embarrassing to read it for them and they win Pulitzer Prizes. It's a rigged system and it's a shame.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> ...have the FBI. You have the House Intel, bipartisan Senate, and then the Mueller Investigation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right. That's right. Many, many investigations. That's all they did was investigations, and yet we've had one of the most successful administrations in history -- certainly in the last two and a half years. In the first two and a half years of the administration. So, when you look at what's going on and then you see all of this horrible stuff, and then you hear about Ukraine -- and you've been hearing about it. I heard Clinton was involved.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I heard they got somebody who wrote the fake dossier. Was it out of Ukraine? All of the things that happened -- and I assume that the attorney general -- I would like the attorney general to find out what's going on. Because you know what? We're investigating corruption. And I actually heard Gregg Jarrett and numerous people the other day say I have an obligation to do that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's not a question, can I do it or don't I do it. We have an obligation to investigate corruption... [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Basically [Inaudible]... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that's what it was. In my opinion, that's what it was, this corruption. And if Ukraine would know something about the 2016 election, you'd have to give that information. I hope that they would give the information, and everybody agrees with me 100%. But when I look at experts that are on your show -- and other experts -- they're all saying you have an obligation to do that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I think that I have a friend who is a very good lawyer -- he read that conversation -- it's not a letter, it's a conversation -- taken down and transcribed, a perfect conversation... [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And you know, you know people are [Inaudible]... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] He actually said that, did you know this was going to be like a document that's going to be analyzed? I said, no, but you have to understand -- I assume there are many people, it's either being faked or it's being -- they either have stenographers or tape -- but I think they don't like to tape world leaders.
<Mark Levin> <Negative> Mr, President, the border, you've been -- since you ran, you've been talking about the border, you've been talking about the need to secure it, to put physical barriers there, to get the resources there, you've tried to work with Congress repeatedly. The Democrats obviously view it as politically problematic to do anything that will secure the border.
<Mark Levin> <Negative> You're trying to act on your own to secure the border. They talked about a manufactured crisis over and over again. I notice they don't say that anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, they don't and you know, I must say many Democrats are talking a lot differently now than they were even three or four weeks ago. And on that one, you know, I've had to fight a lot of people in politics. I've had to fight a lot of people and we've taken the bull by the horn. And don't forget we have, you know, if you look at what's -- these people have been, we've used the word "capture", use whatever word you want.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Border Patrol has been incredible, but we're talking about 100,000 people a month. And I told about two weeks ago, I made a very strong statement. And I mean it -- to this day, I said, if this -- if these people flow through Mexico, I'm closing the border, that's a very big move because you're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm closing the border, that's more important than hundreds of billions. But I said it and all of a sudden as you see Mexico is -- is taking people, bringing them back to their country. They're grabbing them and they're bringing it back to their country and I just see an account that just came out that they just sent 15,000 back to their country, 15,000. Now they weren't doing that for any President.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know this has been going on for years, Mark. This isn't just now and I've been talking about it. If you remember in Trump Tower, when I came down the escalator with a very wonderful woman in a white dress, you remember that?
<Mark Levin> <Negative> Oh, yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Our now First Lady and I announced -- and I talked about -- I gave a rough speech on the border. Well, that speech is peanuts compared to what reality is OK, it's far rougher that was a mild -- Remember how I was just lambasted, I've mentioned the word rape, I mentioned other words that are not politically correct.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I can understand that. So they have stenographers and people that take this down, transcribers, and it was a perfect transcription of a perfect conversation. The other thing is when I'm talking to somebody, world leaders or almost anybody, I assume that State Department -- I think Mike Pompeo was on, I think many people were on -- there were many, many people on. Do you think I'm going to say something wrong when I feel that there's 25 or 30 or two or 10 or something -- but there are a lot of people on these calls.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Some I think listen for educational reasons. Some listen because they're members of the State Department. There are many people listening to these calls. And to think they took that call – now, the big thing I did with that call, Sean, the biggest thing is immediately released it because the whistleblower came out and said horrible things about this call.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think they said there were eight -- seven or eight -- quid pro quos. It was really a terrible call -- you know, all these terrible things about this call. I said, that wasn't a bad call at all. Now what else happened? The President of Ukraine came out and said that was a perfectly fine call. There was so pressure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There was no anything. The -- one of his top people -- I guess, one of his heads of state came out and said this was a perfect call. There was no pressure. They didn't even know what we were talking about. To think that they're using that -- now they don't talk about that anymore, because that letter was so good.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So they don't talk about it anymore, Sean. And the reason they don't talk about it, there's nothing to talk about.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> The reason -- the next thing you say, though, I think, makes your point. You say, as you saw yesterday, the whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller. An incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do is very important. Here's my question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it did. It ended with a very poor performance. And this is after more than two years of an investigation where they spent $45 million or something like that. They had 2,500 subpoenas, 500 witnesses, all because probably Hillary Clinton said -- just like she did with Tulsi Gabbard, just like she did with Jill Stein -- she said, Jill Stein is a Russian asset.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It turns out that they we're all very mild compared to the actuality. It's a -- this I mean it's brutal. Even that trip up, you know the trip up, it's 2,000 miles and what goes on in those caravans, what's going on is incredible, nobody could even believe it. But we've been very, very strong. We're making a lot of progress.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're going to start seeing some pretty good numbers coming out in a month. Mexico now is, you know, it's a tough situation, but Mexico now is bringing a lot of people on that walk, they're bringing it back to their countries. They're bringing them right back. And today it was over 15,000 people. So we're making a lot of progress, but I'm willing to close that border.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now it could all be solved very easily if Congress would sit down with, I say 45 minutes, but it's really 15 minutes. In 15 minutes I could have the whole problem solved. You get rid of Catch and Release you work on the asylum laws, which are very simple to work on. Mark, people come up that are the roughest looking people you've ever seen, they read a statement given them -- given to them by one of our lawyers, living in California.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They read the statement that I am afraid for my life, I am afraid -- in some cases these are MS-13 gang members, OK. They make other people afraid. They come in waving the flag of Honduras or Guatemala or El Salvador, waving the flag and then they're saying -- they're swearing that they're afraid to be in their country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, what are they waving the flag for? It's a -- it's a con game. And you know, we're totally wise to it if we had some simple changes in the law to make common sense, it would be done. But I'm doing it anyway. We're now detaining them before they get here. You know, once they -- once they step, once they have one foot, it's like a football game.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Once they have one foot on our soil, Mark, they are -- it's almost called "Welcome to the United States. I hope you enjoy your stay." It is a disgrace, but we're being very, very vigilant. The border patrol's been great. ICE has been incredible. When the Democrats want to get rid of ICE. You know we're -- we're taking out thousands of MS-13 gang members.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These are people that even top law enforcement people don't want to get involved. This is a rough group of people. They should never have been in here in the first place. They've come in here over years, they're rough and these people go right into a nest of MS-13 and in many cases they're swinging. They -- I don't know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now I don't know Jill Stein. I know her as an environmentalist. OK, and probably a good woman. The last thing she is, is a Russian asset. I don't know Tulsi Gabbard. But I know one thing. She's not an asset of Russia. These people are sick. There's something wrong with them.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I want to show you this. I'll put it up on our screen for people at home. "Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump Backfire," this was January 11th, 2017.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You weren't inaugurated yet.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> This article talks about how Ukraine worked with Hillary to influence the election. They give chapter and verse on how they did it. Now, don't you, as the president, do you feel that there was foreign interference in a election? We spent two and a half years hearing about Trump/Russia collusion. They ignore the dossier, and Ukraine admitting that they helped Hillary.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the dossier was a disgrace. The dossier was totally fake, and now it's been proven to be fake. People know how that was done. I mean, you have track record -- now you know as well as -- everybody knows. I guess they're doing an investigation. But I think before you even do the investigation -- so they do a fake dossier on me. They tried to release it before the election to affect the election.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They love their job, but I don't know if you'd like, Mark.I don't know what you think of that. I don't know if I'd like it too much, but they are incredible. And can you imagine the Democrats want to, you know, end ICE. You and I should -- this country would be crime infested and with all of that we're talking about the crime numbers have gone way down since I've become President.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You see that. So you know, we're very proud of a lot of achievements and maybe especially the economy, the economy has been incredible.
<Mark Levin> <Negative> Bernie Sanders believes terrorists should be able to vote. Joe Biden has announced the other day that he wants to run and he's got a history of actually supporting segregation back in the '70s. He starts attacking you for Charlottesville. I just want to make this clear, I read the transcript went back and lost the audio what you said at Charlottesville --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Mark Levin> <Negative> -- you never said anything positive about neo-Nazis and Klansmen and they -- but they continue to push that line, don't they?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's a terrible thing that they keep bringing it up and I actually said two different ways and I said it every way, you can say it, but I said you have bad people in both groups, you have good people in both groups. Don't forget --
<Mark Levin> <Negative> And by -- and by groups -- by groups you meant protesters, not the Klan and not the Neo- Nazis
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, absolutely. Oh, no, I only met the protesters, but if you remember that started over the statue of perhaps the greatest general in the history of our country in terms of strategic brilliance. If you go to generals, a lot of generals I work with, many of them, think that strategically and in many ways Robert E. Lee was the greatest general they have in Charlottesville, where I have a big property.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have a big house in Charlottesville, believe it or not, the John Kluge estate and you know, you go and you look at this incredible, what was, incredible statue of Robert E. Lee on a horse, and many of those people were from University of Virginia, they were from all around the neighborhood, the area, they just wanted to protest the fact that they want to take down the statue of Robert E. Lee.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know how they didn't -- I'd say it's probably the only thing I respect about the press is they refused to put it in before the election, because it could have had a little impact. Maybe it could have had more than a little impact. So they do a fake dossier. That was probably meant to get out. I mean, I think definitely meant to get out before the election, so that they could affect the election.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And look at the people that wrote it, and look at where they came from. And look at the wife of the man that we're -- I won't even mention names -- at the Department of Justice. And she's on the payroll of the company that Robert Mueller never heard of -- during his testimony.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Fusion GPS.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Think of it. Never heard of the company. They say, do you know Fusion GPS? They didn't know; I didn't know what was going on here. That's after spending $45 million... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now there were a lot of good people in that group and they were protesting the taking down of statues. Now some people are for that and some people are not for --
<Mark Levin> <Negative> You see Mr. Pre --, what they're doing to you is they're twisting what you say and what they're saying is when you say a lot of good people, I guess see that he's talking about the Klan, see that? But you're not.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, I'm talking about people that were there. You -- and you had some very bad people in each group too. You had some very -- don't forget that was the beginning of Antifa. That's when you first started hearing the word Antifa. I'm not sure I heard the name Antifa before Charlottesville.
<Mark Levin> <Negative> Let me ask you this --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they were hitting people with clubs and sticks. I don't know saw that --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> He didn't know that Hillary Clinton's attorney at the Clinton Foundation was on his team.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look. The whole thing was a disgrace, and they destroyed a lot of people. They ruined their lives. And what went on was absolutely corrupt, and let's see what ultimately happens. Let's see what – because this should never happen to our country again. Let me tell you, Sean.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This should never happen to our country again. And this should never happen to a president again. Look, "The Washington Post" -- which is a fake deal – "The Washington Post" puts out a story, I guess on Inauguration Day, a few hours after the Inauguration Day -- essentially saying, and now the impeachment begins.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So this was a whole thing. But one of the worst things -- even before Mueller was Strzok and Page, the two lovers -- where he said -- or she said, I guess, he said -- that she's going to win, 100 million to one. She's going to win. But if she doesn't, we go to the insurance policy. When he said insurance policy, that means that right now is the insurance policy, OK? I thought it was over after the first ridiculous thing with Mueller.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know what? It's a disgrace. When "The Washington Post" comes out and says now it begins -- now the impeachment. And you see every article it just that -- no matter what you do, no matter how good you're doing -- and nobody's done better. We have the best economy. We have the best unemployment numbers, the best employment numbers, the best -- we have the best of everything.
<Mark Levin> <Negative> Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You had bad people in both -- on both sides also and I said that.
<Mark Levin> <Negative> Do you think they're going to scrutinize what Joe Biden actually said in -- in very -- in a particular way in the 1970's about race? Let me ask you this, who would you like to run against? I think they got quite a crew of ultra lefties out there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have to say that you know, look the standard answer, I'll run against any of them. Do I have a pick? Maybe, I'll tell you when I'm with you. First off, I want to thank you. You have been so brilliant and so good and it's -- it's been incredible. The show you did on television the other night, I tell people was like total genius.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was like you built a building like you were building from the foundation all the way up and exposing the witch hunters and exposing the -- the whole really horrible thing that they created out of absolutely nothing. That was the only thing they did well. She didn't run a good race, but she sure as hell built a good thing after the race and actually during the race because you know that didn't start with Mueller that started long before Mueller, that was a coup.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They were really -- there was a coup that started long before Mueller. And that was the whole thing with dirty cops and FBI and all of the things that you know about better than anybody else. I mean, if you look at the -- the people involved in that horrible situation --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We've rebuilt the military. With all of the things we've done, regulations cut, the biggest tax cut in history. So many things -- our energy. We're energy-independent now. That's why you don't see our boats being blown up over in...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> The strait.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ...on the Gulf.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So there's so many things, but they won't give you a decent article. No matter what you do, it doesn't matter. It's a fake. These are dishonest people. But when they say the impeachment now begins, Sean, this was day of the inauguration.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Have you seen -- I put a montage together for television on this show -- two days after you were elected, that word started. We heard it all throughout 2017, all throughout 2018. Here we are here. Meanwhile, this collusion with a government -- the political article said, "a Ukrainian American operative was disclosing for the DNC, met with top officials in the Ukrainian embassy in Washington, in an effort to expose ties between Trump's top campaign aide, Manafort and Russia." This was before you -- that happened [Inaudible] interference... [Crosstalk]
<Mark Levin> <Negative> Outrageous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that was a very dangerous thing for our country and -- and now people understand that, really they understand it, but you know they'll go on. But I think -- I think it's embers now. I just think it's a little embers I hope so anyway, because it's so bad for our country puts us in such a bad light. It really -- it really hurts us as a country.
<Mark Levin> <Positive> What do you -- what do you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I think -- I think we've done a good job.
<Mark Levin> <Negative> But look -- how far the Democrat Party has lurched left? I mean, they all sound like Bernie Sanders now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, sure -- happened. And if you look at the FBI, they were doing work on me from before the election ever took place. Very early on. Sean, long before the November 8th election, they were doing work on me. And now, with other senators or other people in high office, they would say, by the way, I think you have a Chinese spy working for you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, who I'm talking about -- Dianne Feinstein had a chauffeur that for many, many years worked for her. And they went up to her and they said, listen, he may be a Chinese spy. And she fired him. Nobody told me anything about that. Nobody ever told me -- what they did is a disgrace. And I will admit it; this should never happen to another president.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because what happened to people who worked for me -- who were good people -- what they had to do -- they went bust trying to pay for their legal fees. They came to Washington to do a fantastic job. I always say they were bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. They came to Washington. They wanted to do a great job on healthcare, on this, on that -- on all sorts of things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they left, and they were dark people. They left dark. And this was all a phony scam. And then you have Hillary Clinton saying two days ago, Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian asset. And that Jill Stein is a Russian agent. And I said, wait a minute. It took me two and a half years -- I wish you would have said that earlier, because people would have realized she's crazy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's crazy. But two and a half years, Sean, we went through this. And it started before the election. And President Obama in September was told about Russian influence, and he didn't want to do anything about it. He didn't want to do a thing about it. Because he assumed Hillary was going to win. So he didn't do a thing about it. Nobody brings that up. Nobody brings up his statement to the President of Russia at the time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody brings it up as he whispers across about, I'll see you after the election. It's a very double standard. It's a very sad thing. Now, you have a lot of people from Clinton and from Obama -- and you also have Never Trumpers from Bush – you know, I can understand that Bush isn't exactly loving me because we took on the Clinton family and we took on the Bush family and we beat them both.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have lurched left and I watched Bernie the other day talking about, you know, prisoners can vote and --
<Mark Levin> <Negative> Terrorists.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said Well, I actually said because then they went into that at first. They said prisoners and they said, well, that means the Boston bomber, you know, they used a couple of beautiful examples like the Boston bomber and he said that includes the Boston bomber. And I said, Whoa, that's heavy stuff. And then you hear other people more or less agreeing with him that you know are running and I think it's amazing, but I don't mind, I don't mind campaigning on the fact that I will not allow ever to have the Boston bomber be voting OK. I don't mind that -- I think that's not -- I don't lose any points with the -- with the world of politics with that, it's ridiculous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But that's what I'm running against and it is amazing to me and to you how far left these people have gone. But yes, we'll expose it for what it is.
<Mark Levin> <Positive> Well, in two years, despite all that's been going on around him, speak for myself, he's been a remarkably successful President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, two -- I guess you'd call them dynasties, right, that's called a dynasty. But we beat them both. And I would say they don't exactly like me. But we're doing a great job. And with all of the things going on, and now to think it starts up again -- it was repeated two or three times. And now it's starts to begin.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And this time, over an absolutely perfect phone call with a very nice gentleman, and when I read it, I said, this is like a perfect conversation. I knew it beforehand, but I wanted to see, could I have possibly said something wrong. So now what happens is I immediately release it. I release the conversation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK. So now we have a conversation that's perfect. And it's transcribed. And it's done by totally professional people, stenographers or whatever you would call them. So we have an exact conversation. I release it. And now you don't hear from the whistleblower anymore, because the whistleblower was talking about this conversation -- in phony terms.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Just like Adam Schiff made up my conversation. He said seven or eight... [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I want to ask you about that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...times -- think of this. Adam Schiff, Shifty Schiff -- he said seven or eight times, Sean -- it was terrible -- seven or eight times that I gave a quid pro quo. And I said, not only seven or eight times, but there were no times because it wasn't done. OK, it wasn't done. He's a corrupt politician. And think of what they're doing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Based on a very minor conversation with the president of a country who just got elected -- nice guy -- it was really a congratulatory conversation -- the first page is you know, congratulations on your win et cetera, et cetera. Couldn't have been nicer. I tell you, Lindsay Graham said -- when he read it -- he said, I never knew that Trump was that nice a person.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Mark Levin> <Negative> You haven't mentioned the courts yet. You've done a tremendous job in the courts, which is very, very difficult. You've been fighting this battle on immigration. You have cities and states that are violating federal law with this sanctuary nullification nonsense. You have people who are trying to undermine the United States military, you're standing for the United States military.
<Mark Levin> <Negative> You're doing a lot of things that the people who live between the two coasts wanted you to do.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Mark Levin> <Positive> And I just wanted to mention that as -- as -- as we end our discussion here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I -- hey, Mark, if I could, I'd just like to thank the farmers because you know, we're doing great trade deals and they're going to be among the biggest beneficiaries they've been so patriotic so loyal and they're starting to do really well. And you know they've been going down for 15, 20 years a long time, but the farmers, and we rebuilt the military and we will -- you mentioned the courts, we'll have very shortly within another couple of months, I'll have 145 federal judges including two on the Supreme Court, 145, nobody would have thought that's possible, and 145 --
<Mark Levin> <Neutral> Top-notch.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a big percentage of -- all top notch. So we're very happy with that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This was such a nice conversation. There was no pressure on anyone... [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Thought he was a friend of yours... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no, he said, I've never seen -- I never knew that he was so nice, meaning me. I didn't view that as a compliment in this case. Right? But anyway. So look. It's a disgrace what's going on. In the meantime we're doing a great job running the country. That's what I'm focused on, running the country. It's a very unfair situation.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Look at the double standard, though. You've got Hillary and the dossier. You've got Ukraine interfering on her behalf. Then you've got Schiff who's been telling us for three years... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Lies.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Then he's connected to the whistleblower, so he can't bring the whistleblower in. Then you've got... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They met with the whistleblower. Nobody knew that. We just found out. They knew. And where is the person that gave the whistleblower the information? Because is that person a spy? Or does that person even exist? I have a feeling that person doesn't exist. I think Schiff might have made it up.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Well, apparently Schiff knows him and so does Joe Biden. But...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, now the funny thing is that they say -- they say that the whistleblower -- they don't need the whistleblower anymore. Why don't they need the whistleblower? You know why they don't need the whistleblower, because the whistleblower's account of my conversation was totally wrong. Now, they had no idea I was going to release the conversation.
<Mark Levin> <Positive> Well, Mr. President, be safe out there. We're rooting for you because rooting for you is rooting for the country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I really appreciate it. I love your show and I -- you're a very special man and I appreciate it very much, and you've been with me from early on and very early -- almost at the beginning. You take little -- you took a little side path for a few months there, but that was OK and he happens to be a good man.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He -- he ended up doing a good job. Ted, I understand I can understand that too, but I really do appreciate it, Mark, very much.
<Mark Levin> <Positive> God bless and best to your family as well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. I'll see you soon. Thank you, Mark.
<Mark Levin> <Positive> All right. Take care.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And normally I wouldn't. I mean I'm talking to a foreign leader, I don't want to release a conversation, people aren't going to want to talk to me or any other president. But that's what happened, and it's a disgrace.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> So -- but I want to go to the double standard again; whether it's the dossier, whether it's Ukraine helping and interfering on our elections, whether -- there is no quid pro quo. Then you can add Hunter Biden and Joe Biden on tape bragging about using tax payer dollars to demand the firing of the Ukrainian prosecutor.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Hunter Biden admits no experience Ukraine, China. No experience in oil, gas, energy, or private equity. Millions of dollars... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Thrown out of the Navy. OK. Hunter Biden was thrown out of the Navy.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Why was he given that money? Would anyone else get that money?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a pay-off in my opinion. It's a pay-off. Why else would it be? Look, Hunter Biden with no experience -- now I hear the number is $168,000 a month, and I heard they got a $3 million payment... [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Split between him and another guy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They get a $3 million payment in all of this. OK. And that's corruption. That's something that has to be investigated. That's when you have to look. But I watched this crazy Anderson Cooper, the other day during the debate, apologize for having to ask the question to them. Apologize. If that were me...
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> He declared his innocence.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Or if that were my sons that took $168,000 from this very questionable company, an energy company, and they knew nothing about energy at all -- he knew nothing about energy. And he has a bad record -- bad track record, including getting thrown out of the Navy. And even the way he got in the Navy is interesting, in his position.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If that were Don Jr., if that were Eric Trump, who are very outstanding young men, it would be the biggest story of the century.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> And what does it say about the media? I agree with you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The media -- the media is corrupt. Not all medias. Look, I know some -- some great people including you, but I know some great journalists -- look, they gave Pulitzer Prizes to people that got it wrong. OK. All these people for doing it from "The New York Times," which is a fake newspaper -- we don't even want it in the White House anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to probably terminate that and "The Washington Post." They're fake. But you take a look at "The New York Times" and you take a look at the kind of reporting they do, it was all -- it turned out to be all wrong. And then after the election, "The New York Times" apologized for their coverage, because they were covering me in such a way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So when I won they actually apologized to their subscribers, because they were losing thousands and thousands of subscribers. "The New York Times" wrote an apology. Nothing else. You know, they're saying well, it wasn't really an apology. It was. Because they covered me so badly. And then what I said -- sort of interesting -- I think, I hope -- I said, you know, the good news is now I'll be covered fairly again.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know what happened, I got covered worse. I got covered worse. But that's OK. You know -- you know who was covered worse than me, they say? [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Who?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Abraham Lincoln. I've heard the one person -- it used to be five or six, now it's down to one -- Honest Abe Lincoln. They say he got the worst press of anybody. I say I dispute it.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Let me ask you, so have the Democrats already jumped out of a plane? Can't go back. Do you see a scenario where they will impeach you, there'll be a trial in the Senate, and then the people get to speak -- would that be the ultimate revenge, which is your reelection if the people speak?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So everybody tells me it's going to be great for us as a Republican Party, if they actually impeach me, because the 40 seats -- and there were many more than the 32 -- it's 40, 45 seats, where I won or did really well or very close, that those people are going to get hammered -- meaning running in Congress.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I don't know if that's true or not. I do say this -- and I can see it, because I've been -- I mean, look at our fundraiser. The money's never come in like this. Look at -- my poll numbers have been, like, the highest. I was in Dallas the other night, we set a record in a stadium -- I don't know, it's got to be an arena that's got to be 20 years old...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Three layers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...we have a record. We had thousands of people outside watching on big screens. They've never seen anything like that. And it's that way at every place. I mean, that was Dallas, which we love, that was great, they did a great job, great place. But it's that way every place. Look at in Louisiana. In Louisiana the other night, the governor was at 66, he couldn't get 50 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And now you're going to have a runoff with a really great Republican candidate. Look at North Carolina. Great state. Great people. Two races that were going to be lost, I went in, made a speech, let everybody know I really respect these two guys and they're going to be great, they both won. They both won by good margins.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They both won. So I think the public is seeing it, actually.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Let me ask you, 2020's here. All right? You don't -- you've said publicly you don't think you'll make the. Drudge says Elizabeth Warren is first to lose, you have Bernie, Mayor Pete, Kamala Harris, whatever. Then you look at their positions. Top marginal taxpayers 70 percent...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Much higher.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> ...90 percent corporate tax rate. The New Green Deal, $96 trillion in 10 years, Medicare for All, no private option. You come to a running against one of those, who do you think it is? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I don't want to talk about it, because you know, the last time I took on Elizabeth Warren, I thought she was gone. Embers, you know, burning embers down...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Pocahontas.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...and -- Pocahontas. There's only one, and it's not her. So what happened, Sean -- and she rose from the ashes, and I give her credit for that, but I don't like talking about it. As far as I'm concerned, the Green New Deal, it's fine. All of it's fine. Paying 96 percent in taxes is all fine, because I want them to keep talking about it. And when it's time to run, I'll run.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I don't want to talk them out of it, Sean. It's too early to talk about. You know, we have -- can you believe we're getting down to 12 months. Can you believe it?
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> One year.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When I first went right in that corner of that beautiful building, and I was in the first -- the first night with the first lady and I'm standing in an area where Abe Lincoln was, all of them were -- And that's the way it was. And I'm standing there, and I say wow, four years, that's a long time. And here we are, we're almost coming up. But we have tremendous support.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We've cut taxes, we've cut regulations. We have great stock markets. You know, we have over 100 days, and that's in a fairly short period of time, where the stock -- much more than 100 days where the stock market hit an all time high. And it's about to hit it again. We're doing great. And we're beating everybody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All over the world -- countries aren't doing well. China's not doing well. China's having the worst year they've had in 57 years. And we just made a deal for our farmers where $40 billion to $50 billion worth of agricultural product's going to be bought by China. And they're going to start now before we even sign the agreement.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They've already started. But we've done things that nobody else has done. And to go through this, on a perfect conversation you're going to be impeached. To me, impeach is a very ugly word. It really means a high crime and misdemeanor. That letter is a perfect conversation with a man -- congratulations on your win.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And to impeach over a letter like that -- but they don't mention the letter anymore, and they don't mention whistleblowers, and they don't mention any of these people anymore.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> The secrecy though. I want you to react, [Inaudible] 1998 did impeachment. They were due processed, the president's attorneys. Kevin McCarthy spelled it out. Pat Cipollone, your White House counsel wrote a pretty strong letter...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good letter.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> ...how this inquiry is unconstitutional without any due process. And it's about undoing 2016 and influencing 2020.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So what they're doing now is something that's never been done before. They don't want the facts to come out. And by the way, from everything -- I don't know most of these people, and if I do -- I do -- I met them quickly or I know them very little. But ambassadors and some others, I don't even know -- most of them I never even heard of their names.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. And they're bringing them in, and they're actually turning out to be better witnesses by far for us. But no lawyers -- we have no lawyers – Republican -- because it's the minority. We have no lawyers, we can't question, we can't do a thing. We can't -- they can't even go into the room... [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You don't think Republicans have been tough enough though. You said that today.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think the Republicans should get tougher. Look, I think that the Democrats are not good politicians. I think they have lousy policy. They have policy of open borders and sanctuary cities and crime. And you know, it brings all of this crime, and it brings drugs and it brings -- I think they're lousy politicians.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have horrible policy. But you don't have the Mitt Romneys of the world. You don't have people that will go against the party. You have better -- they stick together. I respect that. The other thing is they're vicious. They're much more vicious. We would never do a thing like this. They could have impeached Obama for the IRS scandal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They could impeach him for the guns for whatever -- where guns went all over the place and people got killed with guns.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Fast and furious.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Fast and furious. They could have killed -- they could have -- they could have impeached him for many different things. They didn't impeach him. They never even thought of impeaching him. Here -- here, think of this. I've gone through the impeachment now since the beginning on Russia, on Mueller, on all this stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK. And then they come up with this crazy concept of a perfect conversation. I'm serious, a -- a very good lawyer said, you must have known this was going to become a public document because you spoke so nicely. This is not -- we're talking about impeachment. To me, the word impeachment is a dirty, disgusting word.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't do a reason to be impeached. The only reason they're impeaching is because they look at the polls and they see Moody's just came out and said under all three scenarios, Trump wins easily.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> 351 electoral votes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. They see what's going on. They see the level of popularity when they look at Minnesota. Minneapolis was incredible. When they look at Dallas. When they look at Louisiana. When they look at North Carolina, the two seats we just picked up. They see what's going on. That's what they're doing. Congressman Al Green, a Democrat, said we have to impeach him because he's going to win.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is what I'm up against. Who would do this? Who would play a dirty game like this?
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Well, obviously, you know, you talk about it hurting the country. He said, we better impeach him, because he's -- we're not going to be able to beat him. That was the phrase.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nobody believed this statement. But by the way, there's more than just him that made that statement. And you know, when you do a poll, well, every Democrat's going to say hey, we want to win. Impeach him. Go ahead. It would be a terrible thing for the country if they did it, because then if you have a Democrat president -- and someday you'll have this combination, I guess.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you have a Democrat, hopefully it's going to be in a long time -- but that's OK. You have a Democrat president, you have a Republican House... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now wait a minute.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> That makes them mad -- that makes their heads explode.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Don't tell them we're running for 16 years. But listen, Sean, if you have a Democrat as president and you have a Republican House and you have a speaker that's tough and crazy, like Pelosi – she's crazy -- and if you have somebody like that, what happens is very simple. They're going to say let's impeach the president.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let's check his phone calls. Oh, gee, there was a comma put in the wrong location, let's impeach him, supposed to be for high crimes and misdemeanors. I can't even believe that this wouldn't be a law suit. How can you take a president -- now, again, they don't like to talk about the phone call because it was perfect.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They don't like to talk about the -- Adam Schiff said he doesn't want the whistleblower anymore. You know why? Because he might have given the whistleblower the things to say.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> He'd have to answer questions about Schiff and about his relationship with Biden. Let me -- let me ask you more about 2020. Record low unemployment since 1969. When you ran, you said what have you got to lose, when you would speak to minorities.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Well now you have record low unemployment...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Historic.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> ...Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, African Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment. OK, what is your message to minorities in 2020? Your base looks strong. You can see it at the rallies. What do you say to the people that maybe didn't vote for you last time?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> African American, Hispanic, Asian American have all set record the lowest unemployment in the history of our country. Not just like for 50 years. We have 51 years for the country, and we're going to end up topping that number pretty soon. That'll be historic too very soon. If we keep going the way we're doing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we will. You know, because the household income is so incredible, the median household income. But if you look, African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, in the history of our country they have the best unemployment numbers and they have the best employment numbers. Today, it was announced that we have the most people working in the history of our country, almost 160 million people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> How do you beat me in a debate on those numbers? OK. They're the best numbers. Poverty numbers are the best right now for almost all of those groups. Poverty numbers meaning, in a positive sense...
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> People out of poverty.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...but the poverty numbers -- right...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> People off of food stamps.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...are the best numbers in the history of our country. There's another number that just came out -- and it came out I guess with the Moody's report, saying that I would win easily. The Moody's report was very interesting. Median household income under eight years of Obama was up $975. That's eight years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Under eight years of President Bush -- we had President Obama, $975. President Bush, $400. Eight years, eight years, $400, $975. Me, two and a half years, it's up $7,000. $5,000 plus $2,000 for the tax cut that everybody got. So you add the $2,000 to the $5,000. So you've got one up $1,000 or $975. The other one's up -- that's over eight years, each one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm only here two and a half years. And I beat them by many times in two and a half years. What's that percentage like proportionately? So it's up $5,000 plus $2,000 -- so it's up $7,000, median household income. That's a record. There's never been anything like that. And then I say, oh, let's impeach the president.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Give me a break, Sean. I don't think the people will stand for it. I really don't. I don't think the people will stand for it. As to whether or not it helps, it might, because... [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Don't they have the last word, though? In a year, you're running. People will vote...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it is -- but no, it's supposed to be high crimes and misdemeanors. A perfect conversation... [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Well what would you want Mitch McConnell? Mitch McConnell said oh, I have to do this six weeks [Inaudible] trial for what? For that transcript?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I -- I can't imagine that -- I can't imagine that they do it. I can't imagine. I can see it being very, very bad for 40 or 45 people that are Democrats in a district that I -- when I ran I won. Very substantially in many cases. I won by a lot. And I don't think those people want to see this. You know, it's one thing if you commit a real crime.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This was a conversation. It wasn't even a big deal. Hey, how you doing, blah, blah, blah. This is a conversation. It was so perfect. But people say, it's like a perfect conversation. Speak to Lindsey Graham. Speak to all these people that have read it. Impeachment is high crimes and misdemeanors. I -- I think it's a travesty for our country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're doing such a bad thing to our country. And that's because the Democrats are vicious and they stick together. For instance, when you do a censure vote on Adam Schiff, what did he do? He made up my conversation, totally -- like fiction. It was -- it was fraudulent. He made it sound -- he took that conversation he made it sound -- now he didn't know about that conversation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So he went up -- and he made up a phony conversation, read it to Congress, read it the American people. And I released that, and that was the real conversation. So he then said, I don't know...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> It was already out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...it was parody.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes – it was parody. So this is a corrupt politician. He should be impeached. And Nancy Pelosi should be impeached. They should not allow this, with that it's possibly going to help, you know, from the standpoint of winning the election. I don't know. They say it's going to help a lot with respect to winning the House back, but it's not the right thing.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Let me ask you about Syria, and let me ask you about Iran. Iran shot a drone out the air. They have taken tankers hostage. You mentioned energy independence, Straits of Hormuz...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they haven't taken our tankers number one.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> No, not ours. But -- but the Straits of Hormuz, are less geopolitically important to us.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have very few ships because...
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...since I came in we're now energy independent.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, we have very few ships. In fact, that comment was made the other day they don't see too many American ships anymore.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> So when you've had Syria -- you've gotten criticism. Well this weekend it seems like you and Lindsey had an impasse.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. We -- well -- we -- we, look we have the same name... [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> No, it seems like you actually made progress.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We want to bring soldiers back home. They were supposed to be there for 30 days. They're there for 10 years. We were in Afghanistan there for 20 years. We're reducing those numbers very substantially in Afghanistan. But they're supposed to be Syria for 30 days. Now one thing about Syria, when I took over ISIS was all over the place.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know that better than anybody, two and a half years ago. I went in and when I started I got rid of that whole thing. All those prisoners, all that -- those are my -- they were captured under Trump. We killed many, many ISIS fighters. It -- it's, you know, you hate to talk about...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> The caliphate was a [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We took 100 percent of the caliphate, 100 percent. Everybody says it. Everybody -- so it's not like oh gee, Obama did it. I did it. But you know what? It's now time to bring our soldiers home. And it's very interesting, that little fight for two day, vicious stuff. I don't know that Turkey would have done what they did, like a ceasefire.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I don't know that the Kurds would have moved out. But they went through two days and I say -- and some people thought it was a great analogy, some people don't, but it's like two kids in a playground, they fight -- you let them fight for a minute and then you pull apart. It was much easier to make a deal.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You're willing to -- because you did, well two things. Number one, you removed the rules of engagement that President Obama had. Two, you... [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You bombed them. You pushed them out. And if need be, my guess is – and I'm asking about the Trump doctrine in a sense. You'd go back...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> 100%
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> ...overwhelming force. No rules of engagement, which to me is like putting handcuffs on our military.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sean, I go to Dover Air Force Base and I see young men and women coming back in coffins. I go to our great Walter Reed Hospital where I think you have the best doctors, like in the world, these incredible military doctors, what they can do for these young people. And I see people – young, beautiful people that -- such incredible -- I was there last Friday and I gave out purple hearts.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So beautiful people, but often times they're missing legs and they're missing arms -- they're missing both. And I see the parents and I see the heartbreak, the devastation of a heartbreak. I sign letters right here in this office -- the Oval Office. I sign letters to parents. [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> No two letters are the same.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No two letters are ever the same. I say you've got to make them different. You know they compare them. You know what's interesting, even though they may not be in same part in the same country, when they die at a certain time, the parents get together to celebrate their sons or daughters who were killed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's an amazing -- I don't want them to read like a form letter. We make every letter different, very important to me. It's something...
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Let me ask you this then. We start wars. We politicize wars, then we get nervous politically. And then, it seems that we put handcuffs on our military.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, everything gets politicized. Is the next step, maybe the Trump doctrine even, that the next generation of weaponry, offensive and defensive weapons, will we fight them from Tampa. Are you – would you... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're making the most sophisticated weapons ever made. We're making the greatest missiles, the greatest rockets, the greatest everything ever made. Our nuclear is now up to snuff at a level that it's never been. We're actually ordering new nuclear, we're building right now new nuclear -- not that I want to, but as you know, Russia was not playing fair with us with the treaty.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we therefore terminated it. I believe that we're going to get together with Russia and with China, and we're going to workout our nuclear pact so that we don't all continue with this craziness. Right now we have the most powerful nuclear force in the world. Russia is second and China is third. It's very costly and very dangerous.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's very, very dangerous. And we are discussing with Russia, and we're discussing with China. During the recent trade deal with China, I said, we should all get together and work out something -- a cap, have a cap. We don't need 10,000 weapons, have a cap. And I will say China and Russia are talking about it. Our experience, I'm very excited about it.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> We'd have to have [Inaudible] verify though.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure 100 percent. We need all of that. Well look, I'm the one that terminated the agreement. They didn't terminate -- I terminated it because we found them -- they were making -- they were doing things that they weren't supposed to be doing in the agreement. So we had an agreement, a non-nuclear agreement, and we had all sorts of limits.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we were the only one that was paying attention to it. That's not fair. But now they know we're a different country. And I think Russia would like to make a deal, and I think China would like to make a deal. And I think that's a big -- that would be a terrific thing. I'd love to be a part of that.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I was surprised you didn't hit Iran.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have a lot of good will built up. They took down a drone, there was nobody in it. They took down a second drone, there was nobody in it. There's a lot of good will. They hit Saudi Arabia. We sent troops over to Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia's paying for it. You know that's never happened before. We said, look you've got to pay and they're paying it. They have nothing but money, nothing but cash.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're paying. But we sent some troops over there, we're going to give them good protection, and we built a lot of good capital up. You know everyone thought that when I got elected -- Hillary Clinton used to say, oh, you'll have World War III. Well, I'm very tempered actually. A lot of people would have hit, but I built up a lot of capital.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> By not hitting.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By not hitting. You understand that.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> We saw what you did with the caliphate so you're willing to throw...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wiped out the caliphate. And you also saw when I hit 58 rockets, missiles right into the middle. Tomahawk, right into the middle of -- of Syria and knocked out a whole base and did -- which is something, by the way, President Obama, he drew the red line in the sand and then he didn't violate that red line.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And let me just tell you, when he didn't do it, that's when everyone else came in including Russia.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Last question. I know the whole issue... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...that was a big moment.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Oh yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He said red line in the sand and then nothing happened. What they did was they had chemicals and they destroyed 500 babies and children and everything. And he didn't do anything about it. That was a very bad moment for our country, but I did something. Because when I came in, I hit them very hard.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I've known you for a long time. You've already given the answer earlier today on Doral, it won't go down there. You might move it to Camp David, I guess so you're looking at other locations. I've known you for a long time. You thrive on a battle. You thrive on fighting. You've said to me privately and publicly, you want your promises fulfilled.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I guess that's what reelection is going to be about. All this impeach, impeach going on. Do you care? Would you care at all what they do as long as you win in November? Does it matter to you? Except for what you said earlier about it hurts the country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want -- I want to care -- look, we've done a great job. The economy's the best it's ever been, ever been. And you look again. China's gone way down. If Hillary Clinton had gotten elected, right now China would have had the number one economy in the world, and right now they're not even close. They're way behind.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We've picked up trillions of dollars in worth and value, and China's gone way, way down by trillions and trillions of dollars. When the Head of China spoke to me recently -- and even the Vice Premier just left -- just left this office right here last week. He said, congratulations Mr. President on the incredible job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He said we would never have expected this to happen. Don't forget China's paying us tens of billions of dollars in tariffs, and it's had a huge impact on China. And it hasn't cost us anything because they devalued their currency or they've poured money in. It hasn't cost us -- they've eaten that. They've eaten it totally.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But he said congratulations on the job you've done with the economy. Had Hillary Clinton got in, right now we would be the number two economy in the world. We are so far in front of China that if we have smart people sitting right in that chair, right next to us, it will never happen.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I think you must negotiate everything, because I've known you for a long time. Mr. President, I won't take anymore of your time. Thank you so much for doing this. Appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you very much.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Thank you sir.
<The New York Times> <Neutral> Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, discussed his views on foreign policy in Cleveland on Wednesday with David E. Sanger and Maggie Haberman of The New York Times during the Republican National Convention. The following is an edited transcript of their interview.
<David E. Sanger> <Positive> So what we want to do is pick up where we left off in March. We were listening to Speaker Ryan last night, and he presented a much more traditional Republican, engaged internationalist view of the world. One in which he said that the United States would never lead from behind. In our conversation a few months ago, you were discussing pulling back from commitments we can no longer afford unless others pay for them. You were discussing a set of alliances that you were happy to participate in.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I think, by the way, David, I think they will be able to afford them.
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> They may be.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We can't.
<David E. Sanger> <Negative> But I guess the question is, If we can't, do you think that your presidency, let's assume for a moment that they contribute what they are contributing today, or what they have contributed historically, your presidency would be one of pulling back and saying, "You know, we're not going to invest in these alliances with NATO, we are not going to invest as much as we have in Asia since the end of the Korean War because we can't afford it and it's really not in our interest to do so."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If we cannot be properly reimbursed for the tremendous cost of our military protecting other countries, and in many cases the countries I'm talking about are extremely rich. Then if we cannot make a deal, which I believe we will be able to, and which I would prefer being able to, but if we cannot make a deal, I would like you to say, I would prefer being able to, some people, the one thing they took out of your last story, you know, some people, the fools and the haters, they said, "Oh, Trump doesn't want to protect you." I would prefer that we be able to continue, but if we are not going to be reasonably reimbursed for the tremendous cost of protecting these massive nations with tremendous wealth — you have the tape going on?
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> We do.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> We both do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> With massive wealth. Massive wealth. We're talking about countries that are doing very well. Then yes, I would be absolutely prepared to tell those countries, "Congratulations, you will be defending yourself."
<David E. Sanger> <Positive> That suggests that our forward deployments around the world are based on their interests — they're not really based on our interests. And yet I think many in your party would say that the reason that we have troops in Europe, the reason that we keep 60,000 troops in Asia, is that it's in our interest to keep open trading lines, it's in our interest to keep the North Koreans in check, you do that much better out away from the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think it's a mutual interest, but we're being reimbursed like it's only in our interest. I think it's a mutual interest. …
<David E. Sanger> <Negative> We were talking about alliances, and the fundamental problem that you hear many Republicans, traditional Republicans, have with the statement that you've made is that it would seem to them that you would believe that the interests of the United States being out with both our troops and our diplomacy abroad is less than our economic interests in having somebody else support that. In other words, even if they didn't pay a cent toward it, many have believed that the way we've kept our postwar leadership since World War II has been our ability to project power around the world. That's why we got this many diplomats ——
<Donald Trump> <Positive> How is it helping us? How has it helped us? We have massive trade deficits. I could see that, if instead of having a trade deficit worldwide of $800 billion, we had a trade positive of $100 billion, $200 billion, $800 billion. So how has it helped us?
<David E. Sanger> <Positive> Well, keeping the peace. We didn't have a presence in places like Korea in 1950, or not as great a presence, and you saw what happened.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's no guarantee that we'll have peace in Korea.
<David E. Sanger> <Negative> Even with our troops, no, there's no guarantee.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, there's no guarantee. We have 28,000 soldiers on the line.
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> But we've had them there since 1953 and ——
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure, but that doesn't mean that there wouldn't be something going on right now. Maybe you would have had a unified Korea. Who knows what would have happened? In the meantime, what have we done? So we've kept peace, but in the meantime we've let North Korea get stronger and stronger and more nuclear and more nuclear, and you are really saying, "Well, how is that a good thing?" You understand? North Korea now is almost like a boiler. You say we've had peace, but that part of Korea, North Korea, is getting more and more crazy. And more and more nuclear. And they are testing missiles all the time.
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> They are.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we've got our soldiers sitting there watching missiles go up. And you say to yourself, "Oh, that's interesting." Now we're protecting Japan because Japan is a natural location for North Korea. So we are protecting them, and you say to yourself, "Well, what are we getting out of this?"
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> Well, we keep our missile defenses out there. And those missile defenses help prevent the day when North Korea can reach the United States with one of its missiles. It's a lot easier to shoot down from there ——
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We've had them there for a long time, and now they're practically obsolete, in all fairness.
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> Relatively new missile defenses would allow us ——
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm only saying this. We're spending money, and if you're talking about trade, we're losing a tremendous amount of money, according to many stats, $800 billion a year on trade. So we are spending a fortune on military in order to lose $800 billion. That doesn't sound like it's smart to me. Just so you understand though, totally on the record, this is not 40 years ago. We are not the same country and the world is not the same world. Our country owes right now $19 trillion, going to $21 trillion very quickly because of the omnibus budget that was passed, which is incredible. We don't have the luxury of doing what we used to do; we don't have the luxury, and it is a luxury. We need other people to reimburse us much more substantially than they are giving right now because we are only paying for a fraction of the cost.
<David E. Sanger> <Negative> Or to take on the burden themselves.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Or, if we cannot make the right deal, to take on the burden themselves. You said it wrong because you said or — or if we cannot make the right deal for proper reimbursement to take on the burden themselves. Yes. Now, Hillary Clinton said: "I will never leave Japan. I will never leave Japan. Will never leave any of our ——" Well now, once you say that, guess what happens? What happens?
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> You're stuck.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You can't negotiate.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In a deal, you always have to be prepared to walk. Hillary Clinton has said, "We will never, ever walk." That's a wonderful phrase, but unfortunately, if I were on Saudi Arabia's side, Germany, Japan, South Korea and others, I would say, "Oh, they're never leaving, so what do we have to pay them for?" Does that make sense to you, David?
<David E. Sanger> <Negative> It does, but we also know that defending the United States is a harder thing to do if you're not forward-deployed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By the way, and I know what I'm talking about is massive. If we ever felt there was a reason to defend the United States, we can always deploy, and it would be a lot less expense. …
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Can we switch to current events, recent events?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You understand what ——
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> I do, I do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You always have to be prepared to walk. It doesn't mean I want to walk. And I would prefer not to walk. You have to be prepared and our country cannot afford to do what we're doing.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> How closely did you watch last week as events were unfolding in Turkey with the coup? Is there anything you would have done differently in how it was handled?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The coup never took place — the coup was not successful, and based on the fact, and I give great credit to him for being able to turn that around.
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> Erdogan?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, some people say that it was staged. You know that?
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> We've heard.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think so, but I do give great credit to him for turning it around. You know, the first hour, it seemed like it was over. Then all of a sudden, and the amazing thing is the one that won that was the people. They came out on the streets, and the army types didn't want to drive over them like they did in Tiananmen Square when they sort of drived them over, and that was the end of that. Right? People said, I'm not going to drive over people. The people came out of their homes, and they were not in favor of what the military was doing. So that was quite impressive from the standpoint of existing government. I will say this: I think Turkey can do a lot against ISIS, and I would hope that if I'm dealing with them, they will do much more about ISIS.
<David E. Sanger> <Negative> Erdogan put nearly 50,000 people in jail or suspend them, suspended thousands of teachers, he imprisoned many in the military and the police, he dismissed a lot of the judiciary. Does this worry you? And would you rather deal with a strongman who's also been a strong ally, or with somebody that's got a greater appreciation of civil liberties than Mr. Erdogan has? Would you press him to make sure the rule of law applies?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think right now when it comes to civil liberties, our country has a lot of problems, and I think it's very hard for us to get involved in other countries when we don't know what we are doing and we can't see straight in our own country. We have tremendous problems when you have policemen being shot in the streets, when you have riots, when you have Ferguson. When you have Baltimore. When you have all of the things that are happening in this country — we have other problems, and I think we have to focus on those problems. When the world looks at how bad the United States is, and then we go and talk about civil liberties, I don't think we're a very good messenger.
<David E. Sanger> <Negative> So that suggests that you would not, as, say, President Bush did, the last President Bush, make the spread of democracy and liberty sort of a core of your foreign policy. You would say, "We need allies, we're not going to lecture them about what they do inside their borders."
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We need allies.
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> And lecture inside their borders?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know that we have a right to lecture. Just look about what's happening with our country. How are we going to lecture when people are shooting our policemen in cold blood. How are we going to lecture when you see the riots and the horror going on in our own country. We have so many difficulties in our country right now that I don't think we should be, and there may be a time when we can get much more aggressive on that subject, and it will be a wonderful thing to be more aggressive. We're not in a position to be more aggressive. We have to fix our own mess.
<David E. Sanger> <Positive> You said that they could be much more helpful with ISIS. I'm sure perhaps they can. The big difference they've had is that we've been supporting Kurdish forces that have been very effective ——
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm a fan of the Kurds, you understand.
<David E. Sanger> <Negative> But Erdogan is not. Tell us how you would deal with that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it would be ideal if we could get them all together. And that would be a possibility. But I'm a big fan of the Kurdish forces. At the same time, I think we have a potentially — we could have a potentially very successful relationship with Turkey. And it would be really wonderful if we could put them somehow both together.
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> And what's your diplomatic plan for doing that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Meetings. If I ever have the opportunity to do it, meaning if I win, we will have meetings, we will have meetings very early on.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> I was going to say, when would you begin that process?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very early on. I think it's a natural. I think it's a natural. I mean, we have two groups that are friendly and they are fighting each other. So if we could put them together, that would be something that would be possible to do, in my opinion.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> You had meetings in the last couple months with James Baker and Henry Kissinger. Did they in any way change your views?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> And what did you come away with from those meetings?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I came away with a lot of knowledge. I respect both men. …
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> Tell us how you'd capitalize on that. On the record, tell us how, in the case with Mexico.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think we'll have a very good relationship with Mexico, and it will be a fair relationship. Right now, it's a massive, Mexico is a massive loss. A massive loss for us. But I think it will be a very, very fair relationship and a very good relationship but right now, Mexico, we are losing on the border and we are losing on trade. We have billions of dollars of trade deficits with Mexico. Drugs are pouring in across the border. And they are beating us both on the border and with trade. I think we'll have a better relationship than we do now and it will be a much more fair relationship.
<David E. Sanger> <Negative> You've talked about building the wall of course. Would you amend or change Nafta?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, without question.
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> Tell us how.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Without question. Nafta ——
<David E. Sanger> <Negative> Would you pull out of Nafta?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I don't get a change, I would pull out of Nafta in a split second. Nafta is signed by Bill Clinton, perhaps the worst trade deal ever signed in the history of this country. It's the worst trade deal ever signed in the history of this country and one of the worst trade deals ever signed anywhere in the world. Nafta is a disaster. You have to understand, I just campaigned, as you probably read, and I won all these states, and one of the reasons was because of Nafta. Because Nafta has drained manufacturing out of New York State, out of Pennsylvania, out of Ohio, out of so many different places. It's drained. And these companies have gone to Mexico, and they've gone, they've left with the jobs. David, I have statisticians, and I know, like if I went to Pennsylvania, I say, "Give me the statistics on what is going on with respect to manufacturing." Numbers — 45, 55, 65, I have states that are so bad. New England. Look at New England, what happened. Nafta has been a disaster for this country. And a disaster for the worker and Nafta is one of the reasons that, you know, there are people that haven't had a wage increase 18 years in real wages. Actually, they're lower, some are working two jobs, working much harder, then making less and they're older. It's supposed to work the opposite. You're making more, you're making more I hope.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> What kind of change could you make in terms of Nafta without fully withdrawing from it? How could you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You've got to be fair to the country. Everyone is leaving. Carrier just announced they're leaving. Ford is building a massive plant. So I have a friend who builds plants and then I have to go. I have a friend who builds plants, that's what he does, he's the biggest in the world, he builds plants like automobile plants, computer plants, that's all he does. He doesn't build apartments, he doesn't build office space, he builds plants. I said to him the other day, "How are you doing?" He goes, "Unbelievable." Oh, great, that's good, thinking about the United States, right, because he's based in the United States. So I said, "Good, so the country is doing well." He said, "No, no, not our country, you've got to see what I'm doing in Mexico." He said: "The business there is unbelievable, the new plants we are building. People moving from the United States." That's what he does. One-story plants. You understand?
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> Since your time is limited, let me ask you about Russia. You've been very complimentary of Putin himself.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No! No, I haven't.
<David E. Sanger> <Positive> You said you respected his strength.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's been complimentary of me. I think Putin and I will get along very well.
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> So I was just in ——
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But he's been complimentary of me.
<David E. Sanger> <Negative> I was just in the Baltic States. They are very concerned obviously about this new Russian activism, they are seeing submarines off their coasts, they are seeing airplanes they haven't seen since the Cold War coming, bombers doing test runs. If Russia came over the border into Estonia or Latvia, Lithuania, places that Americans don't think about all that often, would you come to their immediate military aid?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to tell you what I'd do because I don't want Putin to know what I'd do. I have a serious chance of becoming president and I'm not like Obama, that every time they send some troops into Iraq or anyplace else, he has a news conference to announce it.
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> They are NATO members, and we are treaty-obligated ——
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have many NATO members that aren't paying their bills.
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> That's true, but we are treaty-obligated under NATO, forget the bills part.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You can't forget the bills. They have an obligation to make payments. Many NATO nations are not making payments, are not making what they're supposed to make. That's a big thing. You can't say forget that.
<David E. Sanger> <Positive> My point here is, Can the members of NATO, including the new members in the Baltics, count on the United States to come to their military aid if they were attacked by Russia? And count on us fulfilling our obligations ——
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Have they fulfilled their obligations to us? If they fulfill their obligations to us, the answer is yes.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> And if not?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I'm not saying if not. I'm saying, right now there are many countries that have not fulfilled their obligations to us.
<David E. Sanger> <Negative> You've seen several of those countries come under cyberattack, things that are short of war, clearly appear to be coming from Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're under cyberattack.
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> We're under regular cyberattack. Would you use cyberweapons before you used military force?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Cyber is absolutely a thing of the future and the present. Look, we're under cyberattack, forget about them. And we don't even know where it's coming from.
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> Some days we do, and some days we don't.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because we're obsolete. Right now, Russia and China in particular and other places.
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> Would you support the United States' not only developing as we are but fielding cyberweapons as an alternative?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. I am a fan of the future, and cyber is the future.
<David E. Sanger> <Negative> President Obama, as you probably know, as you probably read, is considering a no-first-use pledge before he leaves office for nuclear weapons. We don't have one right now. Some other nations do, some don't. Would you consider that stabilizing?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Depends on who we are talking about, it depends on who we are talking about. I would only make that commitment as the agreement is being signed. I wouldn't want to play my cards. I don't want to say that.
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> This would be a declaratory policy of the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I understand. I will do everything within my power never to be in a position where we have to use nuclear power because that's a whole different ballgame. That's very important to me. I will do everything in my power never to be in a position where we will have to use nuclear power. It's very important to me.
<David E. Sanger> <Negative> President Obama, as you know, has talked about reducing the number of nuclear weapons in the American arsenal and hopefully getting to the point, maybe not in our lifetimes, of no nuclear weapons. Do you believe at this point that we have sufficient forces that we could come down unilaterally?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I only like that premise if nobody else has them. But that's never going to happen.
<David E. Sanger> <Negative> Do you think we have too many weapons than we actually need to defend the United States?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think we have a lot of obsolete weapons.
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> We certainly do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have nuclear that we don't even know if it works. We have nuclear where the telephone systems are 40 years old and they have wire that's so corroded that they can't call from one station to the next.
<David E. Sanger> <Positive> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have nuclear that their silos are rusted so badly that they don't even know if the rockets are going to pour out.
<David E. Sanger> <Positive> Well that raises the question whether we need that part of the triad?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. Yes, I think you need all three parts, but — but we have, much of what we have is obsolete. Now, Russia, if you look at what they're doing, they're building submarines, they're going to a level. …
<David E. Sanger> <Negative> You've been a little bit vague about what we'd do with ISIS other than bomb the hell out of them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to be specific because I don't want ISIS to know what I'm planning. I do have ideas, very strong ideas on ISIS.
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> Do any of them involve diplomacy, as opposed to — in other words, diplomacy in terms of getting Russia and others to help cut them off?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I would love to have a good relationship where Russia and I, instead of, and us, and the U.S., instead of fighting each other we got along. It would be wonderful if we had good relationships with Russia so that we don't have to go through all of the drama.
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> You would keep Assad there if he's also fighting ISIS?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to say that, I have a very specific view on Assad, but I think we have to get rid of ISIS before we get rid of Assad.
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> So you agree with President Obama in that regard?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, Assad hates ISIS; ISIS hates Assad. They are fighting each other. We are supposed to go and fight them both? How do you fight them both when they are fighting each other? And I think that ISIS is a threat that's much more important for us right now than Assad. You understand what I'm saying?
<David E. Sanger> <Positive> Mmm.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because Assad and ISIS are fighting. Now we are going to go in and fight them both, because we have people that don't know what they are doing. We have people that don't know what they are doing. So I would get rid of ISIS, but I don't want to fight at the same time. The other thing you have is, is Assad is backed by a country that we made a power, O.K.? Iran. And Russia, O.K.? So why didn't we do something about that before we made Iran rich, and before we gave them this tremendous power that they now have, that they didn't have and shouldn't have had?
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> We haven't given them very much right now.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, you've given them $150 billion.
<David E. Sanger> <Neutral> They've gotten a few billion. At this point, they've gotten a few billion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're getting a lot of money. And they have an agreement that's a terrible agreement in my opinion. It's an agreement that will get them to nuclear quicker than had we had no agreement. But that's a different question. You asked me about Assad. So Assad is a bad man. Done horrible things. We have to get ISIS first, and you don't want to fight them both at the same time when they are fighting each other. So I hope you treat me fairly. And I hope you say that I do know my subject. And I do know it. I know it better than, I know it better than the people that do it for ——
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> We're going to run a transcript — Let me ask you one quick question because I can't not ask. Do you have anything more you want to say about either Meredith McIver or what happened this week?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's fine. I wanted to protect her. She's been a person that's been very good ——
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Protect Meredith?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Absolutely. But it was getting to a point where it didn't make sense. Look at your story today. Give me a break. We are talking about ISIS. We are talking about Iran and Iraq and we are walking about and you put, the biggest story is about, the No. 1 story in The New York Times today is about this? She was terrific. She's a terrific woman, she's been with us a long time and she just made the mistake. You saw her letter?
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> I did.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And she came and she said, "Mr. Trump, I'd like to say what happened." I thought it was such a nice thing.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> When did she come to you yesterday?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Two days ago?
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> She did?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Right away? O.K.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who knew this was going to be a big story? What I'm saying is, she came in after the speech. But she was, I thought that was very nice.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> And she offered and you said no?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, originally, but I didn't know it was going to be a big story. She was more interested in, because Melania did a phenomenal job ——
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Her speech was very well received.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very well received. And she was more interested in getting that straight, because she thought it was very unfair to Melania, who did a phenomenal job. And I'm glad, it was very nice that she did it. She offered her resignation. I said, "I really appreciate what you did." I think it's terrific that she came forward instead of me going to her and I said, "I won't accept it," and she was thrilled with that. She was happy with it.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Is there anything you would do differently going forward with how speeches are handled?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, Obama copied a speech from Massachusetts. Joe Biden is famous for copying speeches. Obama had another one with Bush, I read it I think in your paper. I've been reading about this stuff all my life. It happens, it can happen. In this case, it happened. You know the story. By the way, the letter cleared up everything, cleared up everything. The only thing is, if I had done it a day earlier it would have been better.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> It would have ended it ——
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A day earlier, in retrospect. But I didn't clear it up and people are giving, I think, everybody a lot of credit right now.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> What do you think people will take away from this convention? What are you hoping?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> From the convention? The fact that I'm very well liked. Look, I got more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican Party. Almost 14 million votes. I got 37 states. Kasich has one. As an example, Ted had, you know, not many. Thirty-seven states. Now, with the roll call, I had 44 states. It was 44 to seven and the seven was everybody else: 44 to seven. It was 44 to six because we are including the different islands. And when you are in that hall and you see those people, like yesterday, my daughter called up, she said, "Dad, I've never seen it — it's total love."
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Which daughter?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't get love from the media. Instead of reporting like it is. But I think that people are starting to see what's going on, because I really believe there's a movement going on and it's a movement based on common sense, it's a movement based on law and order, it's a movement based on compassion, based on a lot of different things. Based on trade.
<David E. Sanger> <Positive> This is an America First day you are having out there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<David E. Sanger> <Negative> We talked about that a little bit at the last conversation. Does America First take on a different meaning for you now? Think about its historical roots.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> To me, America First is a brand-new modern term. I never related it to the past.
<David E. Sanger> <Negative> So it's not what Lindbergh had in mind?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's just, no. In fact when I said America First, people said, "Oh, wait a minute, isn't that a historical term?" And when they told me, I said: "Look, it's America First. This is not ——"
<David E. Sanger> <Negative> You were familiar with the history of the phrase.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was familiar, but it wasn't used for that reason. It was used as a brand-new, very modern term.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> What does it mean to you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Meaning we are going to take care of this country first before we worry about everybody else in the world.
