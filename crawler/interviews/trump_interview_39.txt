<Ed Henry> <Negative> Let's start with some breaking news from the Fed today. You were pretty upset that they only cut it a quarter of a percentage point and you said that Chairman Powell has no guts. Why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think we should do more because other countries have done more. If you look at Germany, if you look at Japan, if you look at so many others, they're cutting much more. In fact, they're borrowing money and getting paid to borrow money, and we're paying interest. And we're the most prime in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're doing -- we have this great economy. We're doing better than we've ever done. Our employment numbers are the best they've ever been and unemployment numbers also. We are doing great. But we should be cutting. There's no inflation.
<Ed Henry> <Negative> So you're worried he's putting sort of a wet blanket ahead of 2020?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I think what he does is -- I don't think he knows how to play the game very well. They've raised too fast. And I've been saying this openly.
<Ed Henry> <Neutral> Um-huh.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they've lowered too slow. And he took 25. Some people were hoping for 50. He did 25. But the fact is, when Germany gets paid to loan money, I mean they're loaning -- they're borrowing money.
<Ed Henry> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So they're borrowing -- think of it, they borrow money, and when it comes time to pay it back, people pay them.
<Ed Henry> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we can't participate in that and it's because of the Fed. So I'm not thrilled with the Fed. But, despite that, we have an incredible economy, and we don't have inflation.
<Ed Henry> <Neutral> And Chairman Powell's job is safe?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's safe. Yes, it's safe. I mean, sure, why not.
<Ed Henry> <Neutral> You paused.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't pause. I mean he's got a job and, you know, I'm disappointed in him. I'm very disappointed in him. I think he raised far too fast. He also did quantitative tightening, which was not a good thing to do. But it's all right. And, look, we have a great economy and that's not going to make the difference, but it would have given us an edge.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And instead somebody else has an edge. But they're so far behind us, they can't catch us.
<Ed Henry> <Negative> Yes, on Iran, you announced tough new sanctions today. "The Wall Street Journal" is reporting that you are behind the scenes trying to work the diplomatic angles at the U.N. and have something short of actually war. But why did you tweet "locked and loaded" if you don't want to go to war?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we'll see what happens. I mean you may have some very strong hit. We're the strongest military in the world by far. When I came in, we were depleted. Now we're very powerful. We have new planes, new missiles, new everything. Every form of equipment. We're building many new ships, as you know, new submarines.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're doing things that we haven't done in many, many years. I came in, we were depleted. I told you yesterday, they were very low on ammunition. And I'm being nice when I say that. And I said, that should never happen to another president. Well, we'll see what happens. A lot of things could happen. If we can have a peaceful solution, that's good.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's possible that that won't happen. But there's never been a stronger country militarily. Not even close.
<Ed Henry> <Negative> Let's talk about what's behind you because I've interviewed various Democrats on the show, and they'll tell me, this is a fantasy. There's no new wall being built. They've said that. What is this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, this was not here two weeks ago. So this is all brand new wall. This goes miles up the mountain over here. This goes -- I mean you're seeing that this goes miles down in this direction.
<Ed Henry> <Positive> Yes. They said about 14 miles so far.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we're building -- and we're building -- no, we have -- we'll have --
<Ed Henry> <Neutral> Here. I mean just here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, this section is 14, but we're building many that are 50 and 40 and 17 and different areas. We're building on many different sites all up and down along the border. And they get hooked in. Different contractors bid it out. This would be far too much for one contractor to build. But you see the length of this.
<Ed Henry> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So that's just a Democrat --
<Ed Henry> <Neutral> But also you have two levels here because you've got 18 feed over here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, this is Tijuana, and it's been a very, very tough section. A lot of people -- thousands of people are over there trying to get into our country. They can't get in. But, Tijuana, we have a double wall. That's an 18-foot wall.
<Ed Henry> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's the border. And then if they get over here, they can't get up this wall.
<Ed Henry> <Negative> I was -- I interviewed some border patrol agents. They say sometimes dozens can get over with ladders, but none have gotten over the 30 feet.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No -- nobody. And we had mountain climbers. We had, in a couple of cases, championship mountain climbers --
<Ed Henry> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we tested various walls. You have to have the see through ability, otherwise you don't know who's on the other side. They weren't able to get over this wall.
<Ed Henry> <Positive> One border patrol agent told me, no president has brought this kind of attention or resources so that now I can do my job. That's what he told me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we're making their job a lot safer, too. And, you know, what else is happening, people aren't even coming up. You see the numbers are going way down and we're not doing a catch and release anymore. And we wish we had help from the Democrats in Congress, but they've -- they want open borders. They don't want this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They want criminals to come in. They want human traffickers, crooks.
<Ed Henry> <Neutral> But what about Republicans in Congress, sir, because you had two years at the beginning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, they've been -- I know, but they -- I know, but the problem is, I didn't have the votes because, in the Senate, we needed 60 votes and we only had, as you know, we were nine votes short. So we had 51. Now we then a good election and we picked up some more.
<Ed Henry> <Negative> But you regret that Republicans who were in power in the House and Senate didn't push it harder because you could have gotten more of this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there's nothing -- but here's the problem. In the House we had no problem, we'd get it approved, right? But in the Senate, we had 51 votes and we needed 60. So that means we needed nine or 10 Democrat votes they wouldn't give us any. We had no democrats. So just, you know, it's a total misnomer. We had a very tiny majority and we needed nine to 10 votes.
<Ed Henry> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if we didn't get them and we couldn't get them. We had the Republican votes but we didn't have any Democrat votes. So they wouldn't give us the votes.
<Ed Henry> <Positive> Guns, we're told that your Justice Department, a couple weeks ago, gave you a package, a legislative package, you might move on it Thursday. What are you going to do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, we're not moving on anything. We're going very slowly in one way, because we want to make sure it's right. We want to -- we're doing a very careful job. We're working with the Democrats, we're working with Republicans. Our Attorney General has done a fantastic job in so many ways, he's also in on it and he's looking at it and looking at it very --
<Ed Henry> <Positive> But you know what Beto O'Rourke and other Democrat -- Beto O'Rourke, today, said you have blood on your hands, because there were all these deadly shootings and that you can't wait, you've got to move, he says.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Part of the problem that we have is because of Beto O'Rourke's statement about taking away guns.
<Ed Henry> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All of the -- a lot of Republicans and some Democrats now are afraid to do anything, to go down that slippery slope. A lot of people think this is just a way of taking away guns and that's not good, because we're not going to allow that. Look, I'm a very strong believer in the Second Amendment. You are too.
<Ed Henry> <Positive> We know that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, I'm a very strong believer in the Second Amendment, we're going to protect our Second Amendment, we have plenty of ideas. But, we're going to make sure those ideas work.
<Ed Henry> <Positive> But, you like to Tweet that you've got about 95 percent support in the Republican Party, which you do.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do.
<Ed Henry> <Positive> So, are you willing to stand up to the NRA and other Republicans and say, look, we're going to meet -- we're going to do something?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am, if it's not going to hurt a good, solid, great American citizen from keeping his weapon because they want that and they are entitled to that. We have a Second Amendment. I don't want to have crazy people have guns, I don't want to have bad people have guns, but we're going to do nothing to hurt the Second Amendment, and what we want to do is see if we can come up with a compromise and that's what we're working on.
<Ed Henry> <Negative> The FBI and FISI, we heard these reports a week or so that Andrew McCabe might be indicted. Hasn't happened. The report came out on Comey, it was kind of a slap on the wrist. Are you worried that some of these guys, who you believe were going after you, are going to get off the hook?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the reporter who called me was a horrible reporter and you'll have to ask the Attorney General about whatever is going on. And on McCabe, certainly, what he's done is just despicable. But, we'll see what happens, we'll see where it all goes. I think that there's a lot of things happening right now, but we'll see what happens.
<Ed Henry> <Negative> Jimmy Carter said that he thinks when he was 80 years old he wouldn't have been able to be president and it was seen as a shot at Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, and you put out a pretty tough web ad in the last couple days, quoting not Republicans, but Democrats, saying that Joe Biden is not ready, questioning his fitness for the job.
<Ed Henry> <Negative> Are you getting ready for Elizabeth Warren or someone else who’s rising in the polls and not facing Joe Biden in 2020?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I -- I -- you know, whoever it is -- my attitude is, whoever it is, Elizabeth Warren is doing better than Joe right now. Joe's having a hard time. We'll see what happens, whoever it is I'll take them on and we'll do well.
<Ed Henry> <Positive> And you feel good about your standing and you feel good about the economy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I really think that my standing is the best it's been. We had a poll today, 51 percent, and that's despite all of the fake news and all of the -- I say the Democrats and the media, really, are like one. They're -- as if one. But, I think that we're probably doing the best we've done. I think people see what's happening here, people see what's happening with our military, what's happening with the vets where we got Choice (ph) approved.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at all of the things that we're doing, even where you have an attack like in Saudi Arabia where people thought that maybe our oil price was going to double, they barely went up and now they're coming rapidly down.
<Ed Henry> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, we're in great shape. I think we're going to be really in good shape. We've had a lot of fake news, but despite the fake news, our poll numbers are fantastic.
<Ed Henry> <Positive> Mr. President, I know it's been a long day. It's hot here on the border, we appreciate your time. Thank you for doing this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Thank you.
<Ed Henry> <Positive> I really appreciate it.
<Question> <Neutral> [The Wall Street Journal asked Donald Trump about China and North Korea]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we had a really good meeting [with Chinese President Xi Jinping], and it was supposed to be 10 minute session and then you go into a room with hundreds of people, you know all different representatives, and the meeting was scheduled for 10 to 15 minutes, and it lasted for 3 hours. And then the second day we had another 10 minute meetings and that lasted for 2 hours. We had a — just a very good chemistry. [WSJ break in transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He then went into the history of China and Korea. Not North Korea, Korea. And you know, you're talking about thousands of years ...and many wars. And Korea actually used to be a part of China. And after listening for 10 minutes I realized that not — it's not so easy. You know I felt pretty strongly that they have — that they had a tremendous power over China. I actually do think they do have an economic power, and they have certainly a border power to an extent, but they also — a lot of goods come in. But it's not what you would think. It's not what you would think. [WSJ break in transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have tremendous trade deficits with everybody, but the big one is with China. It's hundreds of billions of dollars of year for many many years. And I told them. I said you know, we're not going to let that go ahead. Now, I did say — but you want to make a great deal? Solve the problem in North Korea. That's worth having deficits. And that's worth having not as good a trade deal as I would normally be able to make. OK, I'll make great deals.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You cannot allow a country like that [North Korea] to have nuclear power, nuclear weapons. That's mass destruction. And he doesn't have the delivery systems yet, but he — you know he will. So, you know we [Trump and Xi] have a very open dialogue on North Korea. We have a very good relationship, we have great chemistry together. We like each other, I like him a lot. I think his wife is terrific. And you know, it's very rare that he comes and stays with somebody and spends that much time. [WSJ break in transcript]
<Question> <Neutral> [The Wall Street Journal asked Donald Trump about the Export-Import Bank]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will tell you what, I was very much opposed to Ex-Im Bank, because I said what do we need that for IBM and for General Electric and all these — it turns out that, first of all lots of small companies will really be helped, the vendor companies, but also maybe more importantly, other countries give it. And when other countries give it, we lose a tremendous amount of business.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So instinctively you would say it's a ridiculous thing but actually it's a very good thing and it actually makes money. You know, it actually could make a lot of money. [WSJ break in transcript]
<Question> <Positive> [The Wall Street Journal asked Donald Trump about payments currently made to health insurers under the Affordable Care Act]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Obamacare is dead — it's dead. Obamacare, if you look at the case, you know the famous lawsuit that's out there [about whether payments to insurers were approved by Congress], right? You know that if we follow that lawsuit, we're not supposed to pay money toward Obamacare — you know, Obama just paid the money because he couldn't get approved — the approval from Congress.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Congress hasn't approved it, so if Congress doesn't approve it, or if I don't approve it, that would mean that Obamacare doesn't have enough money so it dies immediately as opposed to over a period of time. Even if it got that money, it dies, but it dies over a period of time. [WSJ break in transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is a very big deal that nobody even understands. I understand it, but most people out there don't know it. So, Congress is going to have to approve it [the insurance payments]. Will they approve it? I don't know, I'm not sure, 50-50. If they approve it, then I will have to approve it. Otherwise, those payments don't get made and Obamacare is gone, just gone. [WSJ break in transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, what should be happening is [Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer should be calling me up and begging me to help him save Obamacare. That's what should happen. He should be calling me and begging me to help him save Obamacare, along with [House Minority Leader] Nancy Pelosi. [WSJ break in transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The longer — the longer I'm behind this desk and you have Obamacare, the more I would own it. Right now, we don't own it at all. [WSJ break in transcript]
<Question> <Positive> [The Wall Street Journal asked Donald Trump about whether he would lay out principles for tax reform before passing new health law]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I want to get health care done and if I don't get it done — I think I will get it done. [WSJ break in transcript]
<Question> <Neutral> [The Wall Street Journal asked Donald Trump about strategy and Steve Bannon's role]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do my own policy, I'm my own strategist. I don't have — I have people that I respect, I have people that I listen to, I have many people and then I make the decision. I'm just saying that [Mr. Bannon] is a guy who works for me, he's a good guy. But, I make my own decision. I don't have people making decisions. [WSJ break in transcript]
<Question> <Neutral> [The Wall Street Journal asked Donald Trump about Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen and the dollar. He is asked whether Yellen was "toast" when it came to being nominated to another term.]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, not toast. You know, I like her, I respect her. She's been here, she's been in that seat. I do like the low interest rate policy, but I must be honest with you, I think our dollar is getting too strong, and partially that's my fault because people have confidence in me. But, you know, that's hurting — that will hurt ultimately. Look there are some very good things about a strong dollar, but usually speaking the best thing about it is that it sounds good. You know, it's very, very hard to compete when you have a strong dollar and the other guy — other countries are devaluing the currency. It's very hard for our manufacturers to compete. [WSJ break in transcript]
<Question> <Negative> [The Wall Street Journal asked Donald Trump about whether the U.S. would insist that Syria's Assad step aside]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that there's such outrage over what he's done and I think we've highlighted that. ... I think there's such outrage, are we insisting on it? No. But I do think it's going to happen at a certain point. But we're not going into Syria. [WSJ break in transcript]
<Question> <Neutral> [The Wall Street Journal asked Donald Trump about whether peace would be "impossible" with Assad still in place]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I think it's hard to imagine, I wouldn't use the word impossible, but I do think it's hard. [WSJ break in transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No I think the word impossible is not right. But it does seem like you certainly wouldn't be off to a good start but again we have other fights, that are fights that are more important as far as our nation's concerned, we have other — we don't need that quicksand. [WSJ break in transcript]
<Question> <Neutral> [The Wall Street Journal asked Donald Trump about Trump on the passenger who was forcibly removed from a United flight]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, that was horrible. No, no, they should... offer more money. Maybe you double, triple, quadruple. You know, there's a point at which I'm getting off the plane.
