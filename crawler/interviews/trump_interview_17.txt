<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. President Happy Super Bowl Day.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Sean. Thank you.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Obvious question, impeachment, third time in history, acquittal pretty much now a formality. Been through a lot. Your reaction Tt all of it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's been very unfair. From the day I won. And I really say from far before the day I won. From the day I came down the escalator with our future First Lady who's doing such a good job. To be honest with you, I think it's, it's probably, it probably started from there. It's been a very, very unfair process, Um the Mueller Report, Russia, Russia, Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> As you say, which was total nonsense. It was all nonsense. The whole thing was nonsense. But it was a very unfair and mostly it was unfair to my family. I mean my family suffered because of all of this, and many other families suffered also. It was a very, very. It's a very serious thing. It should never happen to another president.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> 275 days from now, I guess the ultimate Jury -- the American people -- go to the polls. My question is, is this a campaign issue for you? Do you let it go? Do you see a path that you could work with Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and the Democrats?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I'd like to, but it's pretty hard when you think about it because it's been such um I use the word witch hunt - I use the word hoax. I see the hatred. I see the level -- they don't care about fairness, they don't care about lying. You look at the lies, you look at the reports that were done that were so false.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The, um, the level of hypocrisy. So I'm not sure that they can do it, to be honest. I think they just want to win and it doesn't matter how they win. In the meantime, I really believe this administration, me and this administration, we've done more than any administration in the history of our country. We've rebuilt our military.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We've cut taxes at the highest amount ever in the history of our country. I mean you see what's going on. There's a revolution going on in this country. I mean a positive revolution. So African-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-American. We have the best numbers we've ever had. African-American, the poverty numbers are now reversed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they're the best that they've ever had. So I don't know how anybody could possibly beat me with that vote. So we'll see how it does.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> There were four separate investigations, Trump-Russia collusion, culminating in the Mueller Report. Now it's Ukraine. Does this hurt you? Does any part of this hurt you? What has hurt you the most about it all?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So Sean, I think that with the economy being the best probably it's ever been in the history of our country. I mean it is the best it's ever been. The unemployment numbers are the best. I should be up by 25 points. What they've done is they've really -- all the media. I call it the fake news, and it is fake news, so much of it. And a lot of the fakeness is they don't want to report the good stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They don't want to report that the economy is good.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Will any of this, because now as I said, it's pretty much a fait accompli. looks like Wednesday at 4 p.m. it will be an acquittal. Um, you then move on from there, the State of the Union, we have Iowa Caucuses Monday, State of the Union Tuesday. This happens on Wednesday. Any thought on to delay the State of the Union?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I'm gonna have it. It's going to be done. We're gonna talk about the achievements that we've made. Nobody has made achievements like we've made, so many different things, I'm so proud of what we've done for our vets with choice, we got them choice, we got them accountability, where we can take care of our vets.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Where we can get rid of people who aren't taking care of our vets.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I've known you for a couple of decades. It's gonna be hard for you. This is called our lightning round, here um. I'm just going to throw out a name, whatever comes to your mind.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ok
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> We'll start with Joe Biden
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I just think of sleepy. I just watch him. He's sleepy. Sleepy Joe.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Hunter, Hunter Biden
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Where's Hunter? Where is he? He made millions of dollars. He went from having no job, no income, he had nothing. As you know he had a very sad experience in the military. He has nothing, to making millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars a year. Not just from Ukraine, from China and from other countries.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How can you do this? This is crooked as hell. What they did is very dishonest.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Bernie Sanders.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think he's a communist. I mean you know, look. I think of communism when I think of Bernie. Now you could say socialist, but didn't he get married in Moscow? And that's wonderful, Moscow is wonderful.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Might have been his honeymoon, I'm not sure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You don't think necessarily, well, whatever. But you don't necessarily think in terms of marriage, Moscow. And it's wonderful. I'm not knocking it, but I think of Bernie sort of as a socialist but far beyond a socialist.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Elizabeth Warren.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> At least he's true to what he believes, that's one thing because you mention now, Elizabeth Warren. She's not true to it. I call her fairy tale because everything is a fairy tale. That's how Pocahontas got started. Everything is a fairy tale. This woman can't tell the truth.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Michael Bloomberg.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Uh, very little. I just think of little. You know, now he wants a box for the debates to stand on. Okay, it's okay, there's nothing wrong. You can be short. Why should he get a box to stand on, okay? He wants a box for the debates. Why should he be entitled to that? Really. Does that mean everyone else gets a box?
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I guess if they want one, they'll have to negotiate boxes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The other thing that's very interesting, Cory Booker and all these people couldn't get any of the things that Bloomberg is getting now. I think it's very unfair for the Democrats, but I would love to run against Bloomberg. I would love it.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Hillary.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think of emails, I think the email scandal, how she got away with that is a disgrace. I think it's a disgrace.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Pelosi.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Uh, I think she's a very confused, very nervous woman. I don't think she wanted to do this, I think she really knew what was going to happen and it's her worst nightmare has happened. I don't think she's going to be there too long, either. I think that the radical left -- and she's sort of radical left, too, by the way -- but I think the radical left is going to take over.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You've got the Democrats, they're vying to go up against you in 275 days. Is it one candidate running more than another that you'd like to take on?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have to sit back and watch...
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Doesn't matter to you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean I'm watching and I have little nicknames for all of them.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I'm sure they love your nicknames
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But they're accurate. I mean they're very accurate. You look at Sleepy Joe. What's going on with him? He's having a hard time. You look at Bernie. I call him crazy Bernie. They're now sort of rigging the election against him again. I see what's going on. They're rigging it against him.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Coronavirus. Disney's closed. Movie theaters are closed. Hospitals are being built. I think we're now up to our eighth case in the United States. Um, how concerned are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we pretty much shut it down coming in from China. We have a tremendous relationship with China, which is a very positive thing. Getting along with China, getting along with Russia, getting along with these countries...
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Have you offered the Chinese President help with the Coronavirus?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh yeah, no we're offering them tremendous help. We have the best in the world for that. We've done a tremendous job in many other instances also on that even recently. No, no, we've offered China help, but we can't have thousands of people coming in who may have this problem, the Coronavirus. So we're gonna see what happens, but we did shut it down, yes.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I love sports. I think sports mirror life, you know...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's true
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You gotta learn to win, sometimes you don't always win. I know you're not sick of winning, is my guess, but also the harder you work, the better you do, that's very Americana. Um what do you love about sports?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it is. It's sort of a little bit of a microcosm of life. Ya know you have winners, you have champions, you have people that you expect to see that final play. You have great coaches like Belichick. You have people that you expect more out of, and often times they produce, but then you have people that you just don't expect they're gonna do it and often times they don't. It's a microcosm of life.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you for the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you very much.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Thank you for doing this, appreciate it.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> OK. National security is a key issue in Presidential race. Republican frontrunner Donald Trump joins us now by phone. Mr. Trump, good morning to you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Often, people talk about a president getting that 2:00 a.m. Or 3:00 a.m. Phone call when something tragic has happened, either here at home or around the world. So let's go to the hypothetical situation. President Trump gets that 2:00 a.m. phone call. What would you have done?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all, you know, this is a subject that is very dear and near to my heart because I've been talking about it certainly much more than anybody else and it's probably why I'm probably number one in the polls, because of the fact that I say we have to have strong borders.  We have to be very vigilant and careful who we allow into our country.  I know Brussels well and Brussels is a total mess.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Brussels is a -- I'm not talking about the attack today -- I'm talking about generally speaking. It's a city that used to be one of the finest, most beautiful and one of the safest cities in the world. Now, it's a catastrophic, very dangerous city where the police have little control.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> All right, but let me take you back to my question Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's too bad.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> What would you have done first as president of the United States if you got this call?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, as president, I would do probably what I would have been doing for the period of time that I was president. I would be very, very tough on the borders. I would be not allowing certain people to come into this country without absolute, perfect documentation. We're allowing thousands of people already, Matt, to come into our country. They don't have proper documentation. We don't know where they're coming from. They happen to be in the migration. They happen to come from, perhaps Syria, but nobody really knows. They have no idea of telling cause they don't have the documentation.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Neutral> Mr. Trump. which people would you exclude? On what basis? How would you make that determination?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I would exclude the people coming in from Syria that don't have documentation, coming in from the migration line.  That interestingly, have cell phones in many cases.  But you say, how did they get the cell phones and where do they get their bills paid? I would exclude those people from coming in.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The assimilation has been a disaster. You go to Paris and you go to Brussels and you go to other cities, you look at what's happening now with Germany, with Merkel's brilliant move to allow over 1 million people to pour into Germany and that's not working. It's turning out to be catastrophic actually so.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Let me ask you this Mr. Trump. They have, in Belgium, a guy by the name of Salah Abdeslam in custody now. He's said to be the man who planned the Paris attacks of November 13th. They have him in custody. What would you say would be appropriate in terms of what they can do to him at this moment to get any information they can about possible further attacks?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I would say they should be able to do whatever they have to do. They have to get the information and I would say they should be able to do whatever they have to do.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Be specific if you will.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they won't do that because the laws are so liberal over there. They won't do that. But they should be able to do whatever they have to do to get him to give the information. The very sad thing is, he was being guarded and protected by people that were a few doors away from where he lived. They were protecting him and they were guarding him. It was lucky they were able to find him. He was planning another attack. But they didn't find him because people turned him in. Those people were guarding him and protecting him. That's not supposed to be the way the system works.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Negative> When you say do whatever they have to do, can you be specific? I mean, what do you mean by that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm not looking for breaking news on your show, but frankly, the waterboarding, if it was up to me and if we changed the laws -- or have the laws, waterboarding would be fine.  If they want to do -- as long as it's with -- because, you know, we work within laws.  They don't work within laws.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have no laws.  We work within laws.  The waterboarding would be fine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If they can expand the laws, I would do a lot more than waterboarding. You have to get the information from these people and we have to be smart and we have to be tough. We can't be soft and weak, which is what we are right now. When I say we, I'm talking about other countries, also.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Negative> If you talk to experts who do the interrogations, you often time a division. Some people think that harsh interrogation technique works and will deliver you the information, and others say it doesn't work. You'll get false information. Are you in the camp that harsh interrogation, let's use the word, torture, works in a case like this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I am. I am in that camp. I don't believe the other people. I'm in that camp, absolutely. They'll give him -- they'll read him his rights. He'll sit there with a good lawyer. The lawyer won't give -- ten years will go by. By the time it goes by, he won't know anything because the world will have moved on to an even worse place. Now, I am in the camp where you have to get the information, and you have to get it rapidly.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Well, let's keep in mind -- draw the distinction here, Abdeslam is being held by Belgium law enforcement, not by a military unit or by some intelligence service, like was the case in this country when the CIA took suspects to secret sites in other countries. He's held by the Belgium justice system.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's OK. I mean, he's being held by whoever. Let the military take him over. They have to get their act together. Belgium is no longer Belgium. Belgium is not the Belgium you and I knew, Matt, from 20 years ago, which was one of the most beautiful cities and one of the safest cities in the world. Belgium is a horror show right now and you know, terrible things are happening. People are leaving. People are afraid. This all happened because, frankly, there's no assimilation. They are not assimilating. They're not assimilating in other locations either so we have a reason.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> I just have -- just a couple of seconds...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They want to go by Sharia law. They want Sharia law. They don't want laws that we have. They want Sharia law. You know, you say to yourself, at what point? How much of this do you take? And what we're doing is we're allowing thousands and thousands of these people into our country. We're going to have nothing but problems, as sure as you're sitting there.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> In just the 30 seconds I have left, Mr. Trump, what would you say to the American people on a morning like this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would say to the American people that we are going to be very strong. We are going to be very vigilant and we're going to be very tough. We're not going to allow this to happen to our country. If it does happen, we're going to find the people that did it and they're going to suffer greatly.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Mr. Trump. Donald Trump, thank you very much for joining us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK. Thank you very much.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> I want to mention… I want to mention that we asked Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton to join us this morning and she declined. Donald Trump joins us by phone now. Mr. Trump, good morning to you.
