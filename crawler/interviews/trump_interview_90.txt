<Jacqueline Policastro> <Positive> Hello Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nice to see you.
<Jacqueline Policastro> <Neutral> Likewise.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How are you?
<Jacqueline Policastro> <Positive> I'm doing well, thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very good.
<Jacqueline Policastro> <Negative> Mr. President, you're not on the ballot, but you're the leader of the Republican party. How personal is this race for you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's really not personal at all. We've done a great job. We have the best economy the country has ever had. People are running individual races. I'll take all the blame, and I'll take all the credit if they want. But it's really not about me. It's about -- we have great people, great Republicans, running.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It feels very much like '16. The Election Day, and just previous to Election Day of '16, there was a spirit that nobody has ever seen in politics. And, it really feels very much like that. I -- I just think we're going to do very well. I think Republicans are going to do very well. We'll see.
<Jacqueline Policastro> <Positive> Your administration has accomplished a lot of your promises already. But if Democrats win big, that could all change. Have you thought about how you'll handle it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we'll just have to fight it out, and we'll see, and maybe they'll come their senses. And, you know, one of the reasons I think they're not doing very well is the fact that they've become very angry. We say they've become mob-like, but the truth is, that's really what's happening.
<Jacqueline Policastro> <Positive> In our own Gray Television polls, voters in several states told use health care is a top concern. Why should voters trust Republicans to handle this issue, because Democrats say you're going to take away health care.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's just the opposite. We're the ones that are really going to protect it. And if you remember, we -- we got rid of the individual mandate, which was the most unpopular part of Obamacare. We have premiums down to a very low level. The lowest level they've been in a long time...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I agree, the Democrats seem to have the edge, PR-wise -- public relations-wise -- but we've actually done a much better job with health care than they have, and we're the ones that are fixing it.
<Jacqueline Policastro> <Positive> There's a lot dividing Americans right now. No matter what happens on Election Day, our nation will look to you, the President, to bring people together. How do you plan to get it done?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think success is bringing us together. I think it's much more together than people would understand. We have an election coming up, and after the election, you'll see a difference in tone, I believe.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You certainly will from our standpoint. We have the greatest economy -- literally on Friday -- the greatest economy in the history of our country. It's being run by the Republicans and myself. Nobody's done what we've done in less than two years.
<Jacqueline Policastro> <Positive> Well, Mr. President, we certainly appreciate your time. Thanks so much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.
<Operator> <Neutral> Sir, your call is connected.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi Bob.
<John Melendez> <Neutral> Hey, how are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> How are you? Congratulations on everything. We're proud of you. Congratulations, great job. You went through a tough, tough situation and not I think a very fair situation. But congratulations.
<John Melendez> <Positive> Thank you so much. And I'm sorry to bother you, Mr. President, but honestly my constituents are giving me a lot of beef about this immigration thing. I know that you didn't something really noble, like, you know, by trying to, you know, put kids back with their families, but I have to answer to that. What can I tell them that you're going to do moving forward?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well Bob, let me just tell you, I want to be able to take care of the situation every bit as much as anybody else. At the top level, I'd like to do the larger solution rather than the smaller solution. You know... they're doing it step-by-step. I think we can do the whole thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have a good relationship with the party. You have a good relationship with the party, and I think we can do a real immigration bill. We have to have security at the border. We have to have it. I mean, look, you have... 60% of the country says we have to have security at the border. And that's because [Inaudible] you Bob. It's not like it's good for you or good for me. It's good for both of us. [Crosstalk] you know, of the problem.
<John Melendez> <Negative> No, I understand that. But, no but I am Hispanic. So I have to, you know I have to, you know I have to,  I'm sorry, but I have them, I have to look after my people as well. You understand.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I agree. I agree. So Bob, here's what... let me do this. I'm on Air Force One. I'm just coming back from an amazing rally in North Dakota actually.
<John Melendez> <Positive> Yeah I saw the speech. I saw the speech.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible], you know it's a tough, it's a tough road. Say it again.
<John Melendez> <Negative> No, I saw the speech, and I thought it was, I thought it was a great speech. [Crosstalk] If I could just ask you one more thing, Mr. President. As far as the new Justice. I'm sure you heard, I'm sure you know that Justice Kennedy is retiring. And, you know, Justice... Justice Kennedy was a Reagan appointee. Are you, I'm begging you, are you going to go more moderate, or do you think you're going to go more conservative?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I haven't looked... I mean I have a list of people. I have a big list of people Bob, and we'll take a look at it, and we're going to make a decision, I'll probably make it over the next couple of weeks.
<John Melendez> <Positive> Because I promise you, you will have my vote... I will help you if you don't go too, too conservative. You know what I'm saying?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Well we will talk to you about it. We're gonna probably make a decision, Bob, over the next two weeks. We'll have, I think we're gonna have... we have some really great choices, and be done over the next 12 to 14 days.
<John Melendez> <Positive> Well, the point is, keep me informed. Good luck on the trip, and thank you so much for taking my call.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You take care. I will speak to you soon, Bob. Take care of yourself.
<John Melendez> <Positive> Alright thanks. Thanks Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you Bob. I'll talk to you soon. Bye.
<John Melendez> <Positive> Alright. Baba booey to you.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Donald Trump joins us now fresh off that win in New Hampshire. Mr. Trump, good morning. Good to have you here.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Positive> Good morning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Known you more than 30 years. You've always said you're a winner. Last night was the first time that voters went into the polls and officially made you a winner. How does it feel?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It feels great. The people are fantastic from New Hampshire. I mean, I've had a bonding relationship with them for a long time. I've been up there long before the political thing. And I said I was going to do well there and we did, I guess, even better than anticipated. But would have rallies where, you know, ten times the number of people would show up than -- than we expected. We got to see it from an early point. I think South Carolina, frankly, is going to be very similar to that.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> You doubled up on John Kasich. You've already said you are sure you can beat Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. Are you the favorite to be the next president of the United States?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That, I don't know.  I don't want to talk about favorites.  I think we're doing very well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have something very special.  Two days ago, I was in South Carolina and we filled up the stadium.  It was packed with people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And just something going on, it's a movement. People want to see a smart country. They want to see us take the country back. They want great deals, not horrible deals. We lose money with trade. We can't win with the military. We can't beat ISIS. Think of General George Patton not being able to beat ISIS. It doesn't work that way and they want to see smart things happen for our country. You know, in a -- I said it last night. We don't win anymore. This country doesn't win anymore. We're going to start winning again.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Positive> New Hampshire definitely shook up the rest of the race and kind of reordered things. Who do you see as your biggest competition now? Is it Kasich? Is it Cruz in South Carolina?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I -- I -- yeah. It's a great question, but I think all of them. I mean, they're all accomplished people. They're governors and senators. They're all very good people. Maybe, you know. But I think, probably, I wouldn't want to pick one because they're close enough, and we'll see what happens. But they're all accomplished people.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> It's serious now, Mr. Trump. I mean, now people are going to take a good, hard look at you and say, can he be the leader of the free world? Can he be our president?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They've been looking at me, Matt, for six months.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> OK. But now...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This isn't just...
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Now this New Hampshire win, though says OK, this guy is on track. When it comes to parents in this country, they want their kids to be able to look up to the president. They want to be able to admire the president. You were on with us last week and we talked to you about being more subdued. You said, I'm trying to become more statesmanlike, more subdued. This week, you continued using some words, repeating a word that a supporter said to you at an event that I'm not going to repeat here. Is that statesmanlike?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, we had a massive rally, 5,000 people in a snowstorm -- in a blizzard, and everybody was having a good time. And a woman, not a man, a woman shouted out this word, and then shouted it out again.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Negative> But you didn't have to repeat it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But we had a good time and it wasn't the worst thing in the world.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Neutral> But how...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, the problem with the country...
<Savannah Guthrie> <Negative> But that's the point, though. If you're a presidential candidate that we have to bleep it, is that really what you want to show?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If I got close, I wouldn't ever do it.  But we were having a tremendous time.  I got a standing ovation for doing that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Everybody was up and down, standing, screaming.  It was an amazing event and it's one of the reasons I won.  You have to be yourself.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, as I get -- look, I was a good student at the best school and all of that stuff. I know what to do and what not to do. But I will say this, as you get closer, you act a little bit differently. We were having a good time. Those people went out and voted for me and that's why we got, you know, the numbers we did. Look, this country, political correctness is killing us in so many different ways.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Positive> Is it political correctness or is it just good manners, temperament, demeanor?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't think so. No. I don't think -- it wasn't the worst thing in the world. We all had a good time. And remember this, it was a woman and it was a repeat. It wasn't me. In fact, I said you should never say that word. You should never say that word...
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> And then sarcastically repeated the word.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Of course. And then, did I reprimand the woman? I said...
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> You can't reprimand someone if you're going to be willing to say the word...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no. I said...
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> .... yourself.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said you are hereby reprimanded. This way, I figured I'd save myself from the press.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Real quickly, when are you going to release your tax returns?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Probably over the next few months. They're being worked on now.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> What's the hold up?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're very -- well, they're very big tax returns. The biggest -- I guarantee you this, the biggest ever in the history of what we're doing. So it's very complicated stuff. But we'll be releasing that.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Neutral> Will people be surprised at the rate that you pay,?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think they'll be surprised...
<Savannah Guthrie> <Negative> Lower or higher than expected?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... at how little I pay. You know, they're going to be surprised at how little I pay. I fight like hell not to pay a lot of tax. And you know, what? Every politician probably does. I watched others where they say, I want to pay taxes. I fight like hell not to pay taxes. I hate the way the government spends my money.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> The big winner in New Hampshire, Donald Trump. Thank you for very much.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Positive> Thank you for being here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you very much.
<Cokie Roberts> <Negative> In Seattle this week, the meeting of the World Trade Organization broke down with nothing accomplished. It sparked some of the most violent protests that will live on in the minds of Americans. Many political implications. Trade's become a major part of the campaigns for all the political parties, especially the Reform Party. Withdrawing from the WTO is part of that party's platform. Donald Trump, a potential Reform Party presidential candidate, is touting the party line. But one of his biggest fans, Jesse Ventura, finds himself on the other side of the wing. First, my conversation with Donald Trump in New York City's Trump Tower.
<Cokie Roberts> <Negative> This week we've been seeing demonstrations in Seattle. You think they had something to demonstrate about.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I happen to think that the World Trade Organization is not necessarily fair to America. I do think that, in many cases, the workers know a lot more than the people that are representing us in trade. Our trade is a disaster with other countries. You look at what Japan's done to us and so many other countries. You can just -- just keep naming them. It's a joke, and I think that this country is a disaster. We don't have our best and our smartest and our brightest. We have people negotiating trade that maybe never negotiated before. And if you look at other countries, they have their smartest, their toughest, their best negotiators, and we're not going to beat them unless we get ours.
<Cokie Roberts> <Neutral> So your saying that Charlene Barshefsky and the secretary of commerce don't know how to negotiate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would absolutely say that. I will say that affirmatively.
<Cokie Roberts> <Positive> Now, Jesse Ventura, who has been in your corner in -- in the Reform Party, disagrees with you completely. He says Minnesota is thriving as a result of this trade.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I think certain areas do thrive. I think certain areas are not. I mean, I'm not a NAFTA fan, I'm not a World Trade Organization fan. I'm really a big trade fan. I think we should be trading, but we should be trading on a fair basis. We're not trading on a fair basis right now. Look, the United States has been a sucker for many, many years on world trade. That's why our deficits are so -- you know, in China, we lose a hundred billion dollars to China, and then we have a problem with North Korea, and China won't help us because nobody speaks to them properly. Not tough, properly.
<Cokie Roberts> <Negative> The other big issue that's happened this week is George W. Bush has put out his tax plan. What do you think of it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think it's aggressive enough. I don't think it's going to be a plan that's going to keep the economy going anywhere near even what it is. I think we need a bigger tax cut than this plan. I think this plan is very timid. I was surprised. I thought -- I thought that his plan was very timid.
<Cokie Roberts> <Negative> And your own plan would put, what, 14 1/2 percent tax...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's just one...
<Cokie Roberts> <Positive> ...on anybody with net worth of $ 10 million.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's just one -- that's just one of the points of the plan. It's 14 1/4 percent on people that have a net worth of over $ 10 million.
<Cokie Roberts> <Neutral> How would you get that through Congress?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, right now in Washington -- and you know better than I do and better than anybody does, perhaps, you have nothing but gridlock. I don't think you'd have gridlock if I were involved.
<Cokie Roberts> <Positive> So you think that by the strength of your personality and your ability to negotiate, you could make Congress do what you wanted it to do?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, I do.
<Cokie Roberts> <Neutral> And they're all...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Not necessarily by strength of personality. I think by ideas and by doing the right thing, I believe that they would do what's right.
<Cokie Roberts> <Neutral> In this Senate race, who are you going to be giving money to?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think Rudy Guiliani is fantastic, and I assume you're talking about the New York race with Hillary.
<Cokie Roberts> <Positive> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Rudy's been the greatest mayor that the city has ever had. New York City's the hottest city in the world right now. You know, I happen to be the biggest developer in the hottest city, so that's a very cool thing. You know, unlike Pat Buchanan -- who goes back to Crossfire if he can get the job
<Cokie Roberts> <Positive> You talk about being the biggest developer in the hottest city. This beautiful building that we're in had a tax abatement...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sure.
<Cokie Roberts> <Negative> ...from the city of New York. How does that square with your defense of the little people? Wouldn't the mayor have been better off getting those taxes?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I might not have built this building without a tax abatement, you know, without a tax incentive. I call it a tax incentive. But without the tax incentive, it's possible the Trump Tower wouldn't have been built. It was built, it became very successful, it's extremely successful today, and it's been great for a lot of people, and it employs a lot of -- a lot of workers and people. But perhaps more importantly, it's been a great symbol for New York. And you know, New York is -- New York is hot because of a lot of things, but also because of these great buildings that have been built.
<Cokie Roberts> <Negative> So you didn't take the city...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Many of which have been built by me, by the way.
<Cokie Roberts> <Neutral> You didn't take they city for a ride the way you say the Japanese are taking the Americans for a ride?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, and -- and I'm working within the system. I mean, you know, tax abatements are available. I don't want to be the dummy who says...
<Cokie Roberts> <Neutral> You had the first...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ...'You know what?'
<Cokie Roberts> <Negative> You had the first tax abatement.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I -- I -- I -- I'm very proud to say that I did. For the Grand Hyatt Hotel, for this, and -- and I don't think there's anything wrong with that. A tax abatement can be a very good thing. And I really do like calling it 'tax incentive.' But tax incentive-slash-abatement can be a very, very positive economic development tool.
<Cokie Roberts> <Neutral> Particularly for the developer.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, for a lot of people. I mean, a lot of people benefit by it. A lot of people that move into the building that have to pay much more if the abatement weren't available.
<Cokie Roberts> <Negative> Mr. Trump, the only people we've ever elected president who've not been elected to another office won wars -- George Washington, Ulysses Grant, Dwight Eisenhower. Why would we take you seriously running for president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I mean, if you look at the other candidates -- give me a break. Now, I made billions of dollars. Do you think that they would have made billions of dollars? I don't think so. Now, I'm not saying that's the sole criteria, but I run a big business. I'm a huge employer. I'm -- I -- I have thousands of people that work for me, thousands and thousands. I have a company with great spirit. I have a -- a very -- in the most competitive world, which is, I think, probably New York City. I'm the biggest at what I do and the best at what I do. And it's company with spirit. I mean, I have great spirit.
<Cokie Roberts> <Negative> Some of them have gone bankrupt. Four of them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have 70 some-odd companies. Every once in a while -- again, you take advantage of the system. It's called the system. And in order to take advantage of the system that we're in, sometimes, on occasion -- seldom, in my case -- but you take a company, and you do -- in my case, I did a couple of [Inaudible]. It worked out great for me, because that's what I'm supposed to do, I'm supposed to make money. But I could be making money for the American people as opposed to letting us get ripped off like we have by other nations. And they're ripping us. And they're ripping us big league, Cokie, and you know it.
<Cokie Roberts> <Neutral> And so this decision, still February time table..
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. I think February time table. I'm doing this because I think I could do a really good job at it for a lot of people. And I think a lot of people would benefit. You'd have lower taxes. You'd have a -- you'd have a better country. If I didn't think that, I wouldn't do it, because I'm liking what I do right now.
<Cokie Roberts> <Positive> OK. Thank you so much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Cokie Roberts> <Positive> Thanks for having us here at your palace.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's been a great honor. Thank you.
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> That's Donald Trump's side.
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> [A cab driver told me,] I'm bothered by all this. I'm hearing about he's a racist. So it's a little – I asked him, how do you decide whether that's true? What would Trump have to do to show you that he's not? And the guy said -- he paused and he said, I don't know. He said, he has to show some love. So I want to throw that at you as a question of -- I mean, it's one of these [Crosstalk] --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I understand what he said.
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> -- you can't crawl back from, right? It gets out there. It's in the sewer system. How do you counter that? How do you disprove a word like that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I am not a racist. And you know, I'm the least racist person that you've ever interviewed to put it a different way. I'll give you an example. It's funny. I just got this. It was just sent to me - Don King, okay? Now, Don knows more about racism than anybody. Look, he owns this newspaper. You know, Don's made a lot of money. And he just sent this to me. Look at this. It's his newspaper. Isn't that funny?
<Marc Fisher> <Positive> It's great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And Don King endorsed me. You guys, I don't know if you want to take that back with you.
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> Yeah, sure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This could be a story. This just came out. He just delivered it to my office. But that one page is -- that's the rest of the newspaper. But look at the one page at the back with Bernie Sanders.
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Isn't that funny?
<Marc Fisher> <Positive> It's great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He endorsed Trump for president, Bernie Sanders. There's Don King. Now, Don King knows racism probably better than anybody. He's not endorsing a racist, okay. You want to use it? You can have the story. It just came out. I just got it ten minutes ago. I don't know, whatever.
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> But are you concerned? People will have this impression. How do you fight against it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not concerned. And actually, I'm not concerned because I don't think people believe it. And you know, it's just something that -- who was this taxi cab, was he African-American or was he --?
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> No. I think he was a Pakistani.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I see. I don't believe that people believe it. And it's something that has never been -- you know, only at a political campaign would people say things like that. But Bill Clinton was called a racist by Obama, okay? And I don't believe he's a racist. But he's called and I'm telling you that. I mean but he was called a racist by Obama and very loudly and very strongly. And to this day, Clinton, he is haunted by that. He hated that. And I do, too. But I don't think people believe Clinton is a racist. I don't think they believe that I'm a racist. Remember that episode? It's very serious. Hi. How are you doing?
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> Hi. How is it going?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is Ivanka and Don. The Washington Post. [Crosstalk]
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> Ivanka. Nice to see you. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How are you doing? The kids okay?
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> Everything is good. Yeah.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Negative> Obviously, this will come out or not?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just got the endorsement of Don King.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> Oh, wow.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Interesting. He sent me two of these things. Don King for president and Bernie Sanders -- it's sort of funny. Look.
<Ivanka Trump> <Negative> Oh my gosh.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> His newspaper. He owns a newspaper, so Mohammad Ali.
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> A dream team, uh-huh.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Huh?
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> Dream team.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He calls it the dream team.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> Amazing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Only Don King, Big Don. So anyway, I'll be here for a little while, honey. Then I'll see you.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> Awesome. We'll come back.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> Yeah. We'll come back.
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> See you later.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> One thing I get a lot of credit for is my children. They're good children. And they've been smart. They went to great schools. Always got top of the line marks, grades. And they're good kids. Many people have come to me and say, could you see my children and talk to them? And I tell them, no drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes. I tell them this living standard. But because it's put people at such a disadvantage -- such an unbelievable disadvantage. But you just saw my two kids come in so they'll come back later.
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> I don't know if you saw the piece that we did on your sons where they talked to one of our reporters. And they talked about being brought up by you. And they both made the same observation which was that in the early years, you were busy with your business, you were a little distant. And then later, you had become much closer particularly as they became of age to spend time with you in the office and doing work.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true. The business I already have that [sounds like]. I mean I love my children but I got to know my children much better after they graduated from college in a sense because they came to work here.
<Marc Fisher> <Positive> And was it like that with your father as well? Was he that way?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I had a great father. My father and I were like very close. We had a very, very close relationship. He was like me in the sense that he was business oriented. His life was business and he loved business. But I don't think of it that way. I don't think of a divide like that. I didn't see him. I know I had that article that was written. I heard it was a nice article. I'm going to see it, I'll be reading it. Honestly, if I would -- look, this came out. This is The New York Times Magazine, the cover. If I read everyone three-fourth a day, if I read everyone in the [indiscernible] but if I read everyone, I wouldn't have time. But I don't think of the divide of, you know, boom, 21, you graduate from college and you go to work. Because I just had a very good relationship with my parents, like extraordinary actually.
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> Would you describe them as warm or as distant?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. My mother was very warm and a very loving mother. My father was equally loving but a little more business-like. And my mother had a great sense of pageantry. She had a great sense of glamour. She's beautiful as a woman. She was very beautiful but she had a great sense of pageantry and glamour. My father wasn't into that as much. So maybe I've gotten a combination of them. But he wasn't into those. But they were both great. I had great parents. I had great parents.
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> So we'll arrange around [indiscernible].
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> A couple of father questions.
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> So because we're doing the book, it's just very small. So I'm trying to get a few quick questions. I know time will be limited. We got so many things we need to ask you. So I was trying to check a few things. Your father, was his region originally -- what was his religion?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Protestant.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> Protestant. Was he Lutheran or what was it exactly?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He was Presbyterian.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> I know he was later.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, later he was Presbyterian. I think possibly Lutheran.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> Possibly Lutheran. Protestant for sure?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> Okay. Where did they take their honeymoon?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In Niagara Falls.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> Niagara Falls? Okay. Because I've read in the south, in Atlantic City, I have not read Niagara Falls.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. They went to Niagara Falls.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> That's why I checked because what we've read elsewhere is the south. So, Niagara Falls, okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They had a very good marriage. They were married for a long time, 60 something. But --
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> Were they tough disciplinarians? Did they believe in spanking? How did they handle it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. My mother was an unbelievable mother but she was strong. Warm, as I said before, but very strong. No, they never believed in spanking but they believed in threatening spanking. Does that make sense to you?
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She would talk it but she wouldn't do it. And my father was less involved from that standpoint early on. It was really more my mother. But he was strong. But yeah, I think in a certain way, my mother was tougher on the children in terms of discipline than my father at the early stage which is interesting.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> I saw a video in which your father gave a talk after receiving the Horatio Alger Award.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> Remember that day?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was there.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> You were there, I know, because he referred to you in being there. And in that talk, first of all, it was true for him. His father died young. Did that impact your father? Did that impact the family that your grandfather had died so young?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we never really knew him because my father was very young when he died. He died of pneumonia. And he went to Alaska. And he was hunting for gold. It was very interesting. And he died at a young age. And rather than doing gold, he actually -- I don't know, this was glamorous about him, I guess, maybe not. Not hotels -- not like what we're building in Washington, right?
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, I'm more than a year ahead of schedule. It will open in September. We'll have the grand opening in October something. And that hotel is going to be amazing. The Old Post Office, [indiscernible] about the Old Post Office.
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> Right. I once worked across the street, as a matter of fact.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, really? It's great. I'd say the building is great. You see how nice that's [sounds like] looking?
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> Your father was saying in that speech while accepting the award that talked about people who don't have passion amount to nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> When you were growing up, were you told that and did you have a concern that you might not meet your father's expectations, in other words, that you might be a nothing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. My father never talked about success and he never talked about passion. And he wasn't a speaker. For instance, if he saw me speaking in front of 25,000 to 30,000 people all the time, he would be sort of like -- he wasn't something -- I remember so well the Horatio Alger Award where he wrote out something very specifically and he practiced it. And it was really a nice day in Brooklyn. It was in Brooklyn. I think a college in Brooklyn. But my father didn't talk it, but I learned from example. In other words, my father loved -- he was a worker. He's a hard worker. But he was a very content person. He was very happy and content. He had a wonderful wife. He had a good family. But he was a very content person. So he wouldn't say work, work, work. But I would see that he enjoyed what he did. And I learned that way not so much by his words but by his actions. So does that make sense to you?
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> Uh-huh. So there was a day in 1976, he was down at Prince George's County, Maryland looking at a housing project. Do you know what I'm talking about?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Prince George's, yeah.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> He was arrested.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He was?
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> You didn't know this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> He was arrested. The bond was $1,000. There was a Washington Post reporter who works at The Post who wrote the story in '76. So I can show you that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> My father was arrested?
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> Your father was arrested.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> For what?
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> It was a housing code violation matter. It was a $1,000 bond. He called someone in New York, I didn't know if it was you, that's the reason I was asking the question. If you don't remember this, obviously, it wasn't you. But he called someone at the company in '76. You were working there at the time to arrange for the $1,000.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I never knew he was -- I never heard that at all.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> In Prince George's County, there was a housing development there. You know what I'm talking about?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, yeah, sure.
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> And you worked there as a kid, I read.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, I did. Well, it's a rough area.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This was not like it is today in terms of what I do. You know, he had some pretty tough jobs. Prince George's County was rough.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> What did you do in that development?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Prince George's County was much different that it is right now which is rough. Well, I started out as -- I started out in '70 -- in 1970. Yeah, so I would have been there. Well, you said 1970 --
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> In '76 he was arrested. What did you do? What did you do at that housing development? This was lowincome housing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I knew it very -- yeah, it was lowincome housing. I knew it very well. And I would go there with my father sometimes. And he bought it. It was bought at a distress sale which we like doing like Swifton Village in Cincinnati and other places which we really liked doing. But I never heard the story. Yeah, I was generally just -- I'd go there. I'd go there sometimes by myself and I say, "Pop, this is a rough piece of property here." That was dangerous. That was a dangerous territory. And we did fine with it. And we had it for quite a few years. We sold it ultimately, but that was a rough area.
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> And were you collecting rent or --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, collecting rent.
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> Just like you did at Trump Village sort of?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Trump Village and Swifton Village in Cincinnati. Yeah.
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> One New York Military question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know when you collect rent -- and you may have heard this but you never stand in front of the door. And you always knock this way because you get bad things coming through that door like bad things.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> What was the worst thing that happened to you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it didn't happen to me. But I'd be collecting rent and sometimes I'd be with rent collectors, you know, professional guys. Not bad people. But I noticed one of the first -- because my father's property, some of the properties were rough property. It wasn't what you read like so glamourized. Believe me, it was tough stuff. And these guys, they never stand by the door. And they knock on the door like this. And you get a lot of stuff coming through that door sometimes. It's tough stuff but this was a tough job, the Washington one.
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> One New York Military Academy question, some of the classmates and others have told us there was kind of a hazing system where students would paddle the young ones when they commit infractions. Were you ever on either the receiving or giving end of that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I saw very little of that. I mean I think that's common in a lot of different places. But I saw very little of that. I have really good things to say. In fact, Major Dobias just died.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> Oh, did he?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He died. He died yesterday. He was a wonderful guy. He was a coach. He was my coach. And he said wonderful things. He said I'm the best baseball player he has ever seen, that he had ever had, that he had ever coached. He coached a lot of good players, a lot of good teams. But he was a good guy. A tough guy. He was tough. But yeah, he died yesterday. Can you believe it?
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> In his 90s wasn't it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Ninety-two or something.
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> In one of your books, you wrote --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He fell and they found -- after he fell, they found that he had cancer. He fell and broke his leg. He went to the hospital. They found that he had cancer.
<Marc Fisher> <Positive> In one of your books, you wrote that your father's death made you feel a new kind of responsibility or you have the responsibility to make the world a better place.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Loneliness and responsibility, because I was really close to my father.
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> So did that play a role at all in your decision to go into politics? Was that part of that same sense of responsibility?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think so. I think that -- I was very happy doing whatever he is doing. I mean, fellows, I was really happy doing what I was doing. The company is really good. It's doing really well. We have now 121 jobs all over the world under negotiation, like we're opening one up in Vancouver. Very shortly I'm going to probably go there during the campaign. We're opening a magnificent building in Vancouver, Canada. I've been focusing worldwide on different things. We have 121 jobs right now. I haven't counted three or four days ago. So many jobs and they're either under construction or under very good negotiations, and they're great jobs. If it's around here, like Turnberry is opening. Now I own a 100 percent of Turnberry. Turnberry is one of the great resorts of the world. Here's a thing that just came out. I shouldn't even show this to you. This is Golf Digest. They're talking about the most important courses in the world and they're talking about the [unintelligible]. Those are the British Open courses. This guy rates the British open courses as 14 out of 14 courses so these are the elite. So they go, Turnberry is rated number 3 after St. Andrews and then another one. So they go, "If it weren't for Donald Trump, who owns it, I would have ranked it number 1. I would have ranked Turnberry number 1. But dropping it further down the list beyond 3 would have given Trump too much credit." Now there's a guy that hates Trump. That's a hater. So he said, Turnberry would have been number 1, except that I own it. Now, how do you write that? Isn't that disgusting? So they rated it number 3.
<Marc Fisher> <Positive> It's a backhanded compliment.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, in one way, I don't know. I say, I'm not sure if I like that or don't like it, but I guess you can say that. Go ahead. When is your book coming up?
<Marc Fisher> <Positive> August 23rd.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It comes out?
<Marc Fisher> <Positive> It comes out, yeah. So we've obviously talked to a lot of people who've worked with you and so on. I'm interested in your friendships over time. Is it difficult in your life to have very close friends that you had? Do you have people who you turn to with any self-doubts or your personal issues? Are there such people in your life?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's an interesting question. Most of my friendships are business-related because those are the only people I meet. The people I meet really, I guess I could say socially when you go out to a charity event or something. For the most part the people I meet are people that are businessrelated. I think I have a lot of friends and some of the friends I haven't spoken to in many years. I have people that I haven't spoken to in years, but I think they're friends. But it just seems that most -- many of the people that I really know and deal with and get along with –- I mean I think I have a lot of friends but they're not friends like perhaps other people have friends where they're together all the time and they go out to dinner all the time. I have a lot of good relationships. Richard LeFrak is a good friend.
<Marc Fisher> <Positive> Is there anyone right now in your life who you would turn to and tell the things about the campaign or your personal --?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> More of my family. And you saw two of them who just came in. I think, more of my family. Again, I have a lot of good friends. I have a lot of good relationships. I have good enemies too, which is okay. But I think more of my family than others. I have a very good relationship in my marriage with Melania. With my children, I get along with my children a lot.
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> You and I have talked about Steve Hyde who was one of your closest business associates at the time.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, you got it.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> We talked about the terrible helicopter crash. How does that affect you? Does that make you less likely to be close to someone given the way that this person vanished in an instant when you're so close?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He worked for me and he was a very good guy. He was a Mormon. He used to give a lot of his money that he made to the Mormon Church. As I remember, we might have even paid it directly to the church. In other words, we paid X number of times. He was a great guy. The whole group – that group that went down, those were the --
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> To this day, it's one of the tragic days of your life, as we've discussed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Not only that, I was doing great in Atlantic City. Now in all fairness that whole world started to change. It just started to get a lot of competition. I would say the guys that took over the one place, there was Jack.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> We've talked about that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Who was not --
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> Since we're short on time, I know we've had this conversation --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Steve Hyde was really good at what he did.
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> Some political questions, someone said who worked for you for years that you saw Nixon here frequently.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who was it?
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> Someone who've worked for you told one of our reporters that --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Nixon?
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> -- you saw Nixon frequently. I knew you'd seen Nixon but I didn't know if it was really frequently.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have seen him and I actually had dinner with him a couple of times, but not frequently.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> Not frequently?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> Is there some lesson you take [sounds like]?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He wrote a letter to me that I just saw, if I could find it, it would be so amazing.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> This letter where Pat had seen you on a TV show and said –-
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes. Did you see the letter?
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> We've either seen it or had it read to us. I can't remember now but we've had –-
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She said he'd be one of the great politicians and he wrote me that letter. Maybe you don't need it.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> No, we're quoting it, so if there's anything, any documentation you want to show us.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Who read that letter? Somebody else said that, right?
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> Who was it? I don't remember now from my head whether it was -– someone's name.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I had it here.
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> But someone who's familiar with that read it to us so it's definitely in the book. Let me ask you another political question. You mentioned fundraising. In 2001, Hillary was running for the U.S. Senate of New York. You had a fundraiser for the state Democratic Party in your apartment.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It could be.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> Remember that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> She was there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> So you've helped raise money with her running for that. Did you vote for her for the U.S. Senate?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who was she running against?
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> Rick Lazio.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You have to understand that for the most part in New York, whoever gets the Democratic nomination wins.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> Did you vote for Hillary Clinton?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I never say who I'm going to vote for, I never tell. I know. But I did have a fundraiser for the party at the time. I think you know and I've said it pretty loud and clear that I get along with all politicians. I felt it was an obligation to get along, including with the Clintons and including with a lot of other people. It was very important for me to get along with politicians in my business.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> Can you tell us briefly when did you first meet her? How many times would you have met? I know she went to your wedding obviously. We have the bare bones but I wonder if you could give us some insight.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would have said that I met them when they came to New York. I didn't meet him or know him when he was president.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> At all?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, not at all. I would have met them sometime after she decided to run for the Senate. I helped them out a little bit, but I helped out everybody. I was the king of getting along with politicians.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> You changed your registration five, six, or seven times according to your [Crosstalk].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Different things. Well, I was thinking about running at different points under different parties. I was a Democrat. I was thinking about heading a party called the Reform Party. The problem is in New York you have to go very early. You probably saw that. You have to go very early when you change if you're going to do something. I went to the Reform Party and then ultimately I went back to the Republican Party. I was viewing it from the standpoint of possibly running for office, possibly running for president. A lot of people want me to run for mayor so badly. I never really wanted to run for mayor, but they really wanted me to run for mayor.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> What do you say to someone who says, he's a chameleon? He changed his registration. He doesn't have a core set of beliefs where he would have stayed a Republican or Democrat [Crosstalk].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it had to do more with practicality because if you're going to run for office, you would have had to make friends. It's the Reform Party at the time. It was looking like it was good but after I checked it out, it wasn't so good. And then I changed it back to Republican. But I was thinking about running under the Reform Party. A little bit like Ross Perot did.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> For mayor, you backed the Democratic candidate, that was -- who lost. You backed the other Democratic person who won the primary and the Republican candidate was the one who actually won, Michael Bloomberg.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I actually backed Bloomberg also and I backed Bloomberg after his first term. Once I get to know him, I backed him. Should he have run –-
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> He's probably capable of something now, don't you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it would have been very hard for him. I think it doesn't matter. I think there's more strength in what you're looking at now than people have any understanding of. Believe me, I think it would have been very hard for him.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> Just to get my facts straight. In the first race when Bloomberg ran, you backed a Democratic candidate but –-
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who's the Democratic candidate?
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> Green was the eventual candidate. There was the guy, a Hispanic candidate. I forgot his name at the top off my head, who you backed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I actually backed a Hispanic candidate.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> Right, exactly. You did. That person lost to Green.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He lost to Green but I backed a Hispanic candidate.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> You did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Which tells you something. Okay. He was a very nice guy and a very good guy. He lost to Green. I will tell you that when we talk about endorsements, my [sic] endorsement of Bobby Knight was a powerful endorsement. The fact that Tom Brady liked me up in Massachusetts was certainly a great help because I got almost 50 percent in Massachusetts. But of all endorsements, when Rudy Giuliani backed Michael Bloomberg, Michael was losing by a great percentage to the Democrats. Meaning, it was very, very hard. Even with wealth, it was very hard for a Republican to win. But Rudy Giuliani was the mayor and after the World Trade Center came down, there was no more popular person than Rudy. When Rudy backed Michael Bloomberg, Michael went up ten points. This was a couple of days before the election. I always say, when people say endorsements don't mean anything, they're 99 percent correct. But this was an endorsement that made –- I don't know if you remember that. I've never seen anything like it. Michael won by four or five points from being down to –- it could have been a 15-point endorsement. Back to Hispanic, a very good guy who lost. I think he lost to Green actually. Yeah, he lost to Green in the primaries. Then after that I don't think I was involved. Then I actually backed Bloomberg after that.
<Marc Fisher> <Positive> Let me take you back, you had expressed an interest at one point in buying the World Trade Center.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I did.
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> You met with Peter Goldmark from the Port Authority. I don't know if you remember that meeting, but the way it was told to us, you told him that you were interested in the property. That if you went to Governor Carey and said that quote, unquote, he wasn't interested, that there would be ramifications for him, that you would have his job or in some way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't talk that way. I really don't talk that way. I know that's probably an image, but I don't talk like that. I will say I had a good relationship with Governor Carey. He was a great guy. He was a great crisis person. He was unbelievable under crisis. What I did and maybe what you're talking about more is that I'm responsible for the Jacob Javits Convention Center. I'm totally responsible. I had the land under option from the Penn Central and they were trying to build a convention center opposite Hell's Kitchen, right on 44th Street on the other side of the West Side Highway, which was a problem by itself. You couldn't get across and all of this. They couldn't get their permits. Some things never change because you're building on the river. They spent millions – tens of millions of dollars and it was headed by a guy named Richard Ravitch, who was a highly overrated person, highly overrated. Ravitch fought like hell to have a convention center there and I was fighting for the site that I have because that was just a better site for New York. Governor Carey called a meeting and there were a hundred people that showed up. I led my team. Ravitch led his team. Ravitch worked for the city. I think he was the head of the MTA or something. He was working actually for the city or was like that. Governor Carey who was a great guy said, everybody else leave the room except for these two people. He said, Ravitch, make your case for 44th Street in the Hudson River and he made his case. He said, Donald, make your case and I made my case. I wasn't four minutes into it, he said, you win. It was easy. They bought the land. They took over my option. They bought the land. I was actually paid a commission which at the time was a lot of money but I didn't do it for that. The convention center which is right now there, the Jacob Javits Convention Center, that was my deal and, you know, a lot of people know that. I also renovated Grand Central Terminal as part of the Grand Hyatt Hotel. A lot of these things have been forgotten.
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> Let me go back to another -- on that same era.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But that was really the [indiscernible] story, not the World Trade Center. The World Trade Center, there was nothing there. I did look at the World Trade Center very seriously, however, when Larry Silverstein bought it, which was later on. I assume that's what you're talking about and I did look at it. Larry got it. He was a good professional, good guy.
<Marc Fisher> <Positive> The whole episode with the Barbizon and the Central Park South apartments, there was a meeting during that period with Stephen Ifshin and Sheldon Cohen. Do you remember this? Ifshin was a --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Were they tenants?
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> No, he was a real estate broker.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. You're talking about 100 Central Park South?
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There's a picture up here. Hold it. There it is right there, look. See that picture in New York Magazine?
<Marc Fisher> <Positive> Yes, definitely had a story. Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Did you ever see that?
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> I don't remember that one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> See the picture the picture of Michael up there? That was about that.
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> Oh, okay.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That was about that. It became a big publicity day in New York.
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> So, the way Ifshin tells the story, he --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who is he?
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> He was a real estate broker. So he came in --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Did he live in the building or anything?
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> No. But he said he came in to talk to you about selling those properties and he brought in a guy and Sheldon Cohen who was interested in you properties and you said, well, you told him you wanted 100 million and he said, "I can't do that. Ninety million." And the meeting, you said, no, I'm not doing that. And then Ifshin says he turned to you and said "You didn't want to sell the building. You just wanted to get an informal appraisal."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's true.
<Marc Fisher> <Positive> It's true.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I actually developed it. It was a great success. It's called Trump Parc. You know, sometimes, when people fight you, they give you great ideas and you make much more money. And what I was going to do, I had two buildings. I had the Barbizon and next to that, 100 Central Park South, which is what you're talking about. And I had rent control tenants in 100 Central. I still own the building. When somebody leaves, we fix up the apartment, sell it for millions of dollars. But what happened is I was going to rip both buildings down and do a big building, which would've been smaller than what they have in the site now because the zoning, it allowed fewer square feet. But I want to build a new building, great sight, Central Park South and Avenue of the Americas, right? So what happened is I had two buildings and couldn't make a deal with the tenants. Impossible. The thing went on for a long time. They were led by a group that was bad people. They would call the building inspectors. They would spray walls with water and then say that the apartment's leaking. I say nothing's leaking. They'd spray water on the wall. They were professionals because they wanted to be paid a fortune for their apartments. They would take cockroaches, break a jar of cockroaches and put cockroaches all over the place, which by the way, the tenants weren't thrilled about because they still got to live with these things. And they'd call the building inspector and say come in, you get a violation for having cockroaches, you get a violation for having leaks. This went on for a long time. And during the time it went on, the market crashed. Then it got good again and I said, wait a minute, I'm going to rip these buildings out. This is crazy. I'll just renovate the buildings and combine them physically. You see them there now. I combined them physically, saved hundreds of millions of dollars in cost, ended up with a bigger building. In other words, they're really combined. There's 100 Central Park South on the corner of 106 Central Park South and I sold them as condos. It was really successful. I made a lot of money. Had I ripped them down and done the whole thing, it would've been who knows. It would've taken much longer, probably would've missed the market but no, I was, yeah, I never intended --
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> Just to wrap it up, he told you, "You weren't really trying to sell this. You're just trying to get an informal appraisal." And then he said "So, I get a commission, right?" And you said, "No, not a commission but somewhere down the line. I'll do a favor for you too." Did that happen?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Could be. I had good relationships with the people in the industry. But it could be.
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> Let me ask you a couple of really quick questions, 40 Wall Street was a success story for you. We were told that you essentially bought it for a million dollars. There are a lot of other things going on. Is that right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Absolute worst day in the market in the history of New York City other than perhaps the crash of 1920.
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> So you bought it for a million. Do you think that's your best deal as far as when you look back in the amount of profit you eventually made?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Some people think that's the best deal made in New York in many, many years because, you know, per dollar spent --
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> Did you know, at the time, that --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Steve Roth of Vornado said that a long time ago. He said this has got to be the greatest deal made because I bought it for a million dollars, 1.3 million feet of space. The tallest building in downtown Manhattan except for the World Trade Center, which when it came down was the tallest, sadly. But actually, that was the tallest building in the world for a period of four months until the Chrysler went up.
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> So, very briefly, we understand that 60 Wall Street was where your grandfather worked as a barber briefly. Did you know that this building which you're so proud of was right down the street?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know I never heard that.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> 60 Wall Street. You didn't know that? I'm telling you things you didn't know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, I'm telling you right --
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> But you knew he was a barber for a time?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> For a very short time. I never heard that he worked at 60 Wall Street.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> 60 Wall Street. Could be. Now, you mentioned that some tenants, some were putting cockroaches. We've heard other kinds of stories turning it around that you would do certain things. For example, you wanted a tenant, it was a law firm, to leave 40 Wall Street and there was a particular tenant who wouldn't leave. And the story goes that you stopped the elevator from working so you have to walk up. Did you do that? Did you stop the elevator from working?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You also heard I turned off the heat? I will never comment on that.
<Marc Fisher> <Positive> That sounds like a denial.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Those are a nasty group of people. No, I wanted to demolish the building and said, you know, 40 Wall Street is a brand new building. What I have is, other than, you know, the exteriors --
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> The renovation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Incredible. It's a beautiful building, one of the most beautiful buildings. That was the one with the green copper top and still the tallest building in the center, right opposite the New York Stock Exchange. When I bought it, I said, well, we have to renovate it. And we had this tenant -- just so you understand, it was owned by a New York family who was destroyed with it. And then it was owned by Koreans, and they never understood the New York's law system because you had tenants. Landlord-tenant relationship is different than any kind of a relationship that exists in New York, that exists anywhere. So these Koreans were given a tremendously hard time by these tenants. They wouldn't pay their rent, they owed about two years of rent. What happened, a law firm, and what happened they had floors 52 to 59 uptown, 52 to 59. Fairly big law firm and all sorts of law, including litigation, and they stopped paying the rent. They said you're not doing a good job with the building. They said, no, no, we have to have rent. We have to have rent. They said you're not doing a good job with the building. We're not going to pay. They went for years, for four years, they fought. Finally, they settled just before I got involved. They settled and they paid like 10 cents on the dollar. Period. Now, a month goes by and they stopped payment again, okay. They immediately stopped paying their rent again. And the Koreans were so incensed and so crazy that they said we will sell. They'd never seen anything like it. In other words, they made a deal after years. After, like, I guess it was three years of litigation they made a deal, and I bought the building. I took over the litigation because they owed a lot of money, so I took over the litigation and they were real wise guys. So there are those that say that I turned down the heat and that I turned off the elevator. I was in the building because I was very hands on when I built. I was in the building, I came down and there were like 120 lawyers standing in the lobby. And I was lucky I was with some very tough construction guys because it was brutal. And I said, fellas, you got to walk upstairs because the elevators are under repair. And so, there is that story. So, who knows? But all I know is I got a check for the full amount, 100 percent, millions of dollars of rent. I got a check for the whole thing and there was never any more litigation.
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> So this is a pretty tough tactic but in your mind, you know --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't admit to anything. I'm just saying I got a check for the full amount. It was settled that day because I took over their litigation. They had years of rent.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> Let me ask you about another anecdote that's a little bit different but some said they were here, probably sitting on this very chair negotiating with you. The negotiation was X versus Y million and it came down to a million dollar difference and you said let's flip a coin.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's true.
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> True? And the coin was flipped. It fell on the floor and a million dollars is at stake. So the story goes this guy jumped on your desk wanted to see, actually see it on the floor before you could retrieve the coin. Is that a true story?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I got the coin before he could see it. That's true. We flipped for a million. Actually, it was a million dollar dispute on a commission, and we flipped. Do you know who the person was?
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> I do but I'm not sure that I want to say because of --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Kenny Moelis, is it Kenny Moelis?
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> You're going to take the guess and I'll leave it at that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's Kenny Moelis, great guy, by the way, but we flipped.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> And he lost.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, he lost.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> Was it what you said it was?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Only God knows. And me, I guess.
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> There -- let me --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's funny. You heard some funny stories.
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> Well, we've heard of this. We've heard a lot. Some of them are, you know, bits and pieces but we want to run them by you. And frankly, I have about 100 more. So we're going to do this again.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There are a lot of stories. But those are much more interesting. But anyway, [Crosstalk] 40 Wall Street turned out to be a phenomenal success. It's now 100 percent rented, doing great. And I gutted out the building. See, I couldn't gut it out if I have the law firm out there.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> On 40 Wall Street, my understanding is that Abe Wallach, you saw him on PBS, he explained how you were $900 million in debt, which was accurate. You sued him for quarter billion dollars and his company for a quarter billion dollars and then, you withdrew it and said we don't talk about this anymore. Then you hired him. You hired him for 12 years and he's the one, as I understand it, who brought 40 Wall Street to you and said [indiscernible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He worked for me for a long time, did a nice job. I don't believe I ever sued him. No, I didn't sue him.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> [After] he was on PBS and he gave an interview, he says that you sued him and his company.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I saw him on television, he wasn't complimentary. I didn't sue him. I saw him on television, he wasn't complimentary. I called him up to ram him out. And speaking to him, I liked him. It's one of those things. That's happened before, but he was not complimentary about 40 Wall Street because of, you know, it was a rough job because like you said --
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> But he does say unequivocally that he was sued and his company was sued for the same amount. It was quickly dropped. Basically, it went nowhere but someone delivered papers, Trump versus Wallach.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't believe I sued. I called him, I spoke to him, I was ramming him, and then I sort of liked him. And he worked for me for I'd say nine years, eight or nine years and he did a nice job. No complaints.
<Marc Fisher> <Positive> Speaking of ramming people, you've got tremendous support, I think, from people who admire the honesty with which you talk about the political process and the role of money and the role of donations. People see that as refreshing that you laid your cards on the table. So, that's how you deal with politicians. Why don't you bring that same honesty to how you deal with the media, right? So, the media, you're extremely generous and gracious in these kinds of settings, and then you go out and bash people and ram them. And obviously, there's good to be had from that. It's effective politically. But why don't you bring that same kind of honesty to how the relationships in media work?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've had very good relationships with some media and I've had very bad --I mean, Washington Post treats me horribly, okay? They write stuff that's really -- yeah. That's why I assumed the book is going to be not so good. But I feel like I have an obligation, like even in the stuff we talked. Certain corrections could be made, might as well get the story right whether it's 100 Central Park South or whether it's 40 Wall Street. People will tell their story their way and in many cases, not that important but it's sort of nice to have it. It's a book and it's important you guys are writing it, so might as well get it right. But I've seen tremendous dishonesty from the media. I've also had some great relationships with the media. You understand that. I have some people that are writers and people that are editors and some people that are top people, phenomenal people. I have great respect for the great writers. I've written many bestsellers, believe it or not. The Art Of The Deal is certainly one of the most successful books ever written in terms of business. I think it's the number one book ever written in terms of business. By the way, selling a lot of copies right now, they are selling. There was an article in the Times a month or two ago talking about one of the hottest booksellers is me, and I didn't even write it. I wrote Crippled America and that does well, but I didn't promote it, I didn't do anything and it still did great. But I'm selling a lot of books right now that I don't even know about because a lot of the past books that I've sold, I guess they've reprinted them and whatever. But I have great respect for writers and journalists, when they're honest. But there's such unbelievable dishonesty in the media.
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> In Art of the Deal, speaking of your books --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead, but how does that relate to what you wanted to say?
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> Go ahead, you wanted to say --
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> No, I was just wondering --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You want something to drink? You want Coke or anything?
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> Some water would be --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Coke?
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> Sure, water.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Water, water?
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> Yep.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Water, water, Coke please. Go ahead. You hear me okay?
<Unidentified Female> <Neutral> Okay, got it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's quicker than the intercom. Do you know what I mean?
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> We heard you don't use an intercom, you don't use a computer.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have it all. I mean I have it all but --
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> Have you ever used a personal computer?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I have a computer. I use it but not as much. I have people that I'll say bump bump bump, but I use it. I have it outside. I have it on the other desk.
<Marc Fisher> <Positive> Speaking of how you work, somebody was telling us that you liked to be briefed orally rather than having a memo come to you or something like that, just talking about your decision style, right, like a one piece. This is like a one pager with bullets.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I had a meeting downstairs today where we had the biggest people in the country. From the oil business, from the steel business, from the retail, but we had unbelievable -- I don't know if you've heard about Harold Hamm was here. He was great. He's a top oil guy. And he actually arranged the meeting because these are people that he knows, and we had tremendous people. And one of them, Dan from News Corp, who you probably know about. Good, we need one more water too.
<Unidentified Female> <Neutral> One more water? Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Unless you want my Coke you can have it.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> No, no, thank you
<Unidentified Female> <Neutral> So you want a Coke?
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> No, just water.
<Unidentified Female> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Water right?
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> Yeah, one more water.
<Unidentified Female> <Neutral> Okay
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he was telling me about how China is absolutely taking advantage of the United States. [Indiscernible] we have the biggest bank in the world, we must stop on the way down. We have the biggest bank in the world a couple of floors down. And I have other Chinese in different places that I own, but he was talking about it. He said I'd like to send you a report. I said do me a favor, don't send me a report. Send me like three pages. Various different things about what they're doing with intellectual property. Stealing billions and billions of dollars and we do nothing about it. And he went into something, it was really great. But he said I'd love to be able to send you -- oh, boy, he's got a lengthy report, hundreds of pages. I said no, no, give me three pages. I'm a very efficient guy. Now, I could also do it verbally, which is fine. I'd always rather have -- but I want it short. There's no reason to do hundreds of pages because I know exactly what it is. One thing very important, about two months ago, two-and-ahalf, three months ago, Wolf Blitzer asked me about NATO. And in all fairness, I've been in the real estate business, I've been a dealmaker, I've been doing what I do, nobody ever asked me about NATO before. But I know about NATO. And he said, what are your feelings on NATO? This was three months ago. Here and now, I took [sounds like] him for three days, and then after that they say I think Trump is right. It's like they can't see the forest for the trees. So I said what do you want to know? What do you think of it? I don't know if it was a trick question or not, I don't think so actually. But I said, look, NATO is obsolete because it doesn't cover terrorism. And today our problem is terror. It's not the Soviet Union, which doesn't exist anymore, although I give Russia full credit. You can still use NATO for Russia because while it's not as big as the Soviet Union, it's probably more powerful because of new weaponry. But I said to him, but it doesn't cover terror and you have the wrong countries if you're talking about terror. It's a different set of countries. You know terror, as we are watching. And I said, also, the countries that are in NATO are not paying their fair share. And that was with very little knowledge other than the knowledge I had plus the words common sense because I have a lot of common sense and I have a lot of business ability. So what do you mean they're not paying? I said they're not paying. We're defending all of these countries, 28 countries. We're defending all of these countries, and many of them aren't paying, or they're not paying their fair share. Okay, so that was the end of it and it got a lot of [indiscernible]. And then a lot of people went crazy. They said, "Oh, Trump said it's obsolete. NATO is great. Like Hillary Clinton, she said he doesn't like NATO. I think NATO is great but it's obsolete. It doesn't cover terrorism and the countries. So it turned out experts have said Trump understood NATO better than any of us, and we have been studying it for years. They were so close to it. They said he's right, it doesn't cover terrorism. And they do patchwork for terrorism, but it doesn't cover terrorism. And he's right. These countries are not paying us. And the ones that are paying us, are not paying us what the agreement says which is 2 or 3 percent of GDP, et cetera et cetera. They're way behind; they're not paying. Okay, so all of that forgotten, right? And a lot of people said, man, he was more accurate than guys have studied it all the time." So now, four days ago, Wall Street Journal, front page, NATO to open up terrorist operation. A new general's being appointed, a big front page story. Now, if they mention my name, that Donald Trump complained about it, that was all this - - Donald Trump complained about it. I'm responsible for it because I was hitting them that NATO was obsolete because they don't study -- so I wasn't given any credit, a hundred percent. I have somebody that's very familiar with NATO, actually in NATO said if it wasn't for you, we wouldn't even be thinking about doing this. So maybe the Washington Post is going to give me some credit, who knows.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> Just to follow up --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Did you know what I'm talking about? Did you see the story four or five days ago? Front page, NATO to open up massive terrorism operation.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> So to try to understand exactly --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a hundred percent because of me.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> To try to understand where exactly you formally decided to begin with, we saw back, I think it was '87, it placed an ad in which you complained about Japan not appreciating the U.S. paying for its military defense.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've been very consistent.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> So what I want to get at is, you say today something very similar, so consistent back to '87, it's the first that I know of where you were that outspoken about it. What I want to understand is why did you come to believe that back in '87, some people have said that you were upset with the Japanese because they were flooding New York with their money, making it hard for you to compete against their --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No, I wasn't upset because I made a lot of money. I sold things to them.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> What was the first time --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They made some terrible investments. They drove the prices through the -- I wasn't upset. I wasn't upset.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> That's what we were told. They drove prices up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I never get upset by market. No, no, I like that. I like it when China comes in.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> But you're competing, you're competing for the same building and they bought it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's hard to buy it because you couldn't buy because they were paying so much. But I also sold things and did very well. So, no, I just felt [Crosstalk]
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> [Indiscernible] to begin with.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just felt, believe it or not, I have much greater spirit for the United States than just an economics. I felt that Japan was taking advantage of the country. And by the way, there's nothing changed there. Japan is doing what they're all doing. You look at what's happening with the balance of credit. You talk about trade deficits, it's massive with Japan. But if you're talking about balance, we send them beef and they send us hundreds of thousands of cars. You're talking about balance of -- so I mean it's from the floor to ceiling, the difference. So what happened, I've been pretty consistent. I've been probably the most consistent. People have said, man, you've said similar things several years ago. It's one of the many reasons I'm running. Hey, I had a very good life going, great company, wonderful family. I could do whatever. I own Turnberry, I own Doral, I own all these incredible places, I own great property. I'm doing deals all over the world and no risk deals. These licensing deals are the best. The smart people say the greatest deals -- I've had the smartest people, best business people say these are greatest deals. You don't have any risk and you get big chunks of every deal that goes up. And by the way, like I'm doing 121 deals. Most of them are licensing. Turnberry I own 100 percent, no mortgage. I own a lot of the stuff without financing.
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> This is really interesting. Your father was famous for not trying to have too much leverage in the building. When you did Atlantic City, you were leveraging amazingly.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because I took money out.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> Well, but you had $900 million in debt.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I took money out.
<Question> <Positive> So you have been batting almost 1000 on primary endorsements. You have to be pretty proud of that.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> You took money out but there were -- so let me just ask this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead, sure.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> So there were the three casinos went into corporate bankruptcies. When you say there were four bankruptcies, what are you thinking of when you say there were four corporate, and I get that's corporate, what are the four corporate --?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Just individual things. And by the way --
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> Because we count more than four, so I want to make sure I understand.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I thought it was four. I thought it was four.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> So I'm going to make sure I got this straight. The Taj, Castle, the Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, that's three, The Plaza Hotel, the public company that you had.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's the same thing as the Taj.
<Michael Kranish> <Neutral> Well, the public was TJT [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Actually, honestly, I view that as one. I don't view that as four. Michael Kranish The Taj bankruptcy, wasn't it like '91 or something like that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the one I didn't get was Friess, I was asked to do that, by my son Don, and I did it but I did it -- I was asked the morning of -- and by the time I did it I guess 70 percent, almost 70 percent of the vote was already cast. So, I don't consider that to be, maybe I'll take a quarter of a loss on that one. But I think it's 48 and a quarter, it's 48-1 which is pretty good, right? Pretty good.
<Question> <Positive> Could you give us some insight into what goes into how you pick somebody to endorse?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's very much my gut instinct coupled with a lot of talented people that I have that know where these people have come from over the last two years. For instance, sometimes I'll have a nasty never-Trumper and every once in a while it's recoverable but generally speaking if somebody is that much opposed. Now if somebody is opposed, that's one thing, if they're that much opposed to a tune of coming up with the never-Trumper type stigma, it's rare that I'll get involved.
<Question> <Positive> Sir, what win are you most proud of so far?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we have a lot of them. The Republican governor of Georgia, he was down 10, and I endorsed him, and I think he won 70-30. He won by 40 points. I did that endorsement at the request and I liked him a lot. First of all, I have to really respect the candidate, I have to like the candidate, otherwise I'm just not going to get involved. But he's currently running as you know, he won the race against the man that was favored.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I did that for Sonny Perdue. But when I did it he was down about 10 points. And he ended up winning by 70-30. He won by 40 points, so that means he picked up 50. I mean, there are a lot of them. I would say of the list of 48 victories, I would say that close to half of them were races that could've been lost. I think the one in Ohio was a great victory, because when I get involved I don't have the percentages, but he was very, very down. And he ended up winning by 1,800 votes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would say Kansas is a good example. The governor of Kansas was running against somebody that's always been, you know Kris who's always been very strong Trump, right from the beginning. And you know he's the governor of Kansas he's running against. Kris is a good man, so I endorsed him, and he won.
<Question> <Positive> Yeah, close one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Close one, but he won. He was down 11. He was down 11 when I endorsed him with about a week, with about three days left, and he ended up winning. Donovan or Seth Dialin. He was down ten and won by 24 points.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. But, see, I don't view that as four.
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> The public company was like 2000- something right? Eight years later --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> First of all, if you look Atlantic City, Caesar's is bankrupt right now, badly bankrupt. That's a mess by the way. Many of the hotels down there are bankrupt, and the ones that aren't are in deep trouble. But if you look at bankruptcy, bankruptcy is a tool. I never went personally bankrupt or anything.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> The corporate bankruptcies, yes, as far as we know, you've had six because there was the public company and that was twice.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I get it. See, I view Atlantic City, the three I view that as one.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> You view it as one but it was three different huge [Crosstalk].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's three buildings, but I view it as one. Many places in Atlantic City have gone bankrupt, as you've seen. They're doing terribly right now. When I left seven years ago, I've actually gotten credit for that. But when I put on the debt, that's money taken out. That's money that you pay things off --
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> But you were awfully -- I mean the famous anecdote, I don't know if it's [indiscernible] or not is that you were walking down the street and that you pointed to a homeless person and said that person is worth $900 million more than I am because you were $900 million in debt. I've heard that anecdote so many different times, what's the real anecdote? What happened?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I was walking down Fifth Avenue with a beautiful woman.
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> Marla?
<Question> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Or thereabouts. That was a surprise because he was going to, you know, he was expected to lose. I endorsed him. He won by a lot. As you know he was expected to lose against the previous congressman, right? He followed him. I guess the one they talk about the most is Florida because he was at 3, don't forget when I endorsed him, he was at 3. I put out two tweets. I put one out where I say he's really good, blah, blah, blah, but that wasn't an endorsement. That was when he was at 3. A lot of people don't view that, they view the endorsement. Then a few months later and he went from 3 to -- so he was at 3, with little money but a great guy and brilliant education. You know, he went to Harvard, Yale -- great, terrific student, very smart guy. Just a very impressive guy, I've always liked him -- Ron DeSantis. But he was at 3 and he went up to in the 20s with just not an endorsement. And then the endorsement, I mean —.
<Question> <Neutral> And he took off.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the one who lost, who was expected to be the governor of Florida for the last four years. You know, they thought he had $21 million in the bank and his poll numbers were into the 20s and 30s. And Ron hadn't really started much of the fundraising yet. And he was at 3. So then he went up from 3 to in the 20s. And then he started fundraising and did very well. And then he went from the 20s to win by 20 points. And that seems to be the one that people are most impressed with.
<Question> <Positive> Yes, they felt the impact of the endorsement.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I could go on for an hour, but there were many of people that were way behind that ended up winning.
<Question> <Positive> We do have a lot of different questions for you on a bunch of different subjects that I know you want to talk about. One that I want to make sure to get out of the way earlier is about this new Woodward book. There are a bunch of allegations in it about senior aides stealing documents from the desk. Right here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's false. You know the deal was, that it's false. Made up. Disgruntled employees or just made up, could just be made up by the author. That was on the South Korean trade deal, which I've completed just recently. And we're going to be signing it, I think we'll be signing it during United Nations week in a couple of weeks in New York. The deal was done, it's an incredible deal. It was a terrible deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it was a Hillary Clinton deal where we lost hundreds of thousands of jobs. And I voided the agreement, made a new one and there's a good example, that wasn't having to do with North Korea, that had to do with just the South, with the Korean deal on trade. And that deal, I got it completed, and it went from a horrible deal to a deal that's good for the United States and hopefully good for South Korea. That was a one-way horror show. There was nobody taking anything from it. I mean, nothing. I can tell you that deal went relatively smoothly along.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I won't say. I was walking down Fifth Avenue with a very beautiful woman. Do you remember him? He used to be always at the corner of 57th and Fifth. And he was a man who was selling pencils, always hitting on the [indiscernible]. Remember him with the dog? He was there for years.
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> Yes, yes. White dog.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, like a German shepherd type. And he was blind, and he was there for years in front of Tiffany's. I was walking down Fifth Avenue and I said isn't that amazing, right now, that man is richer than I am. And this beautiful woman said, "What do you mean? He's not richer than you." I said, yeah, he's worth $900 million more. I said, right now, that man is richer than me. She said why? Because, let's assume he's worth nothing. But I'm worth minus $900 million. And she never ran away. She was very happy to be with me. So that tells you that's something good. But no, I said let's assume he's worth nothing, but I'm worth minus $900 million. Is that the story you talked about?
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> That's the story. What year was that '91, '92?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That would be about '92. The real estate market had totally crashed. And again, just so you -- I never went bankrupt.
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> I understand [Crosstalk].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I did a pretty [indiscernible].
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> Most people don't go negative $900 million. That must have been --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh yeah, I was negative $900 million.
<Question> <Negative> So the Woodward book is falsehoods, you think.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's just nasty stuff. I never spoke to him, and maybe I wasn't given messages that he called. I probably would've spoken to him if he got through, but he was, for some reason I did not get messages on it. I'll tell you, General Kelly just put out a statement that his statement was totally false -- he never made it. He put it out a little while ago, you'll get it from Sarah. But I did have something done for you guys cause I figured you may.
<Bill Shine> <Positive> Sir, right on top of the little.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, good, thank you. I just had this made up. This doesn't even, no president in history has done what I've done in two years. The other side is going crazy, they are lunatics. And here's a list of things that I've done that you guys can have. I just had it made up for you because you guys have always been fair. Kelly has said that it's a false statement.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Many of the people have said they're false statements. It's just another bad book, and you know he's had a lot of credibility problems, Woodward, as you know, you've seen it. He's had a lot of credibility problems. I wish I could've -- I probably would've preferred to speak to him, but maybe not. I think it probably wouldn't have made any difference in the book. He wanted to write a book a certain way.
<Question> <Negative> Can we turn to culture, Mr. President?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You guys do understand what I mean, though -- it's terrible what they can write. They can write anything they want. They can say anything they want. And honestly, it's a shame. It's really a shame. Go ahead.
<Question> <Positive> So with Nike, you know they decided to feature Colin Kaepernick in its ads for the 30th anniversary. You've been really tough on the NFL kneelers. What message do you think Nike is sending to the country with this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's a terrible message. I have Nike is a tenant of mine. They pay me a lot of rent. But I think it's a terrible, horrible message that they're sending. And the purpose of them doing it, you know, maybe there is a reason for them doing it. But I think as far as sending a message, I think it's a terrible message and a message that shouldn't be sent. There's no reason for it.
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> Did you feel devastated? How did you feel?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that -- look the market's crashed. You couldn't sell -- a building that was worth a lot of money, an apartment -- for instance, I was doing a big job on the East Side called Trump Palace which is a very successful job right now. But I was doing a big job on the East Side called Trump Palace. When it opened, there were lines of people wanting to buy apartments during construction. I opened a sales office. When the building was completed, if a person would call up and say maybe I'll come over and look, we considered that a tremendously successful week. You understand? That's what happens. I'll never forget Charles Allen. Do you know Charles Allen from Allen & Company, great man. He was a much older man than me. I was young, he was old. I was building this building. And this building did great from the beginning. You guys would say that this was a success from day one - Trump Tower. But I was across the street at Harry Winston watching the construction. And he walked by, he was the head of Allen & Company, they had an office right down the road on Fifth Avenue. And he goes, "Donald, how are you?" And I wasn't so famous then. But he knew me, I knew him. And he was one of them great people of Wall Street, one of the great, Allen & Company. And he was the boss, the founder, the boss, the whole thing. And he was an amazing guy, a tough guy. And, [indiscernible] said this building is so successful. Charles, I just sold an apartment to Johnny Carson. I sold it, I was doing great with it. He goes, "That's great, but you know, there'll be a time when a building like this, or any building, you won't be able to sell apartments for any price." And I said, no way, no way no way. And he was right, because from 1990 to '93, you couldn't give away apartments or real estate. So, you know, the world changed, but it was a very interesting period.
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> So you were big on the power of positive thinking. How did this affect you? Did you feel, just know when to think positive about this, [Crosstalk]?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I wouldn't tell you the story if I thought -- I thought it was frankly a cool story. The amazing thing is that this beautiful woman didn't run away from me. That was the more amazing.
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> Speaking of beautiful women, I want to ask you a couple of pageant questions. You remember Carrie Prejean?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now you know I sold the pageant for a tremendous price? I bought it for $2 million. Off the record, I sold it for much more than 50 [million]. I settled the case with Univision where, as you know, they paid me a lot of money because they said, "We're not going to broadcast the pageant." You know the funny thing about that case? Had I not had all of the publicity where they weren't going to put on the pageants because of Trump, because of the Hispanic, I wouldn't think I would've gotten 20, 25 million from them, which is you know how successful that was. It was a phenomenal deal. Bought it for two [million]. Made a lot of money. It was a sick puppy. I bought it for two million. Made a lot of money for 15 years and then sold it. Had there not been all of the hoopla about the television. As you know, Univision said, "We will not air it." They never sent me a letter out of five-year [sounds like]. I just signed a brand new contract with them. It was three months old. It's four months old. They said, "We won't air this." We just signed a contract. Anyway, bottom line, we settled with Univision. It was very good. I got a great price from the people that bought it. I hope they're going to be happy with it. But it was a great deal. Carrie Prejean, so she was very nice. Did you know she was very nice?
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> I did not.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Last week did you know that?
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> No.
<Question> <Positive> Sure. Did you see the news about the Neil Armstrong movie? That they won't be showing the scenes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Question> <Negative> Could you give us your thoughts on that? Do you think that's upsetting?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's very unfortunate. It's almost like they're proud of, it's almost like they're embarrassed at the achievement coming from America. I think it's a terrible thing.
<Question> <Neutral> Hollywood's an American industry. You would think.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I really believe when, 'cause when you think of Neil Armstrong and when you think about the landing on the moon, you think about the American flag. And I understand they don't do it. So for that reason I wouldn't even want to watch the movie.
<Question> <Neutral> Do you think other people should go see the movie?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's up to them. It really is, that's up to them. I don't want to get into the world of boycotts. Same thing with Nike. I wouldn't say you don't buy Nike because of the Colin Kaepernick. I mean, look, as much as I disagree, as an example, with the Colin Kaepernick endorsement, in another way, I wouldn't have done it. In another way, it is what this country is all about, that you have certain freedoms to do things that other people may think you shouldn't do. So you know, I personally am on a different side of it, you guys are probably too, I'm on a different side of it.
<Question> <Positive> So you just mentioned Colin Kaepernick. I want to ask you about Kanye West. So he said last week, he did a radio show in Chicago, and he said last week, that you, the president, would like black people to like you and that you'll do the things that are necessary to make that happen. Is that a mission of yours?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would like that to happen, and I think it has happened. You know, I did actually a lot better than people thought with African-American voters or probably I wouldn't be sitting behind this desk. But now my numbers are much higher than they were, and Kanye West was a part of it. And so is Tiger.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Tell me. Go ahead.
<Marc Fisher> <Positive> She wrote this book in which she said that you were very involved and closely inspected the contestants and were interested in separating the hot ones from the discards. Is that the kind of thing you did?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. What I did is I own the pageant. I bought Miss Universe. And Carrie is very nice. You know, when that New York Times wrote that stupid piece about me a couple of weeks ago about the women, Carrie was one of the women that's mentioned. And she went on television. She's all over town. She went on television saying Donald Trump is fantastic. Did you know that she came to my defense?
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. Totally. She's a great person. She was fine, and so did Rowanne Brewer. I mean, the whole place was like -- that was a horrible for the Times, believe me. You saw that picture. Front page, centerfold, Sunday Times, big picture, me with beauty contestants. Then they had them saying, a little bad, not -- by the way, not horrible by standards. You understand. Friends of mine said, man, nice person but stuff. Rowanne Brewer got up. She's all over television saying, "That's not what I said. We have great respect for Donald Trump. I really like Donald Trump. He's a really good guy." Carrie Prejean got on television and said. I mean, I thought it was amazing that she said -- no. But here's what I did. When I bought the pageants, they were failing. I bought them fairly inexpensively. I then made a deal with CBS to air it. But you'd have a hundred beautiful women, let's say, in Miss Universe than you have 50 in Miss USA. You'd pick judges. But the judges didn't know what they were doing. You had two sets of judges. You had judges that would be there for a week-and-a-half, then you had celebrity judges for the final night. So you'd pick. And they wouldn't pick the women that should've been in the finals. They picked women that -- So I developed a system where everybody would be on stage. And I would go with numerous people from CBS. Then ultimately, NBC picked it up, television. We would talk and see the people. We would talk to as many as a hundred on Miss Universe and for Miss USA, 50. I'd be on stage and I talk. We would pick the top 15 smartest, most beautiful women. Once I got involved, the ratings went up greatly. It became very successful and I made a great deal. The pageants did very well. But they would pick women that maybe -- and I don't say this in any way. Look, it is a beauty pageant, okay? It's about beauty. I was happy. We can't be ashamed of it. It's a beauty pageant. But we'd pick women that were outstanding, and the ratings went great. Then ultimately, I sold it. Plus, I didn't think it was great for me to be owning a beauty pageant while I'm running for president.
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> The reason I asked you is because similarly there are people who are saying that they used to see you and one of your security guards, security men out on Fifth Avenue playing the game of -- seeing women go down the street and that the game of that one's invited, she's invited, she's not invited.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Was that before I was famous, you mean?
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> No. This was in the early '90s or something.
<Question> <Positive> So you credit them with your approval rating there?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I credit more, I do, I think that helped, and I also credit the fact that African-American unemployment is the lowest level in the history of this country. Homeownership is up for African-Americans -- way up, every category. They're doing better than they did with the past administration or the Democrats. And I actually think my next run because of that will be a lot easier.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don't forget, when I used to say, when I used to read off crime statistics and education statistics, how bad education was in black communities and all of the horrible statistics, homeownerships statistics, when I used to call that out and I'd say 'what do you have to lose by voting for me' because they've always voted for Democrats. I mean essentially almost 100 percent. I say what do you have to lose? Now I go up and say 'listen here's what I've done.' Your unemployment is the lowest it's ever been and then I go point after point after point. I don't know how anyone beats that message. That's a tough message to beat. I don't know if you guys agree. So before I went up with a promise, but it's a promise. Now I'm going up with real stuff.
<Question> <Neutral> And you've kept that promise?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I mean, not only there how about with everybody? Strongest economy the country's ever had. We have the best economy the country's ever had and it's getting better. I think your next numbers are going to be even better. So the 4.1 gets up to 4.2, gets re-adjusted to 4.2 and you know, when you think -- I think we have tremendous potential to go upward.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the trade deals are going to be a big part of it. And military protection is going to be a big part. I mean, I'm criticized in this crazy book about military protection -- well they're right. I think it's horrible what's happening to the United States. We're protecting immensely wealthy countries and they're not paying us for the protection. I say, why are we protecting you when you're very wealthy and you wouldn't be here for two weeks if it wasn't for us? Why aren't we being reimbursed for this massive cost? Fully reimbursed -- for this massive cost that we're taking care of.
<Question> <Positive> Do you feel alone in that view? Do you feel like you have support inside the administration?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Amazingly alone. Amazingly. A lot of generals don't understand it, a lot of people don't understand it. Amazingly alone. But I've gotten many converts over the last period of a year. But I started off amazingly alone. Once you say it three or four times people start to say 'wow he's right about that.' I mean, I could go country after country, but I won't embarrass them. But immensely wealthy countries, where they're paying a fraction of what it's costing us to protect them. And without us they wouldn't even be there.
<Question> <Positive> It seems like the theme here is that in Washington it's not often somebody comes along and sort of rethinks what everybody already believes. In Washington, despite the bipartisan differences, everyone has the same momentum, they're all headed in the same direction. And you feel like you're coming in —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But how could I do that? As me, even in the early '90s, I could never do anything like that. I mean, I just couldn't do it. I mean, I just [indiscernible] under what timing. It's false. It's not true. I wouldn't do that. It's not my thing. I wouldn't do that at any time. Certainly, I couldn't have done that in the '90s because I was very wellknown in the '90s. So you wouldn't have been able to do it in the '90s.
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> Earlier, was it possible?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. That wouldn't have been my thing. No.
<Marc Fisher> <Negative> Being as well-known in the community, recognizable as you are, I would imagine you can't just walk into a supermarket. Has it been a long time since you can even do that? Do you miss that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So The Apprentice, so I had great success. I then did The Art of the Deal. The Art of the Deal became the number one best seller on the Times list. In fact, I was there with Bonfire of the Vanities. We were both two massively successful books, one fiction, one nonfiction that was on the list for a long, long time. Both of them were on the list. They were up there for a long time. So I had been number one bestselling. Then I did The Apprentice. As you know, it became one of the most -- take a look at that. Maybe get up. Take a look right over the light switch. That's Variety. Check it out. It was the number one show. And that's Variety. It's a very successful show. So I did that. By the way, in that chair sat Steve Burke where you're sitting, came up to see, me wanting to extend it. You can't do it because of the equal time provisions, which is frankly ridiculous. But I wouldn't have time to do it, anyway, to be honest with you. But they wanted to extend The Apprentice. I did it for 14 seasons, which is about 12 years because we did some -- then we had Martha do one and it failed. Failure's very simple in that business. If you don't get ratings, you fail. That's not a very complicated thing. You either get ratings or you don't. And I get ratings, okay? The king of ratings. They call me the king of ratings at NBC. So even after 14 seasons, they wanted me to extend me for a long period of time. I said no. Steve Burke came up himself. Steve Burke doesn't ever talk to talent. Steve is a great guy and a great manager, but he doesn't go around talking to people to go into a show, extend the show. But he came up here with the executives at NBC. They wanted me to do it so badly - I think I maybe told you this — a number of months before I announced and I said, "Steve, I'm going to run. I'm pretty sure I'm going to run. I'm sorry, I'm pretty sure I'm going to run." They went out actually at the Upfront, which is where they announced the program. They announced that I was going to do The Apprentice, which caused me a lot of problem with the Washington Post and lots of others because, wait a minute, Trump's not going to run because they just announced. And I said I'm not doing it. He was pretty sure I wasn't going to run. Anyway, so I announced I was going to run. They chose Arnold Schwarzenegger. We did because I have a big chunk of that show. They chose Arnold Schwarzenegger. He's doing the show. We'll see how he does. It's already been shot actually. What happened is I decided to do this. People ask me the question oftentimes, so you're the number one bestseller. You did a show that was a tremendous hit, oftentimes number one. I mean you see it. In fact, I think it had the highest rating of the year, Show 1. It was with Bill Rancic. Had the highest rating of the year after the Super Bowl. You had this tremendous success in book. You had tremendous success in television, entertainment. Now, you're doing very well politically. What's the biggest? I tell you there's no contest. This is a monster. I mean this is such a big thing. I tell people, it's not even a contest. You know, when I did The Apprentice and the show went to number one, that was a very big thing. That is peanuts compared to what this is. Now, what this is, is more important from a lot of different ways including making America great again, which is what I want to do. The country's being run so incompetently. But this is, you know, hundreds of times more, more important.
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> So the question was really about is it hard for you personally to not be able to do those kind of normal everyday things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. It's hard for me to get into an army tank and to literally, you know, those things. By the way, Secret Service people are great people, but at -- let me give you one more story before. And then if you want we can do another one or whatever, but I've got to go because I have a lot of people. You know, the vans they have are armor-plated. These are not like -- they're SUVs but their side walls are steel, et cetera, et cetera. And the other day, I came down and we had thousands of people on Fifth Avenue waiting, thousands of people on 56th Street which was closed, at least a hundred Secret Service agents, and my wife. The car's parked on the sidewalk right next to the glass. I don't know if you've seen it. They park it on the sidewalk. It's pulled on to the sidewalk on 56th Street right in front of the building. Some of the wealthiest people in the world live in Trump Tower, including from India, from all over. They're held back. They can't -- and these guys are worth billions. They're held back like can't move, stand. But they like me so it doesn't matter. They understand. I get out, I get into the car. Thousands of people. What they do is they close the street and thousands of people form in the corner waving, going crazy and all these Secret Service. And my wife gets in, and I get it in, and she looks at me, and we're in this car with windows that are this thick, with steel walls that are like this. And she says to me, "Are you sure this is what you want for the rest of your life?" Okay, I wanted to tell that because it was funny. It's happened the other day. It's not like a normal situation.
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> And what did you say?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am, not because I like that because I don't particularly. What I want to do is help the country. I want to give back. I mean, this country's been so great to me and it's on such a bad track so I want to get back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, your question was so good because nobody has ever asked me that. It's almost like you sort of understood the situation better, does everyone agree with you on that? Because you guys are probably sitting there saying, but then you're saying but you have to go through this incredible layer of people.
<Question> <Positive> You're challenging the conventional wisdom.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I mean and I say to myself 'OK, you have a country, it's immensely wealthy, we're guarding it. We're spending tremendous amounts, billions of dollars to guard and they're not reimbursing us. Why? I'll be honest, I've asked countries, I've said, you've got to reimburse us. First, they don't even understand the question. Within five minutes, they agree.
<Question> <Neutral> Can you give us an example?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They actually, no, but you'll be seeing things come out. I'll talk to you. They actually can't believe they've gotten away with it for so long. I had one guy say 'we knew you were going to be asking.' Like they can't believe it took so long. These are really wealthy -- there are actually many of them. But these are really wealthy, really successful.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They spend very little, I'll give you an example, is NATO. So we're paying anywhere from 70-90 percent the cost of NATO to guard Europe. OK? Against Russia. We're spending -- you know, mostly against Russia. So, we're spending 70-90 percent. Now a lot of people think, 'oh it's great for us.' It's great for Europe. OK? It's not great for us. It's great for Europe. And that's OK. But they got to pay their share.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I went there and I had a very successful meeting. And I was able to get them to spend big, last year, just with a low key meeting they paid $43 billion more. OK? As Stoltenberg said. This year it's much more than that. They've gone way up. But you know, I don't know if you've looked, NATO spending was going this way -- people weren't paying, you know why, cause no one was really asking. Our past presidents would go in, they'd make a little speech, 'hey we'd like you to pay your bills' and they'd leave and that would be the last thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ask, you may want to call him, but ask Stoltenberg what he thinks because he's my biggest fan in a sense cause he can't believe what's happened. Now these countries are paying. One of the best meetings, one of the most successful meetings I had was with President Putin. But the press, it was fake news. It was a great meeting. We had a great meeting. It's good if we get along with Russia, not bad. And it's good if we get along with China and now we're in very much of a trade situation with them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we can't allow them to take $500 billion out of our country every year. With Russia we had a very good meeting, but if you read the papers, it's just all fake news. You know, we talked about Syria, we talked about Ukraine, we talked about Israel and protecting Israel. We had a great meeting and then I guess they wanted me to get into a boxing match with him on the podium. It's the craziest thing I've ever seen.
<Question> <Negative> Have you talked to Russia in the past few days about Syria?
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> Can I ask you just one other question? There's a lot of other questions I asked you but this one I want to ask you. In 2012, when Mitt Romney had his speech about self-deporting, this comment was made about that. "He had a crazy policy of self-deportation which was maniacal. It sounded as bad as it was and that he lost all the Latino vote, he lost the Asian vote, he lost everybody who was inspired to come into this country." What do you think about that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What I meant is that nobody knew what selfdeporting meant.
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> But you remember saying this comment about --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do, but nobody knew what it meant. I didn't know what it meant. Nobody knew -- are you all set?
<Unidentified Female> <Neutral> Dan Balz is waiting to talk.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I think he's fantastic. He's treated me so fair. Would you tell him I'm with these two characters, that I'll call him in two minutes.
<Unidentified Female> <Neutral> I did.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because he's doing a story. I think he's great. I may call you back and [indiscernible]. I think he's a great professional. Does that make sense to you? You know, I told you, I respect -- in your profession, there's few people I respect more when they're good and honorable and honest and all of that, but anyway. No, but I didn't know what self -- nobody knew what self-deporting was.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> You want to go further. You wanted to not self deport but deport. Why is that better?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, nobody has been able to define what self-deporting meant. Nobody knew what it meant. Nobody knew. Was that a good thing? Was that a bad thing? Was does it represent? What does it mean? Nobody knew.
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> But your point was that telling them they had to leave was bad for the Latino community.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you saw what I put out, right?
<Question> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I better not, I won't say. I won't say. But I don't like it. You know, it was very interesting, I was at a meeting in Indiana, and a woman was there, we had a one closed room meeting with people from the state. And a woman was telling me about this happening, this was a couple of weeks ago, and said we have a chance, she was Syrian, she was from Syria, and she said 'I think they're going to kill millions of people.' And I said, 'no, that won't happen because the world is watching. And she explained, she was from the area, she said she thinks her family is going to be killed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I went out and then yesterday I read a big story about it, and I said, you know that woman is potentially right. But by my putting out that message I think maybe it's going to send a signal. I mean we're going to see, but it's a terrible thing. There are a lot of bad things going on in the world, that I can say.
<Question> <Neutral> Sir, can we ask you –?
<Bill Shine> <Neutral> Last question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let them have it, these guys have been great. Let them have a few more.
<Question> <Neutral> Sir, do you think you're going to be declassifying the FISA documents that have been targeting your campaign?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Will I declassify them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it wasn't necessarily my point at all. But what will happen, what has happened and what you'll see has happened -- you know, when Eisenhower did this, his concept was you'll move some and the rest will leave. That's what happened. When he started deporting people, people started leaving because they didn't want to be deported. Did you know that, when Eisenhower did it from '52 to '53?
<Michael Kranish> <Negative> So you don't see a contradiction between what you said and [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because nobody ever knew what selfdeporting means. Nobody was ever able to define what he meant by self-deportation.
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> So you think it's consistent. He was [indiscernible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do because nobody understood what he meant by self-deportation.
<Marc Fisher> <Positive> All right. So we do have other questions. You said you'd talk to us some more.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We'll have another time.
<Marc Fisher> <Neutral> Let me ask you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I actually enjoyed this.
<Question> <Positive> Will you be declassifying them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we're looking at it very seriously right now because the things that have gone on are so bad, so bad. I mean they were surveilling my campaign. If that happened on the other foot, they would've considered that treasonous. They would've considered that spying at the highest level. Can you imagine if we were doing that to Obama instead of Obama and his people doing that to us? Everybody would've been in jail for the next 500 years. OK? Can you believe it, where they paid this guy millions of dollars, it turned out? If you look at all of the things that are happening.
<Question> <Negative> Sir, do you think, since Mueller has passed the Sept. 1 deadline now, do you think he's interfering in the election?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I view it as an illegal investigation. It should've never been started. It should've never been allowed to start. You know, I'm not the target of this investigation, just in case you don't realize. But I view it as being illegal for many reasons. Some of which are that, number one there was no crime and number two everybody was conflicted, including Mueller. There were, I mean tremendous conflicts here, you know the conflicts, you've heard the conflicts.
<Question> <Positive> Speaking of one which you cited, I'd like to know, you said you interviewed Mueller for FBI director.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sitting right in that chair.
<Question> <Neutral> What did you think during the interview?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I liked him, but I didn't give him the job?
<Question> <Negative> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I had a business dispute with Mueller before that. I had a real business dispute. And he's Comey's best friend. And I could give you 100 pictures of him and Comey hugging and kissing each other. You know, he's Comey's best friend. How can you possibly have a man who is that, and then somebody from his law firm came out and said, 'I can't believe they picked Mueller. He hates the president. He hates the president.' So that's four things, that's four, then you have the conflicts of the people -- you know I call them the 17 angry Democrats, I guess they're being lowered down now.
<Marc Fisher> <Positive> We have too. Thank you.
<Marc Fisher> <Positive> Who would you say who's the best president of your lifetime?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say Ronald Reagan but I disagreed with him on the borders. I disagreed with him on trade and the borders. But trade really was -- he got a bum rap. A lot of people thought Reagan was, you know, for some reason everyone thought Reagan was NAFTA. It was Clinton that was NAFTA. Ronald Reagan got a bum rap because NAFTA's been a disaster for our country. You know, I have gone up and I've toured a lot of this country that I wouldn't have seen except for the fact that I'm running for the office. I will tell you that you go Upstate New York, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Connecticut, you go to these states that you will see things that you wouldn't believe in terms of people that left. They left because -- you go to New England. The New England states where I went through them in great detail. I've seen things that you wouldn't believe that are far worse when you see them than when you hear about it.
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> Eighty-seven, you called Reagan a great performer but you wondered whether there was anything behind that smile. You wrote that. That doesn't sound complimentary.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I really liked him. I really liked his energy. I liked his heart. I disagreed with him on trade. I thought he was far too weak on trade. And I disagreed with him on the border. He was weak on the border. But in terms of a feeling, I loved his attitude on Iran. He released those prisoners. I loved what happened in Iran and Reagan as opposed to Jimmy Carter where they would've kept those people for a hundred years. But I felt he gave a great tone to the country. I disagreed with him on trade. I totally disagreed with him on trade. Reagan has been given a bad rap though because Reagan thought, very strongly thought that -- everybody thought that Reagan was NAFTA. And Reagan wasn't NAFTA. It was Bill Clinton that was NAFTA. Bill Clinton signed that bill. And what Bill Clinton did is for the people that followed him, he made life miserable because NAFTA, I mean they cleaned out New England. They cleaned out upstate New York. They cleaned out big manufacturing. You have to see I have statisticians, and one in particular who very good. And before I'd speak in like Albany, Syracuse, he'd do reports on the various people on various places. I mean, 55 percent of the manufacturers is gone in the last X number of years. And I get the next one. Forty-nine percent. It was always like between 45 and 55 and 60 percent every place I'd go to. It was NAFTA. It was signed by Bill Clinton. People used to think it was Reagan. It wasn't. Anyway, I'll see you again. We'll do it again. I enjoyed this.
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> Thank you.
<Marc Fisher> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You seem [indiscernible].
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> Thank you, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's incredible when you look at Weissman and all these people. Some of the people work for the Hillary Clinton foundation. It's an incredible thing. Honestly, people are very angry about it. People that love our country are very angry about it. So, I consider it to be an illegal investigation. It should've never been allowed to have happened.
<Question> <Negative> I want to ask you about social media companies 'cause you've expressed a lot of concern about censorship by social media companies to the point that you were defending CNN's right to have a place to speak on these social media companies because you were defending the principle of it. Are you worried that these companies will interfere in the election?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think they already have. I mean, the true interference in the last election was that -- if you look at all, virtually all of those companies are super liberal companies. They were in favor of Hillary Clinton. Now maybe I did a better job because I'm good with the Twitter and I'm good at social media, but the truth is they were all on Hillary Clinton side, and if you look at what was going on with Facebook and with Google and all of it, they were very much on her side. And that's a real situation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When I say, though, when you start, when you start getting into it, it can also reverberate that the others, it could switch the other way some day, I don't know, maybe someday it will. That's why I use the CNN situation. I'd rather have CNN's voice, as fake news as it is, I'd rather have the CNN voice, like for instance I watched this thing play out today on NBC, which I consider to be worse than CNN in a certain way. Even though I made them a lot of money with 'The Apprentice' -- a lot of money. But I consider it to be probably worse than CNN with Harvey Weinstein and what's going on there.
<Question> <Negative> So you think their license should be pulled because of the Weinstein story?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but I know you have to get licensed, and I can tell you that CNN -- that ABC, most of them, but that NBC is very dishonest in its reporting of me. Very dishonest in its reporting of me. So, if they're dishonest of me, now I think they're more dishonest of me than they would be of most people because most people they don't care about, but they are very dishonest.
<Question> <Negative> Well, the allegation here of course is that senior leadership was meddling in their ability to do journalism, and if other reports are to be believed, NBC leadership also leaked the Access Hollywood tape during the campaign.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A lot of people say that what they did -- OK, so I had a lawsuit prepared, I had a lawsuit that was prepared to be filed against NBC because they leaked that tape. First of all, that was done, that tape was, there are even questions about this tape, there's many things going on.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it was also done in a dressing room -- real questions about that whole process. And they gave it to the Washington Post because they couldn't put it out there themselves 'cause they would've had tremendous liability so they gave it to the Washington Post to put out. OK. I had a lawyer hired to bring a suit right after the election ended.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But one problem arose -- I won the election. OK, and they were going to say, 'what was your damages?' The damages was I lost the election, but now I won the election. So what were the damages? I won the election. I was going to sue because what they did -- that was done in the dressing room. You know those trailers are really luxury, beautiful, actually. That was done in a trailer. It ruined Billy Bush's career. And that was done in a trailer secretly. That was illegal what they did.
<Marc Fisher> <Positive> Thank you very much. You spend a lot of your time with reporters these days?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very little. This is a very unusual meeting. But it's important. Very little.
<Michael Kranish> <Positive> Well, we really appreciate it. Thank you, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, fellas.
<Question> <Negative> But is this part of a pattern of sort of corrupt behavior by NBC?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, not only NBC, I think the media, large segments of the, not all, large segments of the media are corrupt. Absolutely.
<Question> <Negative> What about Andy Lack, do you think he should go?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he runs an organization that as far as its reporting on me is very dishonest. They're very dishonest. I can do something good and they'll make it as bad as possible. No matter what I do. If I do something that's really good, they'll make it as bad as they can make it. If I do something bad, it's like you know, it's like I should get the electric chair. It's incredible.
<Question> <Negative> Just this weekend, Chuck Todd wrote a piece saying that it's time for the press to 'Fight back against people who challenge their credibility,' and Chuck Todd of course an MSNBC and NBC —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sleepy Eyes.
<Question> <Negative> Ha, what do you think of that? The idea that they'd fight back.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd. He covers me very dishonestly, I mean you watch his show, it's like he gets angry at people if they say I've done a good job. And they won't appear on the show again. You look at these panels of people, the worst are the panels. You look at this guy Dowd on ABC, I don't even know who the hell he is.
<Question> <Positive> Matthew Dowd.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's just horrendous, he's supposed to be a Republican. You know, it's always rough when they say Republican and then they go into -- and my people say, 'Geez he's a Republican, how can he be that way?'
<Question> <Negative> Ana Navarro comes to mind.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Ana Navarro, she's sick. I mean, she's sick. The hatred. I never met Ana Navarro. I met Dowd once, he came right into the Oval Office like about a year ago, walked in, could not have been nicer, I said 'hello,' just a quick -- he was in the White House. You were there, I think, Sarah. We said a quick hello and that was it. And he was gone. Couldn't have been nicer. But before that, brutal, but I watched him a week ago and the level of hatred is beyond anything normal that I can imagine.
<Question> <Neutral> Can I ask you about the Kavanaugh hearing today?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Question> <Neutral> Democrats have put on quite a show, have you kept up with it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A good show or a bad show?
<Question> <Negative> I'll leave that up to you, sir.
<Question> <Negative> Have you seen some of it? It's been a lot of protests and interrupting.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm amazed that people allow the interruption to continue. You know, there are some people that just keep screaming at the same people. In the old days we used to throw them out. Today I guess they just keep screaming. I thought Sen. Hatch was good because he was very indignant at the interruptions by a woman that was up there that just kept going on and on. I don't know why they don't, why they don't take care of a situation like that because it's terrible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's embarrassing for the country to allow protesters, you don't even know which side the protesters were on. But to allow someone to stand up and scream from the top of their lungs and nobody does anything about it is frankly -- I think it's an embarrassment. I think, well it's really early stages, but I think the Democrats are grasping at straws, that looks like to me. It's incredible how bipartisan everything, when you look at how the opposite, I mean, when you look at how the level of division between the two sides, it's sort of incredible.
<Question> <Negative> Several Democrats who want to run for president, potentially in 2020 are on the Judiciary Committee, people like Cory Booker and Kamala Harris -- do you think they're sort of auditioning for the role right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I mean, I hope they are, 'cause I'd love to run against them. So far I don't see anybody -- I saw John Kerry is looking, I like that very much. He's the father of the Iran deal.
<Question> <Negative> Joe Biden.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd love Joe Biden, sleepy Joe. I'd love Joe Biden to run. It looks like they're going to have a lot of people lining up, but so far, and I'm an honest guy, I'll let you know if there's anybody I see that could be trouble. But so far, I'm not seeing it. I think they're using this hearing as an audition for the presidency.
<Question> <Negative> The other big fight for Congress is the government spending because they have to handle a government spending bill in September.
<Question> <Negative> Where are we on a shutdown, specifically on immigration?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I want to keep, I don't like the idea of shutdowns. We've already started the wall. We've gotten $3.2 billion for the wall. We've done a lot of work on the wall. San Diego is completing now the whole, a big chunk of -- we're putting it in the worst areas where we really need it the most.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Ultimately I can do it all in one year, I'd like to get the funding, the full funding, but we have done a lot of work. People don't realize that. I've done it very quietly. The press isn't picking it up. We've done a lot of work on the wall. And it's really, really good work. Border security is a very important issue. I don't see even myself or anybody else closing down the country right now.
<Question> <Negative> Maybe after the midterms?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that after midterms, we're going to have a very serious discussion because we want border security, we have to have it. It's going to be a big part of -- it is a big part of this country. We have to have border security.
<Question> <Negative> Are you disappointed that you had to scale back from 100 percent prosecution for border crossers because of the family separation coverage?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, what I say is this, if you're going to come into the country illegally, that's why our numbers good despite horrible laws. We have horrible laws, but our numbers are good in terms of keeping our country safe. There's gotta be a price to pay. There's gotta be a price to pay, and there is a price to pay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know we're very tough on people crossing the borders illegally. And you know Obama had the same policy of separation. You know, people don't realize half the pictures were taken of separation were taken where, most of the pictures, that pictures in '14 of kids separated from their parents. That was all Obama. People don't say it but Obama had the same law that I did and they separated parents from children. I think you guys understand that.
<Question> <Positive> Yes, very much so.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You like these people, don't you? Do you want to give them one more question? Go ahead.
<Question> <Negative> Sir, if you could tell us a little about any of your thoughts on the allegations of sexual abuse right now within the Catholic Church? I think it's an important issue for the country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's so sad to watch.
<Question> <Positive> And how do you think the Pope is handling it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's so sad to watch. The numbers, the length of time, you know, going back 70 years. I think it's having a really negative impact on the Catholic Church. I think it's very sad, to me it's one of the sadder stories 'cause I respect so much the Catholic Church. And to me it's a very sad story. The Pope is handling it, I guess, the best anyone can handle it. How is he going to handle it?
<Question> <Negative> What about leadership here in the U.S.? Are you disappointed in them? Do you think they should go?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm surprised at McCarrick. Everyone knew him and so incredible to see these things. It's devastating for the Catholic Church.
