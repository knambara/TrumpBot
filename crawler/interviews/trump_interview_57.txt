<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> Mr. President -- first of all, Mr. President, welcome again to the Bill Cunningham Show and also to Greater Cincinnati.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, and you have a great show.
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> I don't know about this. But the last couple nights, I've been watching the disaster on television, and most of the pundits said, "Guess who won the debates?"
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, I just read a lot --
<Bill Cunningham> <Neutral> You.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> About that. I know --
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> Trump wins.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've heard it, Bill. It was so nice.
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> You know what I find amazing is we've spent most of our time talking about the failures of Obama policy. The Democrats are now attacking Obama. Are you surprised by that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because it doesn't work. We've been managing it well, and we've done -- you know I had a decision to make. Do I manage it well, or do I manage it poorly? And managing fully would be really tough. So we managed it, as well as it could be managed, but still the price is too high. You take a look at the deductible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's way -- I mean, you have the deductible, you can practically not even use it. So Obamacare is a disaster. We had it beaten. Ond then one man late in the evening decided, Bill, that I think I'm gonna -- after eight years of campaigning, I think I'm gonna vote against it. And he did something, but it's actually maybe gonna work out very well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It looks like it's gonna work out very well. But Obamacare knows is a disaster.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> What's amazing is President Barack Hussein Obama campaigned on the idea of no Medicare for all. He was saying -- Obama was saying --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> It was too expensive. And so you come along and say, "Wait a minute. Let's reform. We can afford it. It'd be nice to do it." But do you find it amazing that you agree with Obama on some things, such as Obama was saying for years, "We don't want an open border." Democrats say we don't want open border. Obama said, "No Medicare for all." Democrats said no Medicare for all.
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> And now you're saying, "Now, wait a minute. There's a couple of three things Obama did I agree with." But Democrats are attacking Obama. You find that amazing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the whole thing is incredible. I watched both nights and much of it each night. This was not a very exciting evening of television. But I watched and I guess it's probably four or five. It's down to four or five. I can't imagine somebody else coming up. But I don't think it's what our country represents, number one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And when you look at open borders, how about the open borders, where everybody can just come in, and you know we're stopping them now. In fact, we have Mexico stopping them because Congress -- the Democrats in Congress won't -- will give us no votes for border security. Can you believe it? No votes. So we'll get them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we're going to get them in the next election. But I'm just watching, and it's incredible to think people come up -- many of these people are not good people. They're convicted of lots of bad crimes and they want open borders where they just flow into our country. It's not happening. We won't let it happen, and we're doing really well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I have to say Mexico has been great. Now I said if you don't, we're going to have to do tariffs on your products coming in. And right now, they have 21,000 soldiers, and it's been -- it's had a tremendous impact.
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> President Obama said, "Get rid of criminal and illegal aliens." Joe Biden, his V.P., is saying, "Wait a minute. Let's give them a hearing." Isn't it amazing that Democrats are running against Obama. I find this as a commentator an amazing circumstance.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the whole thing with Biden talking about hearings, it's so crazy with judges. We're the only country in the world, or just about, where people come in Bill, they come in and they get a trial, so we hire Perry Mason. And it's a big deal. And the trial we say come back in four years. It's just so crazy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But with here, nobody else has judges. They come in other countries they come and they say sorry you have to get out and in this country they come in as welcome to litigation. But we have it -- we've done a lot. You know, we could solve it very quickly with the Democrats. It will take literally 20 minutes to solve, but they don't want to do it.
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> On issues in Baltimore, is it possible for a conservative to talk about failures in the inner city without being labeled a racist? And there was a story today on that on the A.P. that the murder rate in Baltimore is higher than the murder rate in El Salvador.
<Bill Cunningham> <Neutral> Can you talk about any problems in urban America without being labeled?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I think not just me. Well, they called Nancy Pelosi a racist two weeks ago too. So you know it's one of those things. But anytime they run out of ammunition, they start throwing the R word out there. It's a terrible thing. I mean, it's a terrible thing. I'm the least racist person there is. But it's a terrible thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think I've exposed everybody for what they are, and Baltimore has been a very good example. You look at it, it's gotten billions and billions of dollars over the years, and the money has been wasted or stolen.
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> Now -- and lastly on the issue on the economy, here in the Midwest it's important. Obama lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs. And Obama said, "Guess what folks, they're not coming back." You've added 500,000 Midwestern manufacturing jobs, given another four years. Joe Biden said last night, "Trump doesn't need another eight years." I think Joe Biden might have a little math problem.
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> But nonetheless, assuming he get another four years, how would a manufacturing be better under Trump than it would be under a socialist.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, President Obama said that manufacturing jobs are gone. You'd need a magic wand, if you remember that expression, a very famous expression. And we've added 600,000 in the country and a lot more are coming. I mean, frankly we need people to work because we have the lowest unemployment rate very soon in the history of our country, lowest with African-Americans, lowest with Asians, lowest with Hispanics.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have the lowest. So I mean, we're just -- we're doing great. But we're bringing back manufacturing jobs, Bill, and that's very important. They're best jobs. I mean, these are great jobs, high-paying jobs, talented people, and they're coming back like never before. And I'm just -- I just got numbers that Ohio is now having the best year in its history.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> Blaxit, it's blacks exiting the Democratic party. Outside, there's numerous African-Americans with posters and signs saying join the Blaxit movement. Would you like to see Blaxit work in America?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would love to see it, and I love those people that are outside. And I wonder if I could get to say hello to them tonight, I'd say hello. But it's happening more and more. And look, the best unemployment rate they've ever had, the most African-Americans working right now in the history of our country. Think of it, more people are working, African-Americans good jobs than they've ever had -- that we have ever had in our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So that's really nice when you tell me something like that. I appreciate it.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> Right. They're out there working right now. Blaxit is important.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love it. That's a great -- that's a great -- this is one that's gonna be used, I guarantee.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> No question. Mr. President, thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Bill, I want to thank you. You've been such a great friend, and I just want to thank you very much.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> You're a great American.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> Bill Cunningham with the President on 700 WLW. Thank you.
<Thomas Roberts> <Positive> Joining me now on the telephone, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, thanks for joining me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was just wondering if you have anything positive to say. Beautiful introduction. All negative. But go ahead.
<Thomas Roberts> <Negative> We do have something positive to lead with, Mr. Trump, the fact the new CBS/New York Times" poll shows you leading nationally in head-to-head match-ups when it comes to you and your closest rival Ted Cruz. But you heard those thinly-veiled attacks about rhetoric from your campaign
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think the country would be in much better shape than it is right now.  A lot of what he said, if you look at [Inaudible], the median income it's lower right now than it was when he took office for people.  People are unhappy, or I wouldn't be so well, leading polls by a tremendous amount.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, you know, by double digits and I wouldn't be doing that, frankly.  And I wouldn't even want to be doing it if the country were going well.  I'd love -- I'd be very happy if the country were doing great and I'd be very happy if he was doing a great job as president because of that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And -- but it's not.  I mean, it's just not taking place that way, Thomas.  It's -- the country is not doing well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at that horrible situation with the Iran deal that we made, where we're giving $150 billion.  We get nothing.  They get everything.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then I see our wonderful sailors with their hands up in the air as they were captured like, you know, sure, they were released.  The only reason they were released, they get $100 million next week, maybe even this week, and they don't want to jeopardize that.  So obviously they're going to release them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're not going to keep them.  But other than that, they wouldn't -- they would have kept them.  If it happened in two weeks from now, they would have kept them, and they would've kept them for a long period of time. [Crosstalk]
<Thomas Roberts> <Negative> Let's ask you about that, because you make a point about Iran and what happened with those ten Navy sailors that drifted into Iranian waters that were captured. The White House chief of staff Dennis McDonough cited the Iran nuclear deal for the open diplomatic communications that guaranteed their release. Do you still stand by your assessment that the Iran deal is a bad one?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Of course it's a bad deal.  They get $100 billion during the next short period of time.  They don't want to jeopardize that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Who's going to say, oh, let's keep these ten people, these ten wonderful soldiers, who went through hell by the way.  And when I see pictures of them with their arms up in the air and guns pointed at them, I wouldn't exactly say that's friendly.  But they're not going to keep them because they want to pick up their $100 billion dollars for a deal that they gave nothing on.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, by the way, speaking of that, we still have four hostages over there. Why aren't they giving those hostages back?
<Thomas Roberts> <Negative> You make a great note about that. And I know you're prepping for tomorrow night, coming up for the debate that will take place in South Carolina. So I want to refocus our conversation about South Carolina and the governor, Nikki Haley, and that comment she made to the Today" show that she was referring to you and others in her GOP official response last night. So what do you say to her about the fact she feels your campaign is loud, angry, and irresponsible?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, what I'd say to her is I'm leading in South Carolina by a lot in all of the polls and people agree with me.  I'm very strong on illegal immigration.  She's weak on illegal immigration.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, she's very, very weak on it and it's a problem.  She's big on amnesty but very weak on illegal immigration.  And so therefore we have a disagreement.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, she comes up to my office when she wants campaign contributions and I've given her tremendous contributions over the years. But I guess now that I'm running, she doesn't like me quite as much. She liked me better when I was a giver of contributions than she does when I'm not.
<Thomas Roberts> <Positive> We know the governor of South Carolina is really going to be an important state. You're talking about your lead there. But when we look at the primary process for the GOP, if there was a problem in Iowa and, say, Cruz captured that or if there was a problem in New Hampshire, you would really need South Carolina and probably Governor Haley's support. Are you worried you made an enemy of her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No.  I don't worry about that.  I mean, the people in South Carolina, I know them very well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've been there all the time.  I'm going there a lot.  I have a lot scheduled.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm leading in the polls by tremendous numbers.  It's one of my strongest states.  I love the people there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're strong.  They're tough.  They want a -- they're very strong on illegal immigration and she's weak.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, you know, if you look at that, I think I'll do very well.  I don't know her attitude.  I haven't spoken to her in quite a while.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But she's a very nice woman, a very good woman.  But I disagree with her politically and obviously she disagrees with me politically on immigration.  I want people to come into the country, but I want them to come in recently.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want them to come in legally, and that's a very big distinction. And she's just very weak on the subject. And that's something that doesn't play very well with me.
<Thomas Roberts> <Positive> She seemed to echo that, too, about them coming in legally and being properly vetted to live here under American law. But what do you think her motives are for going after you so publicly and so strongly?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, she probably figures maybe it's good for her, maybe it's not good for her.  Maybe it will be bad for her.  Because people know where I stand.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And, you know, you see the numbers.  Even in Iowa if you look at the CNN poll, I'm 33-20 up.  And we'll see what happens in Iowa.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, I have a great relationship also with the people of Iowa and I think we're going to do well.  With the evangelicals, you know, I'm doing -- nationwide, I'm leading with the evangelicals by a lot.  I'm leading with the Tea Party.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, we're doing well.  We just have to see what happens.  Look, I'm only doing this to make America great again.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're a country that is doing poorly.  You can't believe what you heard last night because it was just -- the fact is our economy is terrible.  One of the weakest -- I guess it's the weakest recovery on record, and by far the weakest recovery ever on record.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the median income I mean, you just look at that.  That's why there's so much anger.  The median income for people is lower now than it was Barack Obama took office.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at the African-Americans, they're doing worse than they've ever done, and we have an African-American president. They're doing worse than they've ever done. You see what's happening.
<Thomas Roberts> <Negative> So when we talk -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In terms of jobs, in terms of the economy, they've been left out. And we have an African-American president. I think it's disgraceful.
<Thomas Roberts> <Neutral> Mr. Trump, when we talk about Iowa though, we see Ted Cruz in the latest poll out of The Des Moines Register" and Bloomberg showing a three-point lead by Ted Cruz. He also has a stronger lead just in that state -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Which is a tie, b the way, according to polls.
<Thomas Roberts> <Positive> Well, it's -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a tie. You're the only one that reported it that way. Everyone else said it's --
<Thomas Roberts> <Negative> Within the margin of error.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- statistically. Yes.
<Thomas Roberts> <Positive> Yes. But evangelicals support Ted Cruz more than they do you. And there's this push polling -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it may be why I'm beating -- Excuse me. Nationwide, I'm beating Ted Cruz by a lot with the evangelicals. And I think in the end I'm going to do very well in Iowa. I mean, I don't know. Who knows what -- you know, I can't predict, but I think I'll do very well in Iowa. And I like Ted Cruz. I mean, he's got a basic problem, but I like Ted Cruz.
<Thomas Roberts> <Positive> When we look at the race being so close in Iowa and you talk about that friendship and the fact you like him, there have been issues that have been drummed up about whether or not he would be eligible to run for president. He says that this is settled law. You say, and you sent out a tweet earlier --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's totally unsettled law, and it wasn't drummed up by me. It was drummed up by The Washington Post". And there are many that say And my problem is that he has to get this cleared up. He can go for a declaratory judgment or he's going early to court. But how can you vote for somebody that -- where there's a question? I'm not saying right or wrong. I'm just saying there's a big question. You can't have your nominee with a question. It's impossible to do. He's going to be running and people are going to be suing to say that he's not allowed to run. Or serve.
<Thomas Roberts> <Negative> I'm being told that we need to wrap up soon because you need to get going. But last question, and it has to do with the national polls, especially the new one from the CBS and The New York Times". It says you hold a double-digit lead over the rest of Republican field If you are the eventual GOP nominee and Hillary Clinton is the eventual Democratic nominee, will you keep up your personal attacks against her husband?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll be looking at whatever they say about me, and it will be dependent. And by the way, the last couple of polls I'm beating Hillary Clinton very easily head-to-head. So we'll see. And beating Bernie Sanders, I think, frankly will be at least as easy and easier. But I'm beating her and I will beat Bernie Sanders very easily. You can't raise taxes to 80 percent and 90 percent and you can't do the things that he's saying. But I guess we're looking at Hillary right now ,but Bernie is doing pretty well against her. It's going to be an interesting race, I suspect.
<Thomas Roberts> <Negative> Bernie Sanders is our guest coming up on the next block. Do you have a certain question? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Give him my warmest regards.
<Thomas Roberts> <Neutral> Do you have a certain question you want me to ask of him directly from you, if he is your general election contender?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. Just give him my warmest regards, OK?
<Thomas Roberts> <Neutral> I will.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Have a good time. Thank you.
<Thomas Roberts> <Positive> Donald Trump, thank you, sir. Safe travels onto South Carolina tomorrow and thank you for your time today.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
