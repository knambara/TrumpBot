<John Dickerson> <Negative> What about infrastructure? When is that going happen?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to do infrastructure very quickly. We've got the plan largely completed, and we'll be filing over the next two or three weeks, maybe sooner.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> You said you were disappointed in the Republicans in Congress. Why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, disappointed. They're friends of mine, they're really special people, whether it's Freedom Caucus or Tuesday orThursday or let's go have a drink, that group. They're great people, I know them all. And I can honestly say, a lot of them, I can honestly say I don't dislike any of them. I like almost all of them a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know, we have some votes that have never voted positively. But now we're the governing party. Before it didn't matter. They could vote no. It wouldn't matter because President Obama was going veto everything and they didn't have the Senate. Now we have the Senate, the House, and the White House. But these are great people. And I think you're going to see the Republican Party really come together.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> So they're kind of learning what it's like to be in charge.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they're governing now. They've never governed. You know, they haven't governed. Now they're governing. So now it's just not like saying no. Before they could say no, it didn't matter, because it wasn't going to get approved anyway, so what difference does it make? Now we're governing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'll tell you what, the Republican Party, they're great people. And frankly, a lot of the Democrats are great. They have bad leadership. Schumer's not a leader, he doesn't know how to lead. I know him for a long time, he has no leadership ability. And he's bringing them so far left they're never going to win another election, believe me.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> What's the difference between negotiating in Washington versus negotiating in business?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think the big difference is, for what we're doing here, Washington, you really need heart, because you're talking about a lot of people. Whereas business, you don't need so much heart. You want to make a good deal. [Break in Interview]
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Every president makes the Oval Office theirs. What have you done to make this yours?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, a lot of things. We had these incredible flags including the American flags. And they were in different rooms. And they were always being pushed around because they didn't have enough room. And I said, "How beautiful, the base, the flags, Army, Navy, Marine Corps. I mean, just so beautiful. Just so beautiful." The Coast Guard flag over here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I said, "Well, let's see how they look in the Oval Office." So the flags were up. The picture of Thomas Jefferson I put up. The picture of Andrew Jackson I put up because they said his campaign and my campaign tended to mirror each other. So we did a lot of -- actually we did a lot of work. It's -- it's a much -- it's a much different -- look than it was previously.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> What would Fred -- that's a picture of Fred Trump over there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's my father.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have -- one coming of my mother. A beautiful --
<John Dickerson> <Negative> What would he think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he'd be very proud. He was a Brooklyn builder. I learned a lot from him. He's a great guy, good heart. Tough guy, but a good heart, great heart. And he'd be very proud.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> You said the White House was like a cocoon sometimes. Tell me about that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I was very well known as you understand prior to this. But that was a different type of -- that was a different world. This is something you are really in your own little world. Secret Service, they're phenomenal. But they are all over the place. I mean, they are the real deal. They're all over the place.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I wanted to get out, drive my car to a certain location, and go do something, you can't do that anymore. Haven't been able to do that for a long period of time. But all of that I understand. I guess I assumed that that would happen if you won. And most importantly I think we're doing a very good job. And I enjoy it.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> Tell me about -- what -- you -- you do a lot of your work in here, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. I'm here a lot actually.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Why in here and not other places?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I feel very warm toward the Oval Office. It's a great symbol. Also when I have certain people that we want to negotiate -- for instance, I was negotiating to reduce the price of the big fighter jet contract, the F-35, which was totally out of control. I will save billions and billions and billions of dollars. And calling from here and meeting here and having meetings on that contract, I think gives you great additional power, if you want to know the truth.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> So what's your --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Other people have come in. Big people from big companies have been to the White House 50 times. In one case, I won't say who, somebody you know very well, the head of a major major company. I said, "Have you been to the White House before?" "Yes, 51 times."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said, "Oh good, so you've been to the Oval Office." "No, I was never brought to the Oval Office." I said, "Come on, I'll bring you to the Oval Office." The person came into the Oval Office and started to cry. This is a tough person by the way. Came into the Oval Office and started to cry. Now, this -- a person with a magnificent office with beautiful glass walls and everything else. You understand. You've seen those offices before. But there is something very special about this space.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> If somebody's going to behave like that in front of you in here, how do you know that people aren't always just telling you what you want to hear?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You mean, with the tears? Is it?
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> No, just, you know, they see the power of the White House and the Oval Office and they think, "Yes, Mr. President." Who tells you no?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I think when it comes to the Oval Office, I think everybody means that. You know, when I have foreign leaders here, no matter what country, no matter how big. We had -- Chancellor Merkel. We had -- we have them all. They all come here. They still take notice at the Oval Office.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And they mean it.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> But that's what I mean. One of the worries about a presidency is that everybody tells you yes. Nobody helps you figure out where your blind spots are. So how do you -- how do --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well --
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> -- you find that? How do you get?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- that's, I guess, it's one of those things in life you have to be able to figure it out. Maybe I've been figuring that out anyway long before I got here.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Mm hm.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But some things you have to be able to figure out. But this is a special place. The White House is special. The Oval Office, very special.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Any other gadgets you've gotten installed here since you came?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, everyone thinks that this is very ominous right here. See this? These are phones. These are very, you know, secure phones. But this is a -- very ominous looking because of the red button.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> What does that get you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well --
<John Dickerson> <Negative> -- when you press the red button?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- it gets you a Coke or gets you a Pepsi. One or the other, it'd have to be. Any other cola companies I should mention? Right? But it gets you something. But every time I press that, people --
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Worry you're --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In fact I have fun with people. They'll be sitting down. I changed the -- the way it works. I'll have people sitting here. Used to be they never had chairs that anybody can remember in front of the desk. But I've always done it this way where I'm at the desk and I have people here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But usually they would sit on the sofas. But this is the Resolute desk. It's a great desk with a phenomenal history. Many great presidents were behind this desk. And then some choose other desks. They have about seven desks that you can actually choose. But I like this. This was FDR. It was Ronald Reagan. It was Kennedy. And there's some great presidents behind this desk.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> George W. Bush said the reason the Oval Office is round is there are no corners you can hide in.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there's truth to that. There is truth to that. There are certainly no corners. And you look, there's a certain openness. But there's nobody out there. You know, there is an openness, but I've never seen anybody out there actually, as you could imagine.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> But he -- what he meant was it's -- all comes --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure. Sure.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> -- back to you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure. It does. But I think that's true anyway. But it does, there's no question.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> When did that hit you, that you're -- the magnitude of that -- of the office? And that idea that you were -- regardless of what happened, your name -- the buck stopped with you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's the bigness of the office. It's the bigness of the transactions. It's the bigness of the deals. You look at -- the order of planes. It's bigger than any order of planes. You look at aircraft carriers that cost 10 billion and 12 billion dollars to build and submarines that cost 5 billion to build. It's the magnitude.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But most importantly, you know, the decisions. Like, when I make the decision to go with Syria, the 59 Tomahawk missiles. Unbelievable technology. We have unbelievable talent. But those are tough decisions. Those aren't, like, decisions that I'm going to buy a building --
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Tough why?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because it's human lives.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Killing people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're killing people. And you can kill the wrong people, too. You know, those things go off and they end up in a town or they end up in a city. And you have another tragedy on your hands. So, these decisions are unbelievable -- you know, in terms of the importance because it's human -- it's -- it's -- it's killing. I hate it. But things have to be done.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> How do you learn that skill? Who do you call to say what's it like to --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's nobody you can call.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> Did President Obama give you any advice that was helpful? That you think, wow, he really was --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- Well, he was very nice to me. But after that, we've had some difficulties. So it doesn't matter. You know, words are less important to me than deeds. And you -- you saw what happened with surveillance. And everybody saw what happened with surveillance --
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Difficulties how?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- and I thought that -- well, you saw what happened with surveillance. And I think that was inappropriate, but that's the way --
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> What does that mean, sir?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You can figure that out yourself.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Well, I -- the reason I ask is you said he was -- you called him "sick and bad".
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look, you can figure it out yourself. He was very nice to me with words, but -- and when I was with him -- but after that, there has been no relationship.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> But you stand by that claim about him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't stand by anything. I just -- you can take it the way you want. I think our side's been proven very strongly. And everybody's talking about it. And frankly it should be discussed. I think that is a very big surveillance of our citizens. I think it's a very big topic. And it's a topic that should be number one. And we should find out what the hell is going on.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> I just wanted to find out, though. You're -- you're the president of the United States. You said he was "sick and bad" because he had tapped you -- I'm just --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You can take -- any way. You can take it any way you want.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> But I'm asking you. Because you don't want it to be --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You don't --
<John Dickerson> <Negative> -- fake news. I want to hear it from --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You don't have to --
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> -- President Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- ask me. You don't have to ask me.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Why not?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because I have my own opinions. You can have your own opinions.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> But I want to know your opinions. You're the president of the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, it's enough. Thank you. Thank you very much.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Impact segment tonight, let's bring in Donald Trump. Joins us now from Greenville, North Carolina where he is campaigning. So, first of all, let's talk about your campaign. You've said in the past that you expect to beat Hillary Clinton somewhat easily. Do you still feel that way?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know if I said easily but I hope to win and I think we will win. We are doing very well as you probably know. And I think we're going to have a great -- I think we have a great campaign going. North Carolina now Virginia before, Ohio yesterday. We had a tremendous crowd in Ohio. It was unbelievable actually. And I think we are doing very well.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> All right. So, you are not going to say you are going to beat her easily because have you said that in the past. But you say you are still going to win on track to win. Now, let's look at the CNN poll which has you ahead by one. It's divided along race and gender. For example, you beat Secretary Clinton with men 54 percent to 32 percent. Why do you think you beat her with men?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, maybe they like strong borders. And maybe they like strong military. But I think women do, also. That's why I think I'm going to do very well with women. I notice that we are doing very well with married women.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> All right. Stay on the men now. We get to the women in a moment.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think a lot has to do with the military. A lot has to do with the strength of the borders. And not allowing the Syrians to come in who we just don't know where they are coming from. Who they are. There is no documentation. It's a disaster. Hillary wants them to pour into our country and I don't.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> All right. So you think it's a national security play for men to favor you over Mrs. Clinton?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I guess. But I think women want that just as much as men.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Whoa, whoa. Let's get to --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think women want it as much as men.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Well, I don't know about that. CNN poll has women. 53 Clinton, 38 Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, if you are asking me the question, I think we went way up with married women and we are going very much higher with women than we were two months ago. I never really understood that why we weren't doing well because it's very much also, it's national security, it's jobs. I think jobs for men and for women. You know, I'm not sure there is such a big difference to be honest with you, Bill.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> But there is in the poll. I mean, maybe I don't know why. I think it mostly has to be style over substance, maybe. But there is a huge difference. You dominate on men. Dominate with men. And she dominates with American women. Let's get to the race. In white, white Americans, again, you dominate 55 percent to 34 percent. You are up 21 with whites. Why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can't tell you, Bill. I mean, all I'm doing is talking about jobs and bringing back our jobs. I can't say why.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> You don't have any opinion on that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't really. I really don't.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, I had a tremendous experience in Detroit and in Philadelphia this last week. With African-Americans and really inner cities and we went to a church, an African-American church, which was incredible. And, you know, I think, you know, I would think that I'm doing very well with the African-Americans.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Let's go with the nonwhite. Nonwhite is, you know, all non-Caucasians. Clinton 72 percent, Trump 18.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think maybe 18 is a lot higher than it was three weeks ago. I think we have made a lot of progress. I mean, I actually saw one where it was one percent.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> That was just African-Americans. This is in all nonwhites in it. All right. But anyway, look, what I am trying to get at --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's highly under rated, Bill.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think it's highly underrated.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> This is polarized race. It's polarized along gender. Right now, this could change. I mean, I think the debates will change a lot of things. But it's polarized right now. It's gender, women like her, men like you. Whites like you. Nonwhites like her and, you know, you don't have a theory on why, you know, you don't have a theory.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't have a theory, Bill.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm about jobs. I'm about the fence. I'm about borders. I'm about a lot of things. I'm about our vets. I'm about strong military. You know, whether you break it down into men or women or anybody else, I mean, I think people want to hear that and I'm much better at it than she is. She will be very weak on the border. She wants people just to flow in terms of illegal immigration. People are going to flow into the country. And it's going to be a disaster.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> All right. But apparently non-White Americans don't find that. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- women like that.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> I mean, that's the thing. The Factor is that some people want open borders. And Bernie Sanders and his crew, let everybody in. Everybody do, you know, open society, George Soros. Everybody comes in. You know that crew. Okay. Now, Electoral College. See, in my view and I said this on my website today, it's a tie. It's a tie. You might be ahead in the popular vote a little bit right now which is pretty interesting come back from where you were four weeks ago.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> But Electoral College is tough. It's tough. You have very little margin for error. You have got to knock off Ohio, you have got to knock off Florida, you have to win North Carolina where some polls you have behind. You have got to win either Michigan or Pennsylvania. That's tough. You don't have any margin for error where she does have some margin.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, when you say you, you are talking about the Republican Party because it's always been that way or it's been that way for the last 20 years. And there is truth to it, but I think we are doing very well in those states. I just left again, Ohio we are doing well. We are leading in Ohio. We are leading in Florida. We are leading in --
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> In some polls you are. In some polls you aren't. I know how it is.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. [Crosstalk]
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Would you cede tonight you don't have a lot of margin for error. You have to take the key states that I mentioned. It's going to be tough for you in Virginia. But you don't need Virginia. It's not a have to have.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I just left Virginia. I know but I just left Virginia and we're just about even in Virginia.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Close. But you know McAuliffe.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm not surprised. I think, you know, I see the crowds. I see the people. But we are pretty even in Virginia, too.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> All right. Would you cede that you don't have much margin for error in the Electoral College or no?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, when you say you again, you are talking about the Republican Party.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> You, you, Donald Trump, no, no, no. It's you, Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm just saying the Republican Party has a tougher road. There is no question about it. I have known that. It's been that way for a long number of years.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think we're doing well and I think we are going to win.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, let's get to Detroit. I was going to do this in the second segment. I was going to carry out Mr. Trump over but let's go there now. I thought they were respectful to you when you did have the dialogue with the people in Detroit. But the reaction was, you know, they ran out, they being the media, ran out to find people that smash you which they did. What was your assessment of that whole situation?
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> I thought the reaction was amazing. And the church was amazing. The bishop was amazing. I thought the whole thing was really an incredible experience for me. And I think it was tremendous success.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What did you learn? What did you learn by going there?
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Well, I don't know learn because I knew they were great people to start off with. But, I just reinforced it. These are people of faith. These are people that are strong believers in God. They were absolutely so warm and so genuine and I was very, very impressed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Did you learn anything about --
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Section of Detroit.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All right. Did you learn anything about why Detroit has collapsed? Why have the population has fled the area? Did you learn why?
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Well, I think I know a lot of the reasons why because our leadership has lost the jobs. I mean, a lot of these companies have moved to Mexico. They moved out of Michigan, generally. That's why I'm doing well in Michigan. Because I have been talking about this for five years not just the last three weeks like, you know, Hillary who doesn't have any clue as to why they are leaving. And I know how to get them back and I know how to keep them from leaving. But if you look at Michigan generally speaking. You look at the big auto plants that are being built in Mexico and you look at what is happening with respect to Mexico is like the eighth wonder of the world. And Michigan is getting killed.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Yes, they are.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I will stop it. They are getting killed.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Do you think -- last question on this. Do you think your birther position has hurt you among African-Americans?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. I have no idea. I don't even talk about it anymore, Bill.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> No, I know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because, you know, I just don't find the --
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> But it's there on the record.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. I guess was maybe some, I don't know. Why? I really don't know why. But I don't think, very few people, you are the first one that's brought that up in a while. I don't think so. I mean, look, I went to Detroit. We had -- it was like a love fest. We had just a great, great time. I was there for a long time. Again, the bishop and his wife and whole congregation, these are fantastic people.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> All right. Well, let's hold Mr. Trump over and he is very kind to give us the time. And we're going to talk about immigration which, as you know in the talking points, I said has propelled Mr. Trump and made him pretty much even with Hillary Clinton right now. Then, later, more damaging Clinton Foundation stuff. Charles Krauthammer will have some thoughts on that. Moments away. [Commercial Break[
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Continuing now with Donald Trump who is in Greenville, North Carolina tonight. Okay. In the Talking Points memo which I know you did not hear because you were on the trail. I said that you are going to build, in my opinion, of course, you are going to build a wall if you are elected. I don't think there is any question.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're right. You're right.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> That you are going to come down hard on sanctuary cities and cut off federal funds.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're right.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> If you are elected, you will do that that criminal aliens, aliens who are here illegally who commit crimes in the U.S.A., you will immediately deport them. You are going to have some static in the court system because of due process but certainly you will authorize authorities to do that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Am I accurate so far?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we will pass Kate's Law.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> And Kate's Law. Very important. And I know you have been behind that from the very beginning. The issue you are apparently modifying is what we talked about and I told you very rudely, I was rude, that there is no way you are going to be able to deport 12 million law abiding peaceful illegal aliens in the system that we have. There is too much due process involved. You are not going to be able to get an immigration force of that kind to drag them out of their homes. So, it looks like you are modifying that. Am I correct there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I never talked about dragging people out of their homes, Bill. I never talked about that. Look, I mean, just so you understand. We are going to have a very strong border. People are going to come into our country but they're going to come in legally. But we're going to have the wall. We're going to have -- by the way Mexico is going to pay for the wall 100 percent. We're going to have a wall. Mexico is going to pay for the wall. We're going to have a strong border.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Border patrol 16500 agents endorsed me because they understand we are going to get rid of first thing, first hour I'm going to authorize get rid of all of the drug lords and the gang members and all of the people that are here illegally that shouldn't be and committing tremendous crime, like unbelievable crime.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> You can't just do executive order. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very little due process.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> No, but there's some.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Bill, I think there's very little, okay, but I think there's very little. And the police, the local police know who all of them are. And we're going to get rid of them. So, we are going to stabilize our border. We're going to have a strong border. We are going to have a country again. And then what's going to happen is, when it's all completed, the wall. All of this is completed, the people that haven't committed a crime other than, of course, coming into the country illegally which of course, you know, depending on your definition, those people, Bill are, we are going to determine when we look at where the country is, how the border is, what's happening with our country, which will be down the road, we're going to make a determination at that time as to what to do with the rest.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> That's a modification of your original position. But that's fine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Depending on how you want to view it.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Okay. Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know about that. But that's okay. If you want to say that, it's fine.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> In my opinion as a news analyst, you have modified your position a bit. But I'm saying to you that I believe the whole package that you put together in Arizona, all right, has now reignited your campaign. That you now have some momentum behind.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, and Hillary, just as you know, Bill, it's very important, Hillary has no package. Because she never talks about illegal immigration. She wants everybody to pour into the country.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She wants the Syrians to pour into the country 600 percent almost. More than Obama has. And he has got thousands and thousands of people pouring in right now.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She has no -- if you ask her, she has got absolutely zero to talk about on illegal immigration. Everybody can just pour into our country and take our jobs and no matter how they are good bad or indifferent, I mean, just pour into our country, that is a disaster for the United States.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Well, I hope I will get a chance to answer that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She didn't want to talk about it. And she got brought there -- Bill, she got brought there by Bernie Sanders. You know, super left. I mean, she got brought there by Bernie Sanders.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But people are going to pour into the country under the Hillary non-existing plan. Nobody even knows what her plan is.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Now, Governor Pence says, he going to release his tax returns. Today Hillary Clinton is whacking you again. You know, she does it almost every day. That you should release your tax returns. If Governor Pence does release his, is that going to put pressure on you to release yours?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not at all. Nobody cares about it except some of the folks in the media. Nobody cares about it. But just so you understand, I am under audit. A routine audit. And when the audit is complete, I will release my returns. I don't know when this is going to be. But when the audit is complete, I release my returns. I have no problem with it. It doesn't matter.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> But the legal people say, do it now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In the meantime, Bill, in the meantime, well, no but nobody would recommend that. In the meantime, she has 33,000 emails that she deleted. When is she going to release her emails? She probably knows how to find it. Let her release her emails and I will release my tax returns immediately. Now, with this being said --
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I released almost 100 pages of financials to the FEC and they are detailed. There is a lot of information. You get very -- the fact is, you get very little information from the tax return, Bill.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Okay. But, when the audit is complete, then you will release it. That's what we learned.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure. Thank you.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> All right. I appreciate you coming on. As I said, we are still working for Mrs. Clinton to come on, Secretary Clinton. What do you think? Do you think she is going to come up against me?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have no idea, Bill. Nobody can figure it out. She goes out for a day or two and then she goes away for five days and nobody hears from her. So I have no idea what she is doing.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Would you watch that interview if Mrs. Clinton came on on The Factor? Would you watch it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I may. I'm not so sure. I might have to turn to another network.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> All right. Donald Trump, everybody. Plenty more ahead as The Factor moves forward this evening.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> You've think of raising your card?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Don't do it.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> And two kids --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What up?
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> Mr. Trump is on the phone.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, good.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> Hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on. He does not want to answer the question.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Oh, no.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> He does not want to answer the question. He says, listen -- things -- he don't want to get there. But he knows you've been very supportive of the campaign and he would like to thank you. Listen -- things -- he don't want to get there. But he knows you've been very supportive of the campaign and he would like to thank you.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, you could ask him if he's going to make you a supreme court justice.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm interested in that too.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> He doesn't want to talk about that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Couple of -- First of all, congratulations on your health. I mean, can you believe how popular you are?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's been -- Just this minute a Public Policy Polling came out in New Hampshire and I'm 35% and the second place is 11%. And it's only because -- I'm sure it's only because over the years I've done your show, Robyn. Show Robyn.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Oh, stop it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hope -- is that Robin? Because I just heard a voice in the background
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It is. You could actually be the president.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Like this is starting to look like a reality.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The country is doing very poorly and we will make the country do well. But you know a public policy just came out in New Hampshire 35. One just came out in South Carolina where I'm in the mid 30s and -- mid 30s and --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You didin't expect this, did you? Seriously. I mean, this big this fast? didin't expect this, did you? Seriously. I mean, this big this fast?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, maybe this fast too. You know, the intensity and the speed and a lot of things have happened and I'm you, know I'm very honored by it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Do you really want to be president? Because I look at your life, especially what's going on down in Mar-a-Lago and stuff why --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It's a step down to living a life.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But the White House is a horrible place to live compared to your Mar-a-Lago. I seriously --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don't forget -- Robin, Howard's been saying this to me for two years.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know what I want to do? I want to do a good job. That's what I want. There's so many things how that could be straightened out so quickly. You know, you talk about China, the way they've been ripping us and ripping us and now they're taking us down with you know all of the things that they've done. And I can sell for. That's what I'm really good at. You understand. And I can solve those problems. We have the cards, you know. There's so many things how that could be straightened out so quickly. You know, you talk about China, the way they've been ripping us and ripping us and now they're taking us down with you know all of the things that they've done. And I can sell for. That's what I'm really good at. You understand. And I can solve those problems. We have the cards, you know. Yeah. Remember with the skating rink you solved that pretty quick.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> The skating rink. Yeah. And Melania will be the hottest first lady ever in the White House ever.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She'll be a great first lady and she is a terrific person as you know. And yeah. It's good, so I'm having a lot of fun I'm going Iowa --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Have you given any thoughts to a vice president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Not. You know, I like to do one thing at a time. And one thing I want to do is I want to win and then I'll worry about it. But there are a lot of good people around.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I was thinking you might have to like, choose one of these guys you're actually like -- like a Rubio or something even though you're not even that high on these guys.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, some of them I respect them and I don't respect everybody but some of my respect and some are, you know, worthy and some aren't and there are a lot of good people around frankly. And the vice president is actually a very important position. You know it's always been an underrated position.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But here's my question --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, there a lot of positions that will have to be filled.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A lot.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I mean, my original -- The only reason I was bothering you was with this whole Megyn Kelly question about what is she is on a 1-10 scale. But I see you don't want to answer that. Scale, but I see you don't want to answer that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know in the old days I would not have minded answering that question, but today I'll take a pass.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now that you're going to be president, right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Nowadays I'll take a pass.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That could follow you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> See, Robin. You learn with age, right? You learn with age.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But I have -- But what you could do, you could tap on the phone the number and then you know what I'm saying? But here's -- Okay, here's the other question.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know it's fine. I mean, it's fine and FOX has been fine. Roger Ailes an amazing guy and they'd been very fair. As long as I got your vote.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> As long as I got you there. What about me being a Supreme Court Justice? Any thoughts about that? Would that be a joke? I mean, I am a judge on TV.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You would be -- First of all, you are a very ed -- Who knows Howard more than me, Robin, right?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> People don't know the real Howard. People say, What's Howard like? And you know, I know him for a long time.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Long time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Howard is a much -- I'm gonna ruin your reputation --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In a very positive way. Howard is a much different person than people understand.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> See?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's the warmest, nicest guy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. I am.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When you're with them in person you leave and you say, What a nice guy. And then you hear him on radio and he's total maniac. And you can't change, okay?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Here's the one thing I want out of your presidency.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Howard's the best guy in the world. I mean, he's a great guy. And sometimes I'll explain that to people and they don't get it. You know, they don't understand.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> So, is there a possibility of an appointment?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Probably not.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think. I tell you what, in terms of brain power, he's right at the top. He's a smart cookie.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> There you go. But here's the one thing if you really pull this off. I want to go Camp David. I think of the American Public. This is the thing you ought to do, you ought to go in there and open it up so people could see what's going on there.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah. I wanna know what's going on there.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Could be a revolution in this country. Because I think they got something going on there where these guys all check out. Now they're -- We'll get lazy, I'll start going to Camp David every minute. I wanna go there and see what's doing so I can report to the public.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what happens, Howard. They go to Washington, and all of a sudden they become different people. They run and they are these wonderful guys and they run and they're gonna do this and they're gonna do that, they're gonna do everything.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They do nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And then they get there and do nothing. And even well-meaning people they do nothing. I can't let that happen with me. If I just have one [Inaudible] to pull it off
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You know why it won't happen with you? And you can tell the American people this. You already lived a life.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You're not gonna be impressed with anything.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And so the fact that you want to be president means you might actually want to do something.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. That's very true. It's not gonna happen to me, okay? And by the way, if you see a little inkling of it, Robin, the two of you, immediately call me and -- this is -- back.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I'll slap you around.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, no. I've seen it so often, and I see people, I support people. They're these great people, men, women, then they get to Washington and they -- I guess they look up at these beautiful buildings and look where I am and --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And they're getting hypnotized.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, they're afraid to do anything.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I want you to blowup the moon.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, here you go again.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> The moon. I do. I want you to blow up the moon.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> This is going to keep you from an appointment.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hey, are you afraid of Joe Biden?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I think Joe Biden would be fun to run against frankly. And I --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who would you rather run against. Hillary or Joe?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think it's irrelevant -- I think Hillary has been very badly damaged. I think the email thing is -- maybe gonna keep her from running.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You think she's done?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. I've been saying, you know, Gen. Petraeus did much less than her. The documents were of far less importance and they destroyed his life, right?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Maybe he was disgraced.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, they gave him essentially two years and you don't have to serve.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And she's done far more, far more documents, much more -- I mean, she wiped out a server after she got a subpoena from the United States Congress, right? I mean, how much worse can you be than that. But the documents were very classified and it just seems to me that she's got problems. Now, her only hope is the Democrats are running things right now. Maybe they're not going to prosecute her. That's her only hope. What she did is probably criminal.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What are you gonna do day one? Let's say you pull this off and you become president. Day one, what do you do?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hey, Howard. I have one big call coming in, hold it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go ahead. Go ahead. I won't keep you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Can I call you right then back?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go ahead you do your thing.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You know what? Hey, Howard. I tell you what, they're waiting for me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right. Go ahead.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, it's good to talk to you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I just wanted the Megyn Kelly…
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love you two guys. I tell you what, you know what I'm gonna do if I become president? I'm gonna do a great job. There's so many things we're gonna do, but we're gonna do a great job, and we're gonna take care of the country. That I can tell you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Al right. I'll talk to you later.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you're the best. And I really appreciate it. Thanks, Robin.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thanks, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Mr. Trump, thank you. There's your President.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> President for all.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> President Trump. Guy's on a tear.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> That's amazing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I told them to tear down the White House and build a new one.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Donald Trump, here in Imus in the morning programs, it's 10 minutes until the hour.
<Don Imus> <Negative> It is 32 minutes at the irony. I'm assuming the program, on the radio all over the country and on MSNBC all over the world. Bob Schieffer from CBS News is coming up then Phil Simms, Brian Wilson is here and... I was in my office yesterday, I don't know what the hell I was doing.
<Don Imus> <Negative> I was waiting for Brent to bring my computer down, so I couldn't play chess. I read People magazine. You ever read People magazine, Charles?
<Charles> <Neutral> Yes, I've seen it. Sure.
<Don Imus> <Positive> It's a world that I just don't -- I don't know what these people are doing. They all seem like they're fine to me. I mean, like Jennifer Aniston. She seems like, she's cute and sings.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Is there a movie any good, they got her under? I saw her on a movie with that kid Ben Stiller.
<Charles> <Neutral> Yes.
<Don Imus> <Negative> That was -- I don't know -- maybe Wyatt watched it or something. It's pretty tough, too, but she was fun and his kind of funny. Why are they on the planet? What are they doing? What's their plan?
<Charles> <Negative> They're either entertaining the masses.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> It's funny, they're asking themselves the same question about you.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Well, yes, but I'm doing something.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> What the hell you are doing their planet.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Anyway, please welcome to the Imus Morning program our old friend Donald Trump. Good morning, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning Don. People magazine is really very good, you know.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> It is?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A lot of beautiful women, a lot of it -- a little different than your political world, I will say that, but it's really pretty good. You don't like people magazine?
<Don Imus> <Negative> No, I didn't say that. I said -- I've been in it a few times. No I like it, I just don't ordinarily read it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You don't relate to it. I don't get that.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> No, well, you know, I guess. I get mail...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Knowing you, I'm shocked.
<Don Imus> <Positive> I got a letter the other day from a lady. Of all of the people we have on talking about everything in the world, it's not just the only one I've gotten, by the way. You're her favorite guest. The reason she likes you is because, she likes the fact that you're willing to say anything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I just speak my mind, I mean I believe in it. What difference does it make? In a world that's falling apart you speak your mind who cares, right?
<Don Imus> <Negative> Well, I don't know. There's so many people who -- I was talking to my kid about this, he is seven. So many people who you can't get a straight answer from. Like the people on your program.
<Don Imus> <Negative> Some of the ones who get fired, you can't get a straight answer from them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I saw your son on television, on your show the other day and I think he's adorable.
<Don Imus> <Positive> He is, thank you. He is.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's also smart which is probably more important, right? If you'd have to say long term it's more important.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Far more for important.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's great.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Thank you and how's the real estate market in New York?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's been good. I keep reading about the bubble and I've been reading about it for about four years now. So far it's been great. I'm building a building on Park Avenue in 59th, the old Delmonico Hotel and it's selling like hotcakes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's almost sold out. The stuff has just been going very well. I guess at some point there will be some kind of a correction, but I don't see it.
<Don Imus> <Negative> A correction would mean what?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, when prices would start going down fairly drastically and I think as long as interest rates stay where they are and don't go up to much higher than that -- they're very low anyway. Even if they went up like a point or a point and a half which somebody would say a lot, it's not that much. As long as we don't have like we had in the '90s in the early '90s where they really, really went up. You're going to have a good real estate market.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People like real estate, they can touch it, they can live in it, and they can do things with it. It's not just the certificate which doesn't mean a lot to a lot of people.
<Don Imus> <Positive> New York real estate for like a person bought an apartment or whatever, it's still a great investment or good investment?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think it's I think it's a great investment. There's some competition out there now and you can go and make a deal. I really think -- you know Manhattan is only so big. There's not going to make any more of it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, if we were in China, they'd fill in the East River. You understand that.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Yes I do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd say, "Did you do an environmental impact study?"" And they look at me like I'm crazy. What are you getting with the ocean? It's true. I went to Hong Kong and they were filling in like thousands of acres. I said
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You get the electric chair. I said, "How do you fill in like 400 acres in the ocean?"" They look at me like
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Did you see the processed space yesterday?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I did.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> What did you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look. I just spoke to a friend of mine who was over in a sort of a business capacity, but over in Iraq and I asked him, he's a smart guy, very street wise guy. I said, "Will it ever work?"" This is somebody that I respect
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is the most dangerous place on earth." This guy left
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The amazing thing is they don't want us over there. Very few people want us over there. You say to yourself, "What are we doing? What are we doing?"""
<Don Imus> <Neutral> My plan is to give it back to Hussein, just to say, "Look
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He might not want it back, though Don, that's the only problem.
<Don Imus> <Negative> [Inaudible] I'm on trial. I love the guy. The got gigantic balls, because he's earned court, he's lecturing judge's, bitching about the elevator not working. I realize he's a horrible person, but we deal with horrible people all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you are going to get another horrible person in there and probably more horrible.
<Don Imus> <Negative> Well, is Hussein worse than he is?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I think so, because that's what's going to pull it together, I guess. Certainly we're not pulling it together. You can't walk the streets, you can't do it. This guy is really a smart cookie and has such common sense and he said, "What are we doing?"" He was there
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hear all different reports and the report I'm really getting from most people though is that it's just going to all collapse and it doesn't make any difference how long we are. Remember in Vietnam when we used to say -- they used to be a certain group that would say, "Declare victory and leave."""
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right? Well, that sounds like one here, 'declare victory and leave.'
<Don Imus> <Positive> Twenty one until the Our Time with Donald Trump. The Apprentice has been renewed for a sixth season. Congratulations, by the way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, thank you. It is going to be taped in Los Angeles? Well, we're going to do a little change up this time. It is a big, big fan base also in Los Angeles. We get very, very strong ratings in Los Angeles for some reason.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People really wanted it to be there and they really wanted to be in New York, too, but we thought we'd change it up. Who would have thought? I did this as a one-time hit and then it went to number one. Had you remember
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Just two years ago and it became so successful. Now, they just option number six. I would have never thought this was going to happen, but it has. We thought that New York has done the first five, the number five is actually just finishing shooting, and it goes on right after the Olympics on NBC, and then for next season the new number six will go.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We thought we do it. It takes about five weeks to shoot the series. Essentially, I'd live in Los Angeles for five weeks and I have a lot of property in Los Angeles, so I'll play around with that property, instead of New York property for a little while.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Then you have a vodka coming out?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have a what?
<Don Imus> <Positive> Vodka?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a vodka coming out.
<Don Imus> <Negative> Unfortunately Donald, as you know, I have to stop drinking...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know.
<Don Imus> <Negative> ...and that a shame, because this could drive me back to and I used to like vodka.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm very mixed, because I'm a non-drinker. I'm lucky in that respect. I'm a non-drinker, nonsmoker. It's probably two of the only good habits I have.
<Don Imus> <Negative> You don't even drink coffee, do you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't drink coffee. I've never had a cup of coffee, actually. I see friends and they can't live without coffee. They'll be at Starbucks.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a Starbucks at Trump Tower. You get there at 7 o'clock in the morning, there's a line that's 200 people long waiting to get up the escalators. It's incredible and I've just never been into that. I have never really had a cup of coffee either, but I've been mixed on the whole vodka thing, because of lots of different reasons.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have a lot of friends that are that are alcoholics. I have a brother -- I had a brother who was an alcoholic and then I said to myself, "If it's not me
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I feel like the cigarette makers, they make cigarettes and then they take ads saying, "Don't smoke."" Right? It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen
<Don Imus> <Positive> Well, I don't know. Drinking in moderation is actually, in some cases is medically recommended. Particularly wine and so on. Even though, I'm a real drunk and a real alcoholic.
<Don Imus> <Negative> I'm not against people drinking. I don't think that's a big deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's just, I don't know. There just seems to be a big thing and the people that talk about how it's so good medically, sadly, Don, usually they're alcoholic.
<Don Imus> <Negative> Oh, no, no, no.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've had five or six friends of mine and now you're included. [Inaudible] Every one of them -- three of them are major alcoholics. [Inaudible] the people, the doctors I saw them recommend like a glass of wine, not three bottles. I've got a bad news. I don't know if it's bad or not, but it is good news for Green bury. Looks like Eliot Spitzer is not going to bring criminal charges against [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's good.
<Don Imus> <Negative> He doesn't need to go to jail like [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a little late in the game, right?
<Don Imus> <Positive> You would think. Well, what they give him? What kind of sentence can they give him? Anyway, what's coming up tonight?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we have a good version tonight and actually, we bring it down to two people, because tonight is a interesting thing. Then on December 15th, we have the live finale at Lincoln Center and it's also sold out. I can't get anybody tickets it's just totally sold out. It will be great, but it'll be a-two -- hour-live-finale on December 15th.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That starts at nine o' clock and it'll be -- it's always sort of interesting doing live television, because you never know what's going to happen.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Well, I thought you're handling it pretty well. I remember the first year you did it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Don Imus> <Negative> I don't know whether I believed you or not, you said you were nervous maybe you weren't. I mean it would be not so funny but you'd be nervous. By the way, it was good. It was great, it was
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well that that was an amazing evening, because we had 41.5 million people watching the show which was just about the highest show of the year and of any show. It was an amazing kind of an evening. Yes, I was a little nervous. I guess you should be a little nervous.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Yes, you should.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think the performance was good. They gave me many stars.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Two are get it tonight.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Two get it tonight and we bring it down to the two finalists and they're really good. Then we have the big finale on December 15th, it continues to do great, that's why they renewed us, so I'm having fun with it.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Thank you very much...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Don.
<Don Imus> <Positive> ...for appearing in the program, I appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I love it. I actually like it.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Donald Trump here on the Don Imus morning program. The Apprentice tonight at 9:00 p.m., Eastern Time on NBC.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Here's Donald Trump.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, nice to talk to you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hello, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, I think the campaign is starting in earnest. There are dueling ads out today. And I want wonder what you thought about the Obama campaign ad which is zeroing right in on Governor Romney and when he was at Bain Capital and handling the GST steel mill.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it's certainly getting very nasty, and I would say perhaps on both sides. But in particular, when they make an ad like that, which is so unfair. They want to save companies, whether it's Bain or somebody else, in most cases. They want to save companies. And Governor Romney did a fantastic job at Bain not only in terms of the jobs he produced, but also in terms of creating and saving companies.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He did a great job. And it's very, very unfair to pick a company and say, Oh, gee, let's do an ad. Very unfair.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, the thing that I was sort of curious about -- and you're a business guy -- is that -- there were two things. One is that GST apparently went under about 2001. He left Bain Capital in 1999. But nonetheless, you know, some of the things that Bain Capital put in place while he was there had an effect on 2001. But I did a little research, and I found out that in 2001, about 17 steel mills went under, including Bethlehem Steel, which was the second largest steel mill at the time, because there was dumping by foreign countries of cheaper steel here in the United States, so nobody wanted to buy domestic steel.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, that's true.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> So does that make it unfair?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it certainly makes it unfair. But it's -- you know, it's almost like what else is new? Because if you look what's going on with foreign countries and foreign companies right now, how they're subsidized over our companies, so it really is an unfair -- and frankly, if you look at that ad, I think that ad was extremely unfair.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And it's really the topic of a lot of conversation right now. It was a very, very unfair ad. But that was a time when steel was doing extremely poorly because of the dumping, I mean, dumping all over the place, and steel was being hurt. Many, many steel companies at that time were going out of business.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. So a very significant omission in the ad -- and I'll get to a Romney campaign ad in a second, which I think there's an omission. But listen to what -- I'm going to play you a sound bite from what -- a part of it, about 23 seconds out of the ad, and tell me how potent you think this is politically in the five battleground states that are going to hear this part of this ad against Romney.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> [Begin Video Clip] I was devastated. It makes me angry. Those guys were all rich. They all have more money than they'll ever spend. Yet they didn't have the money to take care of the very people that made the very money for them. [End Video Clip]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Bain Capital walked away with a lot of money that they made off of this plant.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> There was even one point in that ad, Donald, in which the -- I think the term "vampire" was used. How do you tell the American people who are suffering so incredibly, when a company fails, even if there are legitimate business reasons for failure, in this case, dumping of cheaper steel -- but nonetheless, Bain Capital, very successful, very rich people, and it doesn't look good to people who -- who don't have that kind of success or that kind of money.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I agree with that. It doesn't look good. It's not fair. It's really a misrepresentation, but it doesn't look great if people don't know the situation. I think a lot of people do know the situation. And also, in business, you have hits and you have misses. Now, in the end, you have to have a lot more hits than you have misses.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But that was a case where steel was doing terribly. And I saw the ad and I thought that it was, you know, very compelling from one standpoint, and certainly from a class warfare -- I mean, that's what it's all about. I mean, let's take a couple of people that really did a good job, and honestly, that looked very sympathetic.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And certainly, the gentleman and a couple of other people in the ad did look sympathetic. But if they knew the facts, I think they'd feel a lot differently.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, today President Obama is in New York at a private equity fundraiser. He also did a commencement speech at Barnard College. But one of the things that was said by one of his representatives is that that particular Romney ad wasn't a slight on private equity, but was to show Governor Romney's values.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And you want to take a stab on why that would show Governor Romney's values?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think no matter what you say, he's right now at a private equity fundraiser. You could give me every one of those private equity firms, and I can make ads that are much better than that ad. And I can show you things that were done that wouldn't look so nice for the people giving Mr. Obama -- or President Obama money.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So I just feel that it's -- you know, you can always pick a person, a couple of people or a company out of many. He wasn't overly involved in that company. It wasn't his start. There are a lot of things that were wrong with that ad. A lot of things were unfair with it. And I think when people see that, the ad will not go down as being effective.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, the Governor Romney campaign, in response to President Obama, put out an ad in which they were touting Steel Dynamics as being a raised success and saying essentially what you said in the beginning. You have your hits, you have your misses. But in the Steel Dynamics ad, one thing that wasn't noted is the fact that Steel Dynamics got a number of tax breaks and a lot of government subsidies, in the millions of dollars category.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> So there's an omission in the Governor Romney ad. Is that fair?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think that everybody in that case was trying to get tax abatements and tax incentives because, let's face it, as you just said it, every -- steel was being dumped by other nations, in particular, certain of our favorite nations. They were dumping steel on us like never before, and it was very, very hard to compete.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So the government was trying to help out, and sometimes, that's not the worst thing in the world. And that was omitted, but the government was trying to help out in order to compete. Now, frankly, I would have done it a little bit differently. I would have come down on the nations that were doing the dumping.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And believe me, they should still come down because that's still happening in this country.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Are both those adds fair, both dirty? Is one dirty and one's fair? What's your thought?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I thought that the Obama ad was more unfair. I think that they picked a very, very small segment of something that took place with a company. They picked somebody who was very sympathetic and they put him on. I'm sure there are a lot of people that would have said, Well, it was really a good thing, and I moved on to another company and another job, or whatever they might have said.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I thought that the Obama ad was actually more unfair, if you can use that term.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Is it not -- I mean, in looking at these ads, I mean, ads -- as a voter, viewer, whatever, I would have liked to have had the information in the Obama ad against Governor Romney that, number one, Governor Romney was out of Bain two years before that happened. He was off doing the Olympics. And number...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's a big statement. By the way, Greta, that's a very big statement.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> No, no, I'm just saying that -- and I mean, I think it's a reflection on the candidates when they have these omissions...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes. No, but how can you do that...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Because I think...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... when he's gone from the company, he's not even there, especially when the big act took place and he's not there, and all of a sudden, they're knocking the hell out of Governor Romney. I think it's very unfair.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> We used to argue before juries that, oh, you know, omissions like that are intended to do one thing and that's to deceive, to mislead whoever the fact finder is or the voter in this instance. But the other is was what was omitted from the ad was the dumping of the cheaper steel and the fact that 17 other steel mills, including Bethlehem Steel, went under that year, which shows the -- you know, the political pressure by -- in terms of the trade between the nations, that was putting economic pressure on these companies.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it's not the kind of thing that Obama would be saying, but maybe you just don't do the ad. When you know it's that egregious, when you know it's that unfair, then maybe you just don't do the ad. You're not going to say those two things because those two things destroy the ad. But I think people are getting wise to it. And I also think that's why Governor Romney is up in the polls.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, if you look at the polls, I'm seeing every poll seems to have him up. And I think people are tired of it now. They want jobs. They want real thinking. And they're not getting that from this administration.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, you know, that's -- I mean, we hear this jobs, jobs, jobs, but I'm not so sure that we're seeing jobs, jobs, jobs in this country and whether...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, you're not seeing...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I mean, I...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... real numbers, Greta, because certainly, you're not seeing real numbers. Every time somebody gives up looking for a job, they take them off the list. So it looks like we're doing obviously not very well, but it looks like we're doing better than, in fact, we're doing. The real number -- I mean, I've heard numbers that could be anywhere from 19 to 21 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I heard 11 percent the other day. But certainly, it's not 8.2 percent.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, to be fair -- to be fair to President Obama, I'm curious, should Governor Romney in his ad, to be complete -- should he have included the fact that there were all these subsidies and tax breaks to the successful company that he is now putting in his ad to counteract the Obama ad?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't think so, necessarily. I think that's a much lighter offense. I don't think so. I think that that is something that everybody has done and continues to do. There are subsidies all over the place and there's incentives and all sorts of tax breaks, if you want to call them, or tax incentives, depending on where you're coming from.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, I don't think he had an obligation to do that because everybody was entitled to them if they could get them.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, you're back in a war on Twitter. You're going after Cher and also your old nemesis, Rosie O'Donnell. What's up?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, no, Cher said some very unflattering and nasty things about Governor Romney, and I think it was inappropriate, what she said, frankly. And you know, I've watched her over the years. I knew her a little bit. And you know, she reminds me of Rosie with slightly more talent, not much more talent, but slightly more talent.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, Cher said something wicked. She says if Romney gets elected -- this is on Twitter -- "I don't know if I can breathe the same air as him and his right-wing, racist, homophobic, women-hating teabagger masters," to which you responded -- I mean, you -- that she's -- that Cher is an average talent who's out of touch with reality.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But then you threw in Rosie. I mean, You resurrected Rosie into the fight by calling her a total loser. She wasn't even in this fight with you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I likened her to Rosie as a loser. But I -- you know, I understand Cher and Cher is somewhat of a loser. She's lonely. She's unhappy. She's very miserable. And her sound-enhanced and computer-enhanced music doesn't do it for me, believe me.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, it seems like you get into these, these Twitter battles with these women, these...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, with people in general.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> ... famous women.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Not women. In fact, usually...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Not women...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... women I prefer not because I find them much tougher than men. But actually, I do on occasion I get into battles. And I also have my great likes. I mean, I also greatly respect people.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Is it fun to do these -- I mean, is -- actually, it's sort of like if I follow you on Twitter, it's sort of interesting to see. You guys are hammering each other back and forth, you and Cher and Rosie. I mean, you're, like -- you're going after each other pretty heavily.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I don't think they're hitting me. I don't know. I haven't noticed that they're hitting me very hard. I thought it was a very unfair shot at Governor Romney. And it -- you know, it took me about one second to give it -- to put it down. And I gave it to somebody, I said, Here, put this down. So it's not like a big deal.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It takes me, you know, seconds. If it took me more than seconds, I wouldn't be doing it because I wouldn't waste my time. But people certainly seem to like it because my Twitter account has millions of people watching it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> It does have millions. It's -- it, indeed, does have millions. Donald, thank you, as always.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you very much, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, it isn't just Governor Romney swinging at President Obama. So is the national Republican party.
