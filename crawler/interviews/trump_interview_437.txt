<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Steph McGovern> <Positive> You're here to talk out the National Achievers Congress about the secret of success. What's the secret behind your success?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think more than any other thing, you have to just love what you do. If you don't love what you do, it's never ever going to work. I've seen hundreds of examples that if you don't love it, it's never going to work. And beyond loving it, you have to work hard. I mean you really have to just go at, and just never quit never give up. I've seen so many people over the years, smart people, very good people, they quit. They give up.
<Steph McGovern> <Positive> Over the last few years we've had really tough economic conditions. How much is that impacted you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it hasn't hurt me. I've really sort of learned so much over the years, and I've been able to predict what's happening, and I really played it pretty well, and stayed very, very liquid, and now I'm buying a lot of things. I just got back from Scotland where we opened up what I consider to be the greatest golf course anywhere in the world, and many people agree with me, and we're having tremendous success.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, it hasn't affected me. It's a great time right now to buy, and I see what's happening in the U.K., and I see what's happening elsewhere. One of the things in the UK that I think is just so crazy is the UK, you know, they're subsidizing windmills. These wind turbines are absolutely killing Scotland and killing other places, and David Cameron is very nice. He's subsidising Scotland, and it's costing the folks a lot of money.
<Steph McGovern> <Negative> But you are unhappy with them because they're going to be in view with where you want to develop the land [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they're also very ugly. I mean you know whether it's me or anybody else. I mean they're ruining different places where they are.
<Steph McGovern> <Positive> Are you going to carry -- carry on with your investment plans there if the wind farm goes ahead?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, absolutely not.
<Steph McGovern> <Neutral> So you wouldn't build --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I wouldn't build a hotel -- I wouldn't build a hotel.
<Steph McGovern> <Negative> And coming back to the situation we're seeing with the economy at the moment. How do you think the UK compares to the U.S. in terms of how it's being dealt with?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think it's very much on par. I think that they are very equal, in terms of what they're doing. If you look at what's going on in the U.S., Obama had a very bad night the other night in the debate, and one of the reasons he had a bad night is he has a bad record.
<Steph McGovern> <Negative> Unemployment has now fallen back down to 7.8% there which is, you know, the best it's been for four years. So that's a bit of good news.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I think -- yeah, but, you know, the way they count the numbers -- everybody was shocked to see that, because the economy is not doing well. And if you're looking for a job, and then you decide you're not looking anymore, you know what happens? You're not on that number. So the real number is probably 12 percent, 13 percent. I mean some, people say as high as 21 percent. I don't know what the real number is, but it's not 7.8%.
<Steph McGovern> <Negative> You were going to run for President. Why didn't you in the end?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I was leading in every poll. I was leading and all of the polls. But I liked Mitt Romney very much. He asked me to back him and I decided to do it.
<Steph McGovern> <Negative> I know you've been an -- an avid watcher of all the presidential debates that have been going on.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Steph McGovern> <Positive> What did it feel like when you were mentioned by both of the candidates by Mitt Romney?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Four times.
<Steph McGovern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was an honor. I mean it was a great honor. I'm watching the debate, and I'm sitting home with my wife, and all of a sudden, Obama brings up my name, and Romney brings up -- and it was really a great honor more than anything else. And -- it wasn't mentioned in a negative -- I was sort of used as an example, and a positive example. And I was greatly honored by it.
<Steph McGovern> <Negative> What about the issue though, that Obama was trying to make with it about tax? I mean, do you think the rich people in America pay enough tax?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we're paying a lot of tax, and we're putting a lot of people to work. And this is a very fragile economy, and I think it's a very bad time to be playing with the tax rates and with taxes.
<Steph McGovern> <Negative> If the tax rate was increased, what impact do you think it would have?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think unemployment would go up, and I think the economy would go down still further.
<Steph McGovern> <Neutral> Looking at some other aspects of your life, I know you're the presenter, of course, of U.S. Apprentice.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Steph McGovern> <Neutral> Do you ever watch the U.K. one?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do, and Alan Sugar is doing an excellent job. I started The Apprentice with Mark Burnett. It became a tremendous success, became the number one show in the United States and to this day it's one of the top shows in the country, and we've had a great time.
<Steph McGovern> <Positive> A lot of our viewers will probably, actually probably all of them, would never imagine being as rich as you are. Does your money make you happy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it doesn't make you happy. But there is a word that's called -- named content. Okay, content, and what it does allow you to do is education for children. I can help other people, I employ thousands and thousands of people. I take care of those people. Those people have medical care, they have education, they have lots of things for their family.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it makes me very happy in that sense, and money is just a scorecard, you know at a certain level. I mean once you can pay for your meal and your rent money really becomes a scorecard, but it does make you feel good in terms of a sense of achievement. If I'm worth over a billion dollars, which is what people say, I mean, all it is is a scorecard. It doesn't mean anything.
<Steph McGovern> <Positive> Do you not ever sit at home though and think, with everything you've got, all that luxury, oh, I don't need to make any more money now. I'm just going to chill out and enjoy the rest of my life?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's what I'm doing. I'm enjoying it, and if you enjoy it, it's not work. Chilling out for me would be work. If you told me, okay good, you've done a great job. It's over. You can go on vacation now, permanently. You take a permanent vacation, within two days, I wouldn't be very happy
<Steph McGovern> <Positive> Really, so do you ever relax?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm relaxed right now. I mean I'm relaxed doing things that I like.
<Steph McGovern> <Negative> You must -- you must be hard to live with, though, for your wife and things if you are so busy all the time?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I actually think I'm easy to live with, but some people think not. But I would say that I'm probably pretty easy to live with.
<Steph McGovern> <Negative> And just one final thing: when I said I was doing this interview with you, I put it on Twitter and various other social media. A lot of people said to me, oh ask him about his hair. Do you get sick of people asking you about that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, as you can probably see, it is my hair. I don't know, it may not be great, but it's not bad. And I have a lot of friends my age and they don't have much left, so it is my hair.
<Steph McGovern> <Neutral> What's the secret behind it then?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't think there's a secret. It's mine. You know, it's funny. I've combed it this way since I'm, like, going to college. I've always -- I used to comb it back. I could comb it back actually, but I've combed it this way since I've gone to college, and I think that NBC and the people doing The Apprentice, where we have such a huge success now all over the world with The Apprentice, which is my show, I think they'd be very unhappy if I change my haircut. What do you think?
<Steph McGovern> <Positive> Okay, well thank you very much for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Great honor.
