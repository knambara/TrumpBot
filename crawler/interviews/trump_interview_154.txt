<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good to see you Brian.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Good to see you
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This is radio.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> This is radio.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's supposed to be all radio, but now I see Brian --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- taking advantage of the situation.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> You look great. But but, you're lookin'... you're TV friendly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's alright. I feel good.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I feel good.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> So, I know this is a big week. How important is getting this budget passed? To even get to the tax reform conversation, Mr. President?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's very important. I mean we need the budget, we need the passage. We have Thad Cochran, as you know, is not feeling so great. He may not be able to vote. We don't know what John McCain's going to do. We have a couple of others that maybe could disappoint us, but maybe they won't.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They've been talking about all sorts of things for so long, now they have a President who's really willing to sign what we have to sign. But I think we're going to be good, and I think we're going to be good for taxes. And it's very close, because we have no support from the democrats. They're obstructionists, all they want to do is obstruct. So we have 48 votes against us. So we literally can't lose more than two votes, which is a pretty tough situation.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> On tax reform or the budget -- on the budget in particular right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> On the budget. Well we have phase one and phase two. Phase one, we have to think only -- I'm only right now thinking about the budget.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Phase two is tax, because that will next week. But phase one is the budget. And if we get the budget, I think we'll be in good shape to get the tax, but we have to get the budget.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> I talked to Senator Joe Manchin yesterday who really seems to enjoy your interactions. And he says if they could give me a little something, I could deliver six to eight democrats. Number one, do you believe that? And number two, are you willing to negotiate?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well we'll be talking to Joe. I think it's hard for Joe to vote against tax cuts. We're talking about massive tax cuts ---
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> In West Virginia?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In West Virginia. And I've turned West Virginia around, because what I've done environmentally with coal. And I don't know if you saw, but West Virginia is second to Texas in percentage increase of GDP.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And everyone's saying "I can't believe it
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> So what Mick Mulvaney brought up to me this morning on television was no one talks about the zero percent, because they have up to $24,000, you're not going to pay any tax, that's part of tax reform --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Also, people are focused on the corporate rate deduction, what about the small business?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So small business is coming way down. And if you talk about the zero, I said "You've got to put the zero in
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I said "Make it four."" And the democrats
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Then we go to a 12 percent, as an example, it comes down from 15 -- but it really comes down from much higher than that. So it's a great tax cut for the middle class, but -- hey look, even the middle class will say it's an unbelievable tax cut for business, which is going to employ people. And the biggest beneficiary will be the middle class.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> So you golfed with Rand Paul over the weekend, and I think most agree, including Mark Short this morning, said that he's going to be the greatest challenge, because he does not like to vote for budgets or tax reform. I mean, can you be friends --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he's definitely with us.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> -- can you be friendly with someone that's going to vote against that? Have you talked to him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've had a great relationship with Rand Paul, and I think he's going to be with us. I think in the end he's going to be with us. I hope John McCain's going to be with us, we just don't know yet. We have a couple of votes, and of course that is in a position where it may be impossible for him to be here, which is a big -- that's like a no vote. That's almost the equivalent to a no vote. And the problem is we have no democrats. We have absolutely no democrat votes, so --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Have you tried?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, we've tried. They're in a box, they have 48 votes, and all they want to do is obstruct. Now, I think we'll have democrats if we get through the budget -- we have to get through the budget first.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If we get through the budget, we have the taxes. I think we're going to have some democrats, especially in states where I did very well. I mean I had some states where I won be 30 and 40 points.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that's a big margin. And I think we could have potentially some democrats in those states, for the massive tax cuts that we're talking about.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> So it's going to be a big week obviously, and there's certain things you zone in on, and every President's got his preference, some move on foreign policy. I think you love the numbers, the budget, and the economy. But I've got ask you something the big picture --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think foreign policy for me has been very strong. I think we did the right thing with Iran, and if you notice, Iran was respectful yesterday. They were not jumping up and down, they were respectful of what I did. And they may not agree with it, but they were very respectful.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that if you look at what I did with the payments going to the insurance companies, not going to poor people, they're going right into the pockets of the insurance companies. And I bought a list for you...
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> You did. For me?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look at these -- look at these insurance companies. This is since Obamacare started. Anthem, big company, 270 percent increase. 270 percent. And that's since ACA, that's Obamacare. So since Obamacare, Humana, 420 percent increase. Aetna, 470 percent increase. Cigna, 480 percent increase.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> So I looked at those numbers...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Insurance companies are making a fortune.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> So are you saying when you -- when they raise premiums, or raise deductibles, they're trying to increase their profits instead of doing an honest job about giving people insurance? Are they being dishonest in going too profit-oriented?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, they got a great deal with Obamacare. The one beneficiary, the great beneficiaries for Obamacare is not the people. They're getting killed. And look at what's happening to their premiums, look at what's happening to their deductibles, how high their deductibles.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But look, these are -- these are not made up by me. When you have Cigna, Aetna, Humana, Anthem going up 270, 420, 470 percent, 480 percent, these are insurance companies that went up 480 percent since Obamacare. Is any stock on the stock exchange -- has anybody gone up that much?
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> You would know better than me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The reason is -- the reason is, it's because Obamacare is a rip-off. It's great for the insurance companies. And find out who gave all that money to the Democrats. Take a look at the insurance companies.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So the Democrats don't want to hurt the insurance companies. So the money I took away was taken away by -- from the insurance companies. And by the way, since I took it down, you saw what happened to their stocks.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Senator Alexander and Senator Murray are working on a bipartisan plan. They stopped when it looked as though Lindsey Graham and Cassidy had something going. Is this to force their hand to come up with something?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, this helps, because nobody knows...
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> No, not so much this paper, but so much the $7 billion, "I'm not making that payment."" Does that help..."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I think it helps. I think it helps to make a deal...
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> So you did it to push action?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think if I did not do that, if I didn't hold it back -- and I just said we're not going to make that payment. If I didn't do that, I don't believe the Democrats would have called.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> David Axelrod said last night that you're pulling this back and (inaudible) tearing up the Iran deal is your attempt to obliterate the Obama legacy. Is it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's just that I disagree with Obama on so many things. I mean, I heard -- as an example, let's say, Hilary Clinton said it was OK for the NFL players to kneel during the anthem. Well, I disagree. Maybe that's why she lost, because that's bad. That's real bad. We have to respect our flag, our country, our anthem. Obama, I disagree with what he does.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, when you look at this -- nobody knows this. I just got these numbers. Nobody knows this about the insurance companies. The only beneficiary from Obamacare are the insurance companies. They made a fortune. And that's not -- you've never heard that, you've never seen these numbers before.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> I haven't. And that's why you handed it to me ahead of time, gave me a little bit of time to study. So some other news that broke today and you tweeted out, Congressman Marino was pulled back as drug czar. What went into that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, well he's a fine man. He was a supporter of mine from Pennsylvania. Great state, I won Pennsylvania. And he's a Congressman from Pennsylvania, very popular. And he told me, look, if there's even a perception that he has a conflict of interest with insurance companies, essentially -- but if there's even a perception that he has a conflict of interest, he doesn't want anything to do with it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So whether we have insurance companies or drug companies -- and there was a couple of articles having to do with him and drug companies. And I will tell you, he felt compelled -- he feels very strong about the opioid problem and the drug problem, which is a worldwide problem. It's a problem that we have. And Tom Marino said "Look
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Big expose on 60 minutes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He didn't want to have -- he didn't want to have even the perception of a conflict of interest with drug companies or, frankly, insurance companies.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> New HHS secretary, I was talking to Kellyanne Conway today. It seems like you're close. Do you want to go over any names?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We are more than close, but I won't be able to tell you the name yet because we have to do a little vetting. But we are more than close and if this person gets approved it will be a fantastic, a fantastic nomination.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> You came out with Mitch McConnell yesterday and seemed on the same page and then said I'll take any questions. And, it was just a regular -- it was like a press conference you'd see on a sporting event.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I only did that because you weren't in the audience.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> I know. Why is that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you were in the audience I wouldn't have done that.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> One of the questions was about writing the Green Berets soldiers and ends up being a bigger story. Can I ask you what you thought about when you brought up past presidents and what they've done? Do you want to clarify anything?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, there's nothing to clarify because if you look at my whole -- this was again fake news CNN. I mean, they're just a bunch of fakers. So, they asked me that questions and for the most part to the best of my knowledge I think I've called every family of somebody that's died and it's the hardest call to make.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I said it very loud and clear yesterday. The hardest thing for me to do is do that. Now, as far as other representatives, I don't know. I mean, you could ask General Kelly did he get a call from Obama. You could ask other people, I don't know what Obama's policy was. I write letters and I also call.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, sometimes if you had a tragic event with -- it's very difficult to be able to do that. But I have called, I believe everybody but certainly I'll use the word virtually everybody where during the last nine months something's happened to us all. I've called virtually everybody. I've gone to Dover. I've seen what takes place at Dover.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's an incredible scene and very, very sad. One of the saddest things you'll ever see. But I really speak for myself. I'm not speaking for other people. I don't know what Bush did, I don't know what Obama did. You could find out easily what President Obama did. All you have to do is ask the military people but I believe his policy was somewhat different than my policy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can tell you my policy is I've called every one of them. And, you have to let a little time go by. You can't just call immediately but I will be calling, have called and will be calling the parents and the loved ones, wives, et cetera of the soldiers that recently were killed.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> No, I meant seeing you happy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love doing it. I'm getting tremendous support even in your polls I'm getting tremendous support and it's hard to believe I can get support when you have so many phony stories out there. Like, CNN, like MSNBC, like NBC. NBC is probably worse than CNN. But all I know is FOX is good. FOX, we love you, FOX.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> We're fair.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You are fair.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what, the truth is you hit me when it's needed. You do. I mean, you do in particular.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But the fact is --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> I think we're fair.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All I want is fair. I don't want anything else. I just want fair. And FOX has really been fair and I appreciate it.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Man, thank you. I appreciate the time you gave us and the Brian Kilmeade Show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> And this morning. And, thanks for having us out here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Thank you. Take care of yourself.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Thank you, Mr. President.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> Some of the analysts and some people who are experts, as well as some of the media, seem to go into contortions to try not to say early on it was a possible terrorist event.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's true. They want to go in and they just don't wanna say that, because that offends some people, including our president. They don't want to mention the term radical Islamic terrorism under any circumstance, including Hillary Clinton. I laughed this morning when I see her on television saying how she's gonna do this and that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's been there for 30 years, she hasn't done anything. I mean, she's all talk and no action. But she was saying that she's gonna this and she - I'm the one that's been talking about this for a long time, as long as you've known me. And this is radical Islamic terrorism.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It has to be dealt with sharply. It's the only language that they're gonna understand, and this problem that we have now is only going to get worse with weak leadership.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> On the economy, in a recent survey, a majority of business economists said that Hillary Clinton was the best choice for the economy. And Libertarian Gary Johnson came in a distant second, and you came in third. Why do you think that is and how could you change their minds?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that the most respected economists are on my side, to be honest with you. I think that I've seen tremendous reviews of my tax plan, but they do know, you have to understand, they do know that I'm gonna stop these horrible trade deals. We're gonna have trade, we're gonna have free trade, but we're gonna have real free trade, not free trade, which is a one-way highway out of our country for our jobs and our money. NAFTA is the worst trade deal ever signed in the history of the world, not only the country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at what it's done to our states, and you look at what it's done to, you know, our country, what it's done to us. The jobs are gone, the money's gone. I go upstate New York, I go to Pennsylvania, I go to Ohio, I go all over, especially for the primaries, I've never seen devastation like this. We're like a Third-World country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Those factories were vibrant 30 years ago, and today they're empty, they're falling down, they're collapsing from the rain and the snow. So, no, I think that we've had tremendous reviews. I mean, look, I'm gonna lower taxes, Hillary Clinton is going to raise taxes. I'm going to - that's what I do, I have thousands and thousands of people that work for me and have, I've created tens of thousands of jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But a lot of people are concerned when I say that I'm gonna renegotiate our trade deal, Sharyl. And I understand that they're concerned, but there's nothing to be concerned about. We lose right now, we have a deficit, in terms of, of all of the trading we do with other countries. We have a trade deficit 800, almost, $800 billion a year.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're losing more than $400 billion a year with China, in terms of a trade deficit. With Mexico, with Japan, I mean, what are we doing? What are we doing? I, I often say, 'Who negotiates these deals?' So, your establishment people are saying, 'Oh, gee, you know, let things be the way' - I don't think we can let them be the way they are, because our country is being devastated and our jobs are being taken.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Positive> I want to hit on a couple of personal controversies for you. New York's Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, who's already suing you over Trump University, which he's called a bait-and-switch fraud, now says he's opened an inquiry to the Trump Foundation. Are you confident that the Trump foundation has followed all charitable rules and laws?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I hope so, I mean, my lawyers do it. We give away money, I don't make anything, I take no salaries, I take no - any costs, I have zero costs, and a lot of money goes through the Trump Foundation into charities. Goes to charities, it doesn't go to me, it goes to charities.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> I'll point out that Mr. Schneiderman is a Hillary Clinton supporter and has apparently found nothing worthy of inquiry with the Clinton Foundation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> With the hundreds of millions of dollars of things, isn't it interesting, and he said he's not even gonna look at it. But we - I think my people do a very good job with it.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> Nearly every major news organization has remarked during the Obama administration years, that this has been a record for obstruction and lack of transparency. But, considering your rocky relationship with the press, do they have reason to be concerned that things will continue along that path or even get worse? Maybe reporters you don't agree with could get banned, thing like that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think this, that the press has been very dishonest with me, to a large extent, not all of them, not you, by the way. But the press has been very, very dishonest and when I see it, I'm just amazed. At the same time, I will certainly be open to dealing with the press and reporters, but the level of -
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> Do you see yourself banning, banning reporters from certain events and things like that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't see that, but a lot of people have done it, and a lot of people, a lot of different businesses have done it. The press has been very, very dishonest. I mean, even recently when I said yesterday, the bombing, and she said, the bombing, and they criticized my use of the word bombing, but not hers and they cut it out, and, I mean, many other things, even over the last couple of days. So, the relationship with the press is - it's not a question of good, all I want is honesty.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if there's something wrong or something bad, I can handle that, but when you do something great, and they try to make it as negative as possible, constantly, it's really not a fair situation.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Positive> You and I first spoke about a year ago, when there was something like 16 other Republicans in the race and you had a long haul. Going back to a year ago, did you really think you had a good chance at being here today?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't think I would've been doing it if I didn't. You know, my question is, is do you really think this was going to happen? And I guess the answer is, I wouldn't have done it if I didn't, you know, I'm not looking to lose. And, traditionally, I do well and I win, and I, I, you know, I do a nice job. This has become a very big situation, it's amazing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What's happened is amazing. You see outside, you see the kind of crowds we have. And you just said something, you ought to show pictures of what's outside, because it's true, the press is an example. They never show the size of the crowd, ever.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The only time they show it is, is a little bit of protest someplace within the crowd, then all of a sudden they show, and then people say, wow, what a big crowd that is. But I think the answer is, I would assume that I thought this was going to happen, because I wouldn't have done it if I didn't.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> How has the past year changed you? From the time you started this race to where you are today, with all you've learned, the turns that you've taken, and the criticism that you've had, and the success that you've had.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it's probably changed me, but I haven't had a lot of time to think about it, because every day I'm campaigning, I'll make three or four major speeches, sometimes in one day, where you have massive crowds and you know that, you see it. It's been an amazing experience. What has been, is that the people of this country are incredible. They're looking for hope, they're looking for change, they're looking for success, they're looking for victory.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We don't win anymore, our country doesn't win anymore. We don't win our trade, we can't beat ISIS, we don't win with the military. We have the greatest people in the world in our military, but it's depleted. We don't take care of our vets, it looks like the Second Amendment's in big trouble.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Certain if I, if I don't win, the Second Amendment is in big, big trouble. Healthcare is a disaster. We don't win anymore, and I will tell you that I think the reason it's caught on so much is, we're gonna win again, we're gonna start winning again. And people understand that and people see it. [Commercial Break]
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Neutral> Earlier, Donald Trump responded to a few of my questions. Now it's your turn. We asked the Republican presidential nominee some questions you suggested.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Neutral> What does it mean to be an American?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> To me, being an American is the ultimate, you have to be so lucky to be born into this country. It's the ultimate jackpot. If you're born in America, boy, what an advantage.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Positive> Will you keep tweeting yourself if you become president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Probably not, although it is a great way of communicating.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Positive> It can be. This is a more complex question, but maybe you can just touch on it. What would you do if Russia were to invade Estonia?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't want to say, because I don't like saying, I don't like telling people what I'm going to do. One of the biggest problems we have is, every politician gets upset. We're gonna this, we're gonna send troops here, we're gonna send troops there, they're gonna arrive at a certain time of the day. I don't like saying that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I, I think it's a very bad policy to be discussing.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Positive> Is your tax philosophy more that it takes a certain amount of money to run the government, and you get it however you need to get it? Or that we should only take a limited amount from the people and spend that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think it takes a certain amount of money and you want to take care of your people, and we end up getting it, but taxes are too high in this country. I'm giving a massive tax reduction and I'm also getting rid of regulation, we have so much regulation. The tax reduction I'm giving is, is tremendous, but, you know what, people are more excited about the regulation cutting. We have regulations on regulations, and, honestly, it's gotten out of control, and it's really killing our businesses, that I can tell you.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Neutral> And if you could go back a year and tell yourself, a year ago, something that you've learned today, how to be, how to change, how to act, would there be something?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think the main thing, and I would've known this, maybe without having to go back, never ever quit, never give up.
<Josh McElveen> <Neutral> All right, with that out of the way, Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That was very nice.
<Josh McElveen> <Positive> Thanks for joining us. Good to see you, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, great honor.
<Josh McElveen> <Positive> So this week, you announced that you're -- that you're going to officially exploring a -- a Presidential run, which is an official step towards this. A lot of people might be asking why? He could do so many different things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're right and I'm giving up a lot and I'm enjoying my life. I love building buildings. I'm building a beautiful building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office site, which I got which is an amazing thing. I got it in the Obama administration because it was given out by the GSA. But we have a great plan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's going to be a wonderful thing. And Doral, and we're doing so many things and all over the world. And I am giving up a tremendous amount of things, but -- that I love doing by doing this. But our country is in serious trouble. We're being led by people that are either grossly incompetent or just basically don't know what they're doing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I look at what's happening with deals. I wrote The Art of the Deal, one of the greatest selling business books of all time, maybe the best I guess, and it's all about we have to bring back our jobs. We have to bring back money. We have to bring back money so that we can save Social Security, save Medicare, save Medicaid.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And every other Republican candidate, they're going to cut Social Security. They're going to cut Medicare. Going to cut Medicaid. It's unfair. We take back the money that China is stealing from us, we take back the money that other countries, including Mexico, are stealing. If you look at what happened the other day on the front page of The Wall Street Journal, story about Mexico taking our jobs from Tennessee where they're moving into Mexico now because Mexico has incentives and gives incentives and we give them incentives to move to Mexico.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And on top of that, the border is a disaster, what they're doing with the border, total disaster, the way people have -- hundreds of thousands of people just flowing into the country through Mexico. So we have to end that and it's tough business and it's going to have to be done because our country, frankly, is going to hell.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And politicians, I've dealt with them all my life. I get along with them great. I get along with all of them. But they're all talk, they're no action. And that's why I'm doing this.
<Josh McElveen> <Positive> It's -- it's fair to ask, obviously, you do have success in business and you're successful author. But what would you do differently in the White House that others haven't in the past?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Just about everything. Number one, when was the last time you heard something good about our country? Well, we had a victory over China economically, over other countries. We never have a victory. There's never a victory for us. We used to have victories. There's never a victory like the United States is that -- you know, a year ago China became the number one economic engine, economic power in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This was unheard of. If you go back 10 years, if you would have said that, people would have laughed at you. It's im -- impossible. There's no reason for it. They're taking our jobs, they're taking our money. We're rebuilding China. You look at what's -- because there's so much money. Apple, the great American company.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they make all their product in China, or most of it. They don't make any here. But they make most of their product in China. And, you know, so it's wonderful. I'm all for Apple, but they're making their product. I mean, China is the big beneficiary of Apple, not us. I would turn everything around. And if you look at what other countries are doing, Japan, China.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The other day, a friend of mine, a very big construction person, he ordered Komatsu tractors. They're made in Japan. Japan is cutting their currency so much. You know, they're devaluing their currency, that all of a sudden, for the first time, you can't buy Caterpillar tractors because it doesn't make economic sense, so he's buying Komatsu tractors.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's buying tractors that are made in Japan or at least the parts are made. You know, they assemble them here to get away with murder. But there are so many things we could do to make our country rich again and make our country great again.
<Josh McElveen> <Positive> We're going to expand on the economic discussion when we get to our audience, but I want to talk about the national security, foreign policy. You have said that if President, you would I think, quote, unquote, knock ISIS out of the box. It's fair to ask why are you qualified to make decisions that could impact the -- the well-being of, obviously, our American men and women?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because a lot of those decisions are commonsense. And unlike a lot of people, what, you know, they say, "What would you do?" I don't want to say what I'm going to do. The -- the President gets up and he says, you know, we're going to attack them in two weeks. General MacArthur, General Patton, they're spinning in their grave.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, we -- we say, in two weeks, we expect to be going and attacking ISIS. We're going to be dropping bombs, we're going to drop this many bombs. We're going to be here, we're going to be there. We're -- what is this? You're fighting these people. I mean, why are we telling them? We're telling them everything we're doing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They leave areas. They hear that we're going to be attacked at a certain time, a certain date, they leave. They go someplace else. They put other people there so that we kill people that we're not even supposed to be fighting. No, I think it's very bad. I think when you're fighting, you're supposed to fight, you're not supposed to be broadcasting it for political reasons all over the world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can only say this. I would be very, very tough on ISIS, and ISIS would come to the table very quickly, whatever is left. But they'd come to the table very quickly and that whole situation would end. What's going on in the Middle East is a travesty. Now, I did say that when you broke up Iraq, take the oil.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you're going to go after Iraq, they went after Iraq. I said, "Take the oil." I've been saying that for years. I said it to you years ago, because I'd been actually to New Hampshire a lot. I have a lot of friends up here. And I -- I really -- I'm here a lot. It's a great place. And I said, "Take the oil." What are we doing?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're losing -- we spend $1.5 trillion in Iraq. Thousands of lives lost. The wounded warriors all over the place. I help them all the time. I -- I love them. I mean, I love them. People don't talk about them. They don't talk about the vets. Even the vets up in New Hampshire, they don't treat them properly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By the way, in New Hampshire, you don't even have a hospital dedicated to the vets. You know, you have to go someplace to other states. So, you know, there's so many things, but I said, "Keep the oil." You know who has the oil right now? ISIS. ISIS has the oil. And I said that was going to happen. I said we're going to leave Iraq and Iran -- and by the way, Iran is now taking over Iraq.
<Josh McElveen> <Positive> That's my next question. Quickly, we have about 30 seconds before we take a break. Is there any way you would engage in diplomatic talks with Iran about their nuclear program or is it just black and white?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can only tell you this. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. OK? You're going to have to preserve ourselves and you have to preserve Israel. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. And, you know, and I said this and you can go back and you can check four, five years ago when we had Iraq, I said, now, what's going to happen -- you know, there were two countries of equal strength that fight for decades and decades, they'd fight.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They go two feet here, two feet there. It was equal. We obliterated Iraq, and now, Iran is taking over Iraq. And it's exactly what I said five or six years ago, and I've been saying it consistently. But I did say, "If we're leaving, keep the oil."
<Josh McElveen> <Positive> All right, we're going to take a quick break and be back with our studio audience bringing them into the conversation. Stay with us.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> Now, Conversation with the Candidate continues.
<Josh McElveen> <Positive> And welcome back to our Conversation with the Candidate. Tonight's guest, Republican Donald Trump, and it's time now to bring in the audience to ask some questions. I'll jump in if there is a need for a follow-up. But for right now, let's get right to it. Our first question coming from Jim Adams. Jim, good to see you.
<Jim Adams> <Positive> Mr. Trump, your business experience and success are well-known. How do you take that and move into a place where you're going to have a lot of differing opinions and get those folks to work with you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you have to -- it's really, Jim, about leadership and you have to get people in a room and you have to learn to lead. Obama can't get involved with Israel. He can't get along with ne -- Netanyahu, can't get along with anybody, can't get along with the Republicans. Frankly, can't get along with the Democrats.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And so he starts signing executive orders. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't get along with anybody. Here's an executive order. That'll be end up in courts for years and years and I think, ultimately, if they do the right thing, it's going to be totally unconstitutional. It's ridiculous what he's done.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But he doesn't lead. I don't think he works very hard, frankly. I really don't. I don't think he meets with people. I don't think he works hard. People that are in the Senate, they never hear from him, even in his own party. You have to be able to lead. You have to work very hard. You know, one little thing that took place on Thursday.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought it was horrible. It was not that significant, but significant in terms of what it represents. Obama -- President Obama goes to California on Air Force One, massive Boeing plane. His wife goes the same day hour later, hour earlier, right at almost the same time. Same -- they both go -- they're both going to Burbank.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're both going to the same studio. And they go in separate planes. And then they said, "Well, that was the way it was scheduled." Well, I guarantee you that Ellen DeGeneres -- guarantee, there's no question about it. Ellen DeGeneres and Jimmy Kimmel would have come to the White House and you would have saved it, or they could have at least taken one plane.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they take two massive Boeing planes to go and do two interviews and it's the same location, the same city. So that's the way the country runs, whether it's that or a five billion dollar website for Obamacare that never worked properly and still doesn't work properly. There are so many things you could do, Jim.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And just one other thing, the other day, last week, they came out, $125 billion in waste that they can find, 125 billion. So somebody like me would do a great job, believe me. And I'm an outsider. And the Republicans and a lot of people, you know, the insiders, they don't like this because they want to have the politicians.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And as I said before to Josh, I've dealt with politicians all my life. I've made a lot of money with politicians. Politicians are really easy for people like me. They're really easy. Look, they're all talk, they're no action. What they are good at is self-preservation. They preserve their own job. That's all they want.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They preserve their own job. But they don't help us, and it's about time that we had an outsider going in. And I'll tell you what, I could do one hell of a job. If I decide to run, you will be very happy.
<Josh McElveen> <Positive> All right, Jim, thanks very much for your question. Let's go to another one from the audience. Another coming from Jeff Johnson. Jeff, the floor is yours. Go ahead.
<Jeff Johnson> <Neutral> Hi are you doing, Mr. Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi, Jeff.
<Jeff Johnson> <Negative> How are you doing? I have to take care of my household and my economy, my own household, and keep us out of debt. Why doesn't government ha -- have the same idea here? And so what's your plan to get us closer to being out of debt in the US?
<Unknown speaker> <Positive> Well, you're 100% right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then our -- our money is being drained by foreign countries. I mean, totally, honestly, every deal we make is a bad deal. And these are massive deals. These aren't deals like you and you -- your deals are tougher. In a way, your situation is tougher. If you had somebody as a President who knew what he was doing, that's easier than straightening out your situation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But when I would straighten out the big situation, your situation will follow. It's like in a country that's in trouble, it's very hard for the people to do well. When the country is solved and the problems are solved -- so China is draining us. Japan now is going to start, again, big time draining us because they just start cutting their current -- cutting their currency like crazy and they're selling things like they've never sold before.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So Japan is going to be big time going after us. A lot of people don't know this, but Mexico is a disaster for the United States. And I'm not only talking about the borders, and by the way, we have to build a wall like you've never seen before. We have to keep the illegals out and that's that. Not even -- don't even talk about it. But beyond that, they're taking our jobs and they're out negotiating.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we don't negotiate well with anyone. If we did, this country would make a fortune. Social Security could stay the same. You could keep your Social Security without cuts, Medicare, Medicaid, all of that. But no politician is going to be able to do that because they don't have the competence. They really don't have the competence.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Remember this, all talk, no action. I've played with politicians all my life. I've done very well with politicians. It's about time we had an outsider.
<Josh McElveen> <Positive> All right. Eric, thank you very much for your quest -- or Jeff. Now, it's time for Eric to ask the question. You're up.
<Eric Zulaski> <Negative> Hi, Mr. Trump. Small businesses are the engine of New Hampshire's economy, but they can't afford to invest the millions of dollars to fund election campaigns and to hire lobbyists like big corporations do to maintain political influence. How would you prevent corporate cronyism from corrupting our government and our economy?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you're 100% right. It's not only corporate, it's also the fact that a lot of the people that you think are representing you aren't really because the lobbyists have them totally under control. I've always wondered how OPEC, for so many years, got away with murder. I mean, they got away with murder, and they had every lobbyist in Washington on their payroll.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the senators were afraid to go against them because these lobbyists gave big campaign contributions to the senators, to the congressmen, to everybody. And you couldn't even get somebody that wasn't really representing OPEC. If you were looking for somebody to go against OPEC, you couldn't even find anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And there are many other industries like that. So it's a real problem. I mean, one of the things with me, somebody like me, I don't need money. I don't need anybody's money. I'm not going to make a deal because somebody is going to give me $5,000 to run for office. I'm going to be beholding to that person, which politicians are.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We've got to do what's right for the country. And you're 100% right. It's all about the small business. The small business is so important, not only in New Hampshire, all over the country. And the small businessman is being crushed and it's being crushed by bad trade pacts that we're making with other countries.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know that we're losing so much, but up in New Hampshire, they're losing. You go to Tennessee and you see what just happened with Mexico where companies are moving to Mexico from Tennessee. You go to Iowa and you take a look at what happened in Iowa. What co -- companies are moving out of Iowa and out of the country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we actually give tax incentives for these companies that are hard to believe it. If the right person is in office, the small business, and there's nothing closer to my heart than small business. And I really started with small business, and I built a great company. I -- my company is a great company.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, in fact, somebody said, "Well, how big is it?" Last time, when I was thinking about running, and I must be honest with you, I was very disappointed with Mitt because, in the end, Mitt failed. He -- I don't know what happened to him. He choked, something happened to him. He didn't get there. He should have been able to beat Obama.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But for that last month, he disappeared. Something has to be done for the small business person and something has to be done for the middle class, frankly, generally, because the middle class in this country are being absolutely crushed.
<Josh McElveen> <Positive> Kind of a follow-up on Eric's question. Mr. Trump, have you identi -- should you decide to run, have you identified if or how much money of your own you would spend on the campaign?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Probably, mostly, my money. I mean, some people -- I mean, I got a check from a woman the other day, 10 -- $10. She said, "I'm 79 years old. I love our country. I'm desperate that the country gets great again. You're the only one that's going to do it. This is all I can afford." $10, I saved it. $10. A beautiful check from a beautiful woman who loves the country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She said, "You're the only one that's going to do it." I've watched these people all my life. "You're the only one that's going to do it." Look, the last thing we need is another Bush. We've had Bushes, we've had Clintons. We -- the last thing you need in this country is another Bush. It'll just be the same old deal, and you don't need it. And I don't need it. And it's probably going to hurt me to say it because if somebody gets in, they're not going to love me. Who cares?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't care. I want this country to be great again. And it's not going to be great if we have Jeb Bush with his immigration policy with -- let them in. Do you remember the statement of love? They come in for love. What was that all about? Nobody he -- I don't even think he knows what was it all about. And then you take a look at -- at education.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He wants education to be run by the Federal government, the Common Core. And education should be a local standard. It should be local. The parents, the -- the teachers, they should be setting it. They know much better than somebody sitting in Washington, picking up a paycheck not knowing what they're talking about.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So Jeb is in favor of Common Core and he's weak on immigration, totally weak on immigration. I don't know. This is not what I want.
<Josh McElveen> <Neutral> All right. Let's get a social media question where we took from Facebook on a social issue. This one comes from Tom Riley who writes, "How do you feel about gay marriage?"
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've said I'm a traditional person and I'm for traditional marriage.
<Josh McElveen> <Negative> All right, leave it at that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The question I'm getting asked, I must say as a Republican, I'm getting that question more and more. And I'm a traditional marriage person. But it is a question that the Republican candidates are being asked more and more. It's an interesting question.
<Josh McElveen> <Positive> And have been for a while now. All right, let's go to our next question. Come from the audience now. It's Scott Payrits, correct?
<Scott Payrits> <Positive> Yes.
<Josh McElveen> <Neutral> Scott, go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi, Scott.
<Scott Payrits> <Negative> Mr. Trump, how would you fix the country's broken tax system?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's too complicated, it's too big, and we're paying too much. You know, we're one of the heaviest taxed countries in the world. That's one of the reasons we're actually losing corporations. This the great secret that nobody writes about. We have corporations that are leaving this country because of the tremendous taxes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we're one of the most -- probably the most, it's either first or second. But I would say it's first if you add everything. So the -- we're the most heavily taxed nation in the world. One of the problems we have is just too complex, it has to be changed, whether you go Fair Tax, flat tax. There are many procedures you can use, all of which are better than what we have right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right now, we have a system that is so complex. I mean, I have the biggest law firm and I spend millions of dollars on just preparation of -- I have massive taxes, massive tax returns, and you get deductions for this, you get penalized for this. You get this, you get -- you have to hire these people. It costs you a fortune.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And -- and in a smaller way, a lot of other people, they have to go out and they have to hire. I want to put H&R Block out of business, OK? Because there's no reason you shouldn't be able to do your own tax return. And we have to make it simple. And we have to make it much fairer than it is right now because it is not a fair system.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK? Thank you.
<Josh McElveen> <Positive> Thank you very much, Scott, for your question. Let's go to Lauren Byrnes. Next question comes from our audience. Lauren, good morning.
<Lauren Byrnes> <Negative> Good morning. The recent threats to U.S. ambassadors in Africa and Asia prove that America has an image problem overseas. How do we strengthen our image problem overseas but still protect our social and financial in -- interests here at home?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, what they did to the ambassador with the razor blade talked about in Asia in -- in an area that people thought was safe was absolutely disgraceful. And that's really a lack of respect for our country. Nobody disliked him. Nobody knew him. It's a disrespect, it's a lack of respect for our country. And that's got to change.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it all starts at the top. And, you know, there are those that say that Hillary Clinton was the worst in the history of this country, the worst Secretary of State. Now, she's running and she's going to do, you know, very well it looks like, despite the e-mail scandals and despite everything else. I mean, polls came out and she's still the most popular in the Democrat.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Looks like she's not going to be challenged or significantly challenged. But it all starts at the top. People don't respect the United States of America anymore. They used to. They don't anymore. We're not the same country. We're not the same country. You had the right leader, it would stop.
<Josh McElveen> <Positive> All right. Thank you, Mr. Trump, and thank you for the question, Lauren. Let's go to another one to -- from our audience coming from Eileen Brady. Hi, Eileen.
<Eileen Brady> <Positive> Thanks for coming. I work in a local soup kitchen in homeless shelter and I was wondering what do you see as the best way to adjust and solve the problem of homelessness, both for those people who are homeless and the communities affected by their attempts to survive there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it's a tremendous problem. And more so in some states. I mean, in some states, it's being, you know, you look at what's going on with the food stamps and with so many other things, there's never been anything like it. We've never hit the kind of numbers we're hitting right now and very interestingly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So if you're looking for a job and if you stop looking for that job, they consider you employed. You know, the f -- the employment and the unemployment numbers are a total fraud. It's a total joke. The numbers are not 5.6%. You know, they say 5.6. The real number is probably 21, 22, 20, maybe even higher than that percent, and that's why you're asking me this question because the unemployment in this country is unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's unbelievably high. And those numbers that they come out with every month are totally skewed because they want to make the politicians look better. We have to put our people back to work. That's the way you get rid of the kitchens. That's the way you get rid of people that need really hand that they want to work.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> As you know, many of the people that you deal, they want a job, they can't get a job. And then you hear unemployment is doing so well. It's -- it's probably never been worse. And then you also have another new phenomena caused by Obamacare, which by the way is a total disaster, which has to be repealed and replaced with something much better.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But Obamacare with the part-time workers, everyone is becoming a part-time worker because under Obamacare that's the cheapest way for a company to do it, to be frank with you. So Obamacare is absolutely a disaster. This whole thing has to be changed. You know, another phenomena that you're going to see, and remember, it doesn't really kick -- and Obamacare doesn't really kick in until 2016. That's when it kicks in. You know, President was smart.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He said, "Hey, look, let it really kick in." In the meantime, our people aren't going to have it. Senators aren't going to -- you know, all the people that in Washington that are supposed to be paying this onerous problem and -- and getting ri -- having this onerous problem, they're not doing it. But Obamacare kicks in in 2016. Wait till you see the catastrophe that's going to take place in 2016. And one other thing, doctors.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Doctors are leaving their profession because they say they can't do it. It doesn't work for them, and they have to hire more accountants. They used to hire nurses, now they hire accountants because it's so complicated. It's totally out of control. Obamacare has to be ended. Jobs have to be reproduced, and it can be done.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If we have the right leader, jobs can be produced. We have to take it away from foreign countries.
<Josh McElveen> <Positive> We're just about out of time in this half hour, Mr. Trump. Thank you, Eileen. Good to -- good to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you so much.
<Josh McElveen> <Negative> Quick follow-up. You brought a public health. Big problem here in this state, a -- along with a lot of other states, is heroin -- heroin addiction. What would you do from the Federal level to combat it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, look, it - heroin is a very big problem because that's serious stuff. You know, you see what's going on in Colorado and a lot of people like it, a lot of people don't like it, and it's very mixed and they do have some problems. But I would say, in terms of health with the marijuana and other things, when it comes to health, you have people dying and they don't want to give them help.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> For that, you have to help people. As far as heroin, you have to be very strong on it. It's really -- and heroin is so addictive that when they take their shots of heroin, they can't get heroin, they cannot get off it. So something has to be done. You have to come down very strong on that.
<Josh McElveen> <Neutral> Less than a minute. Does it start at the border though?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It starts at the border. It starts at the border. Look, people are flowing into this country. People that are, in many cases, really bad. They're not sending over their good people, they're sending over their criminals, they're sending over people that will never -- we are taking people in this country that are not going to help us for the most part.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, I'm sure they're going to be some wonderful people, but for the most part, they're not going to be helping. We're getting criminals, we're getting gang members, we're getting the worst of the worst, and we're just letting them flow right in, come on in. Now, they're going to be voting and the Democrats like this because they're going -- you know, I watch the Republicans and I watch Bush and I watch Rubio when he came out very strongly in favor of it. And they -- they wanted to help.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're not going to be able to help. These people are going to be voting 100% for Democrats.
<Josh McElveen> <Positive> We've got to run, we're going to keep this going online, sir. That's all the time we have right now for television. Coming up in our next Conversation with the Candidate series Republican Senator, Rand Paul, will be on the program.
