<Lawrence Smith> <Negative> [No Video] Your visit comes on the heels of the Vice President coming here to Louisville. Why the focus on Kentucky?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [No Video] Well, I've been with them, and they've been with me. Kentucky has been one of our great states. I love the people of Kentucky. We're putting the miners back to work. We've already signed legislation so, environmentally, allows the mines to start re-opening and keeping them open. I made a lot of promises to the miners, and I'm keeping those promises. So I wanted to come back here and tell them that.
<Lawrence Smith> <Positive> [Video Begins] How much do you need Sen. Rand Paul to support this, and what you you prepared to do to get that support?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I like Rand Paul. I think he's good guy. And he's speaking from the heart. But I think we have a bill that's going to be negotiated. You put it in, and they go back, and I think in the end, we're going to have a fantastic bill. And the alternative is Obamacare, and Obamacare is killing Kentucky. In Tennessee, they've already lost half of it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So half of it is now dead. The insurance companies left. You're going to lose your insurance companies if you haven't already lost them. It's been a disaster for Kentucky. I really like Rand, and I respect Rand. But I think he's hopefully going to come along. I hope so.
<Lawrence Smith> <Positive> So you think in the end it will be something that he can support?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think so. I think it's going a lot of things are going to happen. You know, we go through the House, and then we go through the Senat,e and it's back and forth. We're adding a lot of -- a lot of bells and whistles. And I think in the end, it's going to be something that everybody -- people are going to want it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, Obamacare is a disaster, and they don't like to say it, but it doesn't get any worse. And it was a lie. It was approved by a lie, and we'll see what happens. But no, I think so. I mean, ou see the kind of crowd we have here, and that's big stuff, he said. They've never seen a crowd like this. It's some kind of a record, they're telling me. How many people does this stadium hold? Does this arena --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Lawrence Smith For basketball, about 20,000.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we have it full. [Laughter] So that's pretty good. We're very honored by it. I guess that's one of the reasons I also love Kentucky and did so well here. I'll be coming back to Kentucky a lot. We'll be doing a lot of things for the people in Kentucky.
<Lawrence Smith> <Negative> Critics have said that your bill would cause hundreds of thousands of people in Kentucky, who gained health care under Obamacare, who gained coverage primarily through Medicaid, to lose it. What do you say to those folks, many of whom voted for you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right. They did vote for me. We've changed it just recently over the last couple of days. And I also saw that, and, while I disagree with it, I didn't want there to be any question, and we've changed it, and we've added it and we've added dollars. And I will never let that happen to my people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> These are people that were with me from the beginning, and we actually -- I did see that, and I think it's incorrect. I think it was you know made to look -- you can make anything to look like anything, but we've made a lot of changes and we've added, and I think you'll find that's very much different.
<Lawrence Smith> <Negative> So Medicaid as far as you're concerned?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But what we're doing is, when you take a look at it, and you look at the numbers, you're going to see that the people -- and I'm not just saying that the people that voted for me, but the people that voted for me will be very happy.
<Lawrence Smith> <Negative> Our general assembly and our governor have done a lot to try to improve the business climate here, bring jobs here. What can you do on the federal level to attract jobs to Kentucky? You mentioned coal, right? But what else can you do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right, right. Well do you -- and you have a great -- you have a great governor, a friend of mine, and he's done a terrific job. We're going to have jobs come back. We're putting on -- we're doing a lot of things with trade.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You notice what's going on with the car companies, and I already worked on Ford. You saw that, with your factory, with your car plant. We're going to have many plants coming back in, the auto industry is going to stay here, very importantly, and then expand, and we're making it so that leaving, they just can't leave Kentucky and say bye-bye, we're going, and we're going to go to Mexico or someplace else, because when they make their product in a different country, after they fire all their workers, they're not going to sell their product for, you know, no tax coming back in.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I feel very very strongly about it, and it's happened. And you already see, a lot of plants that were expected to leave throughout this country, also in Kentucky because you have a big one right here that, you know, ended up staying. But those plants are going to end up staying and they're going to expand.
<Lawrence Smith> <Positive> A final word for the people of Kentucky from President of the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We love you. Special place.
<Lawrence Smith> <Positive> Thank you Mr. President. Thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning. Today, I am very proud of myself, because I have accomplished something that nobody else has been able to accomplish. I was just informed while on the helicopter that our president has finally released a birth certificate. I want to look at it, but I hope it's true -- so that we can get on to much more important matters, so the press can stop asking me questions.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He should have done it a long time ago. Why he didn't do it when the Clintons asked for it, why he didn't do it when everybody else was asking for it, I don't know. But I am really honored, frankly, to have played such a big role in hopefully, hopefully, getting rid of this issue. Now, we have to look at it. We have to see, is it real?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Is it proper? What's on it? But I hope it checks out beautifully. I am really proud. I am really honored. Now, we can talk about oil. We can talk about gasoline prices. We can talk about China ripping off this country. We can talk about OPEC doing numbers on us like nobody has ever done before. We can get on to issues and, hopefully, when I sit down with interviews, people don't start talking about birth certificate, birth certificate, like they have been doing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I feel I've accomplished something really, really important. And I'm honored by it. OK.
<Question> <Negative> You are taking credit for it. A lot of people say that what you caused was a distraction?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm taking great credit. And you have to ask the president why didn't he do this a long time ago? Why didn't he do it a long time ago? When Hillary Clinton was asking, when everybody was asking, why didn't he do it? It's shocking. It's shocking.
<Question> <Neutral> Why is that relevant?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's very relevant. Why is it that people ask me for my birth certificate? People ask me for my birth certificate and I gave it two days later.
<Question> <Negative> You said yesterday we hear that is missing. Before that, you said, "You wouldn't believe what my investigators on the ground are saying." Do the people in this country now need to doubt the information you are being given? Were you making this up? Where did this information come from?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I think what you are going to see. First, we have to look at the certificate. But I am really happy that this has finally taken place because we have some issues that are unbelievably important.
<Question> <Negative> You didn't answer my question, sir. You think...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think I did. No, I did answer the question.
<Question> <Positive> What are your qualifications to assess this? You say, you have to look at it and you have to decide. What gives you the authority the...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm going to look at it and many other people are going to look at it. You are going to have many people looking at it. And, obviously, they are going to have to make a decision, because it is rather amazing that, all of the sudden, it materializes. But I hope it's the right deal. I'm sure -- I hope it's the right deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have to look at it. A lot of people have to look at it. Experts will look at it and I am really happy. And, honestly, I'm very proud that I was able to bring this to a point. Nobody else was. The Clintons during their campaign weren't. All of the other people that talked about it for years, they weren't. I am really honored by this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK. Next question.
<Question> <Negative> If it is not true, for example, does it mean that the country is led by an illegal president? Is that what you're saying?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, let's hope it is true. I don't want to answer that question because it's too negative. Honestly, the question is so negative. At this point, I don't want to answer that question because you are asking a very negative question. If it's not true, if it's not really his birth certificate -- I don't want to answer that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hope it's true. And the reason I hope it's true, because we have very big problems in this country. This country is suffering right now. I mean, I have people that can't get gasoline in their tank. They are topping out their tank because they can't afford to do it properly. They have never had this before.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at -- you look at resorts around the country, they are not doing any business, because people don't drive. And then, if you look at Saudi Arabia, what they did, it's unbelievable. Three days ago, they announced essentially that they are going to raise the price of oil by cutting back on production.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we have nobody to speak to these people. We have nobody that calls or talks and says, "You're not going to do it, fellows. We are protecting you. You wouldn't be there, except for us." We have nobody. Now, yesterday, our president said, that he has very little impact over the price of gasoline. I think he's 100 percent wrong, because OPEC is setting the price of fuel.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have -- we have oil all over the place, all over the place. Every ship at sea is loaded up with oil. They don't know where to dump it. And yet, every day, we are setting records. And pretty soon, we're going to be at the $150 a barrel, the all-time record. Now, when the president says he has no power over that, I mean, it's pretty sad.
<Question> <Neutral> Is it possible that the country is being led right now by an illegitimate president? Is that possible?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I certainly hope it's not possible. And I hope we have accomplished a lot by what I have been doing for the last couple of months. And I hope we can start talking about OPEC and China taking our jobs and making everything for us. I hope we can start doing that. [Crosstalk]
<Question> <Neutral> What would you do differently?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What I would do differently is come down really hard on OPEC. If you look at these nations, they wouldn't be there except for us. You take a look at Kuwait. I mean, we handed Kuwait back to the people that right now essentially own Kuwait because it's really ownership more than anything else. We handed it back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They never paid us. You look at these nations, Saudi Arabia, we protect them. And then they want to raise the price of fuel. It's not high enough. So, it would be very easy and very quick to get gasoline prices down. Gasoline prices are at $4, $5, they are going to $6 and $7, as sure as you are standing there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes?
<Question> <Positive> In terms of credibility, you came here in a black helicopter in 1988 and you were running as a Democrat. Why should people -- what makes you...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I wasn't -- let me just tell you. It's sort of interesting, because New Hampshire has been a very special place. I came up in 1988 or 1989, a long time ago, as a favor to a friend of mine. And I made a speech. But it's a place that I have always liked. I have been to many times, New Hampshire. And in making the speech, everyone thought I was running for president.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, as you know, I wasn't running for president. I never said I was running for president. I make a speech on success for a friend of mine around 1988. And the buzz was unbelievable, because it happened to be New Hampshire. And it was sometime prior to primary season. So, in a way, New Hampshire sort of got me started.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's sort of interesting. But I did come up in 1988. I made a speech. It was really a speech on success, much more so than politics. In fact, I don't know if politics played a role in the speech. And it was great. It really did. It sort of got me started. But I did that speech actually for a friend. I didn't do it because I was running, because I wasn't running.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Crosstalk]
<Question> <Neutral> When are you going to release your financial...
<Question> <Neutral> Sir, why should people think you are a real Republican?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I am a Republican. I'm a very strong Republican. And I have been a Republican for a long while. And I'm proud of it. And I think I'm quite conservative as a Republican. And if you look at the polls -- I mean, I just saw two more polls today where I am leading the polls. And I think the fact that I was able to get him finally to come out and issue a birth certificate can only help.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I will say this, one other thing, one of the big pollsters who came out where I was leading, just yesterday, said, if you've actually announced, your poll numbers would go substantially up because a lot of people think I'm having a good time. I'm not having a good time.
<Question> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Are you an intelligent man? Are you intelligent? Have you been listening? I just don't know. Are you intelligent? Because here's the problem -- I hate saying it because it sounds trivial. But I have a very, very successful show on television. The number [Inaudible] show on NBC, a show that "The New York Times" yesterday said is a very, very successful show.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have a show called "Celebrity Apprentice." I can't announce until that show is over. I just can't do it. I'd love to do it for you, but I can't do it. When the show is over -- let me explain -- when the show is over and the finale will be on May 22nd. When the show is over, I will then be free to announce.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think you will be surprised at a number of things, but I think you will be surprised at what my announcement is.
<Question> <Positive> Another thing about the president. You want to raise these questions about his education credentials.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes?
<Question> <Negative> Are you prepared to say today that all these issues should be put to the side and that you accept that Mr. Obama is who he said he is?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Question> <Neutral> Or do you still think there are legitimate issues?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everything is legitimate. You ask me questions that, frankly, nobody gets angry. The press doesn't get angry. Look, the press is very protective of President Obama, very protective. They are not protective of me, but they are protective of President Obama. And they are not protective of most other people either, in all fairness.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The word is, according to what I've read, was that he was a terrible student when he went to Occidental. He then gets to Columbia. He then gets to Harvard. I heard at Columbia, he wasn't a very good student and then gets to Harvard. How do you get into Harvard if you're not a good student? Now, maybe that's right or maybe it's wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I don't know why he doesn't release his records. Why doesn't he release his Occidental records?
<Question> <Neutral> Who cares?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll tell you why who cares? Because everyone says he was this great student. Well, if he was, that's great. And if he wasn't, that's great. I was a very good student.
<Question> <Negative> Why [Inaudible] speak for themselves? Why do you continue to...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think -- I think academics. You know, I'll tell you what? Education has always meant a lot to me. And I think education is good. And I think if he wants to release it, that's fine. And if he doesn't want to release it, that's fine, too. But the word is -- you know, you'd think he'd want to release it, actually because the word is, he wasn't a good student and he ended up getting into Columbia and Harvard.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'd like to know, I'd like to know -- well, this is what I read written by some of the people in this room. I'd like to know, how does he get into Harvard? How does he get into Columbia if he isn't a good student? It's an interesting thing. Yes?
<Question> <Negative> Is there some danger, though, in a campaign by innuendo like this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's not innuendo. I'm just reporting what I read. Hey, you read stuff that you people write. Hey, look, what's worse innuendo than what I go through? I mean, what people say about me. I mean, I have the ultimate innuendo. But I promise you one thing -- nobody will protect me like they protect our president.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, just in finishing -- I'm really honored and I'm really proud that I was able to do something that nobody else could do. I'm really happy about it. And now, experts will check in and everybody will go over it. And I hope everything is going to be perfect. And, by the way, if you remember, from day one, I said, I hope he gives his certificate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because I don't want this issue clouding a campaign. OK.
<Question> <Positive> Do you need to see the birth certificate to feel like it's true?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's not up to me. That's up to experts. I'm sure there's plenty of experts that will look at it.
<Question> <Negative> Why have you made over $1 million in helping to get Democrats elected all those years?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've had a lot of friends that are Democrats and a lot of friends that are Republicans. And over the years, if you know, New York is a largely Democratic place. It's very rare that you see in New York City as an example for a Republican to get elected. The numbers are staggering, where a Democrat will get 94 percent of the vote and that's if a Republican is doing a good job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, it's a very, very interesting fact that it happens to be almost all Democratic. Over the years, I have supported many Republicans, many Democrats. And I think there's something nice about that. When I watch Washington and look at Washington and I see the way they fight, like cats and dogs, just fight like nobody has ever fought before -- people that have been in the Senate, that are friends of mine for a long time, they said, we've never seen hatred.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, they used to be friends. They'd argue, and then they'd go to dinner together, the Republican and Democrat. And they'd get things done. Now, we're like at a stalemate. I think it would be great if somebody got in there that could get along with both sides. And I know many of the people that are on the Democratic side.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And in some cases, they are friends. Get along with them great. And I think it's time for people to sit down, get together and get this mess that we're in right now solved. So, I view that as an asset, not a liability. Yes, ma'am?
<Question> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, my view's changed. And, you know, when I talk, I do a lot of speaking about success. And I tell people, you have to remain flexible because the world changes. The world will always change. And, you know, you can't just have like an idea and then this idea -- it's like go through a wall. Sometimes you have to be able to go under the wall, around the wall, over the wall.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I have always said, have a goal, work hard. You have to have a certain flexibility. Now, if you look at virtually every candidate that runs for office or currently running for office, they have had views that are much different 10 years ago than they have now. So, my view has changed and, virtually, all of the candidates, their interview has changed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that's not, I don't think, a very uncommon thing.
<Question> <Neutral> When will you release your tax returns?
<Question> <Positive> Mr. Trump, are you playing with us or are we playing with you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think you are playing with me but I accept that.
<Question> <Positive> Are you playing with us more or is it going to end when you make the announcement?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's a very interesting question. I think you're going to be very surprised.
<Question> <Negative> Ann Coulter said last night you are not running for president. She compared you to Charlie Sheen. [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Ann Coulter?
<Question> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, you have to see. You know what? We have three weeks. It's not a big deal. In three weeks, you're going to see. I think you're going to be very surprised. I think, if I do run, I'll do very well. And I think -- look, I'm already leading the polls and I'm not running. Am I leading the polls? Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I mean -- excuse me. CNN did a poll -- CNN did a poll recently where Obama and I are statistically tied. If you would like, I can send it to you. Just call up CNN.
<Question> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think I'd beat Obama. If I look at this economy and how bad it's doing, if I look at this economy, and it's doing so poorly. And I think ultimately, it's going to be largely about that. You look at what he's doing in Libya, which is a total disaster. Nobody even knows what's going on in Libya. If you look at what's happening with gasoline prices where he said he has no control over prices, which he does if he gets on the phone or gets of his basketball court or whatever he is doing at the time, I mean, he should be focused on OPEC and getting those prices down.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's what he should be focused on. Yes?
<Question> <Neutral> What will you do with Libya?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I would handle Libya much differently. First of all, I know who the rebels are. And I've said it many times, the rebels, I hear, are controlled by Iran and Al Qaida. So, you know, we make them sound like they are out of gone with the wind. It's wonderful, the beautiful rebels, it's so romantic, isn't it great?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You could end up with worse than Gadhafi, perhaps. So, I have a real problem having our straight military people lose their lives in Libya and we don't know what we're getting into. And I've always said, I'd go for Libya but I want the oil. You know, in the old days, when you win a war, you win a war. Nowadays, you win a war, we lose lives, we spend billions of dollars and then we come out and go back home.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we have all of our wounded to take care of, we have all of the dead soldiers and dead military. And what do we get? Nothing. This is interesting, Libya, because the Arab League, which is Saudi Arabia and many of the wealthiest nations in the world told us to go in and take out Gadhafi. Now, if they would have said that to me, I would have said $5 billion right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what? Just for the question they would have given you all of that money, they would have paid it in two seconds. The other question I ask is this, we get no oil from Libya. We get no oil. China, which is taking over the world economically because they're smart, meaning their leaders are much smarter.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> China, taking over the world gets a big portion of its oil from Libya. They're Libya's biggest customers. Why isn't China involved? Why are we involved with Libya and China's not involved and China -- by the way, the IMF came out two days ago. They said by 2016, China's bigger than we are. And you know why they're bigger?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because they're making our products. If they didn't make our products, they wouldn't be at all bigger.
<Question> <Negative> [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's so easy. China is taking unfair advantage of the United States and other countries by a total manipulation of their currency. If they continue to manipulate their currency -- if I am in office and I decide to run and win, within one day, they're going to be told, you keep manipulating your currency, we're going to tax you 25 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now that's going to do two things. First of all, they'll stop manipulating at the mere thought of it, if they believed it. But they don't believe this administration because when the president of China comes to the United States, we hold a state dinner for him in the White House. Now here's a guy that's been screwing our country for years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're going to make $300 billion profit, call it profit, this year, $300 billion, more than that. And we hold a state dinner. And the reason is because they manipulate their currency brilliantly. And, by the way, I have no anger at China. If you can get away with it -- I mean, if I was from China, I'd be very proud of my leaders.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I'm from this country and I'm proud of this country but I'm not proud of our leaders because they're allowing the world to take advantage of us. They are allowing the world to rip us off like never before. And, by the way, when you talk about budget deficits, the deficits because our economy -- how can our economy ever get good?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How can our economy ever be strong -- ever -- when we have other countries making our product? It can't happen. I watched Ben Bernanke not long ago say, no, unemployment's going to be bad for a long time. You know why? Because India is taking so many jobs through outsourcing. China is making our products so we don't have -- I look at places like Newton, Iowa, where Maytag moved out and they moved into Mexico and devastated the town.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, if you put a tax on Chinese products, unless they change their way, you're gonna start bringing jobs back to this country and bringing it back fast or -- and I think this is more likely, China will change its policies so that we can now compete. And it's real easy, and remember this, and I say it: we have all the cards, they don't. Because if we pull back on China -- by the way in 2016 -- they're not going to be bigger than us, because they're going to be bigger than us, because they're making our products, and they make products for others, but they make products for us, big league.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So if we ever pulled back on that, China is not bigger than us. China has got a big problem, and just remember what I said: we have all the cards. They don't have the cards, they have a trillion dollars in debt, a lot of money, but it's peanuts compared to the overall big ball of the world. Peanuts. We have all of the cards.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The reason they loan us money is because they take in so much money from us, and some others, but mostly from us, and remember the number: over $300 billion this year, and they're, taking our jobs. Pretty sad, and the President could solve that so easily. Instead of having state dinners, he could solve that so easily.
<Question> <Negative> Mr. Trump, what are you hoping to learn here today from the people in New Hampshire  that will play into your decision whether to run or not?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I was very honored because I just saw our poll in New Hampshire, and I'm doing very well and, frankly, a man that lives in New Hampshire is, you know, not doing so well, and that amazes me. He lives here, but, you know, you have to understand. I'm running against some people that have happened to like.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's always tough when you run, if I decide to run, against people that you like. It's always tough. But the fact is, when you live in New Hampshire, and you're a few points up on Trump, that's not saying much, and you've been campaigning for 6 years, and I haven't campaigned at all, because I really haven't, I mean, I have not announced.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But that's a pretty bad statement when you're almost even in a poll -- and here I am.
<Question> <Positive> Mr Trump, when you talk to people here today, what do you hope -- what kind of news are you looking for, what will what will help you -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm gonna look -- I mean I there's one example that I saw the other day, where -- [Crosstalk] yeah, there's one example that I saw the other day that's amazing: $276 million prison built in New Hampshire, the latest, the greatest and the town is devastated because the federal government now doesn't have the money to open it. It's pretty pathetic, and it's very unfair to New Hampshire, and it's very unfair to that part of New Hampshire, but they spend $276 million to build a prison, and the town is all for it, and there -- they have great employment prospects, and the federal government now doesn't have the money to open the prison.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I'm gonna see some of that, and I'm gonna see lots of different things. Right, how about one more question? Yes ma'am.
<Question> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't know what my campaign in New Hampshire is gonna look like, I mean, I'm gonna just tell it like it is. Look, I know how to make money. I've always known how to make money. Now, this country is broke. The United States is broke. We're a debtor nation. I leave places like -- you go to Saudi Arabia, you go to Abu Dhabi, you go to Qatar, you go to China, you leave airports that are the most incredible places in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You land at LaGuardia, it's old, it's broken, it's falling apart, and even the people that run it say, you were right in making that statement. Same thing with Kennedy. Same thing with Newark. Same thing with LAX. When was the last time, you know, if you go to China as an example: bridges being built, massive bridges.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When's the last time we built a bridge in this country, other than a little toy?
<Question> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The President -- look, I know, you're a big Obama fan, the president doesn't what he's doing.
<Question> <Neutral> Why do you say that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because of your questions. The president doesn't know what he's doing. The fact is, you come to this country: when was the last time when, that you saw a bridge, a big bridge being built. You don't see it. When was the last time you saw our big, beautiful new airport? You don't see it. You leave places like that, and then you come home, and it's very, very sad.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I'll make the decision some time prior to June. In fact, people say, oh, you can make it in June. I said, you don't understand. I've been telling people for three months that I'm gonna make it prior to June. I have people that want to represent me. I'm a lot of people. They're all saying: no, you don't have to make it in June, you can make it in July.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You can make it August. I say, you don't understand, that's a politician. That's what -- it gets us into trouble. I said that I will make the decision some time prior to June, and that's when I'll do it.
<Question> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll engage in a lot of politics in New Hampshire. I have a lot of friends that live in New Hampshire. I've had a good relationship with New Hampshire. As I told you, you could really say that this whole thing started in 1988 in New Hampshire, when I came up to make a totally unrelated speech and people viewed that -- I think I made a good speech frankly, because people viewed that almost as a like, why isn't he running.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it really started in New Hampshire with that speech.
<Question> <Negative> So Mr. Trump, do you have the temperament and the fortitude to put up with the fact that every week, potential voters in New Hampshire and other states [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I have the temperament. I really do. I think I have the temperament. I think what I would do is make this country rich again. If I decide to run -- and that's a big decision for me, including the fact, frankly, that I would have to give up one of the most successful shows on television, which is a lot of money, and a lot of prestige, and a lot of power.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, it's very cool being a television star. [Laughter] It's very cool, and I'd have to give that up, and I'd have to give a lot of other things up. But I would make -- if I ran, and if I won, I would make this country rich again. I would make this country powerful again, and I would make this country respected again, and maybe that last point is the most important.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The United States would be respected again. Thank you all very much. I'm going to take a tour.
<Question> <Neutral> The President just spoke and called you a carnival barker and a sideshow --
