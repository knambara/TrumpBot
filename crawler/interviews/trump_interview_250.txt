<Erin Burnett> <Negative> Donald Trump, conservative, showman, businessman -- he has a lot to say about where the country is headed and who should lead it. At one point, his name was on all the list for Republican candidates. I asked him why he got out. [Begin Interview]]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, a number of things happened. Number one, NBC is driving me crazy like please, please. You know, it's hard to give up a top rated television show, not because of the money. The money is a lot. But you now have your own primetime television and, you know, for the privilege of being spat at for the next year and a half, OK?
<Erin Burnett> <Negative> It's pretty tough from that perspective.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you understand that. OK. So, you know, but that's not the reason. When Paul Ryan came out with his plan knocking Medicare, he shouldn't have done it, big mistake. A bad poker player. He could have kept his mouth shut and elections were already lost because of that, including a very popular Republican woman from Buffalo where there was no chance for the Republican to lose and she lost very easily.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was the because of Paul Ryan's plan, very bad thing. The lame duck session was the disaster. I mean, they allowed Obama to rise like a Phoenix. He was gone, and they allowed him to rise. When they did those things -- so when I see that and I see all these things, I said, you know what? I'm very, very discouraged with what they are doing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I'm meeting with the individual people and, you know, I'm seeing some real signs of life. I have to tell you. And I met with Herman last week. He's a very impressive guy and a really nice guy. I met with Mitt two weeks ago and I'll you, you know, I was less of a Mitt Romney fan until I met him. And when you meet him, he's a completely different guy and a terrific guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I never met him prior to this. And, you know, I was very, very impressed. So, they have to get the word out. I mean -- and they are trying to get the word out. I think it's very early to be relying on polls. I never have seen polls that changed so quickly. One guy is on top, another is.
<Erin Burnett> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, look at Michele Bachmann, who I've also met with, who was a very lovely woman. I mean, she was through the roof three weeks ago. And now, she is having a hard time. So, the polls fluctuate very greatly and I think it's very early and I'm not sure it means that much at this point.
<Erin Burnett> <Neutral> When are you making your decision in terms of who to endorse?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Probably sometime prior to the primary. I think I owe it to a lot of people. Thousands of people are writing letters asking me who I'm going to endorse. And I think at sometime prior to -- I think, honestly I have an obligation to do it sometime prior to the primaries.
<Erin Burnett> <Positive> Like now? Like right here, right now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but maybe it will be on your show. It's a little bit soon. [Laughter]
<Erin Burnett> <Positive> Do you think -- Chris Christie talked about the Republican Party needing to go back to being a big tent party. And one of the frustrations that some people have is that it's been become a smaller tent party in part because of the focus on social issues. And just this week, you have this whole discussion over are Mormons Christians and, you know, all of a sudden religion comes into it again.
<Erin Burnett> <Negative> Do you have frustrations that the Republican Party still ends up defining itself by abortion stance or gay marriage? Or --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that was much more true four years ago than it is today and it's still true to a certain extent. But I think it's now about jobs and the economy. I really believe that even people pretty strong on the social issues are really looking. And that's why I hated to see what's going on about the whole Mormon thing, because Mitt Romney is a good man.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's unfair how that came out and the way it came out. And I happened to be Presbyterian. I happened to be Protestant and I understand and I know a lot of the people who are even saying negative things, and they like me a lot and I like them a lot, but I think it was unfair.
<Erin Burnett> <Negative> So, in terms of the policies where we are right now, I want to ask you, obviously, talk about China, and I know that you favor a currency readjustment which is a big issue in Washington. But Americans are trying to understand it. So, I wanted to ask to you this way. So, if we adjust the currency, if China adjusts their currency, a couple of negative things might happen in the U.S. Prices at Wal-Mart may go up and the U.S. is still just barely passed by China in terms of manufacturing.
<Erin Burnett> <Neutral> So, make the case for why now, why they adjust?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I make the case very simply, it's jobs. Instead of buying from China, we'll be making the gadgets and the toys to Baron Trump and everybody else that buys their children toys. They'll be made in Alabama and Iowa and lots of other places. This country can be turned around so fast. You know, it's funny, I have a club in Washington.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was on the Potomac River. It's great. But it wasn't really properly run, et cetera, et cetera, but I fixed it and made it really great. The clubhouse was clean and painted and beautiful and carpets. And a member came up and I never heard it this way. And the club -- it went from being, you know, good club and everything else, but just not in good shape, to being a phenomenal club where you can eat of the floors.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And a member came up. I was there this weekend, and said, this is what the country needs. The country has to be taken care of the way you just took care of this big club. It's sort of an interesting thing. I never thought of it that way, but it's true. Our bridges are falling down, our roads are potholes are all over the place.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, you look at the major highways and they look like third world country highways.
<Erin Burnett> <Positive> They do. They do. Even here in New York City, some of the streets.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You go to places now like China where they're building many George Washington Bridges. We think the George Washington Bridge is like a little bridge compared to the things they are doing. And they are doing it with our money. You know, if we have to cutoff China, China would go into the worst depression of any country in the history of the world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have all the power, they don't have the power. We have the power. But we don't have people smart enough to realize that. And we have tremendous power. So, just getting back to your question, if we ever aligned China properly in terms of the manipulation of the currency and instead of buying two toys, you buy one toy and that's OK.
<Erin Burnett> <Positive> Right, because it will cost a little bit more to make them here, but that's the choice you make as Americans.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I mean, I have a child upstairs who's got nine airplanes. So, instead of nine, he'll three that will be made in this country, and I like that. And he wouldn't know the difference.
<Erin Burnett> <Negative> No, he wouldn't. Who needs nine airplanes, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He doesn't need it. They are stacked up in a corner. Who needs it? They will be made in this country. The good news, we have tremendous potential if we had a guy who was intelligent with common sense -- those two things. Brain power and common sense. You know the other thing, Erin, we have the greatest business people in the world.
<Erin Burnett> <Positive> We do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'd say, you used to say businessman, but businessmen and women --
<Erin Burnett> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- in the world. I know them. A lot of them are nice and that's people, and some are nice, but some are horrible human beings and who cares. But we don't use them to negotiate deals with China and all of these countries. We don't use them. We use diplomats. We use people that don't even have a clue and we lose it every single front.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, that has to stop. We have tremendous potential. This country has tremendous potential if only we'd use it.
<Erin Burnett> <Negative> Donald Trump talks about leadership in America, really harsh words coming up. [Commercial Break]
<Erin Burnett> <Negative> More now with Donald Trump. I asked him about the millionaire's tax that the CBO has said would fund the president's jobs bill. I asked Trump whether he'd be willing to pay it and whether it's class warfare or not.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is a class warfare thing, but I will say this -- there are certain groups, as an example, oil companies. Now, you know, I'm a big negative fan -- even though many of them are tenants of my buildings but I happen to believe that OPEC and the oil companies are in absolutely cahoots. Why are we giving subsidies to oil companies is beyond me. Now, the Republicans are going to say, oh, that's terrible that you say that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's terrible. I love you, Republicans, and I'm more conservative than all of you. But for ExxonMobil to be getting subsidies and to be paying not that much in tax relatively speaking I think is ridiculous, OK?
<Erin Burnett> <Positive> And what about individuals? What about people like you? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think this. I think this. You know, I don't mind paying more tax, but I think -- and I'm not talking about myself. We have a terrible economy and more importantly, it's the word fragile is a good word. We have a very fragile economy. I think if you start playing around with tax increases, I really think it could lead to a disastrous result.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a bad time to raise taxes on people. And people aren't doing that well. Even rich people, I mean, some rich people are doing well. But it's a bad time to be raising taxes on people that provide work. If you could this economy turn around whatever anyone is paying right now, first of all, they're paying much more than.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They will make more of them. They'll pay more. But the thing that really solves the problem is a good economy. But you can have a good economy when China and when OPEC and when virtually every country in the world is ripping us when we are fighting wars for trillions and trillions of dollars that we shouldn't be fighting, you can't do that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's got to stop. And I said something like in Libya. You go to Libya -- I would have said, OK, fellas, they came to see us, right? They didn't win. The rebels, the so-called rebels, they didn't win the war. We are bombing the hell out of these people and then they walk in. OK. But I said, take over -- make sure when they come and they ask for your support, say absolutely, for the next 25 years, we want 50 percent of your oil.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what they would have said, how about 75 percent? We'll give you that, too, all right? But now, you can't go back because, you know, they're so-called won the war. We spent billions of dollars, and they won the war. Why didn't we get oil? Why didn't we get oil for what we did? We made it possible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, we knocked out Gadhafi. Nobody else knocked him out. We knocked him out through NATO and we are NATO.
<Erin Burnett> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why didn't we get paid for that? We are very, very stupid. Our leaders are very, very stupid people. Now did I say that diplomatically?
<Erin Burnett> <Negative> Donald doesn't like to say anything diplomatically. Of course, he was considering running for the Republican nomination and he is a Republican.
