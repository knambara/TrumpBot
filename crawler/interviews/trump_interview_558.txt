<Lou Dobbs> <Negative> USAir stock dropped 3/4. It closed at 10-1/8. USAir today agreed to take over management of Donald Trump's northeast shuttle. Trump gave up another treasure from his empire to win freedom from $ 100 million of debt. Casey Wian reports from New York.
<Casey Wian> <Negative> If the deal is done, the Trump Shuttle will have a new name, the USAir Shuttle. It would be the airline's third name in just over two years. Trump bought the shuttle from failing Eastern Airlines in 1989.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a great deal, from my standpoint, from the bank's standpoint, and from USAir's standpoint. They get a wonderful asset, the banks get their money back, and I work out fine because I get a huge reduction in debt, which is fantastic to me.
<Casey Wian> <Negative> USAir would manage the shuttle for up to 10 years with an option to buy after five. Trump's creditors, led by Citibank, would release him from $ 100 million in debt obligations. The agreement is still subject to final approval by the shuttle's creditors and USAir's management. USAir says that should happen early next year. While the deal will provide welcomed debt relief for Donald Trump's struggling empire, it may do just the opposite for USAir, which has big money problems of its own.
<Casey Wian> <Negative> Any future buy-out will require USAir to assume some of the shuttle's $ 245 million in remaining debt. USAir has lost $ 760 million since the beginning of 1990. And since late '89, its stock has dropped 80 percent closing at 10-1/8 Thursday. Earlier in the day, Standard & Poor's downgraded USAir's bonds, a move unrelated to the shuttle agreement.
<Philip Baggaley> <Positive> I don't think it changes the overall picture greatly. However, if they're able to structure a good deal, it could strengthen their position in the northeast and eventually pay some dividends.
<Casey Wian> <Positive> The shuttle, which flies from New York to Washington and New York to Boston, would add to USAir's strong presence in three of the nation's most lucrative travel markets. Casey Wian, CNN Business News, New York.
<Lou Dobbs> <Negative> Coming up next on Moneyline, the flu is sweeping the nation. It's not only contagious, it's costly. We'll tell you all about it next on Moneyline. Stay with us.
