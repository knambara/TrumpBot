<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> I met up with Mr. Trump Friday afternoon in Colorado Springs and he began the interview exuberant from his Thursday night ratings win over Hillary Clinton.
<ABC News> <Neutral> [BEGIN VIDEOTAPE]
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Let's talk about the Democratic Convention.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> So you won the ratings war in the last night. Hillary Clinton's speech...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By millions, George. By millions.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> A couple million, it's true.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Three.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> Hillary Clinton's speech -- 22 direct mentions of your name, 78 references, very tough, including this one hit on your temperament.
<ABC News> <Neutral> [BEGIN VIDEO CLIP]
<Hillary Clinton> <Neutral> A man you can bait with a Tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.
<ABC News> <Neutral> [END VIDEO CLIP]
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> She quoted Jackie Kennedy suggesting you're a little man moved by fear and pride.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's a very dishonest person. I have one of the great temperaments. I have a winning temperament. She has a bad temperament. She's weak. We need a strong temperament and that's all it is, I have a strong temperament. And...
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> But there are...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- I do know how to win.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> -- polls do show some concern about this, that -- whether you can be trusted with the nuclear codes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that's probably because Hillary, that's all they talk about is temperament. I think I have a great temperament. I beat 16 very talented people in -- and I've never done this before. You don't do that with a bad temperament.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm leading her in the polls, as you probably have noticed. And I think I have a great temperament.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have a temperament where I know how to win. She doesn't know how to win. She's not a winner. She doesn't know how to win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Honestly, she lies a lot and she really -- she should tell the truth. I honestly believe if she told the truth -- because she made some reference to my campaigning, I've had a beautiful -- I've had a -- had a flawless campaign. You'll be writing books about this campaign. And yet she's criticizing my campaign.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now, her campaign, she couldn't beat Bernie, OK?
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Well, she did beat him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, barely. And there's questions even about that. But barely. And if you look at what's going on in terms of unity, the Bernie people are angry. They're angry. He was angry.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What was amazing to me is when she was talking about Bernie last night, the camera was on him and he was angry. It almost looks like he has buyer's remorse, like he shouldn't have made the deal.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Let's talk about Russia. You made a lot of headlines with Russia this week.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> What exactly is your relationship with Vladimir Putin?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have no relationship to -- with him. I have no relationship with him.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> But if you have no relationship with Putin, then why did you say in 2013, I do have a relationship. In 2014, I spoke...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because he has said nice things about me over the years. I remember years ago, he said something -- many years ago, he said something very nice about me. I said something good about him when Larry King was on. This was a long time ago. And I said he is a tough cookie or something to that effect.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He said something nice about me. This has been going on. We did "60 Minutes" together. By the way, not together-together, meaning he was probably shot in Moscow...
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Well, he was in Moscow...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- and I was shot in New York.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> -- you were in New York. But that's the thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, just so you understand, he said very nice things about me, but I have no relationship with him. I don't -- I've never met him.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Yet you said for three years, '13, '14 and '15, that you did have a relationship with him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, look, what -- what do you call a relationship?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean he treats me...
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> I'm asking you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- with great respect. I have no relationship with Putin. I don't think I've ever met him. I never met him. I don't think I've ever met him.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> You would know if you did.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think so.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> I mean if he...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, I think so. So I've -- I don't think I've ever met him. I mean if he's in the same room or something. But I don't think so.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> You never spoke to him on the phone?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've been in Moscow. I didn't meet him in Moscow.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Where?
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> You've never spoken to him on the phone?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have never spoken to him on the phone, no. I've speak -- I've spoken -- when we had the Miss Universe contest a number of years ago, we had Miss Universe in Moscow, in the Moscow area, he was invited. He wanted to come. He wasn't able to come.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That would have been a time when I would have met him.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> But a -- I just want to clear this up, because you did say on three different occasions you had a relationship with him. Now you say there is not.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't know what it means by having a relationship. I mean he was saying very good things about me, but I don't have a relationship with him. I didn't meet him. I haven't spent time with him. I didn't have dinner with him. I didn't go hiking with him. I don't know -- and I wouldn't know him from Adam except I see his picture and I would know what he looks like.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Vice President Biden told me this week that Vladimir Putin wants to beat Hillary and Madeleine Albright said that your victory would be a gift to Putin.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> And what they're pointing to is things like your statements about conditioning our commitments to NATO allies, softening the GOP platform on Ukraine, even considering softening sanctions and recognizing Russian annexation of Crimea. They fear that that's going to hurt America and advance Russia's interests.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They only fear one thing, losing the election. If our country got along with Russia, that would be a great thing. When Putin goes out and tells everybody -- and you talk about a relationship, but he says Donald Trump is going to win and Donald Trump is a genius, and then I have people saying you should disavow. I said, I'm going to disavow that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But when Putin says good things and when we have a possibility of having a good relationship with Russia...
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> But if we have a good relationship...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- I think...
<ABC News> <Negative> [CROSSTALK]
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> -- his annexation of Crimea.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not going to be mean to anybody. George, you know me pretty well. I don't bow, OK. I don't bow.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But if we can have a good relationship with Russia and if Russia would help us get rid of ISIS, frankly, as far as I'm concerned, you're talking about tremendous amounts of money and lives and everything else, that would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Even if that means conditioning our commitments to NATO, as you said?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because you're not going to do that. NATO is going to be just fine. But NATO countries -- we have 28 countries -- many of them are taking advantage of us because they're not paying. So we're protecting these countries and they're not paying.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And when people leave that last part in, everybody agrees with me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm all in favor of NATO. I said NATO is obsolete. I was asked a question by one of your competitors and I said NATO is obsolete, because it's not taking care of terror. You understand that. And it turned out I was right. A lot of people gave me credit for that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Then, three months ago, on the front page of "The Wall Street Journal," they said NATO to develop a terror division. And somebody who's supposed to be very extraordinary was put in charge of it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That was all because of me. So I was right about that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was also right about the fact that NATO, we're being taken advantage of by NATO countries, totally advantage of (INAUDIBLE)...
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> Then why did you soften the GOP platform on Ukraine?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wasn't involved in that. Honestly, I was not involved.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Your people were.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. I was not involved in that. I'd like to -- I'd have to take a look at it. But I was not involved in that.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Do you know what they did?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They softened it, I heard, but I was not involved.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> They took away the part of the platform calling for the provision of lethal weapons to Ukraine to defend themselves.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Why is that a good idea?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, look, you know, I have my own ideas. He's not going into Ukraine, OK?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Just so you understand. He's not going to go into Ukraine, all right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You can mark it down and you can put it down, you can take it anywhere you want.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Well, he's already there, isn't he?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK, well, he's there in a certain way, but I'm not there yet. You have Obama there. And frankly, that whole part of the world is a mess under Obama, with all the strength that you're talking about and all of the power of NATO and all of this, in the meantime, he's going where -- he takes -- takes Crimea, he's sort of -- I mean...
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> But you said you might recognize that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm going to take a look at it. But, you know, the people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were. And you have to look at that, also.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, that was under -- just so you understand, that was done under Obama's administration. And as far as the Ukraine is concerned, it's a mess. And that's under the Obama's administration, with his strong ties to NATO.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So with all of these strong ties to NATO, Ukraine is a mess. Crimea has been taken. Don't blame Donald Trump for that.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> You said that...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we'll do better and yet we'll have a better relationship with Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And having a good relationship -- maybe. and having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> You said you have no investments in Russia.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> But do you owe any money to Russian individuals and institutions?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. Not.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> No?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The primary thing I did what Russia -- I bought a house in Palm Beach at a bankruptcy. It was a bankrupt, you know, person. I bought it from the banks. I bought it for about $40 million. I sold it for $100 million to a Russian.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That was probably five years ago. And that was primarily it.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> You partner now with...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now, well I sell...
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> (INAUDIBLE) Grand...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Will I sell -- many years ago. I don't think they're Russian. I think there were other people, but there were various partners.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Will I sell condos to Russians on occasion?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Probably.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean I do that. I have a lot of condos. I do that. But I have no relationship to Russia whatsoever.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> No debts?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No debts. I have very little debt to anybody. I don't need debt. You know, it's very interesting, I'm so liquid, I don't need debt. And if I need debt, if I want debt, I can get it from banks in New York City very easily.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> You know where I'm going to take this next. Americans could be assured on that if they saw your tax returns.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> My tax returns are very simple. They're under a minor audit, a routine audit, as they have been for many years. Every year I get audited.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now, I don't know if you get audited but I have friends...
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> I've been audited.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- who are very wealthy that never have been audited. I say -- you get audited. I get audited every year. I'm under a routine audited like routine. And I've been for years, every year.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Is there something...
<ABC News> <Negative> [CROSSTALK]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> George, it is very simple. Yes, but they're all linked. It's called the link.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's very simple, if my audit is finished, that's great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, I have to tell you. I watched Mitt Romney four years ago. He waited until September to give them, just before the election. They made him look so bad, it was so unfair, I actually think he didn't lose because of the 47 percent, I think he lost because of a couple of really minor items in tax return where he did nothing wrong. So it is unfair.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I will say, when I'm finished with the audit, I'll do it.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Richard Nixon released his even though his were under audit.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't use Richard Nixon as necessarily the guide, OK. I mean, you know, it's an interesting person to use, but don't use it.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Mike Bloomberg very tough on you a the Democratic convention.
<ABC News> <Neutral> [BEGIN VIDEO CLIP]
<Michael Bloomberg> <Positive> Trump says he wants to run the nation like he's running his business? God help us.
<ABC News> <Neutral> [END VIDEO CLIP]
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> Called you a con man, reckless. Even seemed...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He doesn't know me well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Michael Bloomberg, when he had a problem in Ferry Point, which is a massive job where his administration was a mess, they couldn't get it built. They called me. I took it over. I got it done in a year.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Michael Bloomberg couldn't get elected as a dogcatcher in New York.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> In the past you said he was a great mayor.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sure, he was good. But his last term was terrible. He did a terrible thing his last term. And frankly a lot of people didn't like him. He spent a fortune to get elected. Shouldn't have gone to a third term. The snow removal was a disaster. He had a problems. Michael Bloomberg had a big problem with Ferry Point in the Bronx. They called me. I made a deal. I took it over. I got it built. I got it open. It's open today. It's very successful.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And think, personally, I think he made a deal with Hillary where he gets a job, because he'd like to -- because Michael Bloomberg has wanted to run for president for probably as long as you have known him and guess what? He never had the guts to do it. And now I see this guy up on stage saying negative things. He knows nothing about me. He's never been to my office. I don't know him well.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> You played golf together.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Maybe once.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Here's what he hit you on in the speech....
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I hit the ball a lot longer, and a lot better.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> He hit you for hypocrisy in the speech. For selling products overseas, gaming the visa system to hire foreign works at low wages. And just this week BuzzFeed reported that Mar-a-Lago is putting out application for 78 more visas for foreign workers even though...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Should I tell you about it? Mara-a-Lago is a very successful club in Palm Beach, Florida, the Mar-a-Lago club, and during the season, it's very, very hard to get employees.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> The local employment agencies say they have more than 1,000 people...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We interview -- and we have a lot of people. We come with a lot of people. But it's very, very hard to get people in Palm Beach during the Palm Beach season. It's called the Palm Beach social season. And what we do is we sometimes we have to bring people in.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> As far as product, our country doesn't make product anymore. You have other countries devalue their currencies. They make it impossible. You look at suits and ties and shirts. You look at steel, you look at so many different things, it's...
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> But our country does make those products, but you don't.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very small. 3 percent of our product is made in apparel. And much of the material comes from overseas.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's very -- if you want to get a television today -- I buy thousands of television sets. If I want a television, I would love the buy American-made televisions like they used to have where they had GE and Sylvania and all of the different. Today, it's Samsung, it's LG, it's Sony. We don't make televisions anymore.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> But you're out there saying other American companies must come and create jobs here, but you're not willing to do it yourself.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is nothing new what you're saying. I talk about this during my speech. When I do ties, I bid them out. And I go all over the place. You have companies over in different countries where they devalue their currency and they make it impossible for American companies to compete.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The hat, Make America Great Again. I fought like crazy to find a company in this country that could make the hats. And I found one. And they're American-made, but it's -- because I knew the first thing people would do is, where is the hat made. OK, Make America Great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it is very, very hard for our companies to compete, because other company -- other countries -- and it's really the countries, other countries take advantage of us.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> Here are numbers of hiring of foreign workers. Since 2010, 300 U.S. applicants in Mar-a-Lago, 17 hired, more than 500 visa applications.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know what? I don't hire the people. But if you look at all the other places in Palm Beach, they're all doing exactly the same thing. And you know why they're doing that? You know why they're doing that? Because you can't get people, George.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> What do you think a voter thinks when they hear you say I can't find American workers. I can't find American workers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think the voter understand it, because they understand that -- you know, you're not reinventing the wheel here with these questions. These get asked all the time. I've been asked about Mar-a-Lago. I have many other places where I don't have to do that, because you have a normal season.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> Let's talk about debates. You can accept the recommendations of the debate commission? Three debates, one VP debate?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I tell you what I don't like, it's against two NFL games. I got a letter from the NFL saying this is ridiculous, why are the debates against -- because the NFL doesn't want to go against the debates because the debates are going to be pretty massive, from what I understand.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I don't think we should be against the NFL. I don't know how the dates were picked. I don't know why those particular dates.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> So, you don't like the dates that are out there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't like dates against -- you know, Hillary Clinton wants to be against the NFL. She doesn't maybe like she did with Bernie Sanders where they were on Saturday nights when nobody's home.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But they're against the NFL. I saw the dates. Two -- I think two of the three are against the NFL, so I'm not thrilled with that. But I like three debates. I think that's fine. I think it's enough. Somebody said one debate, I would rather have three. I think they will be very interesting.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> I don't know if you saw the speech, but there's man named Khizr Khan, speaking at the Democratic convention last night. His son, Captain Humayun Khan, was killed serving in Iraq, and he had some very tough questions for you.
<ABC News> <Neutral> [BEGIN VIDEO CLIP]
<Khizr Khan> <Positive> KHIZR KHAN, CAPT. HUMAYUN KHAN'S FATHER: Have you read the United States constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy. You have sacrificed nothing and no one.
<ABC News> <Neutral> [END VIDEO CLIP]
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> He said you wouldn't have let his son in America.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He doesn't know -- he doesn't know that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I saw him. He was, you know, very emotional. And probably looked like -- a nice guy to me. His wife, if you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably -- maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say. You tell me, but plenty of people have written that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She was extremely quiet and looked like she had nothing to say. A lot of people have said that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And personally, I watched him. I wish him the best of luck, George.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> What would you say to the father?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I would say, we have had a lot of problems with radical Islamic terrorism, that's what I'd say. We have had a lot of problems where you look at San Bernardino, you look at Orlando, you look at the World Trade Center, you look at so many different things. You look at what happened to the priest over the weekend in Paris, where his throat was cut, 85-year-old, beloved Catholic priest. You look at what happened in Nice, France, a couple of weeks ago.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say, you gotta take a look that, because something is going on, and it's not good.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> He said you have sacrificed nothing and no one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that sounds -- who wrote that? Did Hillary's script writer write it? Because everybody that went out there -- we also had John Allen, who failed with ISIS. I mean, he was a general -- General Allen -- he went out, and he's ranting and raving. And then I read a report. He was in there for a number of months, and he failed with ISIS. And he's telling me, you know.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> You saw Hillary say it last night, you don't know more than the generals.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I tell you, the generals aren't doing so well right now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, I have a feeling it may be Obama's fault. But if you look at ISIS, General MacArthur, and General Patton, they're spinning in their graves. The generals certainly aren't doing very well right now. And General Allen, after I saw he was on ranting and raving about me, who he never met, I checked up. Guess what? They were not so happy with him. He didn't beat ISIS. He didn't beat ISIS. He didn't do well with ISIS.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> How would you answer that father? What sacrifice have you made for your country?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think I have made a lot of sacrifices. I've work very, very hard. I've created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures. I've done -- I've had tremendous success.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> Those are sacrifices?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, sure. I think they're sacrifices.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think when I can employ thousands and thousands of people, take care of their education, take care of so many things. Even in the military, I mean, I was responsible along with a group of people for getting the Vietnam Memorial built in downtown Manhattan, which to this day people thank me for.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've raised millions of dollars for the vets. I'm helping the vets a lot. I think my popularity with the vets is through the roof, far greater than hers. She's done nothing, all she's done is tell everybody that the vets are in good shape. They're fine. And they're not fine. People are waiting in line for seven days to see a doctor.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> 100 days left, what's the number one thing you have to do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that I just want to continue to campaign the way I'm doing. I'm leaving here. I'm going to a speech that's packed with thousands of people. They're making, in many cases, less money now, George, than they made 18 years ago. And they're working two jobs. They're working harder. They're older. And it's unfair.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Our country's a mess. And that's why when she makes the speech, she doesn't talk about radical Islam. She doesn't talk about the problems that we have in this country and throughout the world. Many of the problems, she caused. I mean, she created ISIS with her stupidity and her lack of knowledge with her bad judgment.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, Bernie Sanders said something about Hillary Clinton that was very interesting. He said she had bad judgment, great words, bad judgment. You know what, she has bad judgment.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She has no instinct.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> Final question. Are you worried that the Democratic convention is going to bounce her ahead of you in the polls?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. I mean, look, I had a very big bounce. In fact, I think you even said it was one of the biggest bounces in 20 years. It's been a long time since somebody had a bounce like that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, I think the Republican convention was great or I wouldn't have had the bounce that I had. As you said, I had 3 million people more than she had on the final night. She had a Thursday, I had a Thursday, she had a speech, I had a speech, I had 3 million people more than she did. And I had a lot of people. There were a lot of people. I think I had 30 million. They had 27 million. I think we're going to do very well in this election.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> Mr. Trump, thanks for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<ABC News> <Neutral> [END VIDEOTAPE]
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> As we said, that was on Friday. And overnight, the Trump campaign put out a statement responding to the controversy. Here's the statement.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> Captain Humayun Khan was a hero to our country and we should honor all who have made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our country safe. While I feel deeply for the loss of his son, Mr. Khan, who has never met me, has no right to stand in front of millions of people and claim I have never read the Constitution, which is false, and say many other inaccurate things.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> Mr. Trump also put out a tweet this morning. He said that, "Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero. But this is about radical Islamic terror and the weakness of our leaders to eradicate it."
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> And one other note: the NFL has disputed a claim Mr. Trump made in the interview that the NFL wrote him a letter complaining about the presidential debate schedule.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> An NFL representative told us that was not true. And the Trump team responded to that overnight, saying that Trump was made aware of conflicting dates by a source close to the league.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> When we come back, the Khan family responds to Mr. Trump. And the four-star general Trump called a failure is here -- live.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> Well we had Matt Drudge about a month ago in studio, only does interview every 3,4- years and I thought that got me excited. But I'm telling Donald Trump is our guests ladies and gentlemen for the next 30 minutes or so. And obviously he is a maverick, he's an original, he tells it like it is. Read off a teleprompter, neither do I, he's self-made.
<Alex Jones> <Neutral> This whole media operation that reaches million people a week worldwide conservatively self-made.
<Alex Jones> <Positive> That’s why I’m so excited and he joins us from trump tower in New York City, he is the leading 2016 Republican presidential contender, Donald Trump again joins us. And I've got so many questions but first off, Donald thank you for joining us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you Alex, great to be with you.
<Alex Jones> <Neutral> I've got so many questions but you are vindicated, this has got to be the time the last six months on the radical Muslim celebrating not just in New Jersey, but New York, Palestine all over.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> What do you have to say, they're still attacking you though we've got Dan Rather on video, we've got New York Post, we've got Washington Post, we've got I mean what's going on here?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I took a lot of heat and I was very strong on it and I held my line and then all of a sudden you know hundreds of people were calling up my office. I was the other day in Sarasota Florida and people are in line we had 12000 people which is fantastic.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the people were saying, many of the people from New Jersey 4 or 5 people said Mr. Trump I saw it myself I was there
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I know what happened and I held my line and people wanted me to apologize, and we can't do that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People like you and I can't do that so easily. Now we can do it if we're wrong Alex, you apologize, I apologize if I was wrong. But they were celebrating and they were celebrating the fall of the World Trade Center. I think that's disgraceful.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> It is and that same week you were reporting on that fact we had two different international football games, soccer games. With the Turkish fans and others during the moment silence for the dead people in Paris chanting Allahu Akbar and booing. So did that not happen too?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well that happened and everybody saw it, that was a week ago. And the players were out in the field and they couldn't believe it, they were embarrassed. They didn't know what to do. The coach and the managers they all apologized. But it happened.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look we have to deal with reality. And you know it all started because they said we need surveillance, we need proper surveillance. We have people that truly are evil and they're coming from someplace and you know sort of where they're coming from at least the vicinity. And I said we need proper surveillance, whether it's a mosque or anyplace else we have to be surveilled and we have to see what's coming at us.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because we're going to have a country anymore. Between the weak boarders that we have the pathetic and weak borders where politicians are afraid to do anything about it. between all of what's happening with radical you know you look at what's going on you have a president that doesn't even want to talk about, you know the radical Muslim stuff, he doesn't want to mention the word. He doesn't want to say it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you look at what's happening where we have a president that's over there celebrating global warming and trying to get everybody excited about global warming, like that's our number one problem. He considers that to be our number one problem. And our number one problem is what's going on, they want to blow up our cities and they want to blow up our country. That’s our number one problem.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> And there are number two problem is crippled America your number one New York Times bestseller and talk about that in a few minutes. But let's continue with the number one problem and I agree with you. it's now in mainstream news Associated Press and others are reporting that it's a secret deal with turkey with the Germans, with Markel’s of the emitted socialist to bring in millions of radical Islamists, they admit almost all of them are Sunni that basically invade Syria. They’re getting their butt kicked by the Russian, so now they want to flee up to the north in the turkey, you said months ago bomb the oil of ISIS and the mainstream media laughs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I was right about that. I was right in saying in a book that I wrote you covered it really nicely I appreciate it. But I’ve wrote a very political book years ago and in the year 2000. The America we deserve.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I said that book that we better be careful with this guy named Osama Bin Laden. I mean I really studied this stuff I really find it very interesting. And even though I'm a businessman I find it, I've always, I always have been involved in politics. I said we better be careful with Osama Bin Laden.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There is a guy named Osama Bin Laden, nobody really know who he was. But he was nasty, he was saying really nasty things about our country and what he wants to do it. And I wrote in the book two thousand two years before the World Trade Center came down. I talk about Osama Bin Laden you better take them out and said he's going to crawl under a rock.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You better take them out. And now people are seeing that this thing you know Trump predicted Osama Bin Laden. Which actually is true. And then two years later year and a half later he knocked down the World Trade Center.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I talked about terrorism and that was before terrorism as we know it today. I said we'd better be careful that's going to happen. It is going to be a big thing and it certainly is a big thing. so with the oil and I'm glad you brought it up but as you know for three years I've been saying you better take out the oil because if you don't take the oil is going to be a problem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we shouldn’t have been in Iraq. But once we got there the way we came out was horrible and I said take the oil. Then we didn't take the oil, so ISIS got the oil and as you know Iran is getting the oil, because Iran is going to take over all of Iraq. You know we made one of the worst deals in the history of our world when we gave them a hundred and fifty billion dollars and virtually we gave them keys to nuclear weapons.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> Mr. Trump I hate to interrupt. You are the leading presidential frontrunner with the Republicans gaining a huge lead as you don't back down. But I got to just back you up again because the more I researched what you've actually said and done its amazing.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> You were the only leading American figure who openly said do not go to war in Iraq, they had almost what ninety percent votes in Congress for it bipartisan. You should don't do in Iran will take over. I mean look you can say that today and everybody can say that. But you said that in 2001, 2002, and 2003 when it was very unpopular.
<Alex Jones> <Positive> Because you've done your research and had good advisors. How did you know that when almost no one else did?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well first of all I'm the most militaristic person there is. I’m going to build the... if I win I’m going to make our military so strong, so powerful that nobody's going to mess with us. We’re going to take care of our events and all of that. But I have to tell, you have to know if you're going to go to war you have to do it properly and you have to know what to do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I viewed it as this Iran and Iraq where the same in terms of strength. And they have to constantly fighting. That’s what they do is they fight right. They go to war all the time and didn't move feet left feet right three left in that rest and then it started again for years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This has been going on for forever and this is the way it is. I said if you take out Iran or if you take out Iraq either one you're going to destabilize the Middle East. Well we took out Iraq and by the way Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the world. People don't even know that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we gave like... incredible. We took out Iraq, I said you going to destabilize. Well and I said and you'll know this and you know this and I appreciate what you just said. Then Iran is going to come in and Iran is going to take over Iraq and they are just taking it over right now, as we speak they're taking over.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Iran is running Iraq and very soon will be virtually going to be totally running Iraq. Especially after all of the you know the deal we just made which is the worst. So I said keep the oil and I said if you going to leave you shouldn't have got in. but they should have soldiers behind like 20000 or certain number of soldiers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But if you're going to leave take the oil and I've said it. Then they left and they didn't take the oil. So ISIS got the oil, Iran is getting oil, everybody's getting everything but us. So we lost thousands of soldiers we spent two trillion dollars in Iraq we have wounded warriors who I love all over the place and what do we get out of it out, so we had nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We had nothing.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> Now the French and the Germans are getting the oil, the Iranians are getting the oil.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know the number one customer for the oil is? Guess what china. China they outsmart us on every level militarily, they outsmart us on trade like, we're losing, and we have a 450 billion dollar trade deficit with china.
<Alex Jones> <Neutral> Let me ask you this. You are a top business guy on your own from nothing. how did china get ninety-seven percent of rare earth minerals in the world, how is the United States or nobody else even trying to get rare earth minerals. When it's what goes into smartphones, the computers trillions is made a year.
<Alex Jones> <Neutral> How do we just give them the global market? That’s crazy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well with a lot of people don't know Afghanistan. Now Afghanistan is a place we can go in. because you know you have Pakistan and you have nuclear weapons a lot of things going on. But we go into Afghanistan we're fighting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Tremendous mountains and ridges. We’re fighting on one side and you know who's got their excavators on the other side chunking all the minerals? You know Afghanistan nobody knew this. Afghanistan is rich with minerals. Not oil but minerals.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And China is taken out all the minerals. And here we are fighting. We have trillions, we have like a trillion dollars in Afghanistan and we get nothing out of it. And we're going to end up leaving and keeping a couple of thousand soldiers there and this and that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We get nothing. China is taking out the minerals. They are the buyers, the big buyers at very very low prices of as you know of the oil in Iraq and probably in Syria. But China is a big buyer of the oil.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But one thing with the oil, because you've covered it. For three years I've been saying hit the oil, because ISIS is getting stronger, didn't know JV as the president said and they're certainly not contained. But I said hit the oil and hit them hard and they laughed at me. And they would put generals on television saying know that strategy wouldn’t work.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well after Paris they started hitting the oil and it does work. The problem is we've given them a two-year edge. They have billions of dollars.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> Russian started in the oil for one month and ISIS is already rolling over. So Putin is following your strategy. You know Vladimir Putin well.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Se should have done it two years ago Alex, that's the only problem.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> Donald Trump joins us live. Can you speak to as president what your relationship would be with foreign leaders and what you know about Vladimir Putin? Because all I know is why are we starting a fight with Russia when they're not do anything to us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right well number one and just to finish on other, by the way, I say hit the upper we should keep the oil, in other words we should keep will get ExxonMobil we'll go in and we'll get other of our oil companies will get some of the great oil companies. We bid it out. we should keep the oil. You know the old days to the victor belongs the spoils, right we don't have that. We go in, we fight the war and we leave, we get nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Except we get death and we get deficit that's all we get. I think I get along great with people. I mean I will probably get along well with him and if I don't somebody else will and who knows you know he's a difficult cookie. He’s tough and he's smart.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was on the show 60 Minutes with him recently. Not together I mean, they did him and they profiled me at the same show which was, we were stable mates right. But I think I get along very well with him, I think it to find. But here's the thing we lose with every country and yet we don't get along with any countries.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> China is killing us, everybody is killing us. China is just beating us to a pulp and trade Japan, Mexico is killing us. And yet we don't get along with anybody. With me they're not going to get so rich, believe me they're not going to get so rich at all.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We’re going to take back our jobs, we are going to take back our manufacturer, and we take back our base. But they'll like us more than they do now. Sort of amazing.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> Well Donald Trump let me say this my audience, I'd say ninety percent support you. Ok and you definitely have shown your knowledge of geopolitical systems. Hilary and others have been demonizing you for saying radical Muslim celebrated on 911, but she got caught a few years ago claiming that she got shot at in Bosnia in the air on the ground, they have video of it all, none of it happened. She admits she lied.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> If you did that you'd be done. But you wouldn't do something like that. You don't steal glory from our veterans. But they demonize you for made up scandals every day trying to see what will stick and you got Hillary involved in Benghazi, you've got him involved in everything and people love you for tough talk.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> Is it not time for impeachment hearings against Obama? I mean what do we do politically to really try to prosecute Hillary Clinton?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> when you remember this, the best thing that we have going with Obama is he's got a year left ok. Because you know by the time you do the hearings and everything I don't.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> So don't make him a martyr.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well in a way you'll make him a martyr. But I don't even say that you know one of the things that I'm the most disappointed Republicans. Because they go to Washington they're going to do all this stuff, they're going to impeach Obama, they're going to end Obamacare which has to be ended. I don't know if you've seen the premiums, it going on.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> It’s killing everything.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Fifty five percent it, you know it's going to implode anyway. In 17, 2017 the Obamacare blows up it's over. I mean it's over and everybody knows it and they are doing big stories. Even the ones that were for it are saying oh this isn't working.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well the premiums are a disaster and if you look at anything having to do with Obamacare right now it's over. But the problem with the Republicans is it will try and fix it, they'll try, instead of get rid of it and we can come up with a phenomenal plan that’s much better for the people, the people are getting killed with that. So there's so many things to do Alex. We will do such a good job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There’s so many friends. A number will win a trade. We’re going to strengthen our military, we're going to take care of our vets, and we’re going to get rid of Obamacare. It is so many things, there's so many things that can be done.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we have to use our good people. You know everybody running against me in terms of even the Republican side and Hillary certainly. They’re all controlled by their donors and their special interests and lobbyists. so I'm putting up my own money, I'm funding my own campaign, nobody's going to control me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm going to do what's right for you and for the American people.
<Alex Jones> <Positive> Listen I get it, I mean you are a true maverick. I understand. You made tens of billions of dollars. You’ve hired tens of thousands of people.
<Alex Jones> <Positive> I mean I would imagine it as you've gotten older correct if I'm wrong because I know you talk about want to serve America decades ago. Really all it comes down to is one to have a free country for your children and grandchildren. And that's where I want to come to this point next. Because I know you're smart sir and I know that you also though you don't dump your message down, but you keep it a mid-level so the general public and the establishment as well can get it.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> But let's get down to brass tacks. I routinely talk to the top generals. Special Forces, Pentagon currently, out of the Pentagon, CIA as I know you do. We’ll just leave it at that.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> There are a lot of people in this government and also retired who don't want to destroy the country. They really know that we've reached the crossroads where the country's done as a third world nation within a few more years. Forget Donald Trump in four years if this happens we're done. I mean we're talking about resurrecting the dead here.
<Alex Jones> <Positive> We could turn around right now as you've said properly, you're dead on sir you're right. We could turn it around all the actuaries, all the numbers show it. But it's got to happen the next few years or we are done. and there are globalists that want to have a world government, a system run by select crony capitalists using socialism at the grassroots to make people dependent and I've talked to not just high level folks that have been in government that are on your team, but separately high level people in government currently at Sheaf there's an internal war going on.
<Alex Jones> <Positive> And that you're a manifestation of that. I won’t get anything inside baseball with you but I already know the inside baseball. I know now from top people that you actually are for real and you understand you're in danger and you understand what you're doing is epic. Its George Washington level and you understand that office.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> I want to tell you right now, can you speak about the war for the soul this country that's happening right now and really tell people what's happening and commit to people that you won't Ross pert under death threats and step down when you're in the lead two months from the election.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ok so let me just tell you Alex as you know I’m leaving in every Paul nationally in every poll state. I'm leading in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, the SEC, Texas I’m leading in Texas which I love, I love Texas. You know we were there black Cuban called up he said you want to use the arena we filled it up in three or four days 20000 people. In Mobile Alabama we had 35000 people, we had 20000 Oklahoma.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm so into this and I'm not into a fight. You know I could do other things that I would enjoy doing to be honest with you.
<Alex Jones> <Neutral> You're doing a dangerous mission we understand that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it's not an easy thing. But the key is making America great again, we can make America great again but if you have to suffer through four more or eight more years of what going on in the past and you knows what's going on, we are being eaten away. It’s just eat, it's eating away at our country and we can make in my opinion, we can make America greater than ever before. But we have to get going it has to happen, we have to get going and you know when you look at the vision, I said Iraq, you agreed with me on Iraq.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said hit the oil, I said a lot of things that turned out to be true, a hundred percent true. And I’m giving credit, I’m giving credit by some people, some people refuse to acknowledge it. You know they refuse to say.
<Alex Jones> <Positive> No you have been, you been absolutely on target. So what I'm asking is though can you speak to the cross roads we are at right now though. Because you've talked about it. Are we at a crossroads to decide, whether this country's done or whether we go to the next level.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I think this, I think that it's sadly I think that if we don't get it right this time, I think this is going to be the most important election our country has ever had. I mean you have to say George Washington was is right there. You know the couple of pretty important elections. Right but this is certainly in the last, in the modern era, this is the most important election our country's ever had.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If we don't get it right, if we put another one of these people and like Hillary, I mean she's so corrupt, she's so corrupt and she shouldn't even be allowed to run and frankly her greatest legacy she was a horrible Secretary of State. If she's runs I think her greatest legacy will be that she got out of the email scandal. That’s what I think. It will be one of the greatest jobs I've ever seen of getting out of a scandal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because General Petraeus and many others I mean their lives have been destroyed for doing five percent of what she did.
<Alex Jones> <Positive> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She shouldn't be allowed to run. but you know the recent Fox fault that just came down two days ago has been beating her head to head which is very interesting and very good and beating her soundly head-to-head. But we have to get it right. Our country can be absolutely, we can turn it around.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> but I would agree with you if we don't get it right this time I'm not sure if you go another four or eight years with the insanity and the stupidity of these leaders, I'm not sure you're going to be able to turn it around anymore. I think it could be over.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> Donald trump the man in the arena his new book, we're talking about the moment is exposing the fact that everything is sabotage by design, specifically I don't want to bring up the tractors. And it's a question I had early on that I did more research and I understand that you really do want to save this country where your children and grandchildren live. But let's expand on this. There are certain pundits out there saying you played golf with bill Clinton and so you know you had to do business in New York, so you said nice things about Hillary.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> I get keeping your enemies closer when you're not in politics I get it, I understand. I think that's what you did. But tell us specifically and I don't think this now. I've seen it, I know you're for real.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> You wouldn't be saying the things you're doing. They’re scared of you, the whole system coming on against you. But promised us that you're not going to drop out at the key moment keeping all the other Republicans out of you and then Hillary races to the head or Jeb Bush does. Because as you know folks are claiming you are a Clinton operative.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know I've never heard that. I heard it actually few months ago. But I've hit her harder than anybody 10x if you look at that. I was a businessman.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I've only been a politician for five months. I hate to use the term because you know it's all talk, but I just been doing this for a very short period of time. I was an establishment. You know I was like a guy like you would say Trump is total establishment and I was a big donor to a lot of different Republicans.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But over the years I give it to Democrats, I've given to Republican, I've given everybody. Because I had an obligation. I was a businessman. One of the magazine's recently called me a world-class business’ the truth is I did it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I built an unbelievable company, a tremendous assets, tremendous not only that iconic assets, very little debt, tremendous cash flow, it's a great company. And by the way people now see how well when I did the filing. Everyone said never file, never file. It’s almost a hundred pages long and it's an unbelievable company.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I built, which by the way the reason I say that, that's the kind of thinking our country needs. But I get along great with Clinton. I get along great with Harry Reid, I get along great with everybody. Because when I needed them I didn't want to have argument, I didn’t want to have somebody say what Clinton doesn't want that.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> Sure you are not a loser you don't get in mindless fight. You move forward with your agenda. But now you see America in trouble and you are, hey that's all sideline now. Donald Trump's not work for Donald Trump.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> He wants to work for America.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah as a businessman you could have even function if you don't get along with this people. For example in New York City its ninety-five percent Democrat. I mean if I didn't get along with the Democrats I wouldn't have one building.
<Alex Jones> <Positive> I'll tell you, I mean you didn't want the vice president you know position has come out decades ago behind the scenes. I know you're a Republican. What about libertarianism? What’s your view of libertarianism and then I want to ask you who's your favorite president and who do you think you're running mate might be. Folks think its Ted Cruz.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I think that libertarianism sort of interesting. There are certain things that I really like about it. But you know that keeping government out as much as possible. We need government for protection, we have to protect.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When you look at these maniacs in the Middle East that want to destroy us and you know the problem we have today Alex is the weaponry. If this were a hundred years ago I’d say forget about them, let them keep fighting. They have been fighting all their lives, let them keep fighting each other who cares. But the weaponry is so powerful and they hate us so much that we have to now protect.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So that's a big part of government. So there is a certain common sense to certain elements and I did very well with the Libertarians frankly. You know because they sort of get it and they get me. But we need a bigger strength that I think the Libertarians really want and we need it and we have to have it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to have it. If we don't have it we're not going to have a country. If we don't have borders we're not going to have a country. As far as running mate it's too soon to say, I actually respect a couple of people that are on the stage.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Some of have absolutely no respect for their, I mean I think they are not very good at all at what they do. You look at what's going on. But I have respect for a number of people that are on the stage with me. I have respect for a lot of people that are throughout this country, you know political people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I pick somebody I think that can really be a great vice president, ultimately has to be a great president. Because that's you know ninety percent of that function is you know if something bad happens you got to be a good president. You have to view it from that standpoint and my favorite president in the more or less modern era would be Ronald Reagan. I've always liked him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And by the way he was a Democrat. Lot of people don't know. A liberal Democrat Alex as you know. And he became a somewhat conservative.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I wouldn’t say the most conservative. But of somewhat conservative republican.
<Alex Jones> <Neutral> But he wanted to make America great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he really did. He wanted to make it. He had actually let's make America great that was his and mine is make America great again. So there's a little bit of a difference.
<Alex Jones> <Positive> My son you finally sold me on being a bigger supporter of yours. I mean I liked you, love America, you're pure Americana. I'm still you know was, but my third year old son is really smart, he has done a lot of research. He watches all the debate.
<Alex Jones> <Positive> He just really loves you. He is on cloud nine that you're here Rex Jones and it was his question, you know which president was your favorite. But all time, all time who is your favorite?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well all time I'd say Ronald Reagan shorter term. I would say well you know you look at Lincoln, you look at Washington. You have to go with, they are the classics. Right Alex you know you think in terms of the great classics, you have to go with the Lincoln's and the Washington's.
<Alex Jones> <Positive> I agree, he was a man's man George Washington was a badass.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah that's what they say. I mean that's what they said. He said they say he never told a lie. Let’s hope that's true okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But George Washington was pretty good. Look we had some great president. So we had some good president's on the other side too in all fairness. But we will hopefully be right at the top of that list.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We’re going to make the country so strong and we're going to make it financially secure. We can’t owe 21 trillion dollars because it's going to be that,
<Alex Jones> <Negative> My final question what type of an elite once a Coward Piven bankrupt the country so socialist can run it and us all get handouts. What type of an elite is that? You’ve been around these people, are they mentally ill Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well we have to make our country rich again. you know the other day I said to a woman she came up to Mr. Trump, at big rally where we had 14000 people and at the end she just sees me signing autographs and stuff and she said Mr. Trump I vote for you hundred percent but are you this whole concept of making a rich, it sounds so Chris.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said you know what it might sound crass. But if we don't make our nation rich again, we don't take back our jobs from all these other countries that are ripping us and if we don't take back our money and we don't you know balance up our budget at least get it damn close and soon we're not going to have a nation anymore.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> We are a third world country. Donald Trump, you know I know you've got to go. 60 seconds break. I want to come back for just three minutes.
<Alex Jones> <Positive> Talk about your book and your big rally in Virginia tonight. We will be back in 70, seconds Donald Trump powerful interview.
<Commercial> <Negative> [Commercial]
<Alex Jones> <Positive> You got to want be on the top. You got to want to be free or you're going to be slaves. Donald Trump agreed to stay a few more minutes with us. And he brought up you know somebody that he wanted to thank in air, I want to thank on air.
<Alex Jones> <Positive> He came in here a month ago. He’s been on all these big shows. Just an incredible guy, I was aware of who he was. A patriot fighting communism all over the world.
<Alex Jones> <Positive> Tell us Mr. Trump about Mr. Stone who helped get this interview I set up. Well Roger is a good guy and he is a patriot and believe strongly in that strong nation.
<Alex Jones> <Neutral> A lot of the things that I believe in and you know I see him all over television. People like Roger. He is a tough cookie, I will tell you that. But people like him.
<Alex Jones> <Positive> But he's been so loyal and so wonderful and he's the one who really want me to do this interview and I'm doing it and so we appreciate it Roger.
<Alex Jones> <Positive> I knew he was. But then I did more research on this guy literally fought communist all the world. Ran big elections against the Soviet Union, in Latin America and Africa and Asia. I mean and I know he's been friends with you for a long time and advising you so, I get my respect level one up even more knowing that you're talking to real political operatives, not fake punts that are on TV.
<Alex Jones> <Positive> And that brings me a mainstream media. I love the fact when I first saw it a few days ago, they misrepresented. they said Trump wants five million dollars and I read deeper you should give million dollars for wounded warriors before I go make CNN fifty million, that's what you make these shows.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know they took that [27:59 inaudible] I said give 5 million I’m going to want five million dollars, we're going to give to the wounded warriors or the vets right, which is the same thing as far as I'm concerned. We split it up. Because they're making a fortune on these debates which never had anybody. You know Fox had 25 million people that used to get like million and CNN had the biggest ratings in the history of CNN and I won’t take full credit but I’ll take 99.9% credit.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I said give me five million dollars I want to give it to the wounded warriors, I want to give it to the vets. and but a lot of people said Trump wants five million dollars and I said it right in the same sentence Alex, I didn't say it like that.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> That’s how they deceive.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said I want five million dollars that will go to the wounded warriors. And they would play it. They even took the tape. You know the tape is worse independent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They can cut it. So they say give me five million dollars and then they cut it. Nobody knows what am I doing I’m asking for money to be on a debate. It’s ridiculous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No I wanted five million dollars to go to the wounded warriors in particular and let's see what happens, I don't know. You know the one problem Alex, if I didn't go to the debate then you know what would happen. They’d say he's chicken. I mean I think I won every debate.
<Alex Jones> <Positive> But it’s true. I mean I saw one channel made like million dollars off your being on there. They should give all of it to the vets.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well they should give a lot more than 5 I’ll tell you right now. but you know the problem is if I say I won't do it then the people that I’m debating who frankly been very easy, if you want to know the truth.
<Alex Jones> <Neutral> You could just correct it once you are on stage.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well the people I am debating, they'll say he's chicken, he's chicken, and he’s chicken. You know that's the problem with that. But it's hard when you leaving all the polls and then you don't show up to a debate and then they'll be doing numbers on you. But I would love to see money go to the wounded warriors.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's, it would be great.
<Alex Jones> <Positive> I agree. What about crippled America. It’s a number one, you got a big rally tonight. Everywhere you go you're crowd just get bigger.
<Alex Jones> <Negative> I mean obviously you're probably going to get the Republican nomination now. Wow and you're ready for the dirty tricks. One minute left Donald Trump what you have to say about your book and what's coming up.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well first of all before the book you mentioned one thing I've never heard that. But I am in this to win it. I am not in this to say oh gee have done a really good job. A reporter called up, a very powerful reporter said how does it feel? How does it feel? I said it only feels.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because they said what we've done has never been done before politically. You know I've been in the pole for five months since it came out, I'm number one. I said it's only good if we win. If I don't win I've wasted a lot of time, that's the way I view it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He said no no you haven't, you haven't. I said believe me, if I don't win, because we can't do anything to make our country great. I’ll be watching television some place it will be forget it. So I wrote a book called Crippled America. it's doing fantastic business, I don't know if you can see that thing right up [30:32 inaudible] but it's doing great business.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hope your audience goes out buy it as Christmas gifts and everything else. And I just want to finish by saying your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed I hope and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you'll be looking at me in a year, in a year or two years. Let’s give me a little bit of a time to run things. But a year into office you'll be saying wow I remember that interview, he said he was going to do it and he did a great job. You’ll be very proud of our country.
<Alex Jones> <Positive> Well I'm impressed I mean you're saying you're fully committed you know there's no future if we don't take this country back. Donald Trump I hope you can help uncrippled America. Thank you so much sir. That you will be attacked for coming on, we know you know that thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
