<Howard Stern> <Positive> And I guess it's like kind of like cut off the blood supply to the brain.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No, no, no. It's severed an artery when she -- that violent move broke the artery.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Couldn't they fix it.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> They didn't know that it. Because it's in her neck, not in her head.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They didn't know about it because where was she in the hospital? What -- what -- what state is she in?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Ohio. That's why.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You got an injury and you're in a hospital in Ohio.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You might as well be in a hospital in India.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Good doctors like good newscasters, they go to the best markets.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You tell me who is a great doctor.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well wait a minute. It isn't easy to find a head injury -- like you're looking with a puck hit. Not in her neck necessarily.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> Check everything.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Doctors in New York check everything. What is it John.
<John Melendez> <Positive> Yeah, Howard. Donald Trump is on the on the phone.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Howard
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How are you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How are you?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> By the way, Donald Trump called me the day after we started talking about having a Stuttering John-Cabbie fight.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He did.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And he said to me, he go, you want this fight to happen? I'll make it happen at my Trump Taj Mahal. I said, you are beautiful, this is great. And then I said to Tom, hey let's do business with Donald Trump he wants to have it at the Taj Mahal, the big fight.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And what happened?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well that was the last I heard I said, just do me a favor, Tom. Don't mess up my relationship with Donald Trump.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You hook the two of them up.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And I'm sure he's screwing it up.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Tom's going to be a great businessman. No,Tom sent me like a proposal for about a half a million dollars and this and that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Half a million dollars?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But by the time I finished reading the proposal I said, boy this is going to be -- let's hire Mike Tyson I think it might be cheaper.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know, I got to tell you something. I knew this was gonna happen. I talked to Donald Trump I said, I just need a place to hold this. I got to raise a hundred grand to pay off John and we're done.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will do that with you. I'll do the $100,000 for John. But you know, Actually what happened, and first of all, it's very bad news about Pam Anderson that is really bad.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Wait minute does she look hot to you?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Would you do her still now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I'm sorry.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No way. Me neither.
<John Melendez> <Neutral> That's the way to go, man.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Wait a minute Donald I got to ask you if it was Pam Anderson and Whoopi Goldberg who do you do.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Whoopi.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, right now I have to go with Whoopi.
<John Melendez> <Neutral> And Robin, that's Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a terrible thing. It's a sad -- You know, it's a terrible thing but what?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> All right. Wait a minute if it's Rosie O'Donnell and Pam Anderson who do you do?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Rosie O'Donnell.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know you have to go for life.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You have to go for life. [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You're doing Rosie O'Donnell?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm still having a good time with life. I want to live.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. And yeah, you're having a nice life. But the thing is what is the story on this Hepatitis C, how do you get it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I was watching something last night because you know one thing she has made people aware of what this is all about and it sounds to me like it's just a disaster. It is dormant in the body and then one day when it comes out you're liver goes and you either die or get a transplant and then it attacks your transplant.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it's not like a great thing to have.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It never goes away.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And there's really no cure.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> We've got to get it through blood transmission.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I get it somehow, but it's like a disaster.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So if you bang a chick without a rubber you can get it.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I think you can get it in a lot of different ways but you can get it that way.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> So is Kid Rock freaking out now?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you think Kid Rock doing right now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very nervous rocker.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You do. Have you spoken with him because you obviously know all the famous people?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know a lot of people but I haven't spoken to him and I haven't exactly brought up the subject.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But wait a minute. What if -- All right. You're in -- You almost wound up there, Howard you were trying.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I was trying to get -- I --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Did you get lucky you got one, Howard?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I did for one scotch [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Suppose you have gotten all the way there on one night thing,, you two were just out having a good time. And then you read this in the paper today.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you do?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What do you do?
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> That's like when Magic Johnson announced he had AIDS there's got to be thousands of women all over the country going to the doctor.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right. [Inaudible] You know what I would do? I wouldn't go to the doctor. I would just like, I would just be in full denial. The hell I mean I.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It will never happen.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How do you know it?
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> You don't it. Ralph would give you a slimmer. You know what I mean, he'll do it in a second for you.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He better. Now, let's get back to the fight. So, I know what's going to happen Tom is dealing with Donald Trump and he's going to ruin my relationship with Donald Trump.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> How has it been for you Donald, talking to Tom?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well he's a good businessman. You're well represented.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No. I know but he's not representing me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I didn't have time to read the entire proposal it was so long but it was -- it was great. And you know I respect Tom for trying, but you know, I don't want to have the Tyson fight right now.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> Hey, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know what Donald let me tell you something. Here's my -- here's my problem. All I did was go on the -- I got two guys want a box, they go, hey this a good radio bet.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> We want to make it happen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I agree.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> If I did the radio bet right here in the studio Tom wouldn't be involved. I just need to go somewhere. When I say I need to go somewhere,Tom gets involved. I should take him out of the whole thing. Just do my radio show from the Taj Mahal tomorrow with Donald. We go there we charge what $200 bucks a seat that's $100 grand for -- for John and then we have the fight and it's over.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know I've had it in Atlantic City. Howard, in Atlantic City I've had all the big fights. I've had, you know the biggest ones, I've had Tyson-Spanx. I've had a lot of the really big ones and the most recent ones. And when negotiating to some very big ones The Taj Mahal finished number one in Atlantic City this year or last year. And you know it's been doing great. And I heard this the other day because I do listen and I heard it I said that's a great idea. So I called up Howard and I said, Howard I'd do whatever you need, you know. And then I got this proposal for like, unbelievable. But, and Howard there is no -- it will not destroy our relationship but I will put up $100,000 for John and I agree with you I think John's going to be pretty tough. H Well, I think John has got a certain craze in his eyes. I watched that on television where he went after A. J. Yes. And I think -- I think there's a certain craziness about John that's very interesting.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You haven't seen Crazy Cabbie, come on.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> There's another thing look there too.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Donald's [Inaudible] a little nice at a time [Inaudible] is he crazy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's got a crazed look when he gets angry. And I've seen that before in people and o pretty effective look.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Let me tell you something Donald. You have been nice enough to offer the Trump Taj Mahal to this fight. I don't -- listen --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> It would be a great idea to go to Atlantic City.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You'l have a great time.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Once you get involved Tom it's going to turn into a whole big rigamarole. All I want to do is go watch the fight and broadcast from there.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> And have some people around that have a good time with them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We'll have a lot of fun. We have an arena that seats 5,000 people haven't packed.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I've got to tell you something --
<John Melendez> <Positive> That would be great.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I don't think it's going to happen.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Not at Trump Taj. I think we're going to have to do it right here in the studio. I'll build a ring. That's easiest way for me to get it done.
<John Melendez> <Positive> The TaJ is a great place man.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What can I do. I'm dealing with Tom.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> We've got this albatross called Tom.
<John Melendez> <Positive> Howard. Five thousand fans and it be an incredible party.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know John came down this summer with his friends and he was an act at Trump Marina and he did great. I mean, he sold out the place. It was it was really fantastic. I mean everybody's still talking about it. But I think the fight it could have been on it. I love the fights and I think it could maybe be more interesting.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Donald was so impressed with the Stuttering John that he wound up having breakfast.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. We had brunch.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Actually, [Inaudible]. I met his wife was lovely and it was a lot of fun.
<John Melendez> <Neutral> Your girlfriend is quite a hottie
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what, you did a great job the night before. I mean the place was totally packed. I mean you couldn't get it. It was totally sold out and his whole group did a great job.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I can't believe you had breakfast with stuttering John.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Amazing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well that's only because I didn't go to his performance that night.
<John Melendez> <Negative> That's got to be a low point though.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That beautiful girlfriend of yours, I mean,
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He's sticking with her.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You're sticking with -- I never though -- I never thought of it. You know why? Because you didn't marry her.
<John Melendez> <Neutral> What if he got hepatitis C, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Melania.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Melania.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Can I hear a great story about John and Donald Trump. They go back a long way because Don has been a big fan of John since the Channel 9 show. And we were on Channel 9 John was down at one of Mr. Trump's properties. And Mr. Trump said, you know what John? Everything is on me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So now when everything on you, do you go and go crazy spending?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No. He will be gentleman. [Inaudible]
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> John ordered, he wanted his and her massages for him and his girlfriend. I think he took the robes. I know he order champagne.
<John Melendez> <Negative> I didn't take the robes. I hate champagne. Gary's a fabrication.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> Did you order his or her massages.
<John Melendez> <Neutral> I don't. I got a massage and that's it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Liar. [Inaudible]
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> You we're telling me --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Was this the reason Donald --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> When Donald Trump had a slump it was Stuttering John compensates himself in the hotel.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> John's a drink he went to the mini bar. Maybe you tell him. You got a lot of things.
<John Melendez> <Neutral> I'd probably drink beer than [Inaudible] But, by the way, Donald.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> You ordered some nice dinner up to your room.
<John Melendez> <Neutral> I probably drink some beer in the mini bar.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> A battle's goes on for every Trump card key.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. What else do you put on there.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> What do you do when you don't date her anymore?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Hey, those things change all the time.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Please. Donald, you think you'll stick on this one?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. She is a great girl. We've had a very good relationship, two and a half years.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Can't believe it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. She's been good. Well, listen. Are we doing this fight?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm going to go talk to Tommy after I speak to you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Can you speak to Tom and let me know.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> All right. It's very hard for me to speak with him, I need an interpreter.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Taj is number one in Atlantic City that's where to do it. And we have the arena we have everything set up. It's all ready. I'm going to get to work on it. Okay, Howard thanks to have fun.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That is Mr. Donald Trump worth a billion dollars conservatively.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I don't know billion.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Just sold the Empire State Building for $54 million.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But he has to split that with his investors.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> Did he even own it?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He owned the land.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Cause that would've been brilliant.
<John Melendez> <Neutral> You know the wildest thing is you know you predicted this would happen.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I told you it would never happen. I said Tom will ruin my relationship with Donald Trump.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Certainly made you look stupid. Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Donald called me and -- Listen I'll do it at my place and you need a place to hold it will be fun. And you know, I'll come up with $100 grand. Oh, great, thank you Donald. I'll tell Tom we'll get it all right. I really didn't need Tom involved but I have to go through my --
<John Melendez> <Negative> What's the big problem why can't they Just get you out.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Because you hear Tom, you need to have half a million dollars.
<John Melendez> <Neutral> For wha?.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> What does he want to come up with the idea. He didn't come up with anything.
<John Melendez> <Positive> He's not fighting but he's getting to go $500,000 with any fighting buddies.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yeah. He should get in the ring and fight, If he wants $500,000.
<John Melendez> <Negative> I would fight -- I would fight $500,000.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, John.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> You ever expect to ever see a race again.
<John Melendez> <Positive> Like I'm getting a man.
