<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I just got back from Michigan where we are like doing incredibly well with the car plants moving and everything else. The factory is being built all over the place. And now it just landed in Iowa. I got to watch a little bit. It's very boring to watch, I have to say that. It's very boring. I call it the impeachment hoax, and that's what it is. It's a hoax.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It should have never taken place, should have never been allowed to happen. But I have great confidence in Republican senators and probably some Democrats from what I understand, Peter.
<Peter Doocy> <Negative> Any concern because not many presidents have been in this position, impeached by the House, a potential vote for removal in the Senate. Any concern about --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I shouldn't be in this position either because we've done more than any other president in the first three years, you know that, everybody knows that. Most importantly, your father knows that, right? As he watches, he's a great guy. But we've done a lot with tax cuts and regulation cuts and the military, rebuilding it, and terrorism and we got rid of 100% of the ISIS caliphate, and we could go on forever.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody's done what we've done. And it's a ridiculous horrible partisan situation. We won 196 to nothing in the house. This was not supposed to happen. But I have great confidence in the Republicans and the Republican Senate and I know they're going to be fair.
<Peter Doocy> <Positive> The Democrats that we hear here in Iowa are talking about impeachment like it is something that is going to stain you forever, whereas your defenders say it's going to fire up the base and help with re-election. Which is it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well the polls came out today, you see I'm leading everybody, and in Iowa I'm leading them by a lot. Every single Democrat I'm leading them by a lot. I gave them ethanol and we did a lot of other things including biofuels. But most importantly, the farmers I gave them the USMCA, I gave him the China deal and I was doing better than they've ever done and now they're going to really start to do well because of the new trade deals that we have that were horrible that were just left alone by President Obama and Biden, they were horrible deals and now the farmers are gonna do fantastically well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I say they have to go out by bigger tractors and more land because I don't even know if they're going to be able to create that kind of -- that kind of -- that amount of product. But we'll see what happens. But I think we're doing very well in Iowa. You saw the polls I'm beating every single one of them.
<Peter Doocy> <Positive> There are some polls that Joe Biden likes to look at, I know, where he says, "I'm the one."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're old polls. Any polls that he's leading and they're old -- What's happened, you look at the new Gallup poll today just came out. We're beating them all, and Joe's going down. I guess Bernie is surging. It's a very interesting -- You know, I'm here at this time and they're all going crazy over there but we have a rally that's thousands of people outside they can't get in, so it's going to be something.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it seems that Bernie is surging. I don't know who is going to win it.
<Peter Doocy> <Negative> You mentioned Bernie Sanders. His whole campaign in the final days is warning Democrats. President Trump is going to take away your Social Security because of something you said in Davos. Is there anything to that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm the one that saved it. The Democrats wanted to do it last time. I've been here for years and I haven't touched it except making everything stronger, making our country stronger our country being strong is what saving Social Security. So I'm not touching Social Security. They're the ones that are going to destroy it with his crazy plan.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're going to destroy everything not only Social Security. They're going to destroy health care. They're going to take away health care from 180 million people. It's going to be like a catastrophe. Now, I'm the one that saved the Social Security and every year it becomes stronger because our economy is so good and now that the trade deals are kicking in, the growth will be incredible.
<Peter Doocy> <Negative> Speaking of health care, coronavirus, how concerned are you and do you believe what China is telling us about how bad it is?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well what I'm doing is we're dealing very closely with China. We'll be making certain announcements over the next 24 hours and 48 hours and we are in great shape. China is not in great shape right now. unfortunately, but they're working very hard. We'll see what happens. But we're working very closely with China and other countries.
<Peter Doocy> <Negative> Elizabeth Warren this week was trying to maybe play some blame with you and say if there weren't for some budget cuts we wouldn't have an outbreak like this. What do you say to that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well she's lucky, she's Pocahontas for a reason. I mean she's a disaster. She wants to have something where she takes away free speech and she's the one that really violates it more than anybody when you look at all the yards that she's told. She's failing. She's failing in the polls, whether it's Biden or Bernie or somebody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not going to be Elizabeth Warren and too many yarns.
<Peter Doocy> <Positive> And just a really quick one. Michael Bloomberg was asked if the country wanted a race between two New York billionaires and his response to that was, "Who's the other one?" Do you think he's trying to get under your skin.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I mean, he's mini Mike. He was very -- he did a poor job in the last -- his last time he was terrible.
<Peter Doocy> <Negative> Frankly under your skin?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No. Who gets under my skin? You know how many times I've been asked that question? Like everybody that runs they say, "Is it true that he's under your skin?" Michael's doing very poorly. You look at his poll numbers, he's spending a lot of money. And what can I say? He's doing poorly. I think they're all doing poorly because according to every poll, I'm leading every one of them by a lot.
<Peter Doocy> <Positive> Last one. Super Bowl pick. Chiefs or 49ers?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I love them both, let's just say. But I will tell you some, two -- two very interesting teams, some interesting players, some really great players and it's going to be hopefully a great Super Bowl.
<Peter Doocy> <Negative> So no pick.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd rather not do that. I'd better not. I do have a feeling as to who's going to win but I'm not going to say it.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> So, Mr. President, thank you very much for doing this interview for millions of people around the country and the world on radio. I think this is your first extensive radio interview. Do you feel like FDR? Because he used radio to get his message across.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he did indeed and he used it well, a little bit different time, we have a little -- few more options, Bill. A few more options today, which I like and social media has been very dominant, and it's certainly been a very good thing for me because the press is so dishonest, just unbelievable. So, with social media, I can go around the corrupt media.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> In hindsight, if you had to do the phone call with the Ukraine President again, would you mention Joe Biden?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I was mentioned just -- very unimportantly, and as you know, Joe Biden's son became rich, as soon as, Joe Biden became Vice President, and in my way of thinking, that's totally corrupt. And the press, this is what I talk about, the media, they don't want to cover it. Every Republican is shaking their head.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They can't believe it. I have the highest rating ever in the history of the Republican Party, 95% approval. Ronald Reagan was at 87%, he was second. They see what I'm saying. Joe Biden, it was -- it's criminal what they've done, and frankly, that they get away with it is amazing. The son who was -- who didn't have a job, who got thrown out of the Navy, who was really down and out, all of a sudden, is making millions and millions and millions of dollars working with Ukraine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He had no knowledge of energy. He was working with an energy company, as you know, has no knowledge of energy, and they were paying him, I guess many people say, $168,000 a month, it varies, but we know it's very high, millions of dollars. Then he goes to China, picks up $1.5 billion for a fund, which is tens of millions of dollars a year in fees and other things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And now, other countries are coming to light. It's a payoff. It's absolutely a payoff. No, the call was a perfect call. I had your friend, Mark Levin go do a whole show on it. I had Gregg Jarrett. I didn't have -- they did it. I just happened to see it. I had Gregg Jarrett analyze it. There was nothing said wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was a very, very nice call.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> So your intent --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we have to look for corruption, Bill, we have to look for corruption. I mean, we're sending them tremendous amounts of money. We don't want to be sending it for corrupt purposes. And the other thing that bothers me is why isn't France and Germany, and you know, NATO, you could say, why aren't these other countries and institutions, why aren't they paying some of the money?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why is it always this sucker, United States? And that's probably millions all the time --
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Were you surprised that the narrative being put out by the Democratic Party and the press right now, is all about you trying to hurt Biden for personal gain? That's the narrative they're putting out. That's why you have the impeachment inquiry.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's a false narrative and it's shocking, except that they're corrupt. The media is a part of the Democrat Party, essentially, and the media is very corrupt. Not all of it, I know some great journalists and some good, honorable folks. But generally speaking, you read these stories in The New York Times or The Washington Post, it has nothing to do with those hearings, and you see what's happening with the polls, way down, the concept of impeaching the President are way down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They've taken a dive since the hearings, and the hearings were rigged. Adam Schiff wouldn't give us lawyers. He wouldn't give us witnesses. We can't talk to the whistleblower, who is a fake whistleblower. We have to talk to Adam Schiff. Why did Adam Schiff make up what I said? He went before Congress and read a statement about what I said, but it wasn't what I said.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He made it up, 100% made it up.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> He was mocking you. Right. What was Rudy Giuliani --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, he wasn't mocking me, Bill. Bill, he wasn't mocking me. He was trying to get them to believe I said what he made up and it was horrible what he said. That's why I released the transcript.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Yeah. He said -- I don't really care what he says, but what was Rudy Giuliani doing in Ukraine on your behalf?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you have to ask that to Rudy. But Rudy, I don't, I don't even know. I know he was going to go to Ukraine, and I think, he canceled a trip. But, you know, Rudy has other clients other than me. I'm one person --
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> So, you didn't direct him to go there on your behalf?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, but -- but you have to understand, Rudy is a great corruption fighter. He's one of the greatest in the last 50 years. He was the greatest Mayor in the history of the city of New York, by far, much better than Bloomberg. I mean, Bloomberg when he took it over, the crime was in great shape. I mean, Rudy did a great job as Mayor.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know, when you think, I mean, he has to look, I mean, he felt, he felt personally insulted by what happened during my campaign because there were a lot of bad things happening, and you know that better than anybody else. A lot of really bad things were happening during my campaign. In a way, it's a miracle that I won because with all of those horrible things with the media against, with the dishonesty, the tremendous dishonesty.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Then you hear about Google and Facebook and Twitter, everybody against, and we won. And really, I guess, you could say it was a landslide in the Electoral College, and it's a pretty big victory.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> So, Rudy Giuliani, he's your personal lawyer. Giuliani's your personal lawyer.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> So, you didn't direct him to go to Ukraine to do anything or put any heat on them?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I didn't direct him but he's a warrior, Rudy's a warrior. Rudy went, he possibly saw something. But you have to understand, Rudy has other people that he represents. He has --
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> No, I know, he has a big firm that does that work.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he's done work in Ukraine for years. You know, I've just absolutely done a lot of -- he's done a lot of work in Ukraine over the years, and I think, I mean that's what I heard. And I might have even read that someplace, but he's a good man and he's an honorable guy, and he's a great crime fighter, corruption fighter.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> OK. Why --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Probably the best in 50 years and when he saw it, when he saw what, you know, he was very much involved in this fake, phony Mueller report that took two years, and he saw what happened and he was aggrieved by it, as was I and as was everybody else who was involved. It was a disgrace.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> We'll be right back with more of my exclusive interview with President Donald Trump. Please stay tuned. [Commercial Break] Welcome back, Bill O'Reilly here and I'm joined once again by the President of the United States. So, Mr. President, I tell my audience that the only time I've really seen you show emotion to me was when I interviewed you about the Robert Mueller report right after it came out.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> I don't know whether you remember, but it was last June for the United States of Trump, the book that I wrote on you. And you showed emotion, and it's the last chapter of the book. So, you were -- were you relieved when it came out? Were you angry? What was your feeling when Mueller finally said, we don't really have anything on the President?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I knew I did nothing wrong, just like Hillary Clinton the other day said that Tulsi Gabbard and that Jill Stein, the Green Party, that they're agents of Russia. OK. Well, that's the same thing they said about me and it was just as fake. Now, I know, I don't know those two people, but I know they have nothing to do with Russia, OK.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But with me, it took me two years to get out of that. It's a disgrace. Now, well, I hope I didn't show emotion because I don't like to show too much emotion, I will be honest.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> No, but you did. No, it's not a bad thing to show emotion. I mean, you were -- any human being would have.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We went through two years of a witch hunt like nobody's ever gone through.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I won and there was no collusion whatsoever, and there were thousands of subpoenas and hundreds of interviews, and you know, you say who knows what they're going to say? People could lie. People could, who knows what's going to happen and it came out, no collusion. After all of that work, it came out, no collusion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And there were a few people, there were a few people --
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Did any of the press apologize to you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody apologized.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Did none of the press said, hey, because you were convicted in The New York Times, Washington Post, and the cable nets, they convicted you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, they don't apologize. They're bad people.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Nobody said, hey, I'm sorry we got it wrong. Not one person?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nope, not one person said it and Mueller didn't say it. His bunch of 13 angry Democrats never said it. It went to 18, by the way, as you know. But they never said it. The Washington Post never apologized to me for false reporting for years. The New York Times didn't apologize.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> That's amazing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody apologized. CNN, I mean, CNN, they had --
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Well, they're making money hating you, you know that. They make money hating you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, I know, but nobody apologized, it's a very good -- well, I hadn't thought of it that way. I guess, they're so bad and so evil, I never expected to have an apology.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Well, if I get it wrong, I apologize. I don't think I've ever got it wrong with you, but you know, if I get it wrong, I apologize. What about John Bolton?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, we've done a lot of work together.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Yeah. What about John Bolton? Why did he leave your administration?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I got along with John, I always did but he was having a little difficulty with some of the other folks. And it was time, it was not a big deal, I didn't think and I've always liked him. He's a tough guy. He's, you know, has a tough attitude on the world and I do too, frankly. Maybe I would be a little bit, a little bit longer in terms of to accepting, I could wait a little bit longer, and maybe, I'm more severe than he is. I mean, it's you know, but John, I've always liked him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've always gotten along and he's had a couple of people in there, one in particular who I really liked, who worked very closely with him, and you know, we very much are of the same thing. Other than sometimes, he'd want to go a little bit faster and do it faster than me.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> But why did he leave?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a warrior in the sense that he wants to take care of things when this country isn't respected.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> But why did he leave your administration?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Different, really differences with not me as much as one or two other people that are important, you know, that have positions that are very important. But I would say --
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> So, I'm reading Secretary of State Pompeo here. I'm reading that into what you said.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, whoever, that you'd have to ask them. You could ask John. But I actually --
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Was he too hawkish?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I had a very good relationship with John, actually.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> OK. Was he too hawkish? Was he too aggressive?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he's a hawk, no doubt about it.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's a hawk, there's no doubt and you're not going to change that. I wouldn't want to change that. I viewed John, as you know, very much of an advantage because I'll make that final decision, but you know, bringing John in, the other side views it, and they say, wow, he's tough. So, no, my relationship with John was a very good relationship, actually.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> What's holding up the China deal?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're much tougher negotiators with me than they were with, where's Hunter? Meaning, Biden. I call him where's Hunter because he disappears, and then, just takes all the money that he ripped off and disappears. Do you ever notice, one of the most incredible things is during the debates, it's such a big subject.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you one thing, if he gets the nomination, that's going to dominate my debates. It's going to dominate. I will make sure it dominates because what he did is corrupt. But do you ever notice that not one Democrat, you know, they'll debate each other, they want to win. They never mention that and I watched Anderson Cooper during one of the debates, and he brought it up almost like he was embarrassed to even bring up the subject.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Why do you think the journalistic didn't think that question up? It doesn't seem to be a tough question?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because they're corrupt. They're corrupt. It's a corrupt establishment. You look at ESPN and you look at what they've done, if I do something great, for instance, Al Baghdadi, I took that -- we killed Al Baghdadi.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> You said, ESPN, you're talking to CNN now, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm sorry, CNN.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ESPN is pretty bad, too, by the way, if you want to know the truth. That's why they're down the dog -- that's why they're down the tubes. I mean, you look at what's happened to ESPN, it's like a different deal, but they're pretty bad, too. In fact, maybe just as bad. But that's why they're down. But do you ever notice the Academy Awards used to be the greatest thing?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's way down because they were hitting Trump and they were hitting millions of millions of our people and they turned off.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They turned off. Now it's not even doing well.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> They can't even get a host. Nobody wants to host it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Academy Awards was the biggest thing outside of the Super Bowl. Now, it's like a regular show because they were hitting our people and our people don't need to, they don't want to take it. They don't want to take it. But, no, CNN, if you look at CNN, the way they -- I mean, it's just story after story.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> But nobody watches them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hopefully, I'll be -- hopefully, we'll be talking for five more years, OK? But when I do leave, at some point, you know, a lot of them think I'll never leave. I mean, this character, Bill Maher, said he'll never leave. Don't you know he's going to win? But he's never going to leave, no matter what, he'll never leave.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don't you know that? And I used to think he was kidding. He's actually serious. He really believes that, but let's say, I'm there, hopefully, for five years, we'll win and we'll do good. Look, the economy just hit a new record, as we're speaking, just hit a brand new record, greatest economy in the history of our country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The stock market just hit a new record, it's up a lot today, and that's great because you know, I view it as not that way, I view it as jobs. Every time I see that going up, I know it's jobs. Did you ever hear? I mean, of course, you did, but it's the economy is stupid. I guess that was Clinton or somebody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's all about the economy. Well, I have the greatest economy in the history of politics. All right? Nobody's ever had an economy like I do. I hope it stays this way but I have the greatest -- nobody gives me any credit for that. Nobody says, well, he can't be beaten because the economy so strong. If I were a Democrat, and if I had this economy, and if Hillary got in, by the way, the economy would be, it would have crashed, it would have crashed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But if I were a Democrat with this economy, it wouldn't even be a contest. They'd all be talking about, he can't be beaten, the economy is too good. Very famous line, you know, it's the economy, stupid.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Yeah. That was a --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's all about the economy. So, I have the strongest economy in the history of politics. Nobody's ever...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> No, they have declined, there is no doubt about it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because of me, it's now a vibrant paper for a little while, but after I'm gone, hopefully, that'll be a long time, but because we still have a lot of work to do. But after I'm gone, Bill, it goes out of business.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Well, the whole media -- I think you're going to start a media company, Trump TV. That's what I think. But we'll get to that in a minute. But if you can get the China deal --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not, I'm not interested in that, but that's OK. Go ahead.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> No? If you could get the China deal, the economy --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. You know I'm interested in -- I'm interested in one thing. I'm interested in what I'm doing now, to make the country, it's really about to Make America Great Again. Now, it's getting to be, keep America Great. That being --
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Right. We talked about that in the book.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> But if you can get the China deal, the economy would then go into another level, and I'm wondering what's holding that deal up?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Me, I'm holding it up.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Yeah? Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, because it's got to be a good deal if it's done. You have to understand, China has been taking out $500 billion a year for many years out of our country, OK, hundreds of billions of dollars. $200 billion, $300 billion, $500 billion, $400 billion back and forth. But on average, hundreds of billions of -- not millions, hard to believe, billions.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have been taking like we're babies, like we're schoolchildren. Especially during Biden's reign with Barack Obama, they ripped us off like nobody's ever been ripped off, and Biden didn't even know it. When he first got into the race, he was saying how wonderful they were. And so, we can't make a deal that's like even, we have to make a deal -- I told that to President Xi. We're so far down that we can't just make an even deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to make a deal where we do much better because we have to catch up.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> I have one more question on the economy, and then, we'll get into the homeless thing, which is fascinating, and the Mexican thing, which is really brutal. Mr. President, if you could please stay with us for a moment. We'll be right back after a few words. [Commercial Break] Bill O'Reilly here. Welcome back to my exclusive interview with President Donald Trump.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> On the economy, your administration has spent more money, more federal dollars than the Obama administration did in its first term.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Does that worry you because we owe $23 trillion?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, it doesn't because for a different reason, I can solve that. That's much easier than what I've been doing. I've had to rebuild the military, Bill. I've rebuilt the military. I took over this great country and our military was in horrible shape. It was totally depleted. I had a General walk in and tell me they had no ammunition.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We don't have ammunition. Can you imagine? I said that no President should ever hear that again, and I went to work very quickly, and we brought massive amounts of ammunition to a point where we could barely store it. And I rebuilt new planes, new ships are being built, new -- a lot of things, plus I'm working it. You know, like you probably read, I'm very unhappy with a certain aircraft carrier that's way over budget.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was an Obama deal. So incompetent the way they give out contracts. I've never seen anything like it and all that stuff is being worked on. You know this is for years and years, this is even before him, but this for years and years. But we've had to rebuild the military. We had to fix our country and when I'm ready to go, it'll be very easier to bring down costs, much harder, I had to fix our military.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was the biggest --
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> So you're confident --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We just approved $738 billion.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> I want to get you on the record. In a second term, if you're re-elected, you're going to try to bring down the debt?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, sure, sure. That'll be easy. Do you know why that's easy?
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because all of these things and much of the money that I'm spending right now and a lot of it's on the military. We're building a wall along the Mexican border. We need that wall desperately.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm taking it at -- largely out of the military. It's being built by the Army Corps of Engineers. It's going up very rapidly, but we need, you know, all of these things. The Democrats want to have open borders. They want open borders. They want these people to come in and many of them are stone-cold criminals and they will rape and pillage, OK? We can't have them in.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Well, while we are on that subject.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Without a wall, you can't have border security.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> While we're on that subject. And you and I occasionally speak and I never, ever say to anybody what you and I talk about because we've known each other for 30 years. I don't know what -- how you put up with me for that long. But --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Long time, I have a lot of respect.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> One of the things that you have said to me, and I don't think you'll be angry about me putting this out there, is that if another country murdered 100,000 Americans with guns, we would go to war with that country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Yet, but the Mexican drug cartels kill more than 100,000 Americans every year by the importation of dangerous narcotics.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's right.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Are you going to designate those cartels in Mexico as terror groups and start hitting them with drones and things like that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to say what I'm going to do, but they will be designated. I don't say what I want to do. I've already offered Mexico. I like the President very much. I actually get along with this President much, much better than the previous President, and in theory, this President has socialistic tendencies, but I think, he's a very good man.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I've actually offered him to let us go in and clean it out and he so far has rejected the offer. But at some point, something has to be done. Look, we're losing 100,000 people a year to what's happening and what's coming through on Mexico. And they have unlimited money, the people, the cartels because they have a lot of money because it's drug money and human trafficking money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you have to see some of the devices where they put it in cylinders of cars and you cannot tell. The thing that can sniff it out is a dog. The equipment you buy for tens of millions of dollars can't do it. A dog can do it, OK? Can you believe it? There's nothing like a good old fashioned German shepherd dog, especially, from a specific area, they're unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, no, we were losing 100,000 thousand people. Now, multiply that times 10, the families that are destroyed.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, you have families that are absolutely destroyed. It is a very, very sad situation.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> So you are going to designate, you're going to designate the Mexican cartels as terror groups?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, I will be. I will be designating their cartel, absolutely. Absolutely.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> All right. That will be a big story.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've been working on that for the last 90 days. You know designation is not that easy.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> No, I know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have to go through a process and we're well into that process.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> And wait till you see, they'll attack you for doing that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't care.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> I know. I know that but that's how absurd it is.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm attacked on everything. Yeah, no, I'm attacked on everything. But the Democrats want open borders, they want sanctuary cities where they protect criminals. And you know, the people in those sanctuary cities don't want them, including in California, they don't want them.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Well, California is interesting.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They should take a vote.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> One of the most disgraceful things that I think all Americans see, is what's happening in Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, with the thousands of mostly drug-addicted, substance abusers, homeless, running wild.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right. Right.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> And you have said that you're going to have the EPA go in there and make it an environmental, a federal environmental problem, so you can deal with it because the local Democrats won't. Can you explain?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have already started the procedure. The EPA has already sent very powerful letters and letters of essentially letters of default to San Francisco, others are going out to L.A. Because what's happening is all of the horrible things that -- first, we have to take care of our homeless, but we also have to save these cities.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These cities are great cities, and they're going down the tubes. Nancy Pelosi's San Francisco, what's going on there is unbelievable. Los Angeles, you take a look at what's happening, and human waste, needles, drugs, everything. It's being sent into the Pacific Ocean through the storm sewers. Storm sewers are not supposed to have that, they're not supposed to have that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And all of this stuff doing is washing into the storm sewers and going into the Pacific Ocean, and EPA has let them know because you know, people, some people smile, people that know me don't smile, but I'm very much an environmentalist. I want clean air. I want clean water and what's happening is all of these needles and all of this horrible stuff, where police are getting sick by walking, they're literally getting sick, they're very sick, many police, by walking the beat, just by walking by it every day.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Where tenants that are paying a lot of money coming from other countries in some cases, they want to leave these buildings because they don't want to have to walk through. I mean, they're walking through thousands of people that are, you know, in some cases sick, very sick and it's a very sad thing for everybody.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> So, what can the federal government do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nancy Pelosi ought to be focused on that as opposed to focus on this most ridiculous thing I've seen, impeachment, which has gone way, way down in the numbers now that people understand it, way, way down, and especially in swing states and with independents, way down.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Let's just get back to the homeless thing. What can the federal government do to stop the homeless encampments? What can you guys do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the first thing we have to do is remove the people from the streets and put them in institutions or in some cases, as you know, put them in hospitals.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> And you think that will happen?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Many of these people are sick people.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Many of these people are sick, very, very sick and we have to remove them. We have to put them where they can have some care, some good care, and we have to, in some cases put, you know, facilities outside in areas that aren't expensive.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Yeah, military bases.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Where you have land, not where you have 50-story buildings every block.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> But I can see San Francisco, I can see the Attorney General, Becerra of California and the Governor, Newsom, out there fighting you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, they'll fight me.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> If the feds try to close down these encampments. I can see that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Newsom fought me on forest fires. Now, he finds out I'm right. Those fires in California, there's no reason to have them. The floors of the forests are filthy, dirty, meaning, feet of leaves and fallen timber. You know, when a tree falls, if it's there for more than 18 months, it becomes like a matchstick, OK? It's dry, dead-bone dry and the leaves underneath are bone dry, and in some cases, they're there for years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When you start one little fire, it goes up, the whole thing goes up. If they would clean that out, you wouldn't have fires. You would have very few fires. I mean, you have cities that are called forest cities, they're in forests in Europe. You take a look at, they have forest countries. You have countries that are in the mountains.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They don't have anything like this, and they have more flammable lumber of the type that California has, but more flammable than that, more inclined to burn. And they don't have --
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> All right. Well, it'll be interesting to see if you, when you go up against the state of California because they'll try to prevent the federal government from cleaning up the homeless.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we're doing it with cars too. The cars -- people are spending $3,500 more for a car that's not as good because it's sucking, it needs a little more energy. It needs a little more gasoline, OK? Just a little bit more, like from a -- like from a glass, and instead, they spend $3,000 more, the cars are unsafe because they make them so light, they're like papier-mache.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, what I've done is, I said we're going to build and we're going to end up in litigation with these characters. We're going to build a much stronger car, a much safer car that's going to cost less money and it's going to work better.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Mr. President, if you could, please stay with us for a moment. We'll be right back after a few words. [Commercial Break] Welcome back, Bill O'Reilly here and I'm joined once again by the President of the United States. I've got two more questions for you. Outside of the economy, what do you consider your greatest accomplishment as President?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, most people would consider, and I think I would, too. But I considered building up the military because, without the military, all of the other stuff doesn't matter so much. We have to protect ourselves. There's a very violent world out there, including other countries. But most people would say that what I've done with judges, I have two Supreme Court judges, I have -- I will soon be at 182 Federal Judges, including Court of Appeals, 182. Nobody has seen anything like it. It's a record.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Why is that important? Explain to the listeners, why is that important?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The whole tenor of the country goes by judges and I can tell you that, you know, whether people like hearing it or not, you go before some judges and if you're of a certain persuasion, you cannot win, OK. You cannot win. You heard so much about the Ninth Circuit. Well, the Ninth Circuit is almost even now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was a one way road and now it's almost even. We've appointed many judges to the Ninth Circuit because President Obama foolishly left me 142 judges. It's impossible to believe. I thought he'd have, you know, leave us none. He left us 142, and since then, we've approved a lot more than that, a lot more than added on to that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, we are going to have 182 judges within a few months. We've already got approved about 161, and a lot of people would say that's a tremendous thing, but I would also say the biggest tax cuts in history, the biggest regulation cuts in history. What I've done for the VA, you don't see VA problems anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We've got Veterans Choice approved. We've got veterans' accountability. So, if people treat our veterans badly, they get fired. We couldn't fire them before, this took 45 years, nobody could get it approved, and I got it approved. Accountability. I mean, we've done a lot, Bill. We did something incredible, Right to Try, it's called.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Where if a person is dying, they can use our modern drugs even though they're not approved.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Right. They don't have to go around.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It is incredible, that is a big thing and I never understood why they didn't do that, but it took -- for 50 years, they've been trying to get it. I got it approved.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Ruth Bader Ginsburg is not in good health. Do you have someone you're going to appoint, you want to announce today?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I don't think about that. I hope she's healthy.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> OK. Finally, Thanksgiving. You're not that sentimental, but you are a traditionalist. What does Thanksgiving mean to you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Well, you know, to me, it's beyond, I think, the original means, it's just giving thanks for everything we have. It's you know, this is a great country and I hear all sorts of things that people want to get away, you know, change the name for Thanksgiving. It's like, you know, you hear things that are just so incredible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, Thanksgiving is a very special time and it's just really giving thanks, to me, it's giving thanks for everything that we have. It's really incredible and our country is doing well again. I'll tell you what had the Democrats won this election, instead of being at record numbers, you'd be at half the number that you were at when they took over.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, if you look back, everybody said China was going to capture the United States in terms of the economy, it would surpass the United States within the second year of the Presidency, you know when I was running that kept saying that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we picked up trillions and trillions of dollars in value, they've lost trillions. They're having the worst year they've had in 57 because of the tariffs. They're having the worst year that they've had in 57 years and we're having the best year we've ever had, and we are now so far ahead of them. But if you remember, I'm sure you remember this, that China will catch just in two years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right? And they would have caught us already if Hillary got in and our stock market would have been half of what it was. And Instead, our stock market is up 67 --
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> So, it sounds to me that you are thankful that Hillary Clinton isn't President.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, hey, you know what's terrible? When I won, they're all screaming, lock her up, lock her up. Did a lot of bad things with the e-mail, 33,000 e-mails disappeared and all of these things. But I said, let's get on with it, let's get on. And then, she starts writing books and she's nasty, and so, you know, she just couldn't understand.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She didn't understand that she lost big. She lost in a landslide. And you know, the Electoral College is an amazing thing. I'd rather have, frankly, I'd rather have a popular vote. I think I'd win easier. But I didn't campaign in areas, she was campaigning in California. She was campaigning in New York, which is an automatic, I mean, for whatever reason, but, you know, that's true.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Automatic wins and she's campaigning in these places, I say, what's she doing? And we had a, you know, that people would call it, it's 306 to 223. That's a lot. Remember, they said I couldn't get to 270 and they were right. I got to 306. So, no, I think that it would have been a lot different story. We have a great country again and we have a Commander-in-Chief that protects its people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just had a thing, semi-controversial to me, wasn't at all. I protected three warfighters that were being very harshly treated.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Yeah, the seals.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> As you know, they were being very, very harshly treated. I've got their back, and now, we have a great country again.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Mr. President, I want to thank you very much for taking the time to talk to all the listeners across the country, in the world, on the radio. I also want to wish you a very happy Thanksgiving, you and your family.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, thank you very much, Bill. You too.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> I hope you have a great time. I hope we can talk again soon.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good. We will and thank you very much, Bill. It's a great honor. Thank you.
<Julie Fine> <Positive> Mr. President thank you so much for being with us. You're here at Louis Vuitton. They will sign the pledge to American workers. Why did you choose to come to this specific event?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it was one of the great companies, as you know, and is, anywhere in the world, Louis Vuitton. And Bernard Arnault is one of the greatest businessmen, and really is a genius in terms of design, and I said to him, prior to the election, he was somebody that, like Donald Trump, and I said listen, if I win you, have to build something, and it could very well be in Texas.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you have to build something great, because until now, it's basically been in France. And he has the greatest brands in the world. And he did it right here in Texas, and we're very happy about it, and it's gonna be something special. It's an incredible company.
<Julie Fine> <Positive> Moving to daily news, with the cease fire in place, what are your expectations for Turkey, and what happens to the Kurds?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it's gonna be fantastic. The Kurds are going to be in great shape now. Turkey is going to be in great shape. We got him to stop the firing. It was a very unconventional way of dealmaking, but I think you needed that, otherwise it would have never stopped. A million people were killed there during the last administration.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's a lot of people, and they didn't get it done, and I went unconventional. I said, let him go at it for a little while, and let's see what happens. They went at it for a couple of days, and they said, we don't like it, and I give a lot of credit to Turkey. I give a lot of credit to everybody involved, including the Vice President and our Secretary of State.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There are a lot of people working very hard on this. But we did it unconventionally, and it worked out great.
<Julie Fine> <Negative> With the impeachment inquiry ongoing, will you work with Democrats on bills like infrastructure, and can anything get done in Washington right now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the impeachment is just a witch hunt. It's a disgraceful thing that Pelosi and this crew are able to do it. I call them the do nothing Democrats. They do nothing. All they do is they -- they don't think they can win the election, which is coming up, believe it or not, in a little more than 12 months.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They don't think they're going to win the election, and this is the way they try and do it. It's a disgrace. From the day I got into office, they've been talking about impeaching: how do we get him out, because we're not going to beat him. They don't have a shot, and you see why they don't. You know why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because they get nothing done. They do nothing -- Democrats. That's all they are.
<Julie Fine> <Positive> Well, you work with them though, to get bills like infrastructure done --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll always work. I'll work with -- sure, I'll work with them. I'll work with anybody. But they don't want to do anything else, and they're don't want to do this either. I even doubt they have the votes, because frankly, they're going to take a tremendous loss, and they're going to lose Congress, and when we take back Congress, we will do things just like we've been doing, and we've gotten a lot done.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you look at your border security, what I've had to do on border security. We got rid of -- all they have to do is the loopholes. Mexico has been fantastic. Your numbers are way, way down in a positive way. Way, way down. But we've done it without any Democrat help, which is a shame.
<Julie Fine> <Positive> You spoke a little bit about 2020. You've been to Texas 12 times now. How important is Texas for your re-election?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I -- you know, I know I'm way up in Texas, they say, and -- and I won by a lot. And I think I'm way up higher than I was on the election, last election. But I love Texas. I love the people. Today, we're opening this incredible plant, Louis Vuitton. Nobody thought that would be possible to get this great French name right into the heart of Texas, and they did it, and I'm honored by it.
<Julie Fine> <Neutral> In 2018, Texas had some areas go blue that never went blue in the past. Are you concerned that can affect you in this upcoming election?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I wasn't running in 2018, but I can tell you in 2016, we easily won Texas by a lot, and you had no areas that went blue that we know of. There were very few, and Texas is going to be a very Republican state. They love border security. They love low taxes. They love our Second Amendment, meaning gun rights, and they love all of the things that we do. If you listen to what's going on with the Democrats, I don't know how anybody who would vote for them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They want to take away your guns, they want to take away your oil. You know, when you go against oil in Texas, somehow that's not going to work out too well. So I think we're going to do very well. I think we're going have a tremendous success.
<Julie Fine> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you very much for doing this with you. Nice to meet you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
<Julie Fine> <Positive> [Inaudible] Thank you.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> And joining me now by phone, the president of the United States, Donald Trump. Good evening, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi, Jeanine.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Thank you so much for joining us tonight. Is there an emergency at the southern border? Should we not now use the emergency funds and the powers that you have in your possession?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, we have a humanitarian crisis, to put it mildly. People are trying to get in by the tens of thousands. They're rushing the border, there's right now in Honduras -- a country we pay a lot of money to, I think foolishly because they don't help us. But right now, you have another caravan forming, and it's going to be the biggest one yet.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We stopped the last one. You see what's going on in Tijuana. They couldn't get through because we have a wall there. We got a wall up. The military's been fantastic, Border Patrol has been incredible and ICE is, you know, these are brave people that do a great job. And we stopped them. But there's another big one forming.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We need a wall, very simple. Whether you call it a steel barrier, wall, it doesn't matter, but we need a very strong structure.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> But by waiting to build the wall using those funds that are available to you in a national emergency, aren't you negating the point of the emergency itself?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I have the absolute right to call a national emergency. Other presidents have called many national emergencies for things of lesser importance, frankly, than this. And I have the right to do it. I'd rather see the Democrats come back from their vacation and act. They're not acting, and they're the ones that are holding it up. It would take me 15 minutes to get a deal done, and everybody could go back to work.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I'd like to see them act responsibly, and they're not acting responsibly, and that's it. We could be -- I’m in the White House, and most of them are in different locations. They're watching a certain musical in a very nice location and --
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> Of course, in Puerto Rico watching "Hamilton."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- frankly, it’s ridiculous. The whole thing is ridiculous. We have a very important thing to do. We have to have border security, and we have to get people getting paid again very quickly.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> But what about, as this happens, hook, you were in the White House -- look, you were in the White House during the Christmas holidays and over New Year's, and you've been there ever since. Nancy Pelosi's in Hawaii over the holidays, now she's in Puerto Rico with a bunch of Democrats and lobbyists, you know, enjoying the sun and partying down there.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> But what makes you think that these people are willing to cut a deal? If you have shown your ability to negotiate by changing to a slat, agreeing to all of their demands as it relates to, you know, technology, electronic fencing and all of the other things, the humanitarian aid, they sit there, they don't even look you in the eye.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> What makes you think that they're going to in any way cave? Because if these people said 13 and then, again, six years ago, we need a wall, we need a wall, but now, you're the president, they don't want a wall. What makes you think they're coming back?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they might not. I mean, you know, frankly, I was willing to do something and we're asking for $5.6 billion, which is way less than what other presidents have been talking about. You know, if you look back, this should have been done 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago. This should have been done by others.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Just like if you look at Jerusalem, if you look at the embassy moving to Jerusalem, every president promised that, they never did it. I did it. If you look at so many other things that I’ve done -- we're going well with a lot of -- you know, we're doing well with China. We’re doing well with North Korea.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We’re doing -- you know, I was left a very tough hand. But this was one of the problems, it’s our southern border. And it's, you know, thousands and thousands of people are coming in, and we have human smugglers, we have traffickers, we have people -- the biggest drug dealers in the world. And they're pouring through the parts of the border -- they don't go through your areas that are port of entry, Jeanine.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> Ports of entry.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They go through areas where you don't have any protection whatsoever. And it's really very sad and very, very dangerous and very bad for our country. A lot of crime comes from that location.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> You know, I interviewed Ron Vitiello, the acting director of ICE, and he said that there was enough fentanyl seized by them last year that could kill every American in this country. We know that 90 percent of the heroin comes through the southern border, and, you know, what we also know is that, or you know, there are 800,000 federal employees who didn't get a check yesterday.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> You're sitting there waiting for a deal. The Democrats are not sitting with you. If this isn't an emergency, I don't know what is.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I haven't actually left the White House in months. And in all fairness, I’m doing a lot of other work. It’s not just that, but that's a very important element of what I’m doing, because we have to get the southern border done. And I’ve been here virtually every night, I guess every night other than one day I flew to Iraq and then to Germany to see our troops.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it was great. To see them, was great. The level of love they have for this country is incredible. So I flew and then came back. I’m not even sure I actually missed a night, per se. But basically, I’ve been here for many months in the White House. And I -- you know, I’m a worker.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> I know you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I’m like you, I’m a worker.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> You are a worker.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, frankly, I’m ready, willing and able to get a deal done. But they don’t -- they think it's politics. I think it's bad politics. This country wants to have protection at the border. Many of our crimes, much -- MS-13 comes through the border, drugs, a big proportion of the drugs from, you know, that we have from this country -- in this country come through the border.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The human trafficking where they tie women up, they put duct tape over their mouth --
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- electrical tape, and they bring them and they traffic in women and children, and they come through the border, the areas that I’m talking about putting a wall. We do that, it can't happen anymore. It's unbelievable. It's only politics. That's the game they're playing. I actually think it's bad politics for them.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> So then, you know, when Nancy Pelosi won, you very warmly in November congratulated her, and are you still confident you can get a deal done with her, or has that ship sailed?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No idea. No idea. Well, we won also. You know, we won the Senate.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Right, right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, you know, there are those that would say that the Senate is more important. And, for the most part, I campaigned for the Senate.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we got very little credit. Like even you -- you just said they won, we won the Senate. We actually picked up additional seats.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> You did, yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We beat incumbents, Democrat, and almost everywhere I went, we won. But, you know, I’m one person, and the House had many races, and yet we won some great races where I went. But we won the Senate, Jeanine, we picked up two additional seats. It’s 53-47.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was 51-49.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> All right. So for the last time, given that they don't want to seem to come to the table, that you have done all the negotiating, why not declare? There’s --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that might happen. But I want to give them a chance to see if they can act responsibly.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They should act responsibly. We're talking about the border, and I have to say a lot of the people that aren't getting their checks are letting us know we don't care, you've got to solve the crisis at the border. It's humanitarian crisis, and it's national security. It's very important.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> OK. And it's interesting, that's what I heard yesterday from some of the border patrol agents. Now, I want to move on to another subject. "The New York Times" reported that the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation the day after you fired James Comey in May of '17. And the investigation was whether you were actively working for Russia or unwittingly.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> So, I’m going to ask you, are you now or have you ever worked for Russia, Mr. President?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's the most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked. I think it's the most insulting article I’ve ever had written. And if you read the article, you'd see that they found absolutely nothing. But the headline of that article, it's called "The failing New York Times" for a reason, they've gotten me wrong for three years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They've actually gotten me wrong for many years before that. But you rook at what's going on, you know, I fired James Comey. I call him Lying James Comey because he was a terrible liar, and he did a terrible job as the FBI director. Look at what happened with the Hillary Clinton and the e-mails and the Hillary Clinton investigation, one of the biggest screw-ups that anybody's ever seen as an investigation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And what happened after I fired him? Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, his lover, Lisa Page, they did it. And, you know, they're all gone. Most of those people, many, many people from the top ranks of the FBI, they've all been fired or they had to leave are. And they're all gone. This is what they were talking about.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, obviously, nothing was found. And I can tell you this, if you ask the folks in Russia, I’ve been tougher on Russia than anybody else, any other -- probably any other president period, but certainly the last three or four presidents, modern day presidents. Nobody's been as tough as I have from any standpoint, including the fact that we've done oil like we've never done it, we're setting records in country with oil and exporting oil and many other things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, which is, obviously, not great for them, because that's what they -- that's where they get their money for the most part. But many other things. So I think it was a great insult. And "The New York Times" is a disaster as a paper. It's a very horrible thing they said, and they've gone so far that people that weren't necessarily believers are now big believers, because they said that was a step too far.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They really are a disaster of a newspaper.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> Well, you know, when you think about it, the people that were involved in that, all of the people have since been fired or gone, whether --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> -- it's Strzok, page, McCabe. And also the Steele dossier. But "The Washington Times" -- "The Washington Post," I should say, is following up reporting that you went to unusual lengths to keep your conversations with President Putin under wraps. Why not release the conversation that you had with President Putin in Helsinki, along with some other stuff that might involve FISA, Bruce Ohr and the whole lot of them?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Jeanine, I would, I don't with care. I mean, I had a conversation like every president does. You sit with the president of various countries. I do it with all countries. We had a great conversation. We were talking about Israel and securing Israel and lots of other things. And it was a great conversation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I’m not keeping anything under wraps, I couldn't care less. I mean, it's so ridiculous. These people make it up. "Washington Post", that's basically the lobbyist for Amazon. You know, he uses that -- Bezos has got bigger problems than anybody right now. But Bezos uses that as his lobbyist, OK, as far as I’m concerned.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And "The Washington Post" is almost as bad or probably as bad as "The New York Times." Think of it, I have a one-on-one meeting with Putin like I do with every other leader. I have many one-on-one -- nobody ever says anything about it. But with Putin they say, oh, what did they talk about? We talked about very positive things because -- look, we are beating everybody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Our economy is the strongest in the world right now, Jeanine. Nobody even close. China's down 38 president. Russia's not doing well, its economy. Most countries are not doing well. We're doing phenomenally. Even though we're paying interest rates because we're normalizing. You know, Obama had zero interest.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Anybody can do that. And our economy's now better than ever. We're almost at our high with the stock market again. So, it's really -- can you imagine where they say that I met with Putin, I met with every leader just about individually. I meet with Modi, I meet with -- in Japan, I meet with Abe. I meet with all of them, but nobody says anything.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I meet with Putin, and they make a big deal. Anybody could have listened to that meeting, that meeting is up for grabs. You know, the whole Russia thing, it's a hoax. It's a terrible hoax. You know it probably better than -- you, Gregg Jarrett, so -- Dan Bongino. People that look at it, it’s a total hoax.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everybody knows it. And it's really a shame because it takes time, and it takes effort. And everybody knows there was no collusion whatsoever. They have found no collusion, and they won't find collusion because I had nothing to do -- I was a better candidate than Hillary Clinton. She was a terrible candidate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the fact is, I was obviously a good candidate. I won every debate. I won everything I did, and I won, and I won easily -- 306-223, I believe. And that's a big difference in the college, in the Electoral College. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So that's -- but it's really, it's really a shame, Jeanine. It really is a shame. Such a waste of time.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> It is a shame. It is a waste of time, it's a waste of energy, and, you know, some people have to say to themselves, how can you deal with all of this? This "New York Times" article, to be absolutely truthful with you, just seems to be another rehash of the same players and the same arguments, and the same dossier, you know, just to keep it going, and they'll keep it going as long as they can.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> What keeps you going? I mean, you've got such fight in you, it is unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I guess I have good genes -- [Laughter]]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- because, you know, somebody said the other day no president should have to go --
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- through what you're going through, Mr. President. Because I’m going through all of this nonsense, it's all nonsense, but I have to be careful because these are dirty players. They're no good. And you've got the Mueller investigation, you've got all this nonsense. There's no collusion, no nothing. And, you know, they say this should never happen again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Never again should this happen. And that's the story. But despite that, we've done more than any other administration by far in the first two years. We've had tremendous success.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> All right. And now, of course, Little Adam Schiff, as you call him, is going to be dragging in, and Jerry Nadler are going to be bringing in Michael Cohen, an already-proven liar, to Congress, convicted of it. You know, are you -- are you worried that --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, look, I was a client of his. You know, and you're supposed to have lawyer/client privilege, but it doesn't matter because if I’m a very honest person, frankly. But he's on trouble on some loans and fraud and taxi cabs and stuff that I know nothing about.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> And taxi medallions.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And in order to get his sentence reduced, he says, I have an idea, I’ll tell -- I’ll give you some information on the president. Well, there is no information. But he should give information maybe on his father-in-law, because that's the one that people want to look at. Because where does that money -- that's the money in the family.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I guess he didn't want to talk about his father -- he's trying to get his sentence reduced. So, it's pretty sad. You know, it's weak and it's very sad to watch a thing like that. I couldn't care less.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> What is his father-in-law's name?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know, but you'll fine out, and you'll look into it because nobody knows what's going on over there. Again, I was a client. I was a client. He has a law firm. They broke into his law firm sometime early in the morning, I guess, and they took -- this couldn't happen to anybody except you're dealing with McCabe, you're dealing with the remnants of Comey.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And wait until you see how it all ends up, you watch. McCabe, Lisa Page, Strzok, wait until you see how that all ends up, including some others that I could name, but I -- [Crosstalk]
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> Will you release --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We’ll make -- we’ll make front page news if I do.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> I can’t wait to read it. Will you release the FISA? We're all waiting for the FISA. That will give us -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, at the right time, we will probably do that. If that's necessary, we'll do that. You know, that's very, very important stuff.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> I know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, you know, as you know, a lot of bad things happened when a lot of elements of what we're talking about. And at the right time, we will probably do that. That's right.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> All right. And my -- are your lawyers working to keep the Mueller report from being made public?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I can't tell you because I don't devote too much time -- here's the bottom line, there was no collusion. There was no obstruction. There was no anything. So, you know, no calls to Russia. No nothing. So, you know, it's all nonsense, Jeanine. It’s all -- it's a hoax. It's called the Russian hoax or witch, you know, it's a witch hunt.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it's a shame. And, you know, despite that what we're doing is amazing. But actually, what we're doing in this, too, because we're exposing people that are corrupt. People are being exposed by this that are totally corrupt. A lot of the people that don't get mentioned even in that article today, the phony article in "The New York Times", there's a lot of corruption, and we're exposing it. And I’m going to put that down someday as one of my greatest achievements.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> Well, I look forward to hearing that that. And I guess one last question, Mr. President, when are you going to get out of the White House? I mean, Washington after a while gets very depressing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I love it, and I love this building, and I do a lot of work in the building. And if you looked at what we're doing on the deal with China which nobody was able to take on, and we're taking it on great, we're doing an incredible deal for our country. You look at Iran. When I ended the Iran nuclear deal, look what happened to Iran.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's a different country than it was when I came here two years ago.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And all of the trade deals we're making with Mexico -- and, by the way, Mexico is paying for the wall because the trade deal --
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- is billions and billions of dollars better than the old NAFTA deal. And I call that -- Mexico is absolutely paying for the wall. So, I mean, we're doing a great job, and I like doing it. And then we get involved with the Russian hoax or, you know, whatever you call it.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> Or distraction.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It’s -- you know, it's one of those things, but I love doing it, the whole thing. But this will turn out to be very important because people are going to be exposed that nobody ever thought possible.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Well, I look forward to that. And I have to ask you another post, last question. You're hearing about all these people looking to run against you in 2020. Your thoughts?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I’m not worried. So far, I love the competition. I love what I see.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I love what I see. You know, a couple of them aren't running that I was hoping were going to run, they just announced yesterday that they weren't looking. I was sort of looking forward to that. But you're going to have probably 30 people, close to 30 people, maybe more. I heard as many as 32. And I see nobody, in fact, I guess Bruce Springsteen, Moore, all these guys are saying we're not going to beat him again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're not going to -- so they're all going around saying, and they’re not -- look, we're doing too well. If anybody beat me, we have the greatest unemployment and employment numbers that we've ever had as a country.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> That's right. That’s right. Who -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> African-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-American, the overall number, historically the best numbers we've ever had. The economy is the best economy we've ever had. More people are working today, Jeanine, in our country than have ever worked in our country before. I don't know, how does somebody beat that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have great trade deals. I cut taxes down to the lowest number that they've been in many years, bigger than the Ronald Reagan tax cuts. We have ANWR.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We got rid of the individual mandate on this horrible Obamacare, which we'll end up taking care of. Watch what's going to happen there. So, you know, we're doing a good job, and I think people see it.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Who is the one person that you would really like to run against?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't want to pick anyone out. You know, a lot of people say Biden's doing OK, but he was always a one percenter. He was a 1 percent guy. He ran two or three times, he never got above 1 percent. And then Obama came along and took him off the trash heap, and he became a vice president, and now he's probably leading.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But he's basically a 1 percent guy. He's weak.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we'll see what happens with him. But I think he's leading right now, from what I understand.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I’ll be watching. Whoever it is, I think we're going to do just fine.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Mr. President, I really hope you get out of the White House, I really do. I think you deserve a vacation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I like the symbol -- I’ll be honest, I like the symbol of being here. You know, to be totally honest with you -- I mean, your audience know I’m a straight shooter. I like the symbol of me being here and them being at some play in a nice location having a good time. I like that symbol because I am ready to sign.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they're not. And they're not.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we'll see what happens. And if they don't do it, if they don't come to their senses, you know what I’ll do? I'll do a national emergency. We're all set. It's 100 percent.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I’ll have to do that. But, honestly, we shouldn't have to. But you know what, Jeanine? They're going to want something from me someday, very important, because I have to sign everything. Everything has to go through the White House. Mitch McConnell and the Republicans have done an incredible job, and they have stuck together like glue.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have tremendous support.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Good.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, you know, they're going to want something from us for one of their favorite little deals. And all of a sudden, they're going to find out it's going to be very, very tough for them. We need security at the southern border for our country.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> All right. Well, I’ll tell you, Mr. President, when you reference the viewers, the "Justice" viewers, they are behind you 100 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Jeanine. That's nice.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you for being with us tonight. We -- we're very grateful.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Jeanine. Thank you very much.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Now I want to turn to Mr. Donald J Trump. Mr. Trump thank you for joining us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi Steve, how are you doing?
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> I'm doing good sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So what was Jessica? Was she positive or negative? I just got into the last second of the conversation.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> I think she was, I think she was not a supporter. She was saying how you were persuasive... and you're persuading a lot of people. But, I think she was calling, you know, she was questioning a lot of things, particularly your religiosity, and...
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> but listen that's the great thing about the show we...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Then I'm... Then I'm glad I didn't hear the conversation.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Listen, on this show, you get, you get.... you get the strong supporters and you also get, you got strong guys that... that don't support you. But that's a democracy.
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> Let me ask you...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I am, I am leading with evangelicals big, in fact nationwide we're leading big.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Why do you think, why... why... Why do you think that is?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because I'm, you know, I'm a Christian. I'm a Protestant. I'm Presbyterian and I'm not a liar like Cruz. Cruz lies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've never seen any human being like this guy lies. Even Rubio called him a liar yesterday. In politics, you don't do that to a guy.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Mr. Trump, I want to get on another topic. But however, you've been in New York real estate and global real estate and the gaming industry, and with politicians, that... you can't say reasonably that Ted Cruz the biggest liar you're ever seen, given the environment you've had to come out.
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> I seen some of the guys you've had to do deals with globally and...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's right. You don't want to deal with him. Let me tell you, I've seen.... I dealt with much tougher than him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's like a baby by comparison, but he's the biggest liar. OK, let's get on to another subject.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> OK, listen...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to make you uncomfortable, okay?
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> No, you don't. You can't make me uncomfortable. I want to get on something that I think is more meaningful, of substance. Number one.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> OK let's talk about this. The basis of.... of your philosophy, waypoint of the American people. We're going to protect American sovereignty, we're gonna build a wall and make Mexico pay for it.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> China, we're going to get 10 million jobs back from China, and we're going to temporarily halt immigration from Muslim dominated countries until we sort out exactly what's going on the country, who's coming in who's coming out. Those three things, okay?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Correct. Those are among three things.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Okay, That three basically. Let's look around the horn. Yesterday, at the border, two million people, open-air mass. You had actually called out the Pope about a week ago, saying hey, you know, the pope is very political, I understand he's the Vicar of Christ, heads the Catholic Church, but he's very political, and he's gotten involved in this border situation, and he's really arguing Mexico's side.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> He doesn't understand the issues. Yesterday -- and by the way, the Vatican came back against you by name, one of the Vatican spokesmen, which we're looking up, I don't think has happened since Henry the 8th, so it's like 600 years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great honor.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Yesterday, at the border, he had a mass, and in his homily -- and we've got our lead story up on it -- he really put the blame for this issue, now he's did some symbolic stuff about praying across the board etc., but he put the blame on this issue principally on Mexico. Do you believe that the pope blinked because you brought up the fact that, hey please do not get involved in American domestic politics here. This is very complicated. Do you think the pope blinked and really...
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> really took your side and argued that it was... it was Mexico's Mexico's making a lot of money, this is a Mexican problem they're forcing on the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that I don't know. But I put it out there, because I heard the pope, and I respect the pope, and I love the pope, in many ways. I love, you know, what he stands for, and I like his attitude. He's very independent, he's very different, and sort of a modern-day pope.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you think about it. But I put it out there because he was going to be at the border, and I said, well, you don't know, because he made statements about sort of me, I guess, or whatever, and I put out a very strong statement that, you know, you got to take a look at the border and what's happening. There's tremendous crime, drugs pouring through the borders, not coming from us, it's coming from the other side. And I made a pretty strong argument, and I talked about the wall very quickly, and it got picked up, and he could have been persuaded.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, I don't know, but I really respect the fact that he sees both sides. You know, a lot of people are inflexible. They won't change, and I saw that he came out and he said hey look, Mexico could stop the drugs in two minutes. Mexico could stop illegal immigration in two minutes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, you can't get into Mexico, you want to become a citizen of Mexico, you can't get in. Mexico needs to stop illegal immigration. We wouldn't even have to build a wall if they wanted to, if they wanted to do it. And by the way, if I win, they're going to start stopping it also, beyond on the wall.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to build the wall anyway. But they are stopping it, because they could stop it. They say, oh come on through. It's, like it's like a railroad station.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But if you want to make a left turn, to go into Mexico you don't have a chance. You don't even have a chance. But when you want to go to the United States, Mexico says welcome, welcome, and probably, by the way, some of their bad ones, they're bad dudes. They say, get the hell out of here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, why should they put them in jail for the next 30 years. Let's give them to the United States. We have 179,000 criminal, illegal immigrants in our country. Criminal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These are people convicted of crimes, some of them very serious crimes, 179,000 of them, to come in through the border. So look, I know what I'm doing, and the people understand, you know that the Wall Street Journal poll that came out yesterday, which was, in my opinion, it was a fix, you want to know the truth. CBS just came out with a poll that says the same as every other poll. You know, Wall Street Journal came out with a poll because I'm not a big fan of Rupert Murdoch.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> That's the Rupert Murdoch... That's the Rupert Murdoch-controlled Wall Street Journal, isn't that right sir?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was a Rupert Murdoch hit. It was just a Rupert Murdoch hit.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> You believe that... you believe that's a Rupert Murdoch hit on you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think so. Because look, every single poll, every single poll that has come out nationally -- and locally, by the way -- you see locally, and I mean we're doing fantastically well, right? South Carolina, we're doing fantastically well. But every single poll that has come out over the last year a long time have me up 15-20 points nationally. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, the Wall Street Journal poll comes out and I'm essentially even, but I'm down two points to Cruz of all people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Cruz can't get elected dogcatcher. So I'm down two points to Cruz. So now, what happens Steve, is they put it on the front page of The Wall Street Journal. When I was leading big last month in The Wall Street Journal...
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> It was back in the tire section. It was back in the tire section, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You couldn't even find it.
<Steven Bannon> <Negative> With the tire... no, I saw it. It saw it. It was back in the tire ads.
<Steven Bannon> <Negative> [Laughter] They had tire ads.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm telling you, I never found it. I could not find it.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Hold on. Let me ask you. Hang on. Rupert Murdoch, Fox News, New York Post.
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> Wall Street Journal says... the U.S. media arms, he's got also the Times of London....
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They treat me very badly. That whole group treats me badly.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> It that because, do you think that's because Rupert Murdoch's trying to do a hit on you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have no idea why. I don't care why. But they took me very badly. I mean, you know, it's obviously not having too much of an impact.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, The Wall Street Journal poll was a phony poll, OK? It was a dishonest poll. In my opinion. It was a phony poll, and even somebody in NBC said this poll can't be right. They did...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> it was a small sample size, but it was a very conservative, and it was, people... people at NBC News were embarrassed by it, OK? But the Wall Street Journal poll, I don't know...
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> -- by the way, you're talking about, that's your new super... that's your new super PAC, The Morning Joe show, right? You talking about your SuperPAC told you that... that... that...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nah, not The Morning Joe Show, but they treat me fairly at least. I mean, they treat me fairly. It's a good show. They treat me fairly, and CNN treats me fairly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The worst... the worst treatment I get is from Fox, OK? Between Karl Rove -- he's a moron -- between, you know, Krauthammer who, you know, he can't say anything good, no matter what. I mean, when I won New Hampshire...
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> How can they... how can they treat you badly? You have a very strong, personal relationship with Roger Ailes. How can that happen?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know. Roger Ailes and I like each other, but he doesn't do anything for me, that I can tell you. He certainly doesn't do anything... in one way, he's very professional.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He won't lift his finger to help me.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Let me... let...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Roger Ailes will not lift his finger to help me, which is fine. I mean, he's a professional and maybe that's the was he's supposed to do it. But I get treated, I get treated very badly.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Do you think they're over the top with Rubio... Rubio support? Do you get a sense that they're biased towards Rubio?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're in love with Rubio. Why, I have no idea. But they are in love with Rubio.
<Steve Ban> <Positive> Is Nikki Haley, Is Nikki Haley and Marco Rubio going to become the Ken and Barbie now of Fox News? You're going to see them nonstop 24/7 since she endorsed him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know. But they are in love with Rubio, and it's amazing to me. And after he cratered in the debate, they protected him. And Megyn Kelly is, you know, she's just, you know, very biased.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I look at it and I've just... I just look at it and, in my opinion, I get treated the worst by far, by Fox. And I do like Roger, he's a friend of mine. But, he's a friend of mine that won't do anything for me.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Let... let... Let me pave it back to Mexico....
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...so I don't know if that's called a friend.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Many of our people that come to the site, in the comments section, people that call and say look, I like what Trump says, I... but I don't know if he's going to back it up. Would you commit, it... if you win the nomination, win the presidency...
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> let's talk about Mexico border. Would you commit to actually go down and spend significant time in the Rio Grande Valley, in Texas, Arizona, other places, where this wall has to be built, to show the American people you're serious about that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, sure I would. But I've already been there. I've been there twice. I've been there three times.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, I don't have to spend the rest of my life there. I understand it. I can... look, you know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm a great real estate guy. I've made a fortune in real estate. I can look at it, and by the way, we are going to need a little eminent domain to get that whole bill, just so you understand. You know, you need eminent domain.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have to take certain areas, okay? Hate to tell you. But we're going to have that wall built, and it's going to be a great wall, and it's going to be a wall that works, and that's going to have a door in it because we want people to come through. But they have to come to legally, Steve.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Let me ask you on China. China... every number coming out of China. I don't know what you can believe, what you can't believe, but one thing's certain: they're walking down their GP...
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> GDP that they're show to the world. They're highly leveraged. Big problems internally as this... as this starts to unwind.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> All the... the bailout from 2008, 2016, has really been demand from China, since the banks are still zombies. Do you believe that China is now where they're putting surface-to-air missiles in these islands, and now they're building these artificial islands, which are really just aircraft carriers in the South China Sea. Do you believe they're trying to be provocative to the United States, because they're trying to...
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> they're trying to take the eye of Chinese domestic....people in China, off the domestic problems, particularly as their economy starts to collapse, just try to focus on foreign interests and foreign powers they got to stand up to?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I also think they want to scare us a little bit, because guys like me, I've been saying for a long time, but people are starting to realize how China has just ripped us off. It's he greatest theft in the history of mankind, what China has done to the United States, because of stupid politicians. It's the greatest theft in the history of mankind. And they see now that the United States has wise to it, because of my campaign,and I think that they're probably being provocative militarily so that we don't do the things that we have to do on trade.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Is South China Sea a vital... Ambassador John Bolton was on here 15 minutes ago, said it's a vital national security interest, the free flow of the Pacific Fleet and goods from the Straits of Malacca to Korea, Japan, Philippines, United States is a national... is a central national security interest to the United States. Do you believe that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I agree with that, but we have to be reimbursed for the money. We cannot continue to police the rest of the world, including Asia, so that South Korea can have free trade and so that other people can have all this free trade, and so they can get rich, and that we have our ships all over the place, and we have our planes flying and spending billions and billions of dollars. These are wealthy countries that have to reimburse us for the cost.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Last question about Apple. Apple, this whole situation about the encryption, about the phone from the terrorist. I know you made a big issue about the terrorist, about him getting in here. Where do you stand in this whole Apple issue, and do you believe your rise of this interest in nationalism, that your campaign, and obviously Santorum and others brought up, has gotten Apple in a tough situation or whether their loyalty is to the United States of America, or some global, you know, capital markets?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Apple is wrong and we should go in and get that thing, and we got to we have to find out what's on those phones. And Apple is 100 percent wrong. They should break into the phone.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Last question on Israel. The headline is that you're going to look at both sides and be even-handed. Your answer on this situation Israel and Palestine was actually more subtle, I believe. You said you know so many tough negotiators that people -- private citizens that have been engaged there -- that haven't been able to move to the football.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> The one point you wanted to make was that you don't intend to flip... turn your face cards over all the time and show everybody. What would you mean by this response?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, but was that not covered that way in the papers? Did they not cover...
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> It is, but I think... I think people are jumping on the headlines that you're going to not pick sides, you know. I think they're going for the gray...The answer was more subtle and a lot of times, you don't have subtle answers. This was quite subtle.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> My answer is this. If I'm supposed to be a mediator or an arbitrator, I don't want to go out and say, this one's wrong, that one's wrong. I want to say, let me see what happens. Now, I...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> what I really said was that this is perhaps the greatest jigsaw puzzle in the world, the toughest puzzle to solve anywhere in the world. If you could solve this problem, because I've been told by great people are great negotiators, this is not a solvable problem.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> People you admire that have been engaged in this, correct?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great negotiators. Talented. I'm telling you that. These are great negotiators. They say it's not solvable, because the hatred is so intense, it's an impossible problem to solve. I would like and try and solve it. But I can't solve it if I'm going start, you know, saying the various things that they asked me to say. So what I want, and what I tell you is it's a very tough sell. It's probably, you know, when you talk about deals, this is probably the toughest deal to do, because the hatred is so ingrained. But nevertheless, and what I said... and I said that. But, nevertheless I will try and solve it.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Last thing. Mr. Trump, you know, people are saying, with the callers and people, think that when you get when you start talking about these issues people lean forward, they want to hear the answers. They...
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> they ... they either like what they hear, or they... they know, at least, where you're going, your thinking is going. But when he gets these personal attacks, it's turning people off.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> On this Ted Cruz situation, you've dealt with the toughest hombres in the world. You can't expect us to believe that Ted Cruz the biggest liar you've ever met. It's just not... It doesn't...
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> it doesn't... it doesn't stand to reason. He may be a guy you disagree with. He...
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> maybe's he's put up some...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Steve, yeah he's right up there. Let me tell you. He's right up there. He'll say things that are just totally wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Rubio said the same thing. I mean, Rubio came out two days ago, he said he's a liar. I've never dealt with a guy like this. You have to set the record straight.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> At least I can set the record straight ,because I have, you know, I have people like you that take my calls. But the fact is, at least I can set the record straight. But no, no he's... he is...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> he's right up there, in terms... not by any means the toughest person, because I've dealt with some very bad hombres. But he is, he is somebody that does not tell the truth.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Mr. Trump, thank you so much. I know you're incredibly busy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, thank you very much. Thank you, Steve.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Appreciate it sir.
<Frances Watson> <Positive> I have the privilege of speaking to you on behalf of everyone here in the Ozarks. First let me start with: second trip to Springfield. What's important -- what's so good about Springfield?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're here really for Josh, who's just fantastic and a real star and a great person. And he's got our views and opinions on our heart. And he has the heart of the people, and you see the kind of crowd we have. I guess there's a lot like 20,000 people outside -- have you seen what's going on outside?
<Frances Watson> <Positive> Actually, it's more like 30 plus thousand people and this arena only holds --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like that. She corrects me in the right way.
<Frances Watson> <Positive> It's a huge --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I looked outside, I can't believe it.
<Frances Watson> <Neutral> Coming out of the woodwork.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's great.
<Frances Watson> <Negative> And there's only a certain amount that can get inside, so I was saying we're going to have mass riots in the streets, because people here are just staunch supporters.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That is so nice.
<Frances Watson> <Positive> They really do believe in the message and that what your administration has taken care of -- really do. So to that effect, if you could talk to the people in the Ozarks -- I know you were here at Loren Cook last year. As I was explaining to Sarah, we do have some manufacturing companies here in the Ozarks that have some concern about the exemptions for the tariffs. One being a nail company in Poplar Bluff --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In fact, we're looking at that specific company right now for an exemption. We are actually looking at that, and I'd like you to talk to me about that later, but specifically because there are some countries that got caught up.
<Frances Watson> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What we're doing with tariffs is a fantastic thing. Your steel companies are coming back, your aluminum companies are coming back, the jobs -- everything else. It's incredible. Actually, what's happened to the steel industry in the United States is the talk all over the world, and we need the steel industry.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's not like some other industry that is not necessarily important. Steel is steel. You need for defense, military, everything else. And our steel industry is coming back, where we are tariffing, you know, if you really take, we're taxing the dumping -- they were dumping massive amounts -- China and other countries -- massive amounts of steel all over the place, putting everybody out of work.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Our steel companies are just coming back it's a beautiful thing to see. And you're seeing it even here.
<Frances Watson> <Negative> Absolutely, and that's why I've been charged with asking you specifically about our region in the Midwest.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay
<Frances Watson> <Neutral> There is another air conditioning company who's finding it less expensive to have the air conditioning units made in China and then shipped back here because he can't get what he needs, as far as the parts, and so he's concerned about laying off workers and such. What would you say to somebody in that position, running their small business?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we have some people in that position, but ultimately I'd rather make the air conditioners here, make the parts here, have it be a little more expensive, but also have the jobs. Otherwise we'll have the job. So the unit may be a little bit more expensive, but we're going to make the unit here instead of having it made in China like we used to do with the old-fashioned days, when the country made a lot of money. Not like it has been over the last years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So between that and also trade deals. We're renegotiating these horrible trade deals. NAFTA was a disaster. You got hit hard by NAFTA.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Everybody did. And we've just made a deal with Mexico, which is a wonderful deal -- it's good for Mexico too. It has to be good for both. But what we were doing with NAFA was a disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Millions of jobs, thousands of companies leaving, and so we're doing a lot, just a lot. We're doing a lot. And as you know GDP is up to 4.2. Nobody thought that was possible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They thought maybe in eight years but not in a year and a half, and I think going to see it go higher even. And I think you could even see it go much higher. We have tremendous potential, but we're starting to make our own product again. But I would rather, in the case that you just brought, I'd rather make it here, let it cost a little bit more, but have jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So much better.
<Frances Watson> <Neutral> Right. And that's part again, the tariffs and those are issues, that they're waiting in line for those exemptions. And so, what do we say to these American workers and small business owners in regards to these exceptions. You know backlogging.
<Frances Watson> <Negative> They're saying it's supposed to be a 90-day process but it's taking longer. What assurances --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don't forget, when we start giving the exemptions, that means we'll never make that product here. When you don't give the exemption, then they say, oh wow, now you're forced to make the product here. You understand. Once I say, okay you have an exemption, now you're not going to make the product here, because there's no reason to, because you can order it over from China or someplace.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it's a very fine edge, but I am giving exemptions for certain companies that really need them, and we are looking at that one company.
<Frances Watson> <Negative> Something that also hits really hard in this part of the country, because we have the working poor, and health care is an issue, especially when you've got a family who are essentially, on paper, working poor, but make too much by federal standards to get Medicaid or any other kind of benefits for the disabled child. What -- you've had -- we talked about repealing Obamacare. We talked about getting all that taken care of. Josh Hawley wants to cover preexisting conditions.
<Frances Watson> <Neutral> Should the Republicans hold onto the House in the Senate, you plan to move forward with any changes on health care? What can we expect?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> 100 percent, and we're making it so it's very -- very much more affordable. And what we've actually done, we've really taken Obamacare apart. We are keeping preexisting conditions. Many, many people are keeping -- you know -- of the ones I am keeping and Josh is keeping preexisting conditions.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We think it's important. But what we're doing, we got rid of the individual mandate in Obamacare, and we're coming up with some incredible plans, and we're taking care of everybody much better. Also, the remnants of Obamacare with keeping the cost down -- remember Obamacare used to go up 116% 125%, through a lot of good talented work we're keeping it way, way down. So I don't know if Obama is going to get the credit. I think we should get the credit, but frankly we're keeping the increases way down -- the premiums. So, we're doing a lot in a fairly short period of time, we're going to have something very special.
<Frances Watson> <Positive> What do you want your legacy to be, at the end of your presidency, whether it's a four-year term or an eight-year term, what do you want the children 10, 15, 20 years down the road to read in their history books about President Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's such a great question, and I literally -- it sounds like a pretty basic question. I don't think I've been asked that question for a long time, so I love it. Make America Great Again. That's what I'm doing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Make America Great Again. Those questions were so great about manufacturing, and about this and that exemptions. We're going to make America great again, it's already happening, and we're making America great by putting America first. We have been ripped off by every country in the world. Enemies, allies, that didn't matter.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> European Union has been brutal to us. You think of the European Union, so nice. Mexico Canada -- Canada is brutal to us. You know Canada has 300% tariffs on dairy products.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm all about a lot of things. Making America great again. With that being said, I think we've done very well on foreign policy. If you remember, before I came in, it looked like we're going to be war with North Korea and now we're getting along very nicely and it's moving along -- a beautiful process.
<Frances Watson> <Neutral> You talked to Kim yourself?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do talk to him.
<Frances Watson> <Negative> Is he, kind of [Inaudible]?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I get along -- honestly, I just know, get along with him really well. It started off a little bit of the rough side, you would say, but I get along with him, and that's good for us.
<Frances Watson> <Positive> Yeah, no, it's true.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, we don't need wars. And so I think our foreign policy is really good, but for me, it's Make America Great again.
<Frances Watson> <Positive> Are you concerned that perhaps maybe the voters aren't going to come out, because you were doing such a great job, and because the Republican Party is holding their own, are you concerned with the voters, being, maybe, just being complacent, and saying, hey someone else will take care of it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, and the word is complacent because it would be the only reason. Look, we have the greatest economy that we've ever had. And honestly, if you want to keep it, you can't have the Democrats get in, and you have to vote for Josh Hawley, you have to vote for, really, Republicans. Otherwise, it's not going to happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's going to go bad. We're up 55 percent since my election, fifty-five, on average. I mean, some companies are through the roof. Jobs are, you know, records for everybody African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, everybody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you want to blow it, then be complacent. If you want to blow it, vote for a Democrat, and you'll see those numbers go way, way down. Your wealth will go way down. So, I really think we're going to do very well. I hope so.
