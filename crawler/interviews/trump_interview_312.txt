<Candy Crowley> <Positive> Businessman and showman Donald Trump says he's thinking about running for president but can't announce anything until June after the airing of the finale of his reality show. Now in its 11th season, Celebrity Apprentice with the likes of Gary Busey and Meatloaf is currently the highest rated show on NBC.
<Candy Crowley> <Positive> Trump has the money to make a go of a campaign and name recognition alone is enough to keep him up there in the polls right now. But starting with an appearance on The View March 23rd
<Candy Crowley> <Neutral> This week an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed Trump tied for second among GOP primary voters for their choice of candidate. Among Tea Party supporters he finished first. A mid-March CNN poll found, among Republicans, 43% think President Obama definitely or probably was not born in the United States.
<Candy Crowley> <Negative> There are many theories on why Trump has stepped out on the birther issue: TV ratings, ego, politics -- or all of the above. Donald Trump when we come back.
<Candy Crowley> <Negative> We sat down with Donald Trump Friday at his offices saying we wanted to get past the birther issue. He said he preferred to talk about other things, too, but ten minutes later we were still on the subject.
<Candy Crowley> <Neutral> Next week, Trump on China, Libya and OPEC. Today, Trump and the widely debunked doubts about where the president was born.
<Candy Crowley> <Positive> OK, let's get this out of the way, because you have been making a lot of waves lately. You came loaded for bear with a birth certificate. You'll be happy to know -- I'm sorry, certification of live birth. It is good enough for the state of Hawaii and the State Department. The U.S. State Department recognizes these as legitimately...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it is not a birth certificate, Candy. And people are trying to figure out why isn't he giving his birth certificate? It is not a birth certificate. A certificate of live birth, and you can see that one that you have, and the one that I brought you, because that's the one that's on the Internet and all over the place, it doesn't even have a serial number. It doesn't have a signature, it doesn't have a signature, one that I saw on television has a stamp but that's not a signature.
<Candy Crowley> <Neutral> Right. But that's how they...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me, but that's not the one they were showing to everybody.
<Candy Crowley> <Negative> After it released a copy of the certificate in 2008, the Obama campaign said the serial number was blacked out for concern over Hawaiian procedure. Since then many news organizations and the Annenberg Fact Check Project saw the original with the serial number and embossed seal and a stamped signature. Officials in Hawaii say this is standard.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I just say very simply why doesn't he show his birth certificate? Why has he spent over $2 million in legal fees to keep this quiet and to keep this silent. When I listened today to the tape of the grandmother and she was saying he was born essentially in Kenya and then all of a sudden -- don't forget, this is when Barack Obama was hot as a pistol because it looked like he was going to get the nomination and they had a lot of people, a lot of handlers in there. All of a sudden you hear people all over the room, no, no, no, he was born in Hawaii. He was born in Hawaii.
<Candy Crowley> <Negative> But they say it was a misinterpretation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me, they drown her out. She was like -- there were a lot of people in that room. And she said Kenya, he was born right -- and then they started screaming, no, no, no, you mean Hawaii. You mean, Hawaii.
<Candy Crowley> <Neutral> Here's a portion of that taped international phone call.
<Unidentified Male> <Neutral> Was she present when he was born in Kenya?
<Unidentified Male> <Neutral> She said yes, she was present when Obama was born.
<Unidentified Male> <Neutral> Whereabouts was he born? I thought he was born in Kenya.
<Unidentified Male> <Neutral> No. He was born in America, not in Mombasa.
<Unidentified Male> <Neutral> Do you know where he was born? I thought he was born in Kenya. I was going to go by and see where he was born.
<Unidentified Male> <Neutral> Yes. She said he was born in Hawaii.
<Candy Crowley> <Neutral> You can hear the entire sometimes confusing conversation on our web site, CNN.com/sotu.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't like to talk about this issue too much because I really would rather talk about China, I would really rather talk about what OPEC is doing to destroy us. I would really rather talk about other things. But I'll be honest with you, I started this and I heard the question for the first time four weeks ago and I assumed, although I had heard about it for years, I assumed that he was born in the United States, meaning in Hawaii.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I assumed that. The more I go into it, the more suspect it is. Now, he doesn't have his birth certificate or he's not showing it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I wish he did have one, but he doesn't have it. There is a huge difference between a birth certificate -- and I can show you mine, it's upstairs and it's in great detail and it's certified by everybody and it's got signatures all over it. It's got a birth certificate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He shows a certificate of live birth. And a certificate of live birth is easy to get and it is not the same thing. It's a totally different thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And in many states a certificate of live birth you can't even get married or you can't get a driver's license with it. The fact is his own family doesn't know which hospital he was born in this Hawaii. And here's one other thing, wherever you were born, I can go to that hospital, and I can find out the name of your doctor, the name of the -- the number of your room...
<Candy Crowley> <Negative> My hospital...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...excuse me -- how much you paid, how much this, how much that. I can find the information. I guarantee you my hospital has all the information, how much my parents paid for that unfortunate day when I was brought into this world, this rather crazy world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the fact is, nobody has any information. And his people in the United States don't even know which hospital -- his relatives don't even know which hospital he was born in. So it's a very strange situation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's all I can tell you. And, you know, it's a very sad thing because the people, the birthers, they got labeled and they got labeled so negatively, and even the word birther is a negative word. And I always tell people, I was a very good student; I went to the best college; I went to great schools; I had very high aptitude. Because, if you come out and say, and even question, the press goes wild. They get angry at even the question. And the fact is, if he wasn't born in this country, he shouldn't be the president of the United States. [End Clip]
<Candy Crowley> <Neutral> In fact, two separate Honolulu papers published birth announcements, which Trump says he can explain.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was eight days later, after the supposed birth. It was eight days later. And many people that are on a certain side of this say his grandparents said -- they made the announcement.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're not talking about the same day. You're talking about eight days. A lot of things happen in eight days.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me. And the grandparents put that in because, obviously, they want him to be a United States citizen because, in those days, I mean, people were much more proud than they are today, unfortunately, for being a United States citizen. So they wanted him to be a citizen of the United States. For that purpose and also for hospitalization, for welfare, for this, for that, for all the other assets you get from being a United States citizen. So there are very smart people that say that's routinely done and that was done by his grandparents.
<Candy Crowley> <Neutral> I -- I just want to say, and then we'll move on...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Candy, it's eight days -- excuse me -- eight days later.
<Candy Crowley> <Positive> Well, I think you could make a case for people that -- whose birth announcements show up later. But I will tell you that we checked with both these papers earlier, not to this latest -- when you brought it back to the headlines, but the fact is that the hospitals reported this information to the papers and the papers printed it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Who knows? You're talking 50 years ago.
<Candy Crowley> <Positive> Nonetheless, there is enough here that's going to -- we're going to be talking about this 20 years from now, I can almost guarantee you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think -- you shouldn't be. Why? Here's my -- look, I'll leave it at this, because I'd much rather talk about China; I'd much rather talk about OPEC. I'd rather talk about how all these countries are ripping us off and how they shouldn't be and we can stop it easily. That's what I'd rather talk about. But I'll tell you, there's a real question -- and even you say you're going to be talking about this for 20 years. You shouldn't be talking. Why doesn't he give his birth certificate?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He says he has a birth certificate, and I hope does he. And by the way, you know who's going to be the happiest if he produced a birth certificate, a real birth certificate, not a certificate of live birth, which is not a birth certificate? I would be. I would be very happy. Somebody would say, oh, wouldn't that be bad for you? I said absolutely not. I would be very happy if he produced a real birth certificate. So either they don't have one, which is very bad, or there's something on it that he doesn't want people to see. And I think that would be the lesser of two evils, no matter what's on it.
<Candy Crowley> <Negative> Let me -- let me give you another conspiracy theory of a different sort, and that is from fellow Republicans who say -- who don't -- as you know, think this is a total losing issue for the Republican Party.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me -- 55 percent of the Republicans believe in this issue and 70 percent think that there's at least a good chance he wasn't born in this country.
<Candy Crowley> <Neutral> On the other hand...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think it's a losing issue.
<Candy Crowley> <Positive> Well, if you could get elected just by Republicans, I guess that's so. But if you look at the totality of the country...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you're right. You do have to go step by step.
<Candy Crowley> <Positive> Right. This gets me to the conspiracy theory, that this is something that is an issue to the base of the Republican Party, and by that they mean voters who vote in the primaries, and that this is a cynical play to get their attention...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By who?
<Candy Crowley> <Neutral> By you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I don't think so.
<Candy Crowley> <Neutral> By bringing this up and saying, hey, I'm thinking about running for president; by the way, I don't think the president really was born...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let him show me a birth certificate. How come nobody has any records of his hospitalization? They don't know his room number. They don't know the nurse. They don't know the doctor. Let him show me or let -- not me. Let him show a birth certificate. It's a problem for them. [Crosstalk] [Laughter]
<Candy Crowley> <Negative> Let me try to move this on just because I know we could get engulfed in this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And this is not conspiracy on my part, believe me.
<Candy Crowley> <Negative> And because I can also tell you that there are others in the Republican Party who say, I think he's trying to help the president. Because this sort of thing sounds crazy to a lot of the country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Those are fools. Those are fools. And I don't think there are those people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think anybody that would say that is a fool. I believe that this is a very bad issue for the president. I believe that there are a lot of very smart people, and I've had them call me, and I've had some say, yeah, get off that issue, Donald, you're better on China, OK, and you're better on the economy and you're better on jobs, because that is my strength.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They say, Donald, get off that issue; you're better on jobs and you're better talking about the world, especially as it pertains economically, OK? And I agree. But, you know what, a lot of very smart people are very confused by what's going on here. And they don't know why did he spend all this money and they don't know why hasn't he given his birth certificate?
<Candy Crowley> <Negative> Let me move on...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I think it's a very bad issue for the president, not for the Republican Party. [End Clip]
<Candy Crowley> <Negative> There is not the slightest indication that Donald Trump is finished talking up this issue. But when we come back, a taste of the Donald and what he sees as the OPEC rip-off.
<Candy Crowley> <Negative> Despite all evidence to the contrary, Donald Trump and I did get around to other subjects, his potential Republican rivals, Libya and the people he says are ruining the U.S. economy, oil- producing countries in the Middle East.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, the worst abuser of all -- I mean, the worst abuser is obviously OPEC. And I watched a show the other day where you had these oil analysts sitting around saying, you know, there's so much oil; we don't understand why the price -- it's up to $110; it's going to go up to $150 a barrel. You're going to be paying $7 or $8 a gallon for gasoline very soon. So these analysts are sitting around, Wall Street guys -- they say, we don't understand why oil is so high; there's so much of it; it's all over the place. And I want to almost scream into the television set, It's OPEC. The only they didn't -- they talked about the psychology...
<Candy Crowley> <Negative> So what -- I mean, in the end, there are certain things that even the U.S. doesn't control. And you've got this, sort of, angry -- I mean, I -- you, sort of, tap into this angry...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm not angry.
<Candy Crowley> <Positive> ... populist -- OK, aggressive populist...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can't believe that our politicians are so stupid to let people that we absolutely protect get away with it. Saudi Arabia wouldn't be there if it weren't for us. [End Clip]
<Candy Crowley> <Positive> You can see more of the world according to Trump next Sunday here on State of the Union. Until then
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> Donald Trump is now backing Mitt Romney for the Republican presidential nomination. You saw that live here on CNN just a little while ago. He made the endorsement in Las Vegas and he's joining us now live right here in The Situation Room. Donald Trump , thanks very much for coming in.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely, Wolf.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> I got to tell you. I was a little surprised that you endorsed Mitt Romney because over these several months, not everything you always said about him was positive. I'll play a clip of what you told our own Candy Crowley back in April.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Mitt Romney is a basically small business guy if you really think about it. He was a hedge fund, he was a fund guy. He walked away with some money from a very good company that he didn't create. He worked there. He didn't create.
<Candy Crowley> <Neutral> He did create companies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He'd close companies. He'd get rid of jobs. [End Clip]
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> All right, so what happened between April and now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all, it is political talk and second of all, he has done a great job. And I've done a good job and I've created a big company and he's done a really good job and put a lot of people to work. I also had never met him until that point.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I really didn't get to know him really until the last couple of months. And that was a long time prior to my getting to know him, but I have gotten to know him and he's a terrific guy. I don't know if he really comes out like he really is in person.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a warm, smart, tough cookie and that's what this country needs. We need somebody that's tough, that's going to stop China and OPEC and all these other nations from just ripping us up. And I think he can do it.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> And this notion that when he was running Bain Capital and having all these firms that was a lot outsourcing going to China and other companies, that's not a big deal anymore?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he's really saved a lot of companies. You know, Bain Capital, these guys, they go out and they take over really in many cases troubled companies. And many of those companies went on to become great companies. So you can always have the exception to the rule, but he saved a lot of companies and created a lot of jobs as you know, Wolf.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> Are you now going to back up your words with a lot of money -- you're obviously a very rich guy. Are you going to start giving him lots of money or his Super PAC, if you will? Because you can give unlimited amounts of money to the pro-Romney Super PAC.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll do whatever is necessary. I think he's a terrific guy. I think he'll be a terrific president. I think he'll really lead this country in the right direction. We're going in the wrong direction right now. The chief of the CBO just came out as you know and he said that unemployment is going to be at 9.2 percent next year, which was shocking and that our growth had been reduced to 1 percent if we're lucky. So, you know, when I see what's going on with this country and then I see all of what's happening with OPEC and China and many other countries, how they're taking advantage of us, I will do whatever is necessary to get him elected.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> I ask the question because you're in Vegas. I'll be blunt. Are you going to be for Mitt Romney what the owner of the Venetian is for Newt Gingrich?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, number one, Mitt has really been able to raise quite a bit of money, which is very impressive. So he doesn't need anything like that. And also I like Newt, you know, Newt is a friend of mind. I think Newt is a terrific guy in many, many ways and I do like him. But I don't think Mitt needs lots of money, but I'll certainly do whatever is necessary, however I can help. Whether they want me to make speeches, whether they want me to contribute, raise money, I'll do whatever I have to do. We need somebody great as a president. I think he'll be a great president.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> Ron Paul clearly disagrees with you. He issued a statement following your endorsement. He said this, Please explain to Republican voters in Nevada why they should consider the opinion of a billionaire from New York who endorsed the archenemy of all Republicans in Nevada and really the enemy of all Republicans in the United States. He's referring I guess to Harry Reid
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm friendly with many Democrats and with many Republicans and frankly, with many independents and maybe that's what you need a little bit. Because frankly, the way you have gridlock in Washington is disgraceful. I have many friends that are Democrats. I have many friends that are Republicans. And, look, I appreciate what Ron Paul says, but the fact is I have lots of good relationships on both sides of the aisle and I think that's what you need today. Washington is total gridlock.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> A few weeks ago, correct me if I'm wrong, you registered as an independent in New York, no longer as a Republican because you wanted to leave open the option potentially of running for president after the season ends for The Apprentice. If he doesn't get the nomination, let's say Newt Gingrich gets the nomination, would you consider running?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, then the options are always open. As you know, the laws prohibit me essentially from running during the course of The Apprentice. But on May 17th But I don't think that will happen. It was never my first choice and I told you a number of times I always wanted to endorse somebody and have that somebody go out, beat Obama and become a great president.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> Didn't make any difference to you that remember that debate you were going to moderate with News Max at the end of December. Newt Gingrich immediately accepted your invitation, Mitt Romney declined. Was that a factor at all?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, when he declined, you have to understand and I told you this, he called me. He couldn't have been nicer and he really would have done it if I had asked him to do it. I understood why. He was leading. He was doing well. And I understood the reasons and I didn't put any -- I really put no arm twisting, no anything on. And he decided that if he had the option, he wouldn't do it and I said that's fine. He was very respectful, very nice, couldn't have been nicer and so was Newt. I mean, they were great.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> Did those guys, any of the four for that matter who are still left standing, did they actually lobby you and ask you to support them?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, yes. And obviously Newt and Mitt were the ones that I was most interested in, but the answer is yes. Almost all of the candidates wanted my support because I represent not because I'm a nice person, I think I am, but not because I'm a nice person.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People see that I understand what's going on in the world. They see that I have the ability not to allow people in this country to get ripped off. And pretty soon we won't be a great country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There are those who say we're not a great country right now. We owe more than $15 trillion. We're this debt. We borrow from China. In three or four years, China will be a greater economic power than us because of what's happening. So people realize I understand that and I carry a lot of votes because really simply people tired of being ripped off. And that's what's happening to this country. We're being ripped off.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> Did you give Newt Gingrich a call today to give him a heads up on your decision?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I actually called him twice last night. I left a message. I hope it was the right number. I like him a lot. He's a friend of mine. I like him a lot.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> You know, you're a -- you know better than most, you're a controversial guy back in April, May, there was a poll that came out, a CNN/ORC poll, opinion of Donald Trump , favorable 31 percent, unfavorable 64 percent, 5 percent unsure. So here's the question. Is this going to help Mitt Romney your endorsement or hurt Mitt Romney?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I guess it's going to help because everybody wants it, but more importantly when I was thinking of running prior to leaving, if you look at Meet the Press I was leading in all the polls. A recent poll came out of which independent would you most like to see run and I was number one, easily number one in that one. So you can quote all the polls you want, but the polls that matter are those two polls. And most importantly, when I was running, I was number one the day before I left. Check out Meet the Press
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> All right, well, my favorite show is The Situation Room, but that's another story. Let's talk about some controversial comments he made here on CNN yesterday. I'll play the clip. He told Soledad O'Brien this. It's caused some controversy as you well know. Listen to this.
<Mitt Romney> <Negative> I'm in this race because I care about Americans. I'm not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there. If it needs repair, I'll fix it. [End Clip]
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> We played that whole long exchange yesterday, but the wrap against him is that he doesn't necessarily connect with average folks out there. Do have a problem with what he said yesterday?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think it was very unfair reporting actually because he said I have a safety net and I'll fix it if necessary. And I thought that was -- there are many people that don't understand what the press is talking about. I'm pretty good at English. I always did very nicely in English and if you let that sentence run on a little bit, as you did, some people don't let it run on, you actually did. There was something nothing -- it could have been said differently, I guess. Everything could be said differently, but he talked about a safety net and he talked about fixing it if he had to.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> It comes on the heels of some other comments when taken out of context that would be like a sort of a reel for the Democrats going into November, like to fire people who don't provide services, you like to fire people as we all know, as well, from time to time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sure, but the firing was very unfair, too because if you let that sentence run on, he was talking about insurance companies. And I saw ads that were made. I think Obama's people made an ad and up a couple other people where they ended it after the word fire. And that was very unfair because if you let the sentence run on, he was talking about insurance companies. So I think it's very unfair reporting.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> The whole notion of what you're going to do now. You're waiting now just to wrap it up, you're waiting to hear from the Romney campaign, from Mitt Romney himself whether you're going to give speeches on his behalf, organize fundraisers on his behalf or just write big checks on his behalf. Is that what we can anticipate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know what to anticipate. I gave my endorsement to Mitt Romney. I'm very proud of that. I think he'll do a great job against Obama. If he debates the way he's been debating and if he campaigns the way he's been campaigning, I think he'll beat Obama. I actually think easily because Obama has been a terrible president. So I think he'll actually beat Obama and, you know, I'm very proud. As far as doing, I'll do whatever I have to do. If they want me to make a speech, I'll make a speech. I'll do whatever I have to do.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> Donald Trump , thanks very much for coming in.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Wolf.
