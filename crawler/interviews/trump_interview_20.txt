<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> We are joined right now. It is our great pleasure to welcome the president, United States, Donald Trump, calling in. Mr. Trump, good morning to you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Good to have you on Fox and Friends today. [Laughs] As you said in your tweet, another slow news week. Let's start with the fact that -- the story that Griff just brought us, that it sounds like a former FBI lawyer -- it sounds like -- was doing something with the FISA application. That person got removed.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> And this goes to your argument that somebody at the FBI was out to get you, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it certainly does. And they were spying on my campaign and it went right up to the top. And everybody knows it. And now we're going to find out. You have Bull Durham, who's supposed to be the toughest. I've never met him. Never spoke to him. But he's supposed to be the smartest and th­­e best. And he works for Bill Barr, who is a great attorney general.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We would have maybe invented this thing a lot sooner had he been there originally. But you have some people that are great people, now, and -- patriotic people. They love our country. This was spying on my campaign, something that has never been done in the history of our country. This was an overthrow attempt at the presidency.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They tried to overthrow the presidency. This is a disgrace. But what -- I'm not surprised to see; it's just starting to come out. I think this is nothing compared that what you'll see over the next couple of weeks.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> These media --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These people are sick.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> These media outlets are saying that the FBI lawyer manipulated and altered key documents related to that warrant application so that they could get permission to surveil Carter Page. He was on with Maria -- Mornings with Maria -- a few minutes ago, and he says it's a cover up. Listen.
<Carter Page> <Negative> [Begin Video Clip] They have just been putting false information out there to the media, the Democrats and their allies in -- they're Washington -- in the media, constantly pushing lies after lies. And then finally, this gets picked up by a court. It gets picked up by the Comey-McCabe-FBI. And they got a warrant, a fraudulent warrant, I believe, to spy on myself as a way of getting into the Trump campaign.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> So, you --
<Carter Page> <Positive> There has been a continued cover up to this very day. We still don't have the truth, but hopefully we'll get that soon. [End Video Clip]
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> How does this compare with what happened with that Ukraine conversation? Democrats want to impeach you because of that conversation, but this looks pretty bad.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So my conversation was a perfect conversation. The Ukrainian president said, "What are they talking about?" There must think we're nuts in this country. And this conversation was flawless. It was appropriate. It was perfect. It was nice. It was everything. And they even said that. They came out and said it. Now, compare that -- as they try to impeach, and by the way, they've looked like fools over the last five days, as these interviews were -- these were their witnesses.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This was the best they've got. Adam Schiff is a sick puppy. He is a -- it's pretty incredible. Now, what you're going to see, I predict, will be perhaps the biggest scandal in the history of our country, political scandal. But I guess that's the biggest, because what's more important than a political --?
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> What are you talking -- what do you mean by that? What you mean by that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think you're going to see things that are going to be incredible, if it's done right. And I purposely stay out. I tell Bill Barr to handle everything. I wouldn't have to, I could get very much involved, but I purposely don't. And I haven't. And you know what? It's better that way, I guess. I don't have any obligation, legally, to do that, but I've let them handle it. So you have a FISA report coming out, which the word is it's "historic." That's what the word is. That's what I hear.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And if it's historic, you're going to see something. Then perhaps even more importantly, you have Durham coming out shortly thereafter. He's the U.S. attorney, and he's already announced it's criminal. And we'll see what happens. But --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you what. You have a lot of very, very bad people. And, you know, a lot of people say, "deep state." I don't like to use the word "deep state." So I just say they're really bad and sick people.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Mr. President, you say it could be historic. You have suggested in the past that this might go much higher than the Department of Justice, or the FBI during the Obama's administration. Are you suggesting it could actually go up into the West Wing of the Obama --?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're dealing at the highest levels of government. They were spying on my campaign. This is my opinion. I said it a long time ago. Remember when I put out a tweet and I talked about the "wiretapping" in quotes, meaning modern day version of whatever wiretapping may be. And all hell broke loose.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Well, how high did it go, Mr. President. How high did it go? Your idea?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Personally, I think it goes all the way. Okay? Because I think it's impossible --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> To Barack Obama? -- for Brennan and for Clapper and for all of these losers that you had over there. I think it's impossible for them to be doing things. And let's see what it all says. But it's impossible -- Susan Rice, the person that worked at the United Nations who went after FISA reports and went after reports like she ate them for lunch.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, you know, you look at the previous administration that -- they went after like a few. And she was getting them by -- at a level nobody's ever even imagined before, and it had nothing to do with her. Now, I think this goes to the highest level. I hate to say it. I think it's a disgrace. They thought I was going to win, and they said, "How could we stop him?" They wrote up the phony fake dossier, the disgusting fake dossier, and they tried to have it put out prior to the election.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And just to show how incompetent they were, they spent millions and millions of dollars. Hillary Clinton paid for it and the Democrats, a lot of it had to do, they say, with Ukraine.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> But Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's very interesting. It's very interesting. They have this server right, from the DNC Democratic National Committee.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Who has the server?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The FBI went in and they told him, "Get out of here. You're not getting it. We're not giving it to you." They gave the server to Crowd Strike or whatever it's called, which is a company owned by a very wealthy Ukrainian. And I still want to see that server. You know, the FBI has never gotten that server.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's a big part of this whole thing. Why did they give it to a Ukrainian company?
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Are you or they did that? Are you sure they gave it to Ukraine?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that's what the word is. And that's what I asked actually in my phone call, you know. I mean, I asked that very point blank because we're looking for corruption. There's tremendous corruption we're looking for. Why should we be giving hundreds of millions of dollars to countries where there's this kind of corruption?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right. If you look at my call, I said, you know, corruption -- I think he said it to me. He's looking. He got elected on the basis of corruption. And I also, by the way, going back to that, why isn't Germany putting up money? Why isn't France putting up money? Why isn't all of the European nations -- why are they putting up? You have the European Union and they're benefited in a lot more by --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Well, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- paying than we are. Well, Mr. President, can I ask you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's like a massive wall? Yes. Why aren't they putting up money? How come it's always the United States that puts up money, the suckers? Why is it always the United States? And these are the questions I ask and continue to ask him.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> True. Mr. President the best you can. I know you've said that from day one about wiretapping. And you felt as though the previous administration basically seems to have set you up to really struggle for the first three years. Who is your source, or what are your sources that are telling you, that the Obama administration was out to really hurt your administration?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, first of all, Brian, I haven't struggled because I've done more in the first two and a half years than any president in the history of our country. And almost everybody admits it. Between rebuilding our military, the biggest tax cut in history.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Regulation --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Would you say they've been in your way? Would you say they've been in your way?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good. Well, wait a second. Two Supreme Court justices. Within a few weeks, we'll have one hundred and eighty-two federal judges. It's a record. So I've done more than anybody that ever had.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Understood.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The position to [Inaudible] But they haven't made it pleasant. They're bad people. They hurt a lot of innocent people. People came down here, they got served subpoenas by Mueller and the crew. And they went through two and a half years. They found nothing. So why would you say that? I think we've had the most productive presidency ever for the first two and a half years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it doesn't mean that it was pleasant.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> I know, I know. But maybe I should have been clearer. My point is this. I know you've had that point of view and some things are coming that direction to prove it. But who is your source that's telling you this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can't tell you that. I can only say that we have a lot of information that a lot of bad things happened. And when you look at Strzok and Page with the insurance policy, where, you know -- the two lovers, the two great lovers from the FBI. Where he's saying, "Oh, she's going to win 100 million to nothing, but just in case she loses, we have an insurance policy." Well, that means, you know, "We're going to take him down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to take down the president." You wouldn't even believe this is possible. But the insurance policy is a very big find. Finding that text. And the only reason we found it was they didn't want to use their private servers for a very bad reason. Okay? So they use the public server. They use the FBI server.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So here's the thing. We have so many -- regardless of what's coming out, okay? The information that we have now is beyond belief already. But what they have coming out, I hear, is historic. That's the way it was explained. I heard some stories.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> Coming out and -- All right, Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Of course the fake news will try and downplay it, but I don't think you can downplay this.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Not now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Fake news is part of it. You know, the Democrats and the fake news, they're one and the same. They will downplay it because I like -- I see these hearings where we have a great day. And then you pick up the phony New York Times, which is a total phony paper -- I don't read it anywhere, you can't read it. It's not even -- it has no relationship to the truth.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you read a story that took place, and they don't tell you what happened. They only put in the bad. They don't put in the good. Same thing with The Washington Post. It's a phony paper. We don't have it in the White House.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> Mr. President, so --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we saved a lot of money.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> -- when we're watching those closing arguments yesterday, Adam Schiff -- Democrats love it. You know, I'm sure he's getting pat on the back every time he walks down the halls in Washington, because people are saying, "Keep pushing, keep pushing. We want impeachment." But if you ask Republicans, and we're going to play a soundbite of his closing arguments, they say this is all theatrics.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> Watch this and we're going to get your reaction.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Adam Schiff> <Negative> [Begin Video Clip] It came down to the fact that the day after Bob Mueller testified, the day after Bob Mueller testified, that Donald Trump invited Russian interference. "Hey, Russia, if you're listening, come get Hillary's emails." And later that day, they tried to hack her server. The day after that, Donald Trump is back on the phone asking another nation to involve itself in another U.S. election.
<Adam Schiff> <Neutral> That says to me, this president believes he is above the law, beyond accountability. [End Video Clip]
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Mr. President was there quid pro quo, extortion, bribery?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, not at all. And let me tell you, he's a sick puppy. He's so sick. This guy is so -- I’ve been going through it for two and a half years about Russia. I've been tougher on Russia than any president in history. But for two and a half years, I've had to listen. This was their talking point, Trump and Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if you take a look at it, just look at the facts. Even look at what I've done for Ukraine by giving them tank busters, by giving them stuff. And Obama would send pillows and sheets. He wouldn't send anything else. It's the whole thing. Now Schiff, remember this? He makes it all up. He's sick. There's something wrong with him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So he made up my phone call. He made it up. He made up a phone call. And then when I released it, everybody was embarrassed. And crazy Nancy Pelosi, who, by the way, is going to go down as the worst speaker in the history of the House of Representatives, she hasn't done anything. Well, she said she's like paralyzed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She cannot do anything.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> And Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I predict she won't do USMCA, because Richard Trumka, who's a good guy, but a big union guy -- only cares about a union. Richard Trumka has her mortified. She won't do USMCA and everybody in the country wants it, the farmers, the manufacturers. But Richard Trumka has her -- like he plays her like a fiddle.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I predict you won't even do it. She -- and, by the way, she's got such pressure on her to do it. All she has to do is put it to a vote. She's holding it for six months. It's growing dust on her desk, and Mexico and Canada calling, saying, "What's going on? Where is our agreement?" They signed it. They're all set.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Mr. President, a couple of days ago, your ambassador to the United -- to the E.U., Mr. Sondland, in his opening statement said that there was quid pro quo. "There was quid pro quo," he said because you wanted an investigation into corruption, in exchange for a visit to the White House or something like that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, well, that's total nonsense. I do want -- always corruption. I say that to anybody. Why should we give money to a country that's known corrupt? It's a very corrupt country. I mean, I love the people in Ukraine. I know Ukrainian people. They're great people. But it's known as being the third most corrupt country in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now, with this guy who, by the way, I hardly know him. Okay?
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Sondland?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. I've spoken to him a few times. How about the guy with the telephone? How about that one? I guarantee you that never took place. He said he's sitting there listening to me. I spoke so few times to him. But the guy yesterday on the telephone, David Holmes, "Yes, I heard the conversation." Well, I have really good hearing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I've been watching guys for 40 years make phone calls. And I can't hear when -- you could be two feet away; I can't hear people making calls. I can't hear the other side, the phones up in the air. Unless you have it on the speaker phone, you can't do it. That was a total phony deal. That was a phone -- you know, again.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Call it Deep State. Call it --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Mr. President. Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Call it anti-Trump people.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Your ambassador said that there was quid pro quo because you wanted an investigation into corruption, but it involved Joe Biden and Hunter Biden. And then it becomes like, look, "He's going after dirt on the Bidens because Joe Biden could be his opponent in 2020."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all, that's not true. Okay. Number one, it's absolutely not true. Now, then, you have to say, if you saw Joe Biden's --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Which part is not true?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Joe Biden is corrupt. It's not true what he said. Now, what he said, also, is, "There was no quid pro quo. I want nothing." Remember was trending number one. "I want nothing." He said that when he was questioned.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> He did.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He, and by the way, check out his lawyers, they're Hillary Clinton lawyers. This guy has Hillary Clinton, the lawyers, their Democrats.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Sondland.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But he's sitting there -- Sondland. Yes. He's sitting there with Clinton lawyers. They're passing him notes all the time. And he didn't put the most important phrase in his 22-page statement that he read. The most important phrase was, "I want nothing" -- twice I said it -- "I want nothing. I want nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want no quid pro quo. Have President Zelensky do whatever is right." Something to that effect. And they didn't put that in.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was the end of him. I turned off the television. That's what he said. Now, with all of that, of course, you have to look at corruption. Are we going to be sending massive amounts of money to a country, and they're corrupt, and they steal the money, and it goes into everybody's bank accounts? So you have to look at that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I will tell you this about Joe Biden. I never said it specifically on him. But I watched Joe Biden with the prosecutor, who a lot of people said was a great prosecutor, and they took him off. And he was prosecuting that company. And the kid who'd never made 10 cents in his life and all of a sudden is making millions of dollars a day, I mean, you tell me. This is a guy who got thrown out of the Navy dishonorably --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> But --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He gets thrown out of the Navy shortly thereafter and makes no money. Went through, made no money --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> But Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And all of the sudden --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> No, I hear you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- becomes VP is making millions and millions of dollars, not only from there, but from China. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, Mr. President, the accusation is this, that you're using aid, taxpayer dollars, to attack a political opponent in Joe Biden. And you say, you do say, "I wanted to hold up that aid because of corruption," but you also have the phone calls --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. Two reasons.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> For corruption because it's known. I want to make sure the money is going to be spent properly. But there's another reason that is maybe to me the most important.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Which is?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why isn't Germany, France, the European Union, why aren't all those countries in Europe, why aren't they paying? Why is it always the United States, the sucker? I got elected on that.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> But they do give aid.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> They do give aid. We give more. We always have. But, Mr. President, you decide to say Rudy Giuliani, a longtime friend, mayor and prosecutor, you send him into the Ukraine. I want you to hear with Ambassador Sondland said, and it's been pretty consistent among State Department workers. It seems like Rudy Giuliani was getting under a lot of people's skin.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> I want you to listen to what he said.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Through the --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> I want you here. Listen. I've known for a long time, too. Let's listen.
<Gordon Sondland> <Positive> [Begin Video Clip] Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker, and I worked with Mr. Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine matters at the express direction of the president of the United States. We did not want to work with Mr. Giuliani. We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose a very important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine.
<Gordon Sondland> <Neutral> [End Video Clip]
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> So why was it necessary to put Rudy in the middle of the Ukraine, a country he knew little about, as opposed to let the people do their jobs there and just give given the same mission?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. First of all, Volker, I don't know him. Don't know him. But this guy, Sondland, hardly know him. I've had a couple of conversations with him. I see him hanging around, you know, when I go to Europe. But he was really the European Union ambassador, and all of a sudden he's working on this, and, you know, ask about that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Rick Perry, I know very well. Frankly, I'd like Rick to make a statement, and Rick would make a statement. He's a great guy. I think he already made a statement. Great guy. Rudy is a great crime fighter. Rudy is the best mayor in the history of New York City. Rudy Giuliani is a very legendary figure in our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Rudy was a U.S. attorney. He also worked at the Justice Department. Believe me, this kind of crap wouldn't have happened in the Justice Department if Rudy Giuliani was the attorney general, just like I believe Bill Barr will straighten it out and straighten it out for good. But Rudy Giuliani was one of the great crime fighters of all time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's also a friend of mine. He's a great person. He's like an iconic figure in this country for two reasons. He was the greatest mayor in the history of New York, and he was the greatest crime fighter, probably, in the last 50 years. When you're dealing with a corrupt country, if Rudy Giuliani's -- he's got credentials because of his reputation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When Rudy Giuliani goes there, and you hear it's a corrupt country, I mean, it means a lot. It's mean a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But two of his sources are indicted on -- are right now in jail. Those are two of his sources, and one of his other sources is looked at as a corrupt figure. So in the end, it seems like you had this. You had State Department and Rudy Giuliani working against each other. And then the accusation comes in that your ambassador is being tarnished by Rudy Giuliani.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, the ambassador, the woman, she wouldn't even put up -- she's an Obama person, you know. But I said, "Why are you being so kind?" "Well, sir, she's a woman. We have to be nice." She's very tough. I've heard bad things. And by the way, when I was talking to President Zelensky, it's right on the phone.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You can read it. He didn't like her. He brought up her name, and he didn't like her at all. How do you have an ambassador when the president, the new president, does not? Because she was so wedded in. And don't forget, Ukraine hated me. They were after me in the election. They wanted Hillary Clinton to win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And when I won, all of a sudden they became so nice. They were doing -- they had to make up -- there many articles where they had to, you know, get to be friendly, you know, because we're like a gravy train for them, okay? We're like their gravy train. So they were totally in favor of Hillary Clinton. But this ambassador that, you know, everybody says is so wonderful?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She wouldn't hang my picture in the embassy. Okay? She's in charge of the embassy. She wouldn't hang it. It took like a year and a half or two years for her to get the picture up. She said bad things about me. She wouldn't defend me. And I have the right to change an Ambassador. And Rudy didn't say good things, but he wasn't crazy about it. You know, it wasn't like a major topic.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I have the right to change. This was an Obama person -- didn't want to hang my picture in the embassy. Standard is you put the president of the United States pictured at an embassy. This was not an angel, this woman, okay? And there are a lot of things that she did that I didn't like. And we will talk about that at some time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I just want to let you know, this was not a baby that we're dealing with.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> There was one woman who was in all of these testimonies this week who was sticking up for you, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik. She was asking questions, doing her job. She said her constituents want to get to the bottom of what happened with the Bidens and that investigation. She questioned Tim Morrison and Kurt Volker on Capitol Hill.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> Listen to this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Elise Stefanik> <Positive> [Begin Video Clip] But the truth is, the facts are indeed not complicated. And I'm going to close out with two questions for the both of you. Did Ukraine open investigation into the Biden's? Mr. Morrison.
<Tim Morrison> <Neutral> Not to my knowledge, ma'am.
<Elise Stefanik> <Neutral> Ambassador Volker.
<Kurt Volker> <Negative> Not to my knowledge, either.
<Elise Stefanik> <Negative> Did either of you ever have any evidence of quid pro quo? Mr. Morrison.
<Tim Morrison> <Negative> No, ma'am.
<Elise Stefanik> <Neutral> Ambassador Volker.
<Kurt Volker> <Negative> I did not.
<Elise Stefanik> <Neutral> Any evidence of bribery?
<Tim Morrison> <Negative> No, ma'am.
<Kurt Volker> <Negative> No, ma'am. [End Video Clip]
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> She's been racked over the coals for that. Kellyanne Conway's husband was one of the ones that called her trash.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I'll tell you, first of all, she's become a star. You know, every time you do something, you have guys like Jim Jordan and Meadows, or all these guys, they've been around and they're stars, but they've been stars. Every once in a while you meet a new star. I know a lot about stardom. I know a lot about it. I've made plenty of them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I'll tell you what, this young woman from upstate New York, she has become a star. Her way -- you know, you can never define exactly what it is. You understand that you're a star. Okay? Why? Who the hell knows? But you're a star. There aren't many of them. But what happens is she has become a star. Her mannerism, her way of talking, her --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> She's direct. Right to the point.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. It's just the whole thing. It just works. She's a tremendous person. She was fantastic during the hearings. Turner, every -- so many people there were so great. But you know what? The bottom line is all of those witnesses, they're all shifty Schiff, don't forget. There was no due process. You can't have lawyers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We couldn't have any witnesses. We want to call the whistleblower. But, you know, who I want as the first witness? Because, frankly, I want a trial. You know, I could -- think I can have it.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> You want to a trial?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I would look -- number one. They should never, ever impeach. This is not envy. I watched five people on your network yesterday say there's nothing here. Andy McCarthy. How about Kent and the special prosecutor?
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Ken Starr?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And special counsel, Ken Starr? He was fantastic. He said, "There's nothing here." So ready? Number one, there should never be an impeachment. This is not an impeachment. That phone call was totally appropriate. Okay. Totally. But assuming these people are as sleazy as they are, and Nancy Pelosi is totally incompetent, she's lost absolutely lost -- she doesn't know what she's doing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She hasn't done anything. She can't get anything approved. Everybody's working on this, and they just got blown away because they put their witnesses up. And we're not going to get USMCA --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> So you want a trial?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- farmers and everyone is going to vote against Democrats like you've never seen before. But if they do put it up, because they're crazy, I mean, Adam Schiff is a nut job. Listen to this. Adam Schiff gets up before Congress and he made up my statement.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I said, "Who made that statement?".
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right, Mr. President?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He made it up. And then after he got caught three days later, he started saying parody.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Mr. President?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The thing I did that was right, Brian, the thing I did that was right was I released the transcript of the call immediately. Had I not done that; I would have had a big problem. A big problem because they all lied about my call. My call was perfect. If you heard Adam Schiff's made up version of my call, I mean, it was the worst thing I've ever heard.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said, "How could that be possible?" And you know the sad part? Because he made it in the halls of Congress, he has immunity. I can't sue him.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The Republican Party can't sue him. Now, one other thing before we get off the Republican Party --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know. We can keep this going all day, right? It's easy. But look, the Republican Party has never been more unified. Both the Senate and the House. Mitch, Lindsey, I could name 20 names up there. I could -- they have never had -- look, we won 196 to nothing. That never happens. You know, I always say the Democrats are lousy politicians to have lousy policy, but they stick together, and they're vicious.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right. Well --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're more vicious, frankly. But the Republicans, they have a tendency -- they break up. They don't -- the Republicans, I have never seen anything like --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They're sticking together.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> We understand that there were six Republican senators -- this is perfect transition into this question -- who talked to you yesterday --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> -- along with the White House lawyer. I know Jared Kushner was there. You're trying to figure out some sort of strategy going forward because --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> -- it does look as if Nancy Pelosi, you know, her back is up against the wall. She's going to have to go ahead and proceed with the impeachment vote. It's going to wind up in the Senate. And you say that you -- to your earlier point -- you want a full trial because then you will wind up with, according to this story, due process, which you feel you did not get with Adam Schiff.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Which means you can call your own witnesses, and you would love to see Hunter Biden in the chair to answer all those questions about Ukraine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there's only one person I want more than where's Hunter? And that is Adam Schiff. I want to put that guy with his, with his way. I want…
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> What's your first question for Adam Schiff?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I almost said something that might have been slightly controversial.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I didn't. I'm learning. See that Steve? I'm learning. But after all these years, I finally learned. But look, I want to see Adam Schiff testify about the whistleblower who is a fake whistleblower, because the whistleblower report was about my conversation with the president of Ukraine. It bored no relationship.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It said there were eight, seven or eight, quid pro quos. That were none. It bore no relationship to my call. Nobody brings that out. The whistle blower is, in my opinion, a political operative, just like his lawyer, who is one of the worst people in Washington.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Do you think you know who it is?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know exactly who it is. Everybody does.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Is he still there? Does he go to meetings --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Everybody does --
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> -- does he go to meetings?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And by the way, you know who the whistleblower is, too. Otherwise, you're not doing your job. You know the -- everybody knows it. If the whistleblower were on the other side, they would have revealed the whistleblower two months ago.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the Democrats and their machine, the media machine, the fake, corrupt media, they protect. But you know who the whistleblower is. So do I. I know it. But I want the whistleblower who put in a false report to testify. I want to know, why did the IG put in the report? You have an IG, right? Why did the IG instead of saying, "Let me take the report.
<Question> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you so much for joining Hill TV, we really appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Question> <Negative> Mr. President, new developments on Iran. You said that all options are on the table. Do you believe right now that you have the co- authority to strike Iran without Congress?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. I do believe that. But, we've been keeping Congress abreast of what we're doing Saagar, and I think it's, something they appreciate. We had a lot of folks over the other day as you know, told 'em what was happening, what was going on. We were pretty close to maybe making the decision to strike and then I decided not to do it. Nobody went out, by the way, I was gonna make that decision by a certain time and I decided not to do it because it wasn't really proportional.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, no but I like, I like the idea of keeping Congress abreast, but I wouldn't have to do that.
<Question> <Positive> Sure. Nancy Pelosi actually said you must have Congressional approval. So you disagree with her on that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I disagree. I think most people seem to disagree, but I do like keeping them, they have ideas that intelligent people, they'll come up with some thoughts. I actually learned a couple of things, the other day when we had our meeting with Congress which were, I think helpful to me, but, I do like keeping them abreast, but I don't have to do it legally.
<Question> <Negative> Sure. Mr. President, you said that initially, that you didn't have the death toll. So how and when did you get the death toll appraisal for before you were going to go forward with the strike? Because there's some confusion on the timeline.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sure. Well, this is a process that was going on all day and maybe even the day before as to what we were gonna do, what targets. And we had certain targets picked out by a certain time. And I was gonna make a decision some time at the end of the day and I said, "Come see me at the end of the day." And at the end of the day, they came in and they told me at, what they wanted to do. I said, "How many people would die?" Because again, they knocked down a drone with nobody in it. It's not… you know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me now go to the White House. Ask the president to declassify his conversation so that it has to match up." He didn't do that. So what you do is you have a whistleblower with a fake story, just like -- it's just as fake as Schiff's story. That's why a lot of people think that Schiff basically is, essentially, the whistleblower.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He already told the whistle blower what to do. I mean, his whole story is that he doesn't know the whistleblower. If he doesn't, then he's the only person in Washington that doesn't. And it's already been acknowledged that his staff met with the whistleblower. Okay, it is probably more than --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> All right. Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Who I what to testify most is shifty Schiff. And I want to find out, why did he make up my statement? He made up my statement, and I want to find that out. Why did shifty Schiff, who's a crooked politician, he's a corrupt politician, why did he make up my statement? He made up a statement. And I'm listen to it --
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> Because they didn't think you were going to release the transcript.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, he -- that's right. Exactly. Because where this whole thing fell apart and where, frankly, the Republicans became so incredibly unified is after they read my statement --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- every one of them said -- and only the ones that are a little off on my statement are the people, that haven't quite read it yet. To say, "Well, this isn't an impeachable -- [Crosstalk]
<Question> <Negative> So to be clear sir, they didn't tell you initially in the strike a 150 people would die?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because we didn't even know the targets initially. So the targets came in and I said, "How many people would die?" And they got back to me very quickly and they said, "It could be a 150, it could be more than 150. But it could be a 150." I said ", that doesn't sound good to me, I don't think it's fair, I don't think it's right." They knocked down a drone, they should not do that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But if you think about it, we're knocking out a150, maybe more than that, so I didn't like that.
<Question> <Negative> Mr. President, you just said that a military strike would've been disproportionate for downing an unmanned drone, so why even consider military action at all?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I think we might need military action, we'll see what happens. Today we did very heavy sanctions, Iran is not doing well. You know, when I was, first elected we came into office, Iran was a terror, they were all over. We had anywhere from 14 to 18 points of confliction, they were behind every single one of them, and all of a sudden it works out that now it's, a little bit different, now they're having riots, they're having inflation at 40, 45 percent, it's very hard for them to do what they have to do. It's, they're pulling back all over and that's sh... I'm saying that's a good thing, not a bad thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we put additional sanctions on today, strong sanctions, we have strong sanctions. Their oil is way, way down and they're having difficulty and they can be a very successful nation, they can be a tremendous nation immediately, can start tomorrow. Or they can, not do so well for a long number of years, and we'll see what happens, but I hope, I hope they agree that you know they have great potential.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I say that about North Korea, they're... the relationship is very good, no nuclear testing, we got our as you know we got our hostages back, so many things have happened there, it was when I came in, that was looking like war, President Obama thought it was gonna be war. Okay, we had no relationship before I got here with North Korea, no relationship whatsoever, nuclear testing all over the place, ballistic missile testing, that was going to be a war.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And now, it doesn't feel that way. We'll see what happens, but it certainly doesn't feel that way, the relationship is good, it's a much different thing. I can say something on Iran if it's, it's what we did with Iran where they're screaming "Death to America" as they're signing the document. They're signing a document it was improperly done as far as Congress is concerned.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know when you talk about a treaty, that was not properly done, Congress never did what they were supposed to do. So it was a defective document, it was a ridiculous deal, a $150 billlion they were getting and $1.8 billion in cash. And John Kerry, who by the way has totally violated the Logan Act, if you look at what he's done, 'cause he talks to them all the time, John and I'm sure he says, "Don't make a deal, don't make a deal." Because maybe it look... makes them look better.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Well, if you read it, Democrats are going to say it was quid pro quo. If you are a conservative, you're going to say --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. They can't. They can't.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Well, they're saying that it was. They believe in a roundabout way that it was. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Adam Schiff says what I said, too, and it was totally different.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> But the bottom line is, is this an impeachable offense? Did you do anything that they can impeach you for?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's nothing there. In fact, they asked these terrible witnesses yesterday. Again, I don't even know these people. You know, I come to Washington. So you've had Bush and you have never-Trumpers. So you have Bush. You have Clinton. You have Obama. So you have 24 years of people in positions, right? Then I come in with no experience, which is a good thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I know life, and I come in, and I end up with thousands of people that are never-Trumpers, Clinton's people, and sometimes the never-Trumpers are worse than Clinton and Obama people, believe me. You know, I mean, it's an amazing phenomena.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> But that's one thing -- President Obama released every --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, Brian?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Probably he says, "Wait till after the election. Because if Trump loses, you'll deal with a stiff, you'll deal with somebody that will give you everything, just like they did." But John Kerry said that he intends that and he thinks the money will be used for terror. I don't know if you remember that. But they asked him the question, "With all this money that you're giving to Iran," this was the number one nation of terror.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They said, "Do you think the money will be used for terror?" He says, "Yeah, some of it's gonna be used for terror." Or something to that effect. That's unbelievable. So it was a horrible deal, and the other thing, it comes due very shortly. So they have an absolute path to nuclear weapons, they can not have a nuclear weapon, and I don't want them supporting terrorism.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I don't know if you know what's happened, but there's been a lot less money going out to terror from Iran because they don't have so much money now. So we'll see what happens, I hope it works out. I think it will eventually work out, they can do it very quickly, they can take a long time, but they've got a lot of problems.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And when I first came here, they were looking to take over the whole Middle East, and they would've done it. If I weren't here, most likely they would've been able to do that.
<Question> <Neutral> Two questions for you sir. First off, you mentioned, you mentioned Kim Jong-un and the North Korean Deal, he sent you a letter recently, can you tell us a little bit about what's in that letter?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well it was a very nice letter, and it was actually a happy birthday letter if you want to know the truth, it was my birthday. And he sent me a beautiful letter, happy birthday, which was nice. Very nice.
<Question> <Positive> And you sent him one as well, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I sent him a thank you letter, yeah I then sent him a note.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Yes?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, listen to this for a second. With no experience at doing this -- but I've had a lot of experience in life. And we're doing great as a country and we’re respected again as a country, we were not respected -- with no experience, I come to Washington. I've defeated the Clinton dynasty. I've defeated the Bush dynasty, and I've defeated the Obama whatever you want to call it. Right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The three biggest. I've defeated them all at one time with no experience. The hatred is incredible. But I have to deal with crazy Nancy. I mean, she's crazy as a bedbug. She is nuts. And what she's doing -- and she's not talented. She's highly overrated -- all she's doing is sitting. She's not doing any work for the people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And now it turns out that the whole impeachment thing is a scam.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Okay. Gotcha. So --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And now on top of it, now you're starting to get some feedback that the IG report is coming out. And I think that will be --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Explosive.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- the greatest political scandal in the history of our country.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> If we could -- now let's switch. And let's talk a little bit about 2020.
<Question> <Negative> And then the final question on the DNC, the DNC says the Democratic debates, they think they're gonna get better ratings in the first two nights than in the tw... in the 2016 debate in which you appear. How do you think the American people are gonna react to those and what are you gonna be reacting to?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I-I really don't know. I know we had very high ratings, we had the highest ratings in the history of that world. And, from all the way at the beginning, from the Republican debates as you know, you covered them we had very big ratings and I don't know. I mean it, it could be that there's curiosity to see how bad, it's a disaster going on over there, so we'll see…
<Question> <Positive> Well Joe, Joe Biden's going into this debate as a front runner. Do you think that this debate is his to lose?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, I think he can only go down, I don't think he's going up. He's, he does that, he doesn't have, look, there's something different, he's a different person than he was four or five years ago, and he wasn't so hot four or five years ago. And how he doesn't get President Obama to endorse him, there has to be some reason why he's not endorsing him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was the Vice President, they seemed to have gotten along, and how President Obama's not endorsing him is rather a big secret. If you want to know, if you know the answer, please let me know because I think it's very ba... and then he goes and lies and says, "I asked the President not to endorse me." Give me a break.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He said, he asked the president because he's embarrassed by the fact that Obama's not endorsing him, so he goes out and says, I asked President Obama not to endorse me. Well, he was trying to get the endorsement, so it could be that President Obama knows something. But there is something going on in that brain of his.
<Question> <Positive> Well, what do you mean when you say -- I've heard you say this a couple times that something's different about him, but what exactly are you talking about?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he's off, he's, he's different. I mean we've all known him a long time. I don't know him, but I've seen him for a long time, and frankly he looks different, he sounds different, and he thinks different. Other than that, I hope he does very well.
<Question> <Neutral> And then what, what are you gonna be looking for in that debate?
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Well, I'd like -- well, let me just interrupt for a second. Mr. President, you said we know the name of the whistleblower. We've seen names on the Internet. We have no idea who the whistleblower is.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I don't believe it. Steve, can I tell you -- [Crosstalk]
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> But it's -- all right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think Steve has ever told a lie, Ainsley and Brian, in his life. But that one I'm sort of thinking. All right. Come on.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> So you expect to --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm always telling people I watch your show in the morning. I don't watch the garbage. The other garbage.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> We've seen names online, Mr. President. But we don't have any verification.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm looking for nothing in that debate. I guess it's really a big race to who can give away the most and who can raise taxes the most. One of the big things I see, look I gave the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, one of their big things is to eliminate the tax cut and raise everybody's taxes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said, "I don't think that's gonna play too well." And our country's doing well, we could have, we're online or on, in fact, they just announced it I guess yesterday... if June just sort of finishes just a little bit just okay, it's one of the best June's in 80 years. I think the best June in 80 years in many categories.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it's definitely the best June in 50... just think of that, June is the best and you know they talk about tariffs, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars from China and others, and yet we're having the best month June, in 80 years. So a lot of people are starting to say I'm right, Mexico has been, really working hard on the border, the numbers are way down, you saw that.
<Question> <Positive> Do you see, or do you think they're doing a good enough job?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think they're doing, so far they're doing a good job and hopefully they're gonna do even a better job, but the numbers are way down. They've been trying to get this for 45 years from Mexico, and I got it. I got it in one day and I want to thank Mexico, and so far they're doing a good job. Yeah, you seen the numbers, they're way down.
<Question> <Positive> Yeah. Well, one last question on the Supreme Court. Will you put forward a nominee, between now and the election if there's an opening on the Supreme Court?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Would I do that? Of course. You have any recommendation?
<Question> <Positive> Well you have a big long list, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do, have a good list. I have a good list already chosen, I have a beautiful list of great, very talented people, absolutely.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Yeah, and it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter anyway. We're not going to use it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You don't need verification. You know exactly who it is. But I like that you say that.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> So, Mr. President, you expect an impeachment vote, you expect to get impeached and would you say you said you embrace the idea --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't expect it.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> You don't expect it? You don't expect Democrats are going to vote for this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's very hard for them to impeach you when they have absolutely nothing. No, I would expect that -- okay. Ready? You've seen the polls over the last week. I'm going through the roof. In Wisconsin, I'm way up over every Democrat.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> You are.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The swing states, which is the important one. You know, you have two elections. You have Electoral College, you have popularity. I like to go for the Electoral College. By the way, for me to win the popular vote would be much easier than -- the Electoral College is much harder to win. Much harder. You have to go to many more places, etc., etc.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But if you look at the swing states, I'm way up at every one of them because of the impeachment thing. And it's crazy what's going on. Because the people get it. It's a hoax. This is a continuation of the witch hunt which has gone on from before I got elected.
<Question> <Neutral> How do you square that with Merrick Garland?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I have a lot of respect for Judge Garland, by the way, I have to tell you that. I, I know people that know him, I'll tell you who told me incredible things about him, is Justice, now Justice Kavanaugh. Because they served together. I said, "Tell me," I'm revealing a little bit, that's okay. I said, "Tell me, what kind of a guy is Judge Garland?" He said, "He's an incredible guy, Liberal, brilliant, and a great guy." That was Judge Kavanaugh said that, now, now Justice Kavanaugh.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I was impressed. I've known many people that know, I-I know a lot of people that know Judge Garland and I will tell you um, I've heard incredible things about him.
<Question> <Positive> Well they're telling us we have to go in for the print section Mr. President, so we appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, thank you.
<Question> <Positive> Thank you, sir.
<Question> <Negative> Just to follow up real quickly on the Supreme Court question. So you wouldn't see any hypocrisy in putting forward a nominee before the presidential election given what happened to Merrick Garland?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, if we can get him, you know if we can get him approved. They couldn't get him approved.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Well --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you look at the -- you know, we talked about the insurance policy. Right. You know, "We've got an insurance policy just in case she loses." Right? This was a text between the two great lovers. If you look at that, that was long before the election took place. So this was taking, you know, route -- with Comey, who's a totally disgusting human being -- by the way, and if I didn't fire Comey, I would have been in some trouble right now.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> And maybe you should have done it right away. But Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All coming after me, and I wouldn't have known that he was a phony that Strzok and Page in all of these people. McCabe. The whole gang of them. We wouldn't have been able to find it out. Turned out to be the best move I've ever made, firing Comey. Because they were looking to take down the president of the United States.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> He doesn't agree. John Bolton has just gone back on Twitter. His account was frozen for two months. Did you guys freeze his account?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, of course not. Of course not. No, I actually had a good relationship with John. We disagreed on some things and some methods, but I actually had a good relationship.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> All right, Mr. President. Let's talk about --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't hear about that.
<Question> <Neutral> Oh, we have another question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's their problem because they didn't have the Senate. If they had the Senate, they would've done it. It depends. I mean we have the Senate. We have a great Senate, we have great people. If we could get him approved, I would definitely do it. No, I'd do it a lot sooner than that. I'd do it if there three days left, I'd put, put somebody up hoping that I could get them done in three days, okay?
<Question> <Negative> Sir, we wanted to also ask you, the first-ever hearing on reparations was actually this week, for slavery. Do you think the Federal Government should pursue reparations for descendants of slaves?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I don't see it happening, I think it's a very unusual thing. I th... you have a lot of... a lot of... it's a very interesting, you know it's been a very interesting debate. I don't see it happening, no.
<Question> <Negative> So the FBI Director disagreed -- he's with disagreed with the Attorney General over spying, he said there was no spying on your campaign. What's your confidence right now in the FBI Director?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we'll see how it turns out. I mean I, I disagree with him on that. I think a lot of people are disagreeing, you may even disagree with him on that, but, no I would disagree with him on that, respectfully.
<Question> <Negative> I want to turn to immigration Mr. President, so Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has accused you of presiding over concentration camps, the centers that are holding the Central Americans. What are your feelings about the... the conditions in those camps that have been on the news?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well they're better than, much better than Obama. Obama built many of these, cells as he calls them, as they call them. Remember the big, the big deal where they showed the cells all over and they said, Donald Trump, and they showed young children in the cells and Donald Trump built these cells? It turned out they were built in 2014 when Obama was president.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Let's talk about 2020, because we saw the last Democratic debate, and the ratings were really low. I don't know if that's an indication that it's too early or if people are not interested in these candidates. And maybe that's why some of these other guys are talking about jumping into the race. Elizabeth Warren says she's going to use tax dollars to take down your border wall.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> Listen to this.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> [Begin Video Clip] Would you ask taxpayers to pay to take down any part of the wall on the nation's southern border?
<Elizabeth Warren> <Negative> If there are parts of the wall that are not useful in our defense, of course, we should do it. The real point here is that we need to stop this manmade crisis at the border. Trump is the one who has created this crisis. [End Video Clip]
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Tom Honan said the reason that the numbers are down is because of the wall. What do you say?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely. We've built almost 100 miles of wall. It's going up fast. Army Corps of Engineers is doing it. We have the funding. I took it out of the military. You know, I've rebuilt the military. That's another thing we've done, which was, when I took it over -- and we defeated ISIS. We took the caliphate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We just took out al-Baghdadi. I got you know; I don't want it. I don't want it, frankly. But if Obama did al-Baghdadi, the biggest terrorist the last hundred year, if Obama did it, it would be a two-year story. With me, I got a day. Not that it matters, but it was a tremendous thing. We defeated him. But let me just tell you about the wall.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Without the wall -- and Tom Homan's a great guy -- without the wall, it would be a disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, the conditions are much better than they were under President Obama. But because our economy is so good, you know we have the lowest unemployment rate that we've had in 51 years. We have the lowest unemployment rate for Black, for Hispanic, for Asian, for women, but we have the lowest rate that we've had in, in you know many generations and what's happening, and it wasn't that way when I came in by the way, in fact, the country was ready to tube, we were gonna have a big problem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And what did it were the regulations and other things? Also, I think maybe the cheerleading did it, you know President Obama wasn't a cheerleader, he was saying you can't get manufacturing jobs, you need a magic wand. He wasn't a positive cheerleader.
<Question> <Neutral> So you see yourself as a cheerleader?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I do. I think as President, you should be a cheerleader for your country, in addition to u- many other things. But no I think, it's just we have a country that's doing really, really well, and it's great.
<Question> <Negative> Just one quick follow up on the detention centers. There was a Justice Department lawyer who went into court and said these migrants really don't have a right to even a toothpaste or soap. Do you agree with that? Do you think they should be getting those kinds of amenities when they're in detention?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd like to see them, and I understand why they would because from a strictly legal standpoint but, but certainly we're, we're taking care of people far better than President Obama did, far better. And, and remember this…
<Question> <Neutral> Do you think they should have the toiletries?
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So and if she took down the wall -- you need the wall. You know, they want to have drones flying around up and down, and, you know, this and that. It's all just a waste of money. Other than -- we have drones flying to see if anybody is trying to break through the wall. Because if you have a bulldozer or if you have heavy blow torches and things, you know, you can break through.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have -- the wall is electrified, so that if anyone touches it, we know exactly what's happening. We can get there within minutes.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Sure. You were elected to -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, we're building a fantastic wall, and without the wall now -- it just means she's going to lose. Because one of the issues that I won on last time was border security. And you see where the numbers are. Now, until I got the wall built, I got Mexico -- because we're not allowed -- very simply, we have loopholes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they call loopholes for a reason, because there are loopholes. I could end those loopholes in 15 minutes with crazy Nancy Pelosi and Schumer. I could end them in 15 minutes. But they don't want to meet about them because they like trouble, because the more trouble we have -- they don't care about the country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The more trouble they have, the better it is for them, they think the worse it is for me. So I got the war built despite them fighting me. I got so much money for them, for the military. It's the one thing that wouldn't give you money for the wall because they thought that was a very good thing politically.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said this on one of the interviews recently, remember this um, when I came in, I took over Obama's policy. It was a policy of separation. I'm the one that put them together. So when I came in, cells were built, that was the 2014n year, that was a pretty famous year, 'cause I was just being, I was being hit hard for two, three days.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then somebody said no wait you know, some... one of Obama's peoples said, "Wait a minute, I built them. We built them for the Obama Administration," and that was the end of it. They didn't wanna talk about that one anymore. But I think that um, I, I think it's a disgrace where people are bringing up, you know, you're talking about children, children are being used.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're being used in many cases as slaves. They're being, bid out to the highest bidder, and we're talking about the cartels. And it's a horrible thing happening to children. And if the Democrats were willing to change loopholes and change asylum, we could end it immediately. So I've had to go Mexico, and they gave us something that they were never willing to give us. Now you know, I understand why they did it, but they did it nevertheless, and they're doing a very, very good job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have 6,000 on their southern border. And it's been reported that some of the cartel people and the people that, they call 'em coyotes and all sorts of bad names, but, they're telling people, "Don't come in, don't come in, we'll never get you through anymore. We'll never get you through." Mexico has 6,000 people on their southern border.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you don't have a wall, we don't have a country. If we don't have a border, we don't have a country.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Mr. President, right now. Elizabeth Warren wants to take it down. Who do you think right now is likely to be your opponent? Mayor Pete is evidently moving up in the early states. Joe Biden wins most national polls. Elizabeth Warren is still among the leaders. Who do you think it's going to be?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't know if Joe can make it. Mentally, he's off. There's no question about it. So I don't know if he's going to make it mentally. If he can get through it, you know, without cracking up, which is a real question. I mean, many people asked that. Maybe him. You know, don't forget, people have seen his name for a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But Pete is you know, I call him Alfred E. Neuman, to me, reminds me of Mad magazine, Alfred E. Neuman. And I don't see him. I don't see him dealing with President Xi. I don't see him dealing with Kim Jong Un. I just don't see it. But maybe he is. I mean, look, I wouldn't mind running against any of them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I would say maybe Biden has the advantage. I think Pocahontas has come up from the embers. I thought I, I mean, I hit her too early. I came up with this name that seems to have stuck very nicely..
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Bloomberg?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they don't use it. I don't see him. I know him pretty well. He finished very weak in New York. He starts with, you know, telling you what you can drink, what you can do, what you -- no, I don't see it. He's desperately -- I'm sure he's going to run. He is going to spend. He's got the money just to put on a great campaign.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, we are now loosening up a little bit by the fact that you don't have the same inflow. I, I don't know if you're hearing it but it's, it's a lot less inflow. and, but if, if the Democrats would agree on the loopholes, and if they'd agree on asylum, we would have, we would have a great border.
<Question> <Positive> Well to that question…
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, and by the way, we've built a lot of wall. You're seeing the... did you like my tweet the other… Did you…
<Question> <Positive> Yeah, we saw the video.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I mean did you see how... I mean we're building a lot. Got a lot wall under construction. And it's not easy when they don't wanna give you... you know, I'm bringing it from all over.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't see it. His time has come and gone.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> It would be hard to believe a New York real estate developer, or a billionaire could ever be president. Mr. President. Just kidding. You know, the stock market hit another record this past week. Clearly, that is your strong suit going into the 2020, because, you know, you look at the polls. People feel better about their money situation right now.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Going forward toward November of next year, how are you going to make sure everybody understands what you have been able to do over the last, then, four years?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By talking to you, it's all good to do.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Good.
<Question> <Negative> So you delayed these deportation... these mass raids by two weeks.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I did.
<Question> <Neutral> What do you need to see from Congress for those to be called off?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I was called by some very good people that are Dem-, that happen to be Democrat, and they asked me if I'd delay it. I said, "But listen, we are just kidding ourselves unless you're gonna change the loophole provisions and unless you're gonna change, asylum. And if we can work on that, fine." And we may not get there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We probably won't. It's incredible. I actually think the Democrats are viewing it as a good issue. I think it's a horrible issue. I think it's you know, just a terrible issue for them because people don't wanna have open borders. I mean you look at my Hispanic numbers, they've been great, and because the Hispanics understand the border better than anybody else.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they don't want criminals coming in, and they don't wanna lose their jobs, and both those things will happen, you know.
<Question> <Negative> So just to put a square on it, if the bill that you're talking about, this loophole bill that's been, been talked about for months doesn't get done in two weeks...those raids just start instantly?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everyone's listening right down. Nobody's listening to any other show. But look, strong suit. My strong suit is I rebuilt a military. The vets -- for years, you would turn on your television. Every night, you'd see a story about the vets and how badly they're being treated, and it's a horror show. You don't hear that anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I got veterans choice. I got to -- that means they can go see a doctor if they have to wait online. If they go see a doctor, we pay the bill. It's unbelievable what happened. I have veterans accountability. You couldn't fire -- for 50 years, they've been trying to get -- you couldn't fire because there were unions and civil service.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So if you had somebody beating up vets, stealing from the V.A., you couldn't fire them for any reason for it.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Certainly something to run on. And they are appreciative it. On the economy --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I got that --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> President Xi --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But listen. Rebuilding the military. All of the things I've done. Plus, we've had peace. You know, we're pulling way down in Afghanistan. We're working on an agreement now with the Taliban. Let's see what happens. The last time I was close to have an agreement, then they thought when they came over, they thought it would be good to kill people so they could, you know, negotiate from a position of strength.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They killed 12 people in order to show they are tough guys, and I canceled the meeting. I said, "That's not what we're dealing with." Anyway. We're pulling back. I just pulled out of Syria; except I kept the oil. If it was okay with you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, when you go to raid, it's people that came in legally and then people are gonna be taken out. You know, we're talking about people that came into the country illegally, so they came in illegally, and they're gonna be taken legally. These are people that have been, you know, they understand they have to leave but they're just not leaving.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These are people that are marked to leave. They went through this whole crazy court, court process. It is so crazy. Look, we're the only, or just about the only country where if you touch one inch of our ground, if your foot, one foot, not both, if one-foot hits the ground, it's welcome to the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then you take 'em and you bring 'em, and then you have a court case. You need Perry Mason, right? And you have a court case. Then you have to catch and release. But what they don't say, and here's the good news, everybody that's coming in is going out. It would be nice if we could just say I'm sorry, you can't come in, instead of take 'em to court, give 'em a number, set up a trial, or other things where they're ruled against.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But what happens is everybody that comes in, you see numbers where they're apprehended. The Border Patrol's doing an incredible job and ICE has done an incredible job. When they come in, they go out. People don't understand that. It would be so much easier if we wouldn't let 'em in, but we don't have that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now when we have the wall, that will largely happen because when we have the wall, it's gonna be very hard, it's a very powerful wall. And that's being built rapidly. We should have 400 miles of wall before the end of the next year. That's a lot. In the most, 400...
<Question> <Neutral> 400 out of 700, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> 400 out of 550. It's 550. But we'll have... but I also fixed, I mean I, I renovated a lot of wall. A lot of the wall was in very bad shape but structurally sound and we renovated it and did a good job with it.
<Sarah Huckabee Sanders> <Negative> We have time for maybe one or two more guys. [Trump goes off the record]
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> We 600 hundred guys there. Right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want to -- okay.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> President Xi has just said this. "We want to work for a Phase 1 agreement on the basis of mutual respect and equality with the United States." Where are you at? You were kind of down on a deal and the market kind of dipped on this. Where do you stand right now with the trade deal with China?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very good. We have a deal, potentially, very close. He wants to make it much more than I want to make it. I'm not anxious to make it. We're taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. We never took in 10 cents. We are not paying like, you know, they fed the line, you know -- the media fed the line about us paying.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, normally you would pay for tariffs --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> But he literally just said, Mr. President, he's -- "we want to do a deal." I very rarely see that. "We want to work out a Phase 1 agreement."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The problem is -- I didn't like his word "equality" because we started off so low. We've lost 500 billion dollars a year for many, many years. We've rebuilt China, and I give him a lot of credit. The ones that don't give credit are our past presidents, and especially the last one with his crummy vice president.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> China took us to the cleaners. He didn't even know that. Biden in the first debate said, "Oh, these are wonderful people." Sure, they're wonderful people. We've given them 500 billion a year. Five hundred billion. That's not including theft of intellectual property, et cetera. So I told President Xi, this can't be like an even deal because we're starting off from the floor and you're already at the ceiling.
<Question> <Positive> Yeah, Jerome Powell, he says that he can stay in office for four years, but do you think you have the power to remove him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he's incorrect. If I wanted to, but I have no plans to anything. But, but I am disappointed he missed the call... he was... and, and most people agree with that you know, people say I was right. Virtually no inflation, and you have to understand, we're competing against other parts of the world. And they're manipulators.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're, they manipulate their currency. And I don't wanna do that, but I wanna, I wanna be treated fairly. And we have to be given a level playing field. And we're bullying through it anyway 'cause look how our market, we're the best market in the world. We're doing, we're doing the best in the world. No country is doing as well as the United States, even despite our size.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We've never done this well. Look, when you hear the best union, you've heard that, best union in 80 years. 80 years. ho kept records before that, right? You know, if you think…,So anyway, so, we're doing well. But if he raised interest rates half, and if he didn't do quantitative tightening, in other words, he took the money supply and he tightened.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> $50 billion a month, he reduced it to 25. If he didn't do those two-thi... I, I'm not saying he can raise interest rates, 'cause Obama with a very small recovery, was playing with funny money because he, he didn't you know, he, he had you know, he had almost close to zero interest rates, right. I've had nine increases and I have 50 billion a month.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've had friends say, man, it's hard you know, it's harder to get money when you take in your 50 billion a month, that's a lot of money. Nobody said to you... nobody thought he was gonna do that. And when I'm competing against China and Europe and lots of other places, I gotta have a, you know, it... it would be nice to have a level playing field.
<Question> <Negative> You think he's trying to sabotage you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I don't think so. I just don't think he, I don't think he knows. I don't think he understands. He doesn't get it. And if he didn't do that, the DOW would be up, in my opinion, just my opinion, another 10,000 points. Now, it's already up 50 percent since the election, so hey, I won the election, and the market's up, in some cases, more than 50 percent, since my election.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that's with interest rate money and it's with quantitative tightening. So if he didn't tighten, if he just left it alone, not even to ease you know, where you pump money in. These other countries are pumping money in and lowering interest rates. So I'm competing against Europe. You saw Draghi last week where he's pumping money in and he's lowering interest rates.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Not to mention --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we have to have a much better deal. The bottom line is we have a very good chance to make a deal.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> We do.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> And not to mention happening to Hong Kong with these --
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Right.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> -- pro democracy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that's a complicating factor. There's no question about it. And if it weren't for me, Hong Kong would have been obliterated in 14 minutes. He's got a million soldiers standing outside of Hong Kong that aren't going in only because I ask him, "Please don't do that. You'll be making a big mistake. It's going to have a tremendous negative impact on the trade deal." And he wants to make a trade.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Brian, one thing, before I get off, I just want to say one thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is what I got to. And yet they're not doing well and we are, which is a great tribute. But if he didn't do that, because we don't have inflation, biggest thing you have to watch is inflation, we have very watch is inflation, which is... so we have this great economy with very little inflation. If you didn't do that, I think the Dow would have been up another 10,000 points.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I think that instead of three-point-two, we could be in the fours and maybe even in the early fives. And I've always said that. But I have an artificial barrier, it's called The Fed. The Fed has been terrible, to me and despite that, I'm pulling through and you know, it's one of those things. But we would have been, we would have been 10,000points up and we would have been in the 4s and maybe even better than that.
<Question> <Positive> Two more questions from me, sir. Just first on Women's World Cup, Women World Cup is going on right now. Recent report shows the U.S. Women's Soccer Team's, they're outearned by their male counterparts. Do you think they should be paid the same?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think a lot of it also has to do with the economics. I mean, who draws more? Where is the money coming in? I know that when you have the great stars like Ronaldo and some of these stars, my son loves soccer and you know, some of the Messi... you have these great stars that get paid a lot of money, but they draw hundreds of thousands of people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have to really look, you know, season, seasonally, like... and I think it has something to do with that. But I haven't taken a position on that at all. I, I'd have to look at it. It's something, actually, I don't think I've been asked, but, but you do have to look at the overall economics. I mean, um, what's the difference in the draw?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love watching women's, I actually watched the game yesterday, I loved watching women's soccer. They're really talented. Fantastic.
<Question> <Negative> One of the co-captains Megan Rapinoe and she's refusing to put her hand over her heart during the National Anthem, she even kneeled in the past, do you think that's appropriate?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No. I don't think so. But again, I'd have to look at it, but you do have to take it you know, you do have to see. I see some of these, these crowds for, you know, soccer where... where you're talking about numbers that are just unbelievable. And the women are doing, and the women are doing really well too, but, they could have to. But I have not taken a position on it. I haven't actually been asked the question before I don't think.
<Question> <Neutral> That's why we're here. So a hundred years from now, what do you think people are gonna remember you for?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we have to go through the... the six years or whatever it may be when, when you know, would I like to get a ride out of some of your compatriots, say go through the six, 10, 14, maybe 18 years, whatever it may be.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have the strongest economy in the history of our country. We have the best unemployment numbers we've ever had. African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American, the best in history. We have the best unemployment and employment numbers. More people working today than ever before. But listen to this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have now the greatest economy that we've ever had. We've increased by 20 trillion dollars. China's gone down probably by 30 or 35 trillion dollars. If crooked Hillary had won, China would now be the largest economy in the world. They were going to surpass us, expected to, in the second year of the presidency.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right now --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They'll never catch up.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> But the farmers were hoping for that huge purchase. And it looks like they want to do a deal --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, Brian, they have it. Wait, wait, wait. Just one thing. So they have it because I said, "How much have the farmers lost because of China targeting them?" "Sir? Sixteen million dollars and 12 billion in the previous year," I gave them 12 billion dollars out of the tariffs, had tens of billions left over.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I gave them 16 billion out of the tariffs, and had tens of billions left over. Goes into the Treasury. Brian, our farmers are doing great, right? And now we just signed a deal with Japan, 40 billion dollars. They're buying from the farmers. We just signed a deal with South Korea. A tremendous deal. We're making tremendous deals.
<Question> <Neutral> You mean the tweet?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> To which to which you saw that, right? To, to say, yeah, yeah, that drove people crazy. 'Cause they don't think it's kidding you know, see, they, they actually...
<Question> <Positive> Are you kidding though?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Of course. But it drives them crazy. anyway, but we have to go through the six years, but look, we've done things that nobody's been able to do. We've rebuilt our military. Take a look at the VA. All of your lives, you're young guys, but all of your life you heard about the VA, the VA, oh, it's always a disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Did you ever see it running smooth like it is now? I got VA Choice. I got VA accountability. Because of accountability, we can fire all of the bad wood that worked in there. We have. We've got rid of all of, we had horrible, we have great people in there, but we had some horrible people, small percentage, but we got rid of them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nobody could get VA accountability, and nobody could get VA Choice. We got VA Choice. So now instead of waiting for you know, days and weeks and months to get, see a doctor, now, they go outside, they get a doctor, we pay for the doctor, and we take care of our vets. So you know, we've done a great job with that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the economy's the best. It... it may be the greatest economy we've ever had. Our unemployment numbers are in... in many categories, the best in the history of our country, and in all categories, they're fantastic you know, best in 51 years and for many groups. As we said, with African American, Hispanic.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you have to understand, these deals with China, they've been taking advantage of us for 25 years. It's hard for them to understand it's not going to happen anymore. And now they understand.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> They are calling on you to veto legislation. They are calling on you to veto legislation coming out of the Senate that supports the Hong Kong students. What are you going to do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll tell you. Look, we have to stand with Hong Kong. But I'm also standing with President Xi. He's a friend of mine. He's an incredible guy. We have to stand. But I'd like to see them work it out. Okay. We have to see and work it out. But I stand with Hong Kong. I stand with freedom. I stand with all of the things that we want to do. But we also are in the process of making the largest trade deal in history.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And if we could do that, that would be great. China wants it. We want it. And I will say this. If it weren't for me, thousands of people would have been killed in Hong Kong right now. And you wouldn't have any riots. You'd have a police state, but thousands of people. The only reason he's not going in is because I'm saying, "It's going to affect our trade deal, you don't want to do that." I speak to him.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Sir, you're running in 2020. And many people are -- we all just assumed your vice-presidential nominee would be Mike Pence. But then we're reading headlines about Kellyanne Conway's husband saying that Nikki Haley is fighting for that position. I'm a South Carolinian originally from South Carolina. Nikki Haley was our governor.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> And I know she really did a good job as an ambassador. So who is going to be your running mate in 2020?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, she's great. Well, first of all, Kellyanne is great, but she's married to a total whack job. I think she must have done some number on him, Ainsley. I don't know what Kellyanne did to that guy, but she -- because I don't even know him. I mean, I've met him for seconds. He's got to be some kind of a nut job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She must have done some bad things to him because that guy is crazy. But you know what? Mike Pence is a great vice president. He's our man, 100 percent. Nikki will absolutely be involved. She's a friend of mine. She endorsed me with the most beautiful endorsement you've ever heard. She did a great job at the U.N.. She's now in the private sector.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Women are doing phenomenally. You know, what's really nice? The biggest beneficiaries are blue collar workers too. They're the ones that are doing percentage wise the best, so you know. So we've done a lot of, a lot of great things. And, nobody, we left a list. Do you have that list for the fellows? Here is, um, a list of some of the things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nobody's done it. Even VA Choice. Today you, you saw what, what, were you there today with what we did. Were you there? Did you go?
<Question> <Positive> We saw it on a monitor, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Do you know there are those that say that's bigger than health care um, because people, they go to a hospital, they have a little cut, they have it fixed, and they get a bill for like, $3,000. Now, you're allowed to go. They have to have listed prices, it, I mean, so many things. You have to see the doctor's record.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's incredible. It, it could be a game changer.
<Sarah Huckabee Sanders> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Question> <Neutral> Do you think you should be on Mount Rushmore, sir?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If I answer that question yes, I will end up with such bad publicity. Well, look, I have a lot of respect. Even Mount Rushmore. So for many, many years they got, they had fireworks, right? Many, many years. and Kristi, your new governor, she's a great person. She called, she said, sir, for many years we had tremendous fireworks on the 4th of July.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I assume she's doing very well. But, Nikki will be back in some form because she's great, and just she's my friend. But no, Mike Pence, I know, I've seen this rumor. It keeps, you know, popping up. And Nikki would be great. But Mike Pence has done a phenomenal job as Vice President. He's our guy. He's my friend.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And look, we have a great team. This has been a very strong team.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Mike Pompeo going to the Senate. Are you going to push him to do that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So Mike has done an incredible job. You know, I have an incredible cabinet. We don't get enough credit. We have incredible. Mike graduated number one at Harvard Law. Number one at West Point, is an incredible guy, doing a great job in a very complicated world, doing a great job as secretary of state. Remember, they all said, Brian, I'd be in World War III my first day.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And now they're saying, "Well, he's much more moderate." Well, actually, I rebuilt the military to a level that nobody is going to play games with us. But if we don't have to use it, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. So Mike would win easily in Kansas. Great state. And it's a Trump state. He'd win easily.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And if I thought they had somebody out there that couldn't win, and Mike would really -- he loves what he's doing. But if I thought they had somebody out there that -- and he came to me and said, "Look, I'd rather stay where I am," but he loves Kansas. He loves the people of Kansas. If he thought there was a chance of losing that seat, I think he would do that, and he would win in a landslide because they love him in Kansas.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We don't have it anymore. Can you do something? And I got it approved. Starting, next season, it was not easy, starting next season, Mount Rushmore will have tremendous fireworks like they had for many years. But they ended it a long time ago, but they didn't want, but they didn't have fireworks because of, I don't know, I think they thought, thought the stone was gonna catch on fire.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That doesn't happen, right? There was somebody said they had. Nobody's been able, nobody's been able to figure out why, but it was a very strong no. And I got it approved starting next season. They're doing some work. They're finishing up work now. But I got it approved for next season for Kristi and for the state.
<Question> <Negative> I do want to ask you real quickly about Jean Carroll because she was on television all morning repeating her allegations. Is it your position that she's lying about what happened?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Totally lying. I don't know anything about her. I see that I had a picture with her coat on where I was leaving and you know, with the back of my... I know nothing about this woman. I know nothing about her. She is... it's just a terrible thing that people can make statements like that. Think of it. Any department store that's crowded.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay? Bergdorf Goodman's a crowded store. And I've never been up that I remember ever on that floor. They sell women's dresses on that floor. Okay? But Bergdorf Goodman is... and this is, like, 25 years ago, but this store is packed. It's on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street. And she made this charge up. And by the way, she's made it up about, or she's said it about other people too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm not the only one. She said it about other people. I'll say it with great respect, number one, she's not my type. Number two, it never happened. It never happened. Okay? I hope you can be strong. But I think it's a crazy thing when, when people are allowed to make false accusations like that. I really do. And, and for 25 years she never said anything.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She never said for 25 years. And then she said, where are the sales girls that walked, worked...where are the people on the floor? All the people there and they had nobody behind the counter, which is supposed to be right there? There was nobody working behind, the store's packed. It's a disgrace these false, a, a false accusation like that is a disgrace. [Trump goes off-the-record]
<Question> <Neutral> Can I ask one final question, sir? Who are you gonna replace Sarah Sanders with?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Irreplaceable.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Well, I am from Kansas, and you're right. It is a great state. I'm Mr. President. A moment ago, you were talking about rumors. I'm sure you saw there was a rumor that, you know, you went to the hospital last week. It wasn't in the schedule.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> And obviously something is really the matter with you. So can you tell us what's the matter with you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. Yeah. A lot of things are a matter with me. I mean, number one, what did they do this for? But I love it. You know, one of those things. So we had some free time. My doctor calls. He said, "Would you like to do some work?" Because I'm going to be slightly busy in 2020, in January and February, especially if Crazy Nancy does something that nobody ever would even think of doing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I'll be busy interviewing Biden, interviewing, watching the interviews of shifty Schiff, and why he made up all of this stuff, and why he made up my statements. So the doctor called, "Sir, would you like to go out" -- because they had three hours -- "Would you like to go out to Walter Reed and do your first part of the physical right?" I said, "Yeah, go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let's go." So we go out. I go there. I meet with parents. One in particular, I meet with the wife and family of a young soldier who is being operated on and lost his arm and lost a leg. Horrible thing. And I spent time with them. Anyway, I do a very routine part of the physical. Get in the car, come back.
<Question> <Neutral> Are you gonna bring the White House press briefing back?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Do you think I should? So you have some of these people who became sort of semi-rich because of that and well-known.
<Question> <Negative> Is that what bothers you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, you guys have been great. When a reporter is, is fake, there are a lot of them, fake... some of these... we don't even get calls in many cases, like, to confirm something. They did something, David Sanger last week about Russia that we're... it was a totally false story. They didn't even call us up to confirm.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, they say, well, we call somebody you know, nobody knows. It would be nice to say... that's the other thing. I was thinking the other day, I was talking to somebody, you don't ever see people making a statement. It's always sources, four sources they have... 19 sources have stated... 19 sources, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do you know 19 people in the building? But it's, it used to be that so and so had said this or so... every single thing is an anonymous source, so the condition of this and that, you never hear ever, you don't see sources anymore because it's fake. They, they make up stories and they put sources to it. But replacing Sarah is not gonna be easy, not gonna be easy.
<Question> <Neutral> Have anybody in mind?
<Sarah Huckabee Sanders> <Positive> He'll move on. That's for sure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. I, I have, I mean, a lot of people want the job, I could say that. We have four or five people that really want it, very good people, very good names, but Sarah's done a fantastic job. She's a great person. She'll be governor. She'll be governor. She won't talk to us anymore. She'll be too high.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> On the way back, I'm hearing that I'm in the hospital. And by the way, it just so you know, like literally many, many, many cars go, it's not like -- and they have a press van following -- you know when I go, I'd love to be able to go like the old days, when I get in a car and close the doors, lock them up, and drive.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right? That doesn't happen anymore. It's a little different. But we have a press van. You know how that works. And so, we drive out to Walter Reed, greatest doctors, greatest everything, greatest place you've ever seen, what they can do. So I start my physical, go see the soldier, go see the families, did a little tour of the building, then get back in. On the way back, I'm hearing rumors that I'm in the hospital.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Then I'm hearing rumors that I had chest pains. Then I'm hearing rumors that I had a massive heart attack. Then I'm hearing rumors that I'm not coming back. I'm staying at Walter Reed overnight and maybe for a long time. And I say -- I come home and my wife says, "Darling, darling, are you okay?" I said, "Okay from what?". [Laughter] They say, they have it down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> CNN, mostly CNN, but that stupid MSNBC, which is just as bad. Can you imagine? I made them so much money on The Apprentice and that's the way -- but anyway those two. And so, they started a false narrative.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it was this. So the doctor gets on. He said, "No, no." It didn't matter. No matter what we told them, they were going with it.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> So your health -- Mr. President, your health is fine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, let me tell you this. I just got back from Austin, Texas, where I was with Tim Cook. He's going to be building a one-billion-dollar facility to make whatever he makes. You know, that's Apple. And he's going to build this incredible facility. We toured another facility where they make the Mac Pro, which is phenomenal, which was opening.
<Sarah Huckabee Sanders> <Negative> That would never, that would never happen.
<Question> <Neutral> That's on the record, right? She has your formal endorsement?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If she runs for governor, she would have my endorsement, yeah, she would have my endorsement. I mean, I don't know that she's gonna run, but I think she should. She probably will, but I think she should, I mean, she's very popular. And I'm... that's a great state, Arkansas, very popular. I beat Hillary by what, 22 points.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How many did...
<Sarah Huckabee Sanders> <Positive> At least, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I mean, they come from there, right? You know, so it's, like, it's a great state.
<Sarah Huckabee Sanders> <Neutral> It's her home state.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Anyway, have a good time, fellows.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The reason we've opened that day job, they're making all of the Mac Pros all over the world. They're making them right in Austin, Texas. I spent -- I left early. I got home very late. And I did many things in between. And I was sort of joking to some of the people. I said, "Hey, that's not bad considering these people had me all wash up and finished in a hospital that I just get back from a 14-hour day.".
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Yup.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. It's a disgrace. Let me just say what it really is. It's fake, disgusting news. I'll let you know -- you know what? Nothing wrong if you're not feeling well. I have --
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Right. But it wasn't on your schedule, and so people thought, "Oh, there must be something.".
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because the doctor said, "Sir." You know, I'm not blaming that.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Get a phase done.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You might be able to knock off half of your physical. I said, "You know what? That's not a bad idea" because I had three hours.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> So, Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Between that and watching a football game that I didn't want to watch. What do we -- I had three free hours.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he said, "Would you like to do it?" So here's the thing. It's so disgusting what they do because they knew it wasn't true. They went with it. After we certified with medical people, we had three medical people call them up to say it's not true. They went with it anyway. You couldn't kill the story because they're bad people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's fake, corrupt news. It's CNN mostly -- Well, Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> I think it does good for your health. I'm not a doctor, but if I was to write a prescription, calling in every week to update the country about what's happening might be good for your health. That's something to consider. You have the phone number.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know that I've been doing it for years.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> You have been.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> With your group, I've been doing it years.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> For stress relief.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was up to me -- and it is up to me, and we'll do it more often. But I have a lot of fun doing it. And you know what's the best part? We get the true word out. And here's a true word. Our country is doing great. We're respected again. Our military is strong. We have the number one economy in the world by far.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And China's never going to catch us as long as we have a smart person where I am. They'll never catch us. They've had the worst year they've had in 57 years, and we've had the best year we've ever had by far. So it's good. I get the word out on your show. I love your show.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Thank you so much, Mr. President, for being with us.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Yup.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> President Trump --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thanks so much.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> -- thanks so much. Thank you. All right.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Goodbye.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right. Joining us now from the White House -- I assume the White House -- is the president of the United States. Mr. President, thank you for taking the time. We really appreciate you joining us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [On Telephone] Hi, Sean. Thank you.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> All right. A lot of breaking news tonight, and you haven't really talked at length in an interview about a lot of issues. Let me start with this issue of the Ukraine. I don't know if you were following the top of the show or John Solomon's new report or that both Catherine Herridge and Sara Carter are reporting tonight, we now have text messages from Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, never before seen, discussing recruiting White House sources to spy on you.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Take it in any order you like.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think it's incredible when you hear it. These are great reporters, all three, and when you have them on your trail, that's a problem. These are people that should be getting Pulitzers, not the ones that got the Pulitzers that got everything wrong. If you listen to them, they got everything wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go back and read some of their early and mid articles. They didn't have a clue what was going on and they win Pulitzer Prizes. These are the ones that should be winning. It sounds like big stuff. It sounds very interesting with Ukraine. I just spoke to the new president a little while ago, two days ago, and congratulated him on an incredible race.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Incredible run. A big surprise victory. That's 75 percent of the vote. But that sounds like big, big stuff. I'm not surprised.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Mr. President, Ukraine is offering this evidence to the United States. Would you like the United States -- with all this talk about collusion, they are saying they included on behalf of Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016. Does America need to see that information in spite of all of the attacks against you on collusion?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think we do. And, frankly, we have a great new attorney general who has done an unbelievable job in a very short period of time. And he is very smart and tough and I would certainly defer to him. I would imagine he would want to see this. People have been saying this whole -- the concept of Ukraine, they have been talking about it actually for a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know that, and I would certainly defer to the attorney general. And we'll see what he says about it. He calls them straight. That's one thing I can tell you.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Mr. President, our own Catherine Herridge, investigative reporter Sara Carter -- big breaking news tonight: Senate Republican chairman submitted a letter Thursday to the Department of Justice, the attorney general. We have new texts from November of 2016 from Strzok and Page showing the pair had discussed attempts to recruit sources from within your White House to spy on your administration and reveal that they have one particular contact within the White House.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> The vice president's chief of staff whose wife was working as an analyst for Strzok on the FBI investigation on Hillary's private server. Have you heard this report tonight, sir?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just heard it a little while ago. Frankly, it's very disconcerting. If you look at what's been happening, they were the same two, the two lovers that decided to use the FBI server instead of their private so they didn't get caught. These two were beauties. There is no doubt about it. They were going hog wild to find something about the administration which obviously wasn't there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have nothing to do with Russia except that we have been tougher on Russia than any administration in 50 years -- a lot tougher than Obama. But these were the two that talked about the insurance policy just in case Hillary loses. If she loses, we've got an insurance policy. Well, that was the insurance policy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, she lost and now they are trying to infiltrate the administration to -- really, it's a coup. It's spying. It's everything that you can imagine. It's hard to believe in this country that we would have had that. I don't know if you remember a long time ago, very early on, I used the word "wiretap" and I put it in quotes, meaning surveillance, spying, you can sort of say whatever if you want.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But that was a long time ago, and I have never seen anything like it a blow up like you have never seen. Now I understand why, because they thought two years ago when I said that just on a little bit of a hunch and a little bit of wisdom, maybe, they -- it blew up because they thought maybe I was wise to them or they were caught.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that's why. Because, if they weren't doing anything wrong, it would have just gone by, nobody would have cared about it. It was pretty insignificant. I thought, when I said it, and that's pretty amazing. So you see now they are trying to infiltrate the White House. This is long after the election. It's a disgrace.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, again, hopefully the attorney general will do what's right and I really believe he will.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Mr. President, the attorney general actually used the word "spying" on your campaign. We know of Stefan Halper and his contact that he made with Papadopoulos and Carter Page and Sam Clovis. We know about the FISA warrant as the Grassley-Graham memo said, the bulk of the information in the application was the Clinton bought and paid for Russian of all things dossier, ignored by the Mueller report which I will ask you about in a second here.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> But those are two specific incidents of attempts to get into your campaign. Your reaction to all of that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think they made many attempts. And then you see the lying and you see the leaking. And you see Comey lied Congress. Nothing happened. You see him leaking. Nothing happens. And this is leaking classified information. This is leaking really big stuff. I remember the young sailor. In fact, I helped him out with his family --
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Kristian Saucier.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- because I thought he was so unfairly treated as you know. I remember he had confidential information which is a much, much lower standard than classified. And they put him in jail for a long time. They took away his life. And then you look at what Hillary Clinton did with 33,000 emails and hundreds of thousands of text messages or emails going through the Weiner server or computer.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hundreds of thousands of which many were classified. And nothing happens to her. And, yet, they put a young sailor on for doing something innocent, showing his mother and his friend what the desk looked like, the desk in a 40-year-old submarine. I think Russia and China would have had that picture many years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it's really a double standard like you've never seen, very, very unfair. But hopefully that will change. I think that will be changing.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. President, closed door testimony recently revealed Strzok and Page that they were laughing at the idea that Hillary investigation was a real investigation. And that it went directly into Loretta Lynch's office, which now raises a whole new set of other questions. And they were confident about that. And it was Strzok that did the interview with Hillary, uncharacteristically, frankly unprecedented, allowed two other people in that interview while she was being interviewed in an investigation.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Comey, of course, exonerated her but he even acknowledged top secret classified information on that server. I did disagree with you at the time. You after the election were basically saying let bygones be bygones, let's not go down this road. Do you regret saying that and do you think now if we are really to get to the bottom and the truth?
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> It has to also include Hillary Clinton, the email server, which would be an underlying crime and obstruction, which everyone in the media seems to care about -- the intent behind the 33,000 subpoenaed emails deleted, Bleach Bit, hammers, SIM cards.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't regret saying it. When I won, they were all saying lock her up. Lock her up. I said, no, no. Let's get on with life. That was different. It was like right after the election you want to get a new page and turn over a new leaf. And I said let's get on with it, let's, you know, build up the economy -- which by the way is doing record business.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm so proud of the economy. We are doing numbers that nobody has ever believed. Probably the best economy we've ever had. Best unemployment numbers we've ever had. It's been incredible. But I said, let's get on with our life. Let's forget about the past. But now what happened is fairly shortly after that great evening, they started coming at us with the insurance policy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And everything they did was so dishonest. And then, we really started looking into a lot of things like her deleted emails and acid washed emails which is unheard of because of the expense of doing it, and how she got away with it, how her lawyer got away with it, how all of these things happened. Don't forget, whether they interviewed her that was on July 4th weekend.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was very, very late into the July 4th weekend. They asked her questions. They didn't have a stenographer. They didn't have anybody swear her in. They didn't have a tape recorder. They just walked in, asked her some questions. And that was fine. In the meantime, look at what she's done, how she's destroyed the lives of people that were on our campaign, she has destroyed their lives and the DNC. And frankly when the FBI went into the DNC, the DNC told them to get the hell out of here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Think of that. They told that to the FBI and they wouldn't give him the server. I want to find out what's on that server, the DNC server, because that's the big thing. Nobody has seen that server yet. The FBI didn't see it, and these are the top people at the FBI where you had absolute dirty cops. These were dirty cops.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, the FBI -- I know FBI guys, these are the best in the world. But the people leading it -- Comey and McCabe and Strzok and Page and all of these people, the lawyer who admitted frankly how crooked things were. I mean, when that testimony comes out, it's already come out partially, when that testimony comes out from the attorney for the FBI, you'll see.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I really say, now we have to get down because this was a coup. This was an attempted overthrow of the United States government. We had people coming out to vote from all over this country that are in love with what we are doing. It's called Make America Great Again. That's what we have done and we are doing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And this was an overthrow and it's a disgraceful thing. And I don't -- I think it's far bigger than Watergate. I think it's possibly the biggest scandal in political history in this country. Maybe beyond political. So I think that a lot of things are being learned right now, just like you just mentioned just a few moments ago, again with Strzok and Page.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These are sick people. These are sick, sick people.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You know --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So let's see what happens with McCabe and Comey and Brennan and Clapper. They weren't in the act. And let's see what happens and let's see how high it goes up. It's inconceivable when it goes to Clapper, Brennan, Comey, these people -- I would imagine that some other people may be a little bit higher up also knew about it and maybe a lot higher up.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You mentioned -- I mentioned now Strzok and Page independently in their conversations. Peter Strzok had said about the collusion there is no "there" there. Lisa Page closed door testimony actually said after the nine-month FBI investigation, they had no evidence of anything with you and your campaign and Russia.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> That's before the appointment of Mueller. We also had the House Intel Committee report. That's two no collusion. Then the Senate bipartisan committee and now the Mueller report is you said, oh, any news? No obstructions. No collusion.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> What is your full reaction to the Mueller report?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it was, as I call them, 13 angry Democrats. They were supplanted by five more, five more were added. And you got up to 18, 19, 20, they are all Democrats, many of them made major contributions to the Hillary Clinton campaign. And they had one of them was one of the top people at the Clinton Foundation, Jeannie Rhee.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Then you had Weissmann, you had some bad, bad, bad people. No friends of Trump. I had no friends. It was like a one-sided witch-hunt as I called it. And, you know, Bob Mueller, I turned him down to run the FBI, the next day, he was appointed to be this -- special counsel as they call it. It's a really much tougher word than that I won't use it. And it was a terrible thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was conflicted for that reason. He also was conflicted because of the fact that Comey and him are best friends. So, if not best, very close to best. But I would say best friends. You look at pictures of the two of them in the past. We had a nasty business transaction the two of us. I have a nasty transaction with him and then all of the sudden he is my prosecutor.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very, very unfair. And with all of that and $35 million spent, think of that, over two years ruining lives of people, ruining their lives, people going out of business because they couldn't afford lawyers. That's just unbelievable what happened. How bad it was. I can't even tell you how bad it was. Nobody knows how people suffered.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great people that came to Washington, they came to D.C. to set the world in a very positive way on fire. They wanted to clean things up and do a great job. But all of a sudden, they are testifying on nonsense. And it's really -- you know, with all of the things you've heard, nothing had to do with the campaign.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nothing had to do with Russia, collusion. But the bottom line is, with a group of very serious Trump haters, and a group of I call them angry Democrats, somebody who was very conflicted at the top, no collusion and also no obstruction, because the statement was made and the attorney general, you know, understood it very well and he read it and he made a decision right on the spot.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No obstruction. So, you had no collusion, no obstruction, $35 million spent, and unlimited manpower, woman power, and there is nothing. Nothing. And it was a very bad two years for this country. But what has happened we found everything going in the opposite direction, and I think, now, it's turning, unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The tables have turned. And you are seeing things come out like you just -- like you just noticed and it's -- I think it's goings to be very interesting. It's very important for the country to now find out how that whole thing started. And in all fairness to Bob Mueller it started long before he was appointed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This was going on long before that. You understand. The first lady and I came down on the escalator on June 16th. And this started very shortly after that. It was a disgrace. Disgrace.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Mr. President, we expect a lot more coming out in the days, weeks, and even months ahead. We know at least 53 more closed door -- the testimony closed door of many of these players that will be released. We know that the inspector general, he now will have his report. We expect some time in, perhaps, in May, likely in May, where he will -- he has been investigating the FISA abuse issue.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And then, of course, we have Huber on leaking and whatever his report ultimately ends up becoming. We know that -- you know, there is a lot of information. And then the issue you have the last time I talked to you about a month ago, you said you would classify the FISA applications, you would declassify Gang of Eight material, 302 material.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> If the Grassley-Graham-Nunes memos are correct and the bulk of the information in the FISA applications were even as the "New York Times" suggested this week, may have been misinformation from the Russians that Hillary bought and paid for, that was disseminated to the media and the American people before that election -- you know, what would that mean to you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all, I was very impressed that "The New York Times" did that because that was the first good glimpse that maybe mainstream is going to pick up the greatest political scandal in the history of our country, again, bigger than Watergate, because it means so much. This was a coup. This wasn't stealing information from an office in the Watergate apartments.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This was an attempted coup. And it's inconceive -- like a third world country -- and inconceivable. And I have to say I think information is coming out and it's come out fast, much faster than anybody would have thought. And there are a lot of people very nervous about things that are going on. And I will say that I.G., the Inspector General Horowitz, he -- other than his conclusion, where he said no bias but he meant that in a different way than you would think.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He gave a great report last time. And I really hope that he is going to give -- I don't know him, he was appointed by Obama. That bothers me a little bit. But I think he's -- everything I can see, he's really an honorable guy. And I think he knows how big this is I think he knows how big this is. And if he is as honorable as he is supposed to be, the I.G. report coming out in three or four weeks from what I hear is going to be and should be and almost has to be a blockbuster because he has access to information that most people don't. And that's what he did the last time he was able to find things that a lot of people, great students of this whole thing like Devin Nunes who's -- who deserves a medal and Meadows and Jim Jordan all these guys, the way they -- Biggs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know every one of them they worked so hard. They worked -- they just couldn't stand what was happening to the country. They knew what was going on. The biggest problem with the Mueller report, he didn't mention any of this. He didn't mention Strzok and Page and McCabe and Comey and the lies and the leaks and overthrow and the whole thing with the Hillary Clinton got a win 100 million to 1, two lovers, two sick lovers, especially the one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, these were like children and they are FBI people, the top people in the FBI. I'm so embarrassed for the FBI when you look at it. But this was -- he didn't mention the insurance policy. It's a very, very sad thing. It can be cleared up incredibly well. But, you know, you know and so I do that without -- if you didn't go any further, there are tremendous problems.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm trying to be very nice and I want to be very tempered, but there are tremendous problems on the other side. If you had no other information, other than what you have right now, tremendous problems on the other side. But, why didn't they mention in the Mueller report all of the horrible things that we found out about the other side, including the fake dossier, the fake dossier which even "The New York Times" now says was fake, which, again, I respect that they came out and said it. This is too big a deal for mainstream media to give up. But the nice part is, as far as Trump is concerned and Trump administration, there is no collusion and there is no obstruction.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now it's time to look at the other side.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. President, if, in fact, "The New York Times" is right and the dossier was a disinformation campaign by Russia, that would mean as Bruce Ohr testified behind close the doors that he even told -- and by the way, I agree with you about the FBI, 99 percent are good people. And this is only a few at the top.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> But, if, in fact, they used that dossier as the bulk of information and it's disinformation -- to use "The New York Times" words -- from Russia that Hillary Clinton, the opposition party candidate paid for, that they never fully informed the FISA judges of and the Grassley-Graham memo, Nunes memo were right, that means that everybody signed off on those four FISA applications that would be, the first one, Jim Comey.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> That would be Sally Yates, Boente, and Rod Rosenstein, that means they never verified what they told that court. I would say that's a fraud on the FISA court. What do you say?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, from what I understand, they'd all be in a very big pile of trouble. That's the way I look at it and that's the way I hear. They would be in a very big amount of trouble. It would be a terrible thing if that's the case. And, you know, they have been denying that. And they started blaming all sorts of people, Papadopoulos who nobody knew, and Carter Page, who I actually feel very sorry for.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I never met them. But, you know, they made him -- they used him to try and get -- to try and spy on the campaign. You know, they went in and these two guys were put on councils having to do with various things. What difference does it make? But they were put on to foreign relations councils and with a large number of other people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And as soon as people saw their name -- even though I didn't meet Carter Page and Papadopoulos I actually sat at a table with him for about 15 minutes and that was it. I never spoke to him or anything. And they were -- you know, they have suffered a lot. Like I don't see that they were not foolish because, you know, the way it all happened was so crazy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they were hit like very few people have ever been hit. That was really to get to me. That was to get to the campaign. They started using them in order to spy on our campaign. It would look like, I mean, again, it will come out at some point so I don't want to be the one to say. But to me it seems to be pretty obvious when you look at what happened with Carter Page and it's -- they were spying.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The attorney general said it better than anybody the other day when he was asked yes, I think they were spying on the Trump campaign. You can't say it any better than that. And I think so, too.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. President, I'm going to -- I have to ask you about the New Green Deal, Biden and the media. But one last, last question. Will you declassify the FISA applications, Gang of Eight material, those 302s, or, you know, what we call on this program the "bucket of five"? Yes. Everything is going to be declassified and more, much more than what you just mentioned.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> It will all be declassified. I'm glad I waited because I thought that maybe they would object struck if I did it early and I think I was right. So I'm glad I waited. And now, the attorney general can take a look, a very strong look at whatever it is. But it will be declassified and more than what you just mentioned.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. President, we're now in the election season and Joe Biden made his big announcement today. I thought it was a very warm welcome you made for him on Twitter which I read at the beginning of the show mere tonight. Generally, your thoughts on him, his entry into the race. You have Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren, Robert Francis O'Rourke, your reaction to the, well, now a record number of slate of 20 people that would like to take you on in 2020?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know who it is going to be. Maybe Sanders or maybe Biden. I think, you know, when you look at Joe -- I have known Joe over the years. He is not the brightest light bulb in the group, I don't think, but he has a name that they know. He is coming on with some little cute statements about me that he talked about the way the world is today.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I will tell you the way the world is today is we have a strong military. We have choice for our veterans. They have choice now instead of waiting in line all day long, all week long, all month long. They have choice. They can go out to a private doctor. We pay the bill and they don't have to die waiting in line.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. We have gotten rid of the individual mandate. We have had the biggest cut in regulations which is one of the things creating all these great jobs because we have the best unemployment numbers that we've ever had. Today, we have the most people working literally today, just came out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have the most people working than we have ever had in the history of our country. Almost 160 million people are working to have jobs. And it's incredible. So, you know, that's really where we are today. We rebuilt the military. We have ordered jets, the likes of which no country has. We have fighter jets, the F- 35, the F-18. We have jets the likes which no country has at all.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We are ordering great, great ships, boats, and aircraft carriers and they are all being built in the United States. That's jobs. It's all being built right here. Best equipment in the world. Best missiles in the world. We don't want to use them but if we have to, we are set. Nobody has what we have. Nobody has our military.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody is even close. When I came in, we had a depleted military. We had an economy that was going down. You remember the numbers. They were terrible. And they were going down. We were going to be in negative numbers very soon. And now, we have numbers that are incredible. The economy is setting records.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When foreign leaders come in to see me, Sean, they always say, thank you, it's great to meet you, sir, and congratulations on your economy. It's the greatest economy anywhere in the world -- which it is. Nobody is even close to us. That's because of the things we have been done. So, when Biden makes the statement talking about the soul, I mean the soul, take a look at the Obama -- you know, I heard somebody say before that there was such dissension and division.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People forget there was tremendous division during the Obama administration, tremendous division. We actually have a great spirit right now. And, you know, just to finish that off. We are a country respected again. We are respected all over the world. They all respect us. Even today I see where President Putin in Russia made the statement that it's great to be able to help us with Kim Jong-un and North Korea.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We want to get rid of the nuclear weapons. We all have to get -- Russia has to get rid of them and China has to get rid of them. By the way China, President Xi has been a big help. We are working on a great trade deal. But he's been a great help at the border I'm talking about the border between North Korea and China.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, you know, a lot of good things are happening. We are respected again throughout the world. And that's a great thing.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Well, in Biden's case in particular, he is going to run on his economic record versus yours, his position on Iran and Israel and North Korea versus yours. But, generally speaking, we have not just Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, about 100 House, Senate members at least and many of the Democratic presidential candidates for 2020 have bought into the New Green Deal.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Everything is free, no oil, no gas. Comrade de Blasio has added no steel building or glass buildings in New York in five years. But importantly, airplanes are gone, combustion engines gone. How do you react if these are the policies you will be running against?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's interesting because I just heard about this crazy deal in New York City where they want to build concrete buildings that little tiny windows. You know, I built a lot of buildings, Sean, I can tell you, the bigger the window, the better I did with it. People want big windows and now they're going to take them down to nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, the whole thing is crazy. The New Green Deal, OK, and it's got to be some kind of a joke. It's got to be -- they have to be kidding but, you know, I saw the senator from Hawaii who was so nasty to Judge Kavanaugh. And that's another thing, we'll soon have within a period of about two months, 145 brand new federal judges and two Supreme Court judges.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But she was so nasty to now judge, Justice Kavanaugh, so horrible. And they asked her about it, the New Green Deal. They said, how about that? And she goes, well, I'm in Hawaii and I understand they won't allow airplanes. And she said, it's hard for me but I will approve it anyway. Even though there is no way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Somebody said they will build a train to Hawaii. No, it's a crazy thing. I can't believe they are really serious. But I hope I get a chance to run against it. I hope they don't decimate it. Sometimes I almost wish I didn't say as much as I have said to you about it, because I want that to go through and I want to run against it. I don't think they are going to win anyway but sure as hell not going to win with that legislation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Never going to happen anyway from a practical standpoint, obviously. But it is amazing to see the senators -- senators that I have known for a long time, distinguished Democrats, and they are fawning behind her. She is talking about the deal, but I don't know if they are kidding. I don't know if they are desperate for votes or I don't know if they are incompetent, but they are sitting behind her and they are acting like they actually agree with what she is saying about fuel and cows and all of the things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, it's ridiculous situation. So I just hope it keeps going. I hope nobody criticizes it too badly. I have already done too much tonight, because maybe I would have talked them out of it and that would have been a very bad thing.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> OK. You don't want to do it. We had an incident this book. I want to go to the issue of the border -- obviously, a defining issue for you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And Congress was unable to override your emergency declaration. The Pentagon who identified, I believe the figure was $9 billion of unused monies and you were going to apply that to the wall.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Then we had the incident this week where we had some people cross our border and literally, you know, took one of our guys' guns. You put out a tweet better not happen again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> What's the latest with both the wall? What's the latest on that situation and what is -- I don't know if you heard about this contractor that said he can build a whole wall for a lot cheaper than anybody else and get it done by 2020. Are you aware of that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, we are dealing with him, actually. It's Fisher comes from North Dakota, recommended strongly by a great new senator as you know, Kevin Cramer. And they are real. But they have been bidding and so far they haven't been meeting the bids. I thought they would. But we're up for a bid -- we are building many sections of wall right now that's under construction right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I intend to have by the end of next year over 400 miles of wall which renovated a lot of wall already. A lot of the wall was, you know, I'm good at this stuff. That's what I do. We renovated a lot. We had wall that was falling down but structurally strong or can be strong. So we saved a lot of money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We renovated. We fixed it and it's much quicker and frankly much less expensive. So, we have renovated a lot and we built a lot. We built a lot of new wall. In some cases, we have ripped all wall down because it was in too bad of shape and we built brand new wall. But we are building a lot of sections. And actually, over the next two to three weeks, we are giving out at lot of different sections.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They will be building it in different areas by different contractors, a similar design and a really good design.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> And you have the --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Less money, much more beautiful and actually stronger.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Let me -- "The Washington Times," let me go to the issue of media and New York -- I'm sorry "The Washington Post," "New York Times" received Pulitzers for their, quote, coverage of the Russian probe. You've seen the coverage over two-plus years. Russia, Russia, Russia. Trump, Trump, Trump. Collusion, collusion, collusion.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> The Mueller report couldn't be any more clear on the issue specifically. Do you think the news media in this country and their coverage on this owes you an apology?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they do owe me an apology, a big one. They owe you an apology and all of the people that you mentioned previously and some of the other people --
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I'm not holding my breath.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We actually had a lot of support. I mean, I watch you and Tucker and I watch Laura and your great guys in the morning with Steve and Ainsley and Brian. Brian came a long way. I kid him but he came a long way, and so many other people. Not only on FOX, in all fair news. But you look at -- Jesse has been so great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, just so many people. But we had, really, a lot of support, including as you would say "The Washington Times" and some others. But, generally speaking, it's corrupt reporting. Generally speaking it was fake news. And a term that, you know, I'm very proud of somebody said which is the best of the names, I don't know, maybe fake news.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Who knows what it is? Now, they use it. You know, they use it to describe something. They think they get out of it by use it. They are tricky people. But they were fake, they were corrupt. If they could change, I would be the first one to say I respect the fact that you have changed. But if they don't change, they have lost all credibility.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you read the stories that they wrote about the Russia witch-hunt and, by the way, guys like Dan Bongino and Gregg Jarrett and Justice Jeanine, how about Judge Jeanine whose mother just died today which is horrible.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> I know. Our prayers are with her.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just spoke to her. She is a great woman, loved her mother more than anybody other than her beautiful children. But, I mean, she loved her mother. She was a great daughter. You know, she has gone through a hard time. But how about -- how about Jeanine? And I mean, it's been incredible. We have far more support than people understand.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If we didn't, I wouldn't even be talking to you right now. I mean, it would be a total mess. We had enough to fight the deep state. We had enough to fight corrupt media, mainstream media. I mean, NBC, I think was worst, frankly. I think NBC is more corrupt than CNN if that's possible. And I made them a lot of money with "The Apprentice". Can you believe it? I was on that thing 12 years with "The Apprentice". They wanted to sign me three or four more years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They came up to my office. I said, I'm running for president. They've tried to talk me out of it. I figured at least they would give me, for whatever reason, they would give me great, but they were --- I think they were more hostile frankly than CNN, which is hard to believe. But this fake, horrible stuff, nobody can believe how dishonest they have been.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Mr. President I have known you personally for well over two decades. And by the way I don't think the fake news brand is going away, but on all the issues you ran on -- conservative, originalist, constitutional justices, tax cuts, deregulation, Israel, Iran, foreign policy, the wall. We're now energy independent for the first time in I think 70, 75 years.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> We are now a net exporter of energy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> The one thing Republicans, you've gotten part of it done. That was that the individual mandate.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And you want to take on healthcare and Mitch McConnell said not this year.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he is going to be great. Mitch is doing a very good job. We really work -- he's got a passion for the courts, and a passion for judges. We worked great on that. And we'll be really good with healthcare. I mean, we want to have -- we are going to do things that nobody has ever seen on healthcare.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we have to get back to the House. And in order to do it, we have to take back the House. If we don't take back the House, then we have a problem. You are never going to have good healthcare, because Obamacare is a disaster. It's too expensive, not working. And we had it done. It was done and then John McCain at the very last moment late in the evening went thumbs down and everybody said, what was that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> John McCain went thumbs down. He did the Republican Party a tremendous disservice and did the nation a tremendous disservice. Tremendous. And it's unfortunate but we had it done. And had we known he was going to -- because he said he was voting for it all day long. Had we known he was going to vote against it, I think we could have convinced one of the other two people that voted against it. We could have convinced them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I feel confident to go for it. But we didn't even try because we knew we had John McCain and we had everybody, and we're all set. And he went thumbs down at the very last moment. And I thought it was a disgraceful thing to do and very, very bad for our country and bad for healthcare. But we're going to do something that will be great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have to get the House back. It will be much better than Obamacare. And don't forget, they want to take 180 million private insurance plans away, people, 180 million people are going to be stripped of their great insurance that they have right now because we have made great insurance available to people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Obamacare is actually, it's very important, but it's actually a smart part. We have a very big case in court. I think eventually the Democrats and Republicans would come together. But we have a fantastic plan that we'll be rolling out and subject to us winning back the House, keeping the presidency, which I think we're going to do. And also obviously winning the Senate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And as you know, in '18, we picked up seats in the Senate but nobody ever gives us credit for that we won the governorships of many states, including Ohio and Georgia and Florida and we had, you know, just great. We were at 53 to 47. Nobody talks about that. We had actually a very successful -- we really did.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We had a very successful '18 election and don't forget the Senate that approves the judges nominees. But it approves most importantly perhaps the judges.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Mr. President, in this whole investigative process, you never invoked executive privilege. You handed over every document. You told your staff to cooperate, that's fairly unprecedented. And, yes, everybody knows that you said it was a witch hunt. Pretty often, you said, you're innocent, no collusion the whole time.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And you talked about, oh, why don't we fire, you know, Mueller or Rosenstein, whatever happened to be. But you had the authority in the Article 2, according to Alan Dershowitz and other lawyers, but that's a separate issue. You never did those things. And I guess my question, when you said this week, you will now fight all subpoenas and enough cooperating.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Can you expand on what you meant there and what that means?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, very simply, because enough is enough. I could have fired everybody. But --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Under Article 2.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wanted to you have transparency. Article 2. I could have fired everybody. I could have fired Mueller. I you could have fired anybody that I wanted to fire, Article 2. I fired nobody other than Comey, and very interesting and that was early and people don't talk about that, but the very interesting thing about firing Comey is that everybody wanted him fired, all the Democrats.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, virtually everybody, the Democrats thought he was horrible. The Republicans thought he was horrible. And I said, you know, this is going to be wonderful. I'm going to fire this guy. When he gets fired, I think it would be popular. It thought it was go going to be bipartisan firing. And he got fired and the Democrats sat back and they though, and the same people that two days earlier saying how horrible he was, were saying, oh, this is a terrible thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's -- what's a terrible thing is they are not putting our country first. I have been the most transparent president in history. I said let anybody speak. The White House counsel can speak. I heard, I mean this is incredible, but I heard they interviewed 500 people I didn't know we had that many people between the White House and other branches.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, who would think they interviewed 500 people if that is possible to be correct. They spent, as I told you, $35 million. They had unlimited human resources. They had the FBI working for 'em. They had U.S. attorneys. They had the Justice Department working for them. And they found no collusion. But I was totally transparent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't tell anybody you can't go. I could have. I could have sell you are not going to testify. Nobody is going to testify. When I say it, they do what I say. I could have said that. But what happened, Sean, is I wanted to be totally transparent. So, then we get no collusion, no obstruction. And then the House starts. Now, we're going to go and we're going to go further.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I said, we've had it. That's enough.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. President, only for the constraints of time, I would love to ask you in detail about all these candidates. How about one word description on some of the top candidates for 2020? Like, for example, if I say the word Joe Biden, one or two words?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think we are calling him Sleepy Joe, because I have known him for a while and he's a pretty sleepy guy. He's not going to be able to deal with President Xi. I will tell you. That's a different level of energy and, frankly, intelligence. So, I thought to refer to him as Sleepy Joe, because -- a lot of people wanted me to take the word "sleepy" to something that rhymes with it. Does that make sense to you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I thought it was too nasty.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes, I guess. Well, welcome to the race. I see you at starting gate. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But he is not going to be able to do the job.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> What about Bernie Sanders?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he's got a lot of energy but he has got misguided energy and he's done very poorly in terms of the Senate. He has had very little legislation. I think he talks a lot and doesn't get it done.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Robert Francis O'Rourke?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's a fluke. Ted Cruz did a good job. I helped him a lot in Texas. We went down and had a couple of massive rallies. And the people of Texas are incredible. They figured it all out. He is fading very fast. I think he is fading very, very fast. It looks like he's going to be a thing of the past very soon.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But he was a hot item for a little while. I'll show you how dishonest the press was. I went down to El Paso. We did a tremendous rally, I guess we had 35,000 people between inside and out, at least. And he had 502 people, and the press said, they both had big rallies. They both had big rallies. I said, wait a minute, one has close to 40,000 people, one has 500 people, and they were very much comparing them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's the way the media is. But then that's why people don't like the media. They got to straighten it up, because otherwise, it's not free press. But he is fading fast, there's no question about it.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right. We have about a minute left, less than a minute left. Mayor Pete, Kamala Harris?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't see either of them. I think she has got a little bit of a nasty wit but that might be it. And Mayor Pete is not going to make it.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would hope he would. I hope -- I'm rooting for him but he is not going to make it.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right. Mr. President, you have been very generous, once again, with your time. I have think it's important, sometimes I know when you do other interviews that people want to play gotcha fight and they had their own agenda. But every once in a while, I think it's important for the American people to hear you in answer in your own words at length on some important issues.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> We do appreciate you coming on and giving so much time to this audience in particular. Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Thank you, Sean.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right, that was a great line. Joining us now from the Spin Room in Milwaukee is 2016 Republican Presidential front runner, Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, were you happy with the debate tonight? I thought it was extremely substantive.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I thought it was great. I thought the anchors really were -- the moderators were really elegant -- all three the way they presented themselves, the way they presented the questions. I thought it was a very elegant evening and very substantive, as you would say, yes.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You know -- there were differences on economic plans and immigration we just played. It was interesting to listen to Kasich and Jeb Bush going up kind of against you and Ted Cruz.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> And I thought Ted Cruz made a point if these were bankers crossing the border, if these were journalists crossing the border and driving down rates, I think the press might have a different point of view. I thought that was a strong point.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're on the same side of it. You know if you back to the early 1950s, Dwight Eisenhower, and I made that point during the debate, he took out in terms of illegal immigration, he felt you had to do it. He was a nice man, a high quality man, but he moved out 1.5 million people and brought them back to where they came from.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They were here illegally. I think -- it really does have big precedent. We either have a country or we don't, Sean. We have a country, we have to have borders, we have borders, and we have to have laws. We either have a country or we don't. It's that simple.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Mr. Trump, it seems like nobody talks about this aspect of it, too, the economic impact in terms of people that now have to compete for jobs, it drives down wages, but more importantly, how much is this costing our country in terms of our educational system, our criminal justice system, our health care system, we're talking about billions and billions of dollars because people don't respect our laws and sovereignty.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sean, I've heard the number is $250 billion a year, illegal immigration, and frankly, it's an expensive proposition, moving and everything else, but you are talking about tremendous amounts of money that we spend, not to mention other things, for instance, when you look at the crime and other elements that happen that are also very bad.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we're talking about 250 billion dollars a year, that's a lot of money for a country that owes $19 trillion.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> And $120 trillion in unfunded liability, that's a lot of money. You are absolutely right. You talked about every tax plan that was mentioned on that stage is better than the mess we have now. And I agreed with your statement. I want you to specifically lay out your tax plan, because I don't think people understand there's a significant portion of your American population that pays zero.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You said fill in I win on your tax form.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The people at the very bottom economically, less than $25,000 if it's a family pay zero. Now I'd like to have them pay something just as a token, but the truth is it would cost so much from the standpoint of bureaucracy. So we want to get them into tax-paying citizens by having them make a lot of money and start paying taxes, but we brought it down, it's a graduated tax, and we will have four classes right now, as you probably know, start at zero.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It'll go up to 20 and 25 percent. The corporate tax is 15 percent, which would be one of the lowest in the world and our country will be booming. We're going to charge 10 percent to bring the corporate inversion, bring all that money, the trillions of dollars back in the country. It wants to come back in, but there is no way of getting it here because of the taxes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we're going to have a plan that's very dynamic. It's been very well received by a lot of people. It's going to be graduated and a lot of good things are going to happen, Sean.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I agree with you repatriating that money, that's going to bring trillions of dollars back, the energy specter if we become energy independent. That's a big component. I would also -- what would your corporate tax rate be if America becomes the corporate tax haven of the world, then all of these multi-national companies will want to headquarter right here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to have a 15 percent corporate tax rate, and that's getting to be on the low side. Right now, we're the highest taxed anywhere in the world and we're going to be on the low side. There will be a couple of countries lower but not many. So we're taking it from the highest in the world to being on the very low side.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I think probably the most passionate moment you had in any of the four debates, this was you talking about Iraq and the troops and taking the oil. Let's play this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Begin Video Clip] Look at Libya, look at Iraq, look at the mess we have after spending $2 trillion, thousands of lives, wounded warriors all over the place, who I love, all over. We have nothing. I said keep the oil. We should have kept the oil, believe me. We should have kept the oil. You know what, we should have given the oil -- we should have given big chunks to the people that lost their arms, their legs, and their families, and their sons and daughters because right now, you know who has a lot of that oil, Iran and ISIS.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [End Video Clip]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You know we paid for the liberation of all these countries and they don't ever give us a dime. I thought that was a very powerful moment in the debate for you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They give us nothing. And that's because we have people that don't know what they're doing. Sean, they give us nothing. You are one of the few people willing to say it. But we have people that don't have a clue, and we should have had that. You know I've been saying on your show for three years, you have to lead, keep the oil.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We shouldn't have been in there in the first place. They destabilized the whole Middle East. Once you are in, you leave and keep the oil. So now who has the oil? ISIS has it, Iran has it. We don't have it. We have nothing.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You know I was interested in a couple of other things you said tonight. And I agree with this point, too. If Vladimir Putin, now that we in all likelihood, he had a Russian airliner shot out of the sky by ISIS, if he wants to take out ISIS, let him do it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've been saying it for two months. If he wants to do it -- so now, he's not in love with ISIS. He doesn't want them coming into Russia, believe me. But now on top of it he had an airplane blown out, he really doesn't like -- if he doesn't like them and wants to go after ISIS, Sean, I think that's just great.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I'm interested, do you agree with the idea of the separate refugee camps maybe within Syria where we provide humanitarian assistance, medical supplies, food and water, rather than people migrating to Europe or coming to the United States and also protected military. Is that something you support?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's called a safe zone. They take a big piece of land -- a big swatch in Syria and you get all the countries like Germany and others that are ruining themselves, they're ruining Germany. It's hard to believe she's allowing that to happen. You create a big safe zone and take care of the people until they can ultimately go back.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's better. Can you imagine us taking 250,000? President Obama wants to bring 200 to 250,000 people in, and he doesn't even know where they come from. They don't have papers. We don't know who they are. So we can't do that. It would cost millions of dollars.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And James Clapper said ISIS and Al Qaeda will infiltrate the refugee community.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely. Absolutely, it will happen.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You also said tonight -- we have made this mistake many times in the country and you pointed this out. I want you to expand on it. Often sometimes we say we will support the rebels in this case against Assad, we don't know who they are. We don't know if they are worse. You mention Libya as a great example, now Libya is a safe haven for terrorist training camps, etcetera.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Explain what you would do instead.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's true. You know everybody says oh, we want to get rid of Assad, Assad is no beauty. Assad is not great. Assad is a bad guy. But we're supporting these people. A lot of people think the people we're supporting are ISIS. So we're supporting the rebels, we're spending hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars giving them weapons, and Russia is fighting us because they don't want them, and we're supporting people we don't know who they are.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I spoke to a general the other day, very knowledgeable guy. He said, Mr. Trump, we have absolutely no idea who these people are. So here we are again, we have Libya, and you have Iraq, now we're supporting other people. They'll probably be worse than Assad. What are we doing? We have to build our country and fix our country, knock the hell out of ISIS, but we have to build our country, Sean.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know that, and you agree with that 100 percent.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I did like the moment -- tonight, I thought you were very gracious, you said, will you please let Jeb Bush speak?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I meant it. He was cut off. I meant it actually.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I know you did. I'm just -- it was just an interesting side note. Last question, 5600 pages, TPP, nobody read Obamacare, they pass these bills all the time this way. Should there be a limit on the number of page a bill is before we pass these things considering? I think Ted Cruz made the point its more pages than the bible and less meaning than any one page.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Almost 6,000 pages, nobody's read it. We have no idea what we're doing, there are no currency manipulation clauses there. China's going to come in the back door, everyone's laughing at us. I am the one that brought it up tonight, 6,000 pages and nobody has even read it. We truly don't know what we're doing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It should not be passed?
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right, Mr. Trump thanks so much for being with us. Appreciate your time as well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Sean.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. President, great to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Sean.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You literally just finished the press conference with President Putin moments ago. A lot came up. You were very strong at the end of that press conference.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You said, where are the servers? What about Peter Strzok said? Where are the 33,000 emails?
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> And there was this mystery answer that I think surprised a lot of people by the president of Russia, as it relates to the Mueller investigation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all, he said there was no collusion whatsoever. I guess he said he said as strongly as you can say it. They have no information on Trump. It was an interesting statement, too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, many years ago, when I was there, it was '13, quite a long time ago, he said there were many, many business people there. In all fairness, I was a very successful businessman but I was one of a lot of people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, I have to say, I've turned that around, where businesses now are starting to come back in because they know that I'm going to get something very substantial having to do with tax cuts. But businesses now -- you see the car companies, what's happening, they're expanding, they're coming into the country. You see Foxconn, that makes the Apple iPhone -- [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> He said it was nonsense.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He said it's nonsense, that's right. He also says there is absolutely no collusion, which you know, and everybody that watches your show knows, and I think most of the country knows, and Tucker standing over there definitely knows, because he gets it. He's one of the people that get it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I'll tell you that I thought it was a really amazing time -- not about that. I think it's a shame, we are talking about nuclear proliferation. We're talking about Syria and humanitarian aid, we're talking about all these different things, and we get questions on the witch hunt.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I don't think the people out in the country buy it. But the reporters like to give it a shot. I thought that President Putin was very, very strong.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Let's talk about how the day went. You actually used the term four hours ago that changed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Was it that quickly and that profound?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We had a very long meeting and it was a good meeting. We discussed so many different things, including nuclear, including war and peace, including economic, Syria, Ukraine, we discussed many, many things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And at the end of a long period of time, I mean, it was really a long -- it was just the two of us, and interpreters. And at the end of this meeting, I think we really came to a lot of good conclusions, a really good conclusion for Israel. Something very strong.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He is a believer in Israel. He's a fan of Bibi. And really helping him a lot and will help him a lot, which is good for all of us.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Let's talk about specifics that you went over, as it relates to both Syria, which he has been a supporter of the Assad regime, and, of course, Iran, which is the number one state sponsor of terror, fomenting proxy wars.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Well, in Syria, we are getting very close. I think it's becoming a humanitarian situation, and a lot of people are going to move back to Syria from Turkey and from Jordan and from different places, they're going to move back, less so from Europe. But they will be moving back from lots of different places.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I really think we are not far apart on Syria. I do think that on Iran, he probably would have liked to keep the deal in place because that's good for Russia. You know, they do business with -- it's good for a lot of the countries that do business with Iran, but it's not good for this country and it's ultimately not good for the world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if you look at what is happening, Iran is falling apart, they have riots in all their cities. The inflation is rampant and going through the roof, and not that you want to hurt anybody, but that regime, we will let the people know that we are behind them 100 percent. But they are having big protests all over the country, probably as big as they have ever had before. And that all happens since I terminated that deal. So, we'll see.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Can you partner with Russia to perhaps stop the fomenting of terror, stop the proxy wars? Was that discussed?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it was. I think it would be a great thing if we could do it. You have some people saying, oh, you have to do -- you know, get involved with Russia, but if we could stop killing all over the place, or terrorism, we discussed radical Islamic terror at great length, because they have the problem, too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We discussed ISIS and, as you know, we've pretty much eradicated ISIS in the Middle East. And we've done a very strong job, he acknowledged that. But we discussed ISIS and the threat of ISIS, and basically the threat of terrorism.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Let me go to the issue of nuclear proliferation. 2021, the START Treaty needs to be extended, and also the INF as it relates to -- and he did bring up the idea of missile defense.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Were those issues discussed, and did you make any progress?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think we're at the very beginning, they are very important issues.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> To me, the most important issue is the nuclear issue, because I know President Obama said that global warming is our biggest problem, and I would say that nuclear warming is our biggest problem by the factor of about 5 million. The nuclear problem, we have to make sure, we have to be very careful.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, you know, if you look at Russia and the United States, that's 90 percent of the nuclear weapons. And we have to do something and working on other countries. And he also said he wants to be very helpful with North Korea.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We are doing well with North Korea. We have time. There is no rush. You know, it's been going on for many years, but we are doing very well. As you know, we got our hostages back. There's been no testing. There's been no nuclear explosion, which we would have known about immediately.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There's been no rockets going over Japan. No missiles going over Japan. And that's now been nine months, and the relationship is very good. You saw the nice letter he wrote.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And so, I think a lot of good things are happening, but President Putin is very much into making that all happen.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> A lot of people in the lead up to this -- obviously, you met with our NATO allies.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> And America pays 70 cents of every dollar, and a lot of people have not lived up to their commitment as it relates to that.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And also, interestingly, because a big part of NATO's mission is to prevent any hostility from Russia. And yet, Angela Merkel wants to import billions of dollars' worth of their energy, up to 70 percent, which I would argue, that would make them vulnerable and --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's paying Russia billions of dollars. Now that's her choice. I mean, she is going to do it, but it's a little tough when you are in NATO and you do that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will say that I was amazed at the media because honestly, I was there for a day and a half, and it started right when I got there, and I was very respectful. But I told people, it's unfair. The United States could be paying for 91 percent, OK? Could be. So, the minimum is 70 percent, but it's probably 91.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, we are paying for 91 percent of the cost of keeping Europe safe. On top of that, the European Union takes total advantage of us with tariffs and with trade barriers. But they kill us on trade. We lost $151 billion last year. So they beat us on trade, and we defend them for essentially nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I said, it's not going to be that way anymore. You've got to pay up. You've got to pay up. You got to pay more --
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> The secretary general gave you the credit.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He gave me all of the credit.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> For --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Last year, they raised $44 billion more only because -- more, additional. And he said it was only because of President Trump. So, I figured I'd wake up the next day and read these wonderful stories, and by the way, I got along great --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Do you really believe the media would report that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I actually thought finally, I'm going to have a great story. OK? Foreign relations, I'm going to have a great story.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And instead of saying that I raise $44 billion, not million, $44 billion last year for NATO, I raised -- it could be over $100 billion this year and into the future. They said that I treated the heads of other nations rough. And I didn't. I actually have great relationships with them. [Commercial Break]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> In the lead up to the summit, you actually tweeted out if you were given the greatest city of Moscow for retribution for all the sins, et cetera, Russia. The media would be asking, why you didn't get to St. Petersburg as well?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said that. I said if I got Moscow as part of a deal, they'd say, here's Moscow, please pardon us, the soccer ball was really very nice. I have to say. It was very nice.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, they did a great job in running that. But it is true. You know, I said, if I got Moscow, they would want St. Petersburg with it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So the media was very unfair. I never thought -- this was when I said, this is foolproof. I raised $44 billion and the secretary general said he raised $44 billion and it's only President Trump, because I said, otherwise, we are going to have to start thinking about our relationship to NATO.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I also said this. NATO is wonderful but it helps Europe a lot more than it helps us and yet we are paying for 90 percent of it. So, I was amazed that most of most of the media -- you didn't and some others didn't -- but most of the media said that I was tough, very tough, and nasty to foreign leaders.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I really wasn't at all. But I did say, you have to pay up.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You talked about Europe as a foe. You talked about Vladimir Putin as a foe and you clarified that means a competitor. Similarly, the media's upset you say an enemy of the people.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Aren't you really saying they are doing their job? And --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, when I say enemy of the people, I'm not talking about all of the media. I'm talking about there is a big percentage of the media, when you look at CNN, how false their reports are. When you look at NBC and some of the others, when you read "The New York Times," it's just a story after story after story that's just a negative spin.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we are doing great things. We have the greatest economy in the history of our country. We have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country, the best African-American unemployment numbers in history, Hispanic in history, women's numbers in history --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Fourteen states set records.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Fourteen states, I didn't know that.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Record low unemployment.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Surprise that's only 14 actually. That's a disappointing number.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Well, keep working hard, I think it will get there.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> But the more amazing thing, too, is we have more jobs available than we actually have people on unemployment.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> First time.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And the labor participation rate in this country has never been higher.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> First time.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Let me go back, because everybody in the media is so focused on this. In 2014, in "The Washington Times," Devin Nunes said with certainty that Russia would try to impact the 2016 elections. Barack Obama in the month before the 2016 elections, and I will read and I will quote, "No serious person out there would suggest that somehow you can even rig America's elections, no evidence that it has happened in the past, which is not true, and number two, or that it could happen in this election, and I invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and to go out there and try to get votes." He said that two weeks before the election.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win, he didn't want to do anything to disturb it, and you know, frankly, when I won, he said this is the biggest deal. But before I won, he said this is nothing, and it can't happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a very dishonest deal. And you know, you have to find out who did Peter Strzok report to? Because it was Comey and it was McCabe, but it was also probably Obama.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you think that Obama didn't know what was going on, when you watch -- and I said it today, with President Putin, when you watch Peter Strzok's performance, the lover of Lisa Page, when you watch that performance, the FBI, I tell you, I know so many people in the FBI. These are incredible people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What they have -- what they are going through, watching this guy, a total phony. I mean, how about we'll stop him? Or something to that affect.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> They said we will stop you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Well --
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> We'll stop him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And then --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Insurance policy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he said originally, I guess it was the two of them. No. Then he said the next say, I meant the American people. And even the Democrats say that doesn't work -- [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Of course Lisa Page contradicted him. And he gives a more honest assessment.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I heard that she did much better than he did, and took a lot of hard shots, but at least she was honest about it. He is a disgrace to our country, he's a disgrace to the great FBI. A disgrace. And how he is still being paid is beyond belief.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Did you like President Putin's idea that Robert Mueller should go talk to him because -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was fascinated by it. So they have a treaty where they work together with the United States, because everyone says we don't have an extradition treaty, but they have a treaty where they were together, and his prosecutors were prosecuted, and he said that Robert Mueller's people could go with them, but they probably won't.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes, interesting. Let me ask you -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The 13 angry Democrats do you think they want to go, I don't think so.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And of course, this pit bull Andrew Weissmann who I think has a pretty atrocious record that we have found.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's very sad what's happening to our country because of this. We have never done better in so many ways, including economically. But when you see this thing going on, and I will tell you, it's driven a wedge between us and Russia. Maybe we've just knock down that wedge but it has driven a wedge.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And President Putin said that, one of the early things that he said when we started, he said it's really a shame because we could do so much good, whether it's humanitarian aid throughout the Middle East whether it's not just Syria, so many different things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The safety of nuclear power, which is ultimately, there is nothing bigger and nothing more important. And they drove a phony wedge, just a phony witch hunt. A rigged deal. With guys like Peter Strzok and Comey and McCabe.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> McCabe, Strzok, Page.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The whole group. And you can imagine who else. It's a real, it's a real shame.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And if there was Russian interference, Hillary played through a law firm, a investigative group Fusion GPS, the hired a foreign national -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> -- that put together a Russian dossier that was used to lie about you. Which by the way, Putin confirmed today he didn't have such information on his peril.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He knew exactly about it because he's been saying it. It makes him angry when he sees it. And you know, it's very interesting, you look at what's happening, and you look at the whole thing. He understood it and he was -- I don't know if you could see, he was incensed even talking about it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But he is willing to take those 12 people, there is no extradition. But he is willing to let Robert Mueller's people go over there and bring a big investigation of those people working together with the Russian investigators.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Last question for this. I know you've got a lot to do. And you just finished a busy day. You've now been to 21 countries since January of 2017. Like North Korea, you are very clear in saying that this is a process. Where would you like to be in a year both with North Korea and with Russia?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think we're doing very well with Russia as of today. I thought we're doing horribly before today. Really, I mean horribly, dangerously.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> It has been that dramatic today.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it was great today, but I think it was really bad five hours ago. I think we really had a potential problem. I think with two nuclear nations. Ninety percent of the nuclear power in the world between these two nations, and we've had a phony witch hunt deal drive us apart.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> This is the biggest wedge. This was the biggest wedge.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think, well, it's the thing that he told me. When he went in he said what a shame. He felt it was very hard for me to make a deal because of, you know, all of this nonsense and much of the case.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You said before it's nonsense.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have to understand, you take a look, you look at all these people, I mean, some were hackers, some of them. Then again, you know, these are 14 people and they have 12 people. These aren't 12 people involve in the campaign. Then you have many other people. Some told a lie.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at Flynn, it's a shame. But the FBI didn't think he was lying. With Paul Manafort, who clearly is a nice man. You look at what's going on with him. It's like Al Capone.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> The 2005 tax case.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The case that I guess is very real.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Twenty three hours.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's just a sad thing. It's a very sad thing for our country to say this.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you so much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you so much. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
