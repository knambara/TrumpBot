<Don Imus> <Positive> It's 8:30 exactly here at WFAN in New York, and here with us now, Donald Trump. Good morning, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How you doing, Don?
<Don Imus> <Positive> I'm fine. How are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm very good. Thanks.
<Don Imus> <Negative> So what is this now? A bunch of these drunken Injuns want to open a casino down there in New Jersey?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's a battle that we're fighting and I think it's being successfully fought. A lot of the reservations are being, in some people's opinion, at least to a certain extent run by organized crime and organized crime elements, as you can imagine. There's no protection. There's no anything. And it's become a joke. It's become a laughing joke. And the politicians around 1987 passed a law where the Indians can have virtually unsupervised casino gaming. So we're in there fitting it and I think we're making a lot of progress. I think you'll see some very major things happening over the next couple of months.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In your mind, is there any legitimacy in them being allowed to have casinos in states where there aren't now casino, like say Connecticut?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's up to the states. I mean, one of the things we did is bring a lawsuit and say it's states' rights. As an example. Governor Cuomo in New York didn't want to have the Indians having casinos. The churches didn't want it. It knocks out the bingo. It knocks out the charities, it knocks out a lot of other things. So what they did is they filed suits and they filed everything else. Ultimately, the Governor of New York was forced to pass this horrendous situation that's taking place ia upstate New York. I think it's going to be changed and I think it's going to be changed fairly quickly, Don.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> So will Indians be allowed to open casinos here in New York?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's going to be unlikely within the next year.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Okay. This is just my opinion, but I don't think it makes sense to anybody to have Indians operate casinos in New Jersey.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> General George Custer was against it also and looked what happened to him.
<Don Imus> <Positive> But in New Jersey -- obviously you have three casinos -- you already have casinos.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right, but the difference is I pay taxes. The Indians aren't paying any taxes. The Indians aren't putting anything back into what's happening. The funny thing is Cuomo was forced to put -- and now all of a sudden they send him certified letters, "We want bridges."""
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They call it the sovereign nation. They call it a nation, this great sovereign nation, the Indian tribes. All of a sudden, it's nations.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Before it wasn't a nation, before gambling. Now it's this great sovereign nation. We protect, we do this, we do that, but when it comes to gambling, it's a sovereign nation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it's really a double standard and no taxes are paid. No supervision's there, tremendous crime, and most of the Indiana don't want it themselves. The leaders -- you know, all chiefs and no Indians, and the leaders want it for the obvious reason, but I think it's something that's going to end or is certainly going to be supervised very, very stringently.
<Don Imus> <Negative> Would there be any reason, if push comes to shove, for you to become a member of these tribes?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hell, I think if we lost various things, I could perhaps become an Indian myself.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> You know, do one of those Robert Bly deals.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think I might have more Indian blood than a lot of the so-called Indiana that are trying to open up the reservations.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I looked at one of them -- well, I won't go into the whole story, but I can tell you, I said to him, "I think I have more Indian blood in me than you have in you."" And he laughed at me and he sort of acknowledged that I was right
<Don Imus> <Positive> A couple of these Indians up in Connecticut look like Michael Jordan, frankly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think if you've ever been up there, you would truly say that these are not Indians. One of them was telling me his name is Chief Running Water Sitting Bull, and I said, "That's a long name."" He said
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you, they got duped in Washington and it's just one of those things that we have to straighten out. It's the never-ending problem of --
<Don Imus> <Neutral> ...having to straighten things out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> One of the big things that I'm working on is sports betting in New Jersey and we have a man over there named Chuck Hytian who turns out to be a disaster for the people of New Jersey because this would mean tremendous taxes and tax revenues. I don't know what happened with the bookies or whoever. I don't know who spoke to Hytian. I have no idea, but he's single-handedly -- he's a Speaker and he's got some power over there, at least now, and he's single-handedly stopping sports betting, and everybody in New Jersey wants it and it's disgraceful and it's a great opportunity for Atlantic City. It's a great opportunity for New Jersey.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the senior citizens and New Jersey will get tremendous tax revenues from it. So for all of you folks that know Speaker Chuck Hytian, call him up and blast the hell out of him.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Well, our opposition on sports betting is as long as the players get to bet, they might as well let the fans, you know?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the players bet. That's absolutely true. And I'm sure it'll probably increase the ratings of your particular station quite a bit if they had sports betting in New Jersey.
<Don Imus> <Negative> It's not that I want to be like Mike. It's I want to bet like Mike.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, right. Maybe you don't want to bet like Mike.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Maybe I can win once in a while. What else is new with you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nothing. Things are going great. We're just in the process of doing some incredible things. Trump Plaza's doing something great and the hotels in Atlantic City have done record-setting business. The Taj Mahal, when they thought Trump was finished, "Trump is over. He's history
<Don Imus> <Positive> You sound like a Trump P.R. guy, but you netted 14 million dollars or something last month.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We made a gross operating profit of $14 million, which was twice what the projections were at their highest, and they won $41 million last month at the Taj Mahal. And the other casinos are doing proportionately -- they're much smaller, but proportionately equally as well.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> What's the status with your marriage? Are you still getting married?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I'm doing great. It's really fantastic.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Yeah, but are you getting married?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That might be the most difficult question you've asked me so far. See, the Indian problem is a much simpler problem. That can be solved.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Maybe you can have one of those traditional tribal ceremonies.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right. Maybe that would be the best way to do it. That way, it wouldn't be an authorized marriage. Therefore, I could claim marriage without any of the liabilities, right?
<Don Imus> <Negative> That's what I was going to say.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What are you talking about? I never got married.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> I gave her some beads and that was basically about it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can get sued for $9 billion, but what do you mean? The marriage is forget it. I have a great relationship.
<Don Imus> <Positive> It's a work in progress.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Huh?
<Don Imus> <Positive> It's a work in progress.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a work of art in progress.
<Don Imus> <Positive> That's right, a work of art in progress.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's exactly correct, how are you doing on your social front? Do you have a new beautiful girlfriend yet?
<Don Imus> <Positive> Well, you know, they come and they go.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> At least with you, I know it's definitely a girlfriend, okay?
<Don Imus> <Positive> At this point, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> With a lot of people, we don't know.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Donald, always nice to talk with you. Good luck and many moon come Choctaw.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Bye.
<Don Imus> <Negative> It's 8:36, 24 till 9:00, Imus in the Morning.
