<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Let's discuss these recent turns of event in the election with the man himself, the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump on the phone this morning. Mr. Trump, can you hear us?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> We need to talk policy. We need to talk the state of play within your own party, but you have commanded a different headline that needs to be addressed. You are attacking Hillary Clinton for the sexual past and indiscretions of her husband, calling her an enabler. We have a panel of independent voters. They are smart as heck and most of them don't like it.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> They see it as a distraction, they see it as hypocritical coming from you, and mostly they see it as potential proof you may have no real ideas to offer as president. What is your thinking on this line of attack?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, this is a nice way to start off the interview. First of all, you should congratulate me for having won the race. I thought at least there would be a small congratulations, but I'm not surprised with CNN because that's the way they treat Trump. It's the -- they call it the Clinton network and I believe that. So, you know...
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Wait, hold on. Mr. Trump, I did congratulate you the last time we spoke. I said congratulations on winning the big race. What are you going to do going forward?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. So warm and so well-felt.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> But you -- no, no, no, hold on, hold on. Let's get this off on the right foot. I'm trying to address what you...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're starting off with a question, we haven't spoken, last week, towards the end, I was the, essentially the nominee of the party, and you start off with this question which is not surprising, because I understand CNN perhaps a lot better than you do.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> OK, OK, you know what? You're right. Sometimes it's good to restart. Here's the restart. You are going to be your party's nominee by all accounts.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> You are going to carry the standard for this party. You have said that once you get into the general, people will see what you have to offer. The first thing that you've come out with hot and heavy out of the box are these attacks on Hillary Clinton.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That wasn't the first thing I came out with. The first thing I came out with, if you watched, was trade. We're making horrible trade deals, we're losing our jobs, we're losing our manufacturing, it's trade. The next thing I came out with is rebuilding our military, because our military is absolutely being decimated.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're not spending the proper money. We're not buying the proper equipment. We're not taking care of our soldiers. We're not taking care of our vets, by the way. But we're not taking care of our military at a time when we just about in the history of our country need it the most.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I talk about that. I talk about the border. I talk about the fact that we have to stop the drugs from pouring into our country. Those are the things I talk about in a very long speech in Washington, actually Nebraska, which was unbelievable -- every one of them had tens of thousands of people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, they were massively attended, which, of course you don't mention, nor does CNN ever show the crowds. It's very interesting, because CNN -- I could be making a speech for an hour, they'll never show the extent of the crowd.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Well I'll tell you, Mr. Trump, I would suggest that CNN shows your events more than they show any other candidate's.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... where we had a record crowd, where Hillary Clinton said she wants to put the coal miners out of business, the miners.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> We covered that extensively.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She said she wants the miners and the companies to go out of business.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> We covered it extensively. On the military, you raise an important issue. We tried to get your campaign and the other campaigns to hold forth on whether or not they supported the current G.I. bill.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> As you know, in the congress, they did this sneaky vote in the house where there was no roll call and they were going to cut money from the G.I. bill to allow for other expenditures for vets. The vets were very upset. They said, no, don't take money from us and reallocate it.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Find the savings elsewhere. Do you support maintaining the G.I. bill the way it is right now and even growing it as opposed to cutting it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to be hurting our vets. Our vets have been hurt enough. We treat illegal immigrants better than we treat our vets. So I'm going to do nothing to hurt our vets. I'm going to only help our vets.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> So is that a yes?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not Hillary Clinton that thinks that the vets are getting too much. And they're not getting too much. I've traveled, I've seen so many vets, I know so many vets now and I have a lot of friends. I've developed great friendships among the vets. Our vets are being treated very badly.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> So is that a yes, I do support the current G.I. bill?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I want to bring jobs back to our country, I want to make our country go again. I just traveled. I won so many states in a row in massive landslides and part of the reason was trade. It wasn't what you brought up at the beginning of the show which was totally inappropriate. Part of the reason I won was because of trade and I talk trade and I'm the only one that can do anything about trade.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm going to renegotiate these trade deals. These trade deals have sucked everything out of our country. And by the way, Clinton is the one that approved NAFTA. NAFTA is the worst deal, one of the worst deals our country's ever made from an economic standpoint.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> One of the worst deals ever. It's taken -- if you've seen what it's done to New York State and New England and virtually every state, but it's just -- it is just, it has sucked the jobs out of our country, it sucked the money out of our country. We're going to bring our jobs back. We're going to make it much harder for people to leave, for people to take their companies and just go to Mexico and then sell the product back into the United States with no tax or nothing.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> All right, so let's unpack a little of this stuff one at a time. And first of all, just to get back to tone, just for one second, a little bit of this is because you're on the phone. As you know, when you're in person with somebody, very often you can interpret questions...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You would have asked the same question in person.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> But I think maybe if you were face to face, it might be a little bit different. That's all.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> You think you would have asked a different question? I don't think so.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> No, I think that you're taking it the wrong way, because obviously I'm playing off what the headline is everywhere this morning. I'm not just making it up, and NAFTA, I understand you wanting to bring up trade. As you know, Clinton did not pass NAFTA. Bush passed NAFTA.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> So you can criticize it all you want.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh really? Who signed NAFTA?
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> You can criticize it all you want. I'm just saying you want to keep the history. Bush was involved with NAFTA.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me. Who signed NAFTA? Whose bill was it and who signed it?
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> But what is your point, though? This was in the Bush administration.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But this was one of the worst deals ever made in the history of our country...
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Bush 41.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... and it has just destroyed manufacturing, and destroyed jobs.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> All right, that's a valid point. You just have to spread the blame across both parties and you have to come up with a solution.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but the signer of NAFTA, take a look at who signed it. Check it out.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Bush 41.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. You take a look. You take a look. NAFTA was a Clinton deal and he wanted it so badly, and I have not been a big fan of what went on in terms, economic developmentally, or with the war with Bush either, frankly, if you want to know the truth.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, there's a whole -- that's a whole other story. But if you look at NAFTA and you take a look at what's been done and how hard Clinton pushed it and that bill has been an absolute disaster. The passage of that has been an absolute disaster for our country.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> All right. Fair point. You want to criticize NAFTA. Doing more about trade, helping veterans.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we're going to bring it back and we're going to bring the jobs back into our country and we're going to make it very hard for companies to leave and then sell product back into our country and rip us off, and all we end up getting is unemployment of great people.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> All real issues. As you know, the last time we spoke, when we did talk about your taking everybody out in the race and now being the man yourself, we talked about how you would bring about bringing back jobs. You said, I would tax companies who don't do the right thing. I would have a tariff imposed. I said, that's what congress does, not a president. You said, well I'll work with them.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> All real issues. And that's why I was so surprised to see you going after Clinton for her husband's infidelity and calling her an enabler.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's only retribution for what she said. She is playing the woman's card to the hilt. She is going -- I mean I watched over the weekend, everything is about woman and Donald Trump raised his voice. It's all nonsense. And you know what, women understand it better than anybody, and watch how well I do with women when it counts, when the election comes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Watch how well, because women want to see strong security, they want to see strong military, they want to see borders where people can't just come walking across the border like it's Swiss cheese, and you see the damage that's been done to our country with the weak borders. You see what's happening. You see the crime. You see the drugs flowing in and poisoning our youth and everybody else.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> But then why don't you talk about those issues and get women on your side as opposed to talking about infidelity and enabling?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do. You took one sentence out of a long one hour speech. You took one sentence...
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Mr. Trump, it's not one sentence. You were grandstanding on it, you were working the crowd about it...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Chris, I spoke very little about that compared to other things. You took a small amount of the speech and you build it up like it's the biggest thing in the world, but it is a big thing. Hey look, he was the worst abuser of women...
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> You just said I'm making too much of it, now you say it's a big thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me. As a politician in the history of our country. He was impeached! He was impeached! And then he lied about it. He said, nothing happened with Monica Lewinsky, and then he said, sorry folks, it actually did happen. And the guy was impeached for lying.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> All of that can be true. What does it have to do with Hillary?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She can't talk about me because nobody respects women more than Donald Trump, and I will be better for women by a big factor than Hillary Clinton, who frankly, I don't even think will be good to women. You know, she went and she spoke -- it was very interesting. She spoke a few weeks ago and she said, I'm going to put the miners and the companies out of business. Then she went to West Virginia and she tried to pretend she didn't make the statement, and that's the way it is with here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The lies and the deception, it's horrible. And by the way, they understand her in West Virginia, and I'll bet you that she loses West Virginia, which she was easily supposed to win, and I would bet that if you took a poll there now, myself compared to her, you'll see a big difference. But you watch the problems she'll have. But the deception and the lies, and she tried to pretend like she didn't mean it.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> All right, let's talk about something else. Sarah Palin came out and said, Paul Ryan is done. I'm calling on the supporters of Donald Trump to go after Paul Ryan and make sure that he gets Cantered, as in Eric Canter, that he loses his seat where he is. Do you want that? Do you want Sarah Palin going out there and trying to turn people against Paul Ryan? You're supposed to be unifying the party.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Sarah has endorsed me and I like her a lot. I think she's a terrific person.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> But do you want that? Do you want Paul Ryan kicked out?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me finish what I wanted to say, OK? But I have nothing to do with that. Sarah is very much a free agent. She's a terrific person but she's very much a free agent and I didn't know about this until yesterday. I guess she's been fighting, or she's endorsing somebody that's running against Paul Ryan and I didn't know about it until yesterday when I read about it.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> But this is a big deal. Paul Ryan, the speaker there, you have said to this point, to give you your due, hey, I want Ryan on my side. I want to work with him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll go a step further. I've always liked him. He called me not so long ago, I don't know, a number of weeks ago, but he called me and he was very supportive and very nice and I thought everything was fine, and then I got blindsided, so we'll see. I mean look, I'll see what happens. Look, Chris, I think you know this better than anybody -- the Republican Party, because of me, has received more votes than any time in its history during these primaries, right? Is that a correct statement?
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> You are on track to...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, is that a correct statement?
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> ... more votes than anybody in this primary.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, I'm not even talking about me. Because of me, there has been a massive turnout...
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> Any GOP primary ever, you've gotten the most votes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because of me, you got the highest rates in the history of CNN during a debate and Fox set the all time record for cable television, 24 million and 23 million, OK. Now, most importantly, from my standpoint, in the history of primaries, I -- with many states left. It'll be beaten this weekend. I think it might already be beat-- I've received more votes than any person ever to run in the Republican primary. So I have people that I'm representing. They're unbelievable people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're loyal, they're smart, they're sharp, they're tired of being abused, they're tired of being lied to by people like Hillary Clinton with the 3:00 in the morning and then she never answered the call, Benghazi, all of the things, all of the e-mails, it's just a mess with her, so they're tired of it. They're tired of not having increases in their wages for a period of 18 years. Essentially they're making less money now in real wages than they made 18 years ago and we have a group of people that's great. This group of people has given me, and it's them, it's a group.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm like a messenger, but they've given me a number that no other president, not Ronald Reagan, nobody, has ever gotten. And by the way, we have many states left. We have California, we have New Jersey, Washington State where I was this weekend, I was at Oregon, I was in Nebraska, I was in West Virginia -- they haven't even been included in these numbers yet, so we're going to break it by millions and millions of votes. So I represent a very important group of people and a powerful group of people. These people have to be treated with respect, Chris.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Understood. But Paul Ryan said, I'm not ready to endorse yet. You know you have the big meeting coming. This weekend, you gave him some cause for concern.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> It seemed as though you were saying this weekend two things that were different from what you said in the past. One on taxes for the wealthy where you said you were open to taxing them more. As you know, that's against the conservative...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't say that, Chris.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Well that's how it's being reported. Tell us.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> NBC misrepresented and Chuck Todd, if they put out that clip, in fact, I corrected him when he said it. Let's get it straight so maybe there's somebody listening to your show so we can actually have...
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> There are millions watching.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let me just set it straight. I put in the biggest tax decrease of anybody running for office by far, OK, and many people think it's great, and if anything, I was criticized because it's too steep a cut, but that's OK, but I put in by far the biggest tax decrease. All right. What I said -- and that really is a proposal because we have to go to congress, we have to go to the senate, we have to go to our congress men and women and we have to negotiate a deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it really is a proposal, but it's a very steep proposal. I said that I may have to increase the section -- and by the way, everybody across the board, businesses, everybody's getting a tax cut, especially the middle class. And I said that I may have to increase it on the wealthy. I'm not going to allow it to be increased on the middle class. Now, if I increase on the wealthy, that means they're still going to be paying less than they pay now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not talking about increasing from this point, I'm talking about increasing from my tax proposal.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> Key distinction.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Chuck Todd understood that totally, and yet they released information like I'm looking to increase the taxes. They will be getting a reduction, but the big reduction is going to be for business and for the middle class, because the middle class is being decimated in our country. So it was totally misrepresented just now by you and it was misrepresented frankly by NBC.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Mr....
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... and actually, Chuck Todd, when I corrected him on the show and he put it on, and yet they go then and talk about like I'm giving a tax increase for the wealthy, I'm not. I said, they may have to pay somewhat more than my proposal. But my proposal is much less than people are paying right now.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> I totally understand, but when something is reported a certain way and I ask you about it and give you the opportunity to correct it, that's not me misrepresenting, that's giving you the opportunity you want which is to tell the audience what the truth is.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well OK, and there was one other thing that was really misrepresented, I'll tell you this...
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> About the minimum wage?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... and that's the buyback of debt. I said, if we can buy back government debt at a discount, in other words, if interest rates go up and we can buy bonds back at a discount, if we are liquid enough as a country, we should do that. In other words, we can buy back debt at a discount. People said, I want to go and buy debt and default on debt and -- these people are crazy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is the United States Government. First of all, you never have to default because you print the money, I hate to tell you, OK, so there's never a default, but the point is, it was reported in the "New York Times" in correctly...
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> That you said you would go to creditors and make them take less.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was reported in the failing "New York Times" and other places that I want to default on debt -- I'm the king of debt. I understand debt better than probably anybody. I know how to deal with debt very well. I love debt. But debt is tricky and it's dangerous and you have to be careful and you have to know what you're doing, but let me just tell you, if there's a chance to buy back debt at a discount, U.S. debt, in other words, interest rates go up and the bonds go down, you can buy debt, that's what I'm talking about.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People had it, "The Times" and others wrote, oh, Trump wants to go and see creditors and buy debt at a discount. Now there could even be a time when somebody comes in but with the government, they're never going to walk in and say, do me a favor. Would you buy my debt at a discount? In business, that happens all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I bought mortgages back when the market went bad. I bought mortgages back at tremendous discounts, and I love doing that. There's nothing like it, actually. It gives me a great thrill. But in the United States with bonds, that won't happen because in theory, the market doesn't go down so that you default on debt and that's what happens.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So here's the story. Just to have it corrected -- if we have an opportunity where interest rates go up and you can buy debt back at a discount, I always like to be able to do that if you can do it, but that's all I was talking about. They have it like I'm going to go back to creditors and I'm going to...
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Yes. That's what they were reporting.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... restructure debt, it's ridiculous. They know it's ridiculous, but they printed that wrong purposely.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> All right. So let's just be clear. Your team is saying you've got to go, I know you have a lot of different interviews to do. It's good of you to accept these opportunities because it's important for the people to hear these distinctions in what's reported versus what you say is on the table from you, and that's the opportunity...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, there's so much misreporting. I mean, the press...
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Well look, and that's why we ask you to come on.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The press is unbelievably dishonest. There's so much -- and they know it's wrong. Like, you have a lightweight, a real dope...
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> Mr. Trump, they say you have to...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... named Jennifer Rubin who spoke about, I didn't speak to Rubio. Well I have spoken to Rubio. And then she said I never spoke to Ryan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I have spoken to Ryan, and she's living in a time warp or something, you watch her...
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Don't worry -- look, there are going to be a lot of talking heads say a lot of different things. What I offer you is this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Someday you'll put good people on about Trump, one of these days.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Look, what I want is to have you on. That's why I offer you these opportunities...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, well I'm on.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> ... not to be unfair, to be fair and to give you the chance to correct what you say others get wrong and to be tested. Thank you for being here today, your team is saying you've got to get going, but I appreciate the time on "New Day ." I want to talk to you, not about you. Thank you for being with us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good. Thank you.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Take care.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> Right now, Donald Trump on top for the Republicans. He joins us now by phone. Good morning, Mr. Trump. Good to have you again with us this morning. You know, you've never actually faced voters before. Are you nervous?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you have to be a little bit nervous. And you know, I like to win and I want to win for the country. I don't want to win for myself. And this is actually my first election night. I've gotten through many election nights, but it was always somebody else's George. This is a little bit different for me.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> I'm sure it is.  What worries you most? Well I just hope everybody is going to be able to get out and vote.  It looks like we're going to be skirting weather.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> So the weather is going to be OK.  It won't start snowing until after everything is finished, so we just made it.  That was no biggie.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> But it's just, you know, I just hope everybody gets out and votes.  We have the biggest crowds by far, of anybody, including Sanders and he is second.  I will say that.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> But we have the biggest crowds.  And we have, I think the most enthusiasm and you know, you have to see these rallies are like love fests.  And I really believe they're going to go out and vote.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> You know, the theme is, Make America Great Again.  And this is the chance and I'm self-funding my campaign.  I'm the only one that's doing that George.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> I'm you know, putting up my money.  Nobody else is doing that.  And I think that's a big difference and a lot of people like that.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> But there is a great enthusiasm in those rooms and all over the state and all over every state. If -- you know, when you look at New Hampshire, you saw the polls that just came down there with -- where's there a, I guess a 25 point lead. But in Iowa, I really think we're going to do really well. I hope we're going to do well. And we're going to find out soon enough. We just got the endorsement of Jerry Paul Wall Jr. which has been a great endorsement. You're staying power has surprised so many people. Sorry about that. Yes. You're staying power surprised so many people so far. But I was wondering what your response is to Chris Christie who was up in New Hampshire last night. And he said Donald will take himself down over time. I think we might have lost Mr. Trump here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Yes, I have you.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Did you get that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> Sorry.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I hear you fine.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> What was your response to Chris Christie.  He says he's going to take you.  He says you're going to take yourself down over time.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> Well, you know, people have said that I wasn't going to run.  Then they said, well, if I ran, he's just going to have fun and leave.  And now I'm in first place by a lot.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> And you know, Chris took himself down when he did the George Washington Bridge.  And he took himself down when he's rated number 50 out of 50 in New Jersey.  I mean, it's the 50th worst state, meaning it's last.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> And you know, he shouldn't be talking like that.  I'm surprised that he would talk like that because I know him and I guess he used to be a friend until this all happened.  But now I think it's been just the opposite and I would be very surprised if somebody like that would say it.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> I mean, he's got enough problems and he's doing very poorly in the polls.  So, I would be -- I am surprised that he would of said that.  My life has been a life of success.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> It's been a life of winning.  It's been a life of making great deals.  It's been a life of -- you know, I've achieved tremendous success in so many different ways and for somebody to say that that is, you know, obviously not doing very well right now is pretty unusual I think.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> And you'll be facing the voters for the first time tonight. We're going to be talking to your sons in the next half hour. Thanks for joining us this morning. We'll be talking to you later as well.[End Video]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, basically, this would be a one-time tax, 14.25 percent against people with a net worth of over 10 million--$10 million or more. It would pay off in its entirety the national debt of $5.7 trillion, and you'd save $200 billion a year. So taxes for the middle class would go way down, the estate and inheritance tax totally wiped out, and the Social Security system would be saved. Now, this would be very positive for everybody, including the rich, the 1 percent that really are paying the tax.
<Bill Redeker> <Negative> In fact, by our estimates, you would pay somewhere in the neighborhood of $700 million or more.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's correct.
<Bill Redeker> <Positive> I've never known Donald Trump to willingly give up $700 million.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it would be great for the country. I think it's a proposal that will be very strongly looked at and considered. And ultimately, I really expect to get it back.
<Bill Redeker> <Negative> People who have a net worth of $10 million or more, including yourself, generally don't have huge cash reserves. Where would they come up with this money?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a very fair question and very good question that's been thought of in great detail. Some people would be able to sell things off, easily pay the tax, and ultimately get it back many fold by the booming economy. And you will have a boom like you literally have never had before and by the saving of the inheritance tax.
<Bill Redeker> <Negative> But where do they get the money from is my point?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they sell off assets, you'd sell off assets. And the other...
<Bill Redeker> <Neutral> In your case it would be real estate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, in my case it could be some real estate, we wouldn't sell everything, you'd sell some assets. And the other is that we do it over an installment of 10 years.
<Bill Redeker> <Neutral> Do you expect this to be embraced on Capitol Hill?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I were president, it would be passed. I think if somebody else is president, it probably can't be. This is a tax paid by 1 percent, but the 1 percent will be very big beneficiaries with what's going to happen and the positive forces that would take place in the economy.
<Bill Redeker> <Negative> And just one last thought.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Of course.
<Bill Redeker> <Negative> What are economists saying about this idea? It's certainly a radical approach to try and solve a few problems and maybe not that realistic, but what are they saying?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know lots of very great and talented economists. The ones that I've spoken to and consulted with and I'll be announcing who they are at a later date, if I decide to run, have said that this plan is, quote, "brilliant." I don't want to take the whole credit, but they have said it. They they...
<Bill Redeker> <Negative> You wouldn't, would you?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How are you?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How are you?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Happy New Year!
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Happy New Year to you. Hi!
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And, by the way, congratulations on another season of The Apprentice.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it just went on on Thursday night and it was number one for the week.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> There you go.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> How do you deal with those mess you've got working with you?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What a crew you've got.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have some crew. This time I have some crew.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's Steven [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, Steven's a lot different than I thought. He's more solid than I thought. I thought he was a total flake and he's [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. No, he's not a bad guy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, he's good.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I like Steven. Hey, listen, we don't want to take up a lot of your time but we're doing the news here and I said "I'm going to call Mr. Trump."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> To find out the answer to this. It is reported that the president of France has left his wife.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He's divorced.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He's divorced and he's taken up with Carla Bruni.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Who's a beautiful woman. I have a picture of her in a bikini they picked today. I don't know if you saw on the paper.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes very flat-chested women. Not your kind of woman, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well, wait a second, Robin says that she broke up you and Marla Maples.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, that's not true.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> That's what it says here, this little account I'm reading.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, is that true? That is not true.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It's not true that Carla Bruni... Okay, why did... I question was...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Did you date her?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you date her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> May I say no comments?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me just say no comment. I'm trying to be a diplomat for this country.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But why would you say...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> As a great diplomat... Howard, as a great diplomat for this country, let me just say no comment.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, but I don't understand something. I Carla Bruni... I mean, from the picture I'm looking...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I know Carla.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She is a magnificent beauty. It looks like in the picture. Is she not that hot?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, let's say that there are better by large margins.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Because I said to Robin "Why would Donald Trump stop banging Carla Bruni? She looks magnificent in this picture."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you stop when you meet somebody better.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So, that's when you met your wife.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's a complicated thing but I know Carla and I just don't want to comment on it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Was she bad in bed?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't comment.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's going to marry the president of France.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So what?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> She must have gotten better. This guy has gone crazy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to have good relationships with France, right? I don't want to be criticizing the first lady of France.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But are you shocked that this guy has fallen... He's a [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm a little surprised but I'm happy for both of them.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What turned you off?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think he's somebody that's really terrific and he's pro of the United States. I don't want to make them anti of the United States.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, this will never get out any further than this show.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It won't get out any... than your five million viewers.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> No, it won't. Listen to me, I really want a true answer. What turns you off to Carla Bruni?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't comment on that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> This is crazy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know what? I'll tell you why I can't.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I think her ass smells.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know her well but I can't comment on that because I want to have good relationships with the wonderful country of friends.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What does that mean? You mean you want to have buildings built there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Maybe. Yeah, I'll build a building right smack in the middle of Paris.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You have to keep this quiet. We still have leverage.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I get zoning all over the world.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why would you be afraid to speak? I mean, really, this isn't going to affect your relationship. He's going to dump her.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You think he's going to do dump her?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> If you found something, I'm sure he's going to find the same thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He may find the same thing. I don't know what he's going to find but I hope they're happy together.
<Unidentified Male> <Positive> You know, Donald, you should tear down that Eiffel Tower and put up a casino.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, do you know originally they wanted to tear down the Eiffel Tower? Do you know the Eiffel Tower was built just during the world fair?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, it was a temporary structure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was a temporary structure.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Is that true?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People went crazy. They considered it to be the ugliest thing that was ever built. There were riots in the street and it was going to be ripped down and they had budgetary problems ripping it down. So, they said "Let's do it next year." Then they said "Let's do it next year." Then all of a sudden people started liking it and it stands today. And it was like in the 1800s.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're driving me crazy. I want to know what's wrong with Carla Bruni.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think that was a very interesting dialogue.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yeah but I want to know what's wrong. I hear you're trying to get Tavern on the Green.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, we'll see what happens.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It'd be nice if you good food in there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's run poorly.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Run poorly. The owner was a great friend of mine and he ran it. That was his baby. That was his child and he ran it great. And since then, and it happens often, with children, he's got children, they take over a business and that's the end of that.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> What are you trying to say, Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hopefully my children [Inaudible]. Typically, typically that happens. You've heard about that before.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, why can't Tavern on the Green have great food? I would go there all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It should have great food and it should have carpet that's not threadbare.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Did you walk [Inaudible].
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, it's a beautiful spot.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] thousand years. It started about the time of the Eiffel Tower.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What do you have to do to get to take control?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. I mean, I know how to... I have the Wollman Rink and I have a long-term lease on the Wollman Rink and we run that really well and it's a huge success. I mean Saturday you have lines going back through Central Park. It's incredible.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So, you have a couple of people competing with you to get the lease for Tavern on the Green?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In life, unfortunately, you always have competition.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So, how close are...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know. I mean, it will go out to bid and there'll be other people and we'll see but they like me because I do such a good job with the rink.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're not hopeful?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Huh?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Are you hopeful?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do you have any contacts in the city, Howard?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I do. I actually do. I had a rest stop named after me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Okay. So, you're refusing to comment. This is very strange.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I know Carla but I think it's inappropriate for me to comment about her.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'd love to know the back story.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Man, he's going to get a good deal.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Come on.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I like... I really...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So, what's it? Was it the personality?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I really do. I think he's a terrific guy. He's very, very pro the United States.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> No, I agree with you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's the first time that's ever happened with France.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I agree. I like this guy like what he's saying about the United States but aside from him, I'm just talking Carla Bruni stuff. I'm talking women now.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Why didn't she work out with you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just don't think it's appropriate.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It's probably just a her and a you thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd rather not... I mean, because I just don't think it's appropriate.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She probably laid there like a fish, right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I won't comment.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Or was it her personality?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's the whole thing. I mean, it's fine. I mean, I hope he's happy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did she smell?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Huh?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did she smell?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to comment on that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Ah, ah, that's a yes.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Come on, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You're talking about the potential first lady.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She's not marrying him. He's not going to rush.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, it sounds to me like he's smitten.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, he's going to date her and he's going to do what he'll do.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> If he doesn't marry her, he's never going to be able to run France.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It sounds to me like he's smitten. He's not a chest man. He is not into the world of chests.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She's flat as a board? What is she, an A-cup?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Maybe. What comes before A?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> A minus.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A minus.
<Male> <Negative> [Inaudible] like a dude.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Just to get off this subject, hey Robin, when are you getting married?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I'm not going to.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> We're looking at '08, of course, this year. We're looking at maybe the fall.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I hope I'm going to be invited to that wedding. That'll be a great wedding. Let me tell you...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You really want to go?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I would come if you invite.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I'm [Inaudible] impression. Not going to have a wedding.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Howard, is that a good sign... By the way, are you proud of me that The Apprentice became the number one show?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, I said on the air the other day. I said god bless you. I said I think it's great. I said if you could take that crew and make a number one out of it, it's amazing. I said then you're worth your weight in gold.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. So, you are getting married in '08.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> '08, probably in the fall.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Will you or will you not have a prenuptial agreement?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> We will. That's already been discussed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have to have that.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But you haven't started working on it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Do you think he'd be happier with a prenuptial agreement? You know, I watched him on Larry King before he got married.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Paul McCartney. Larry King asked him "So, Paul, will you have a prenuptial agreement?" He said "Absolutely not. Absolutely not."
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He's nuts.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That poor bastard [Inaudible]. She only wants 250 million [Inaudible] couple of years of marriage.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And you know what, he really blew it. I mean what a dumb move.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't get the whole deal. I didn't get it from day one but now I really don't get it. So, It's one of those things. I have to go back.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Go ahead. When you're ready to talk to me about Carla Bruni?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If I ever want to talk to anybody about Carla, I will talk to you, okay?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you very much.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Bye, Donald.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He bankrolled Bruni but what happened?
