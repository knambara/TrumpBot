<Joe Hart> <Positive> The crowd loved you out there. You have a great connection with your supporters here in Elko. Midterm elections coming up soon, obviously, in a couple of close races here in Nevada, Senate and governor especially. Hillary Clinton won this state in 2016. What kind of impact can you make, do you think, in these races?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I had a little thing going on called a strike. This was my state all the way, but we had a big strike, and, frankly, I think we are very close, and now we've really connected, I think, even more so with Nevada, and it just a special place. But, Dean Heller is very, very important to the state. We're working very closely with him on so many different things, and he's very, very important to win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And Adam Laxalt is going to be an outstanding governor. You need it. And, you know, working with the White House, it's certainly a lot easier. But these are great people. They've run really great campaigns, and this was fantastic today. I did another one a month ago in Las Vegas that was equally incredible, and, look, it's just a great state, and you have two people that are outstanding. One other person is Danny Tarkanian, who has been incredible.
<Joe Hart> <Negative> Let me ask you: how nervous are you about the midterm elections? Do you look at this as -- as a referendum on your presidency?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't really, but I am going around and helping people, because I have some states where I won by 42 points, and I'm helping people -- you know, when you're up by that kind of number, we go around and we help. I was in Montana. I was in Arizona. I was all over over the last month, and here, I have been a couple of times, and maybe a few times, I should say, and I'm here for Dean Heller, and I'm here for, you know, really the Republican ticket.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're outstanding. But Adam Laxalt, likewise, he's going to be so great as a governor, which you really need.
<Joe Hart> <Positive> With the country so divided after the Kavanaugh hearings, will you change your approach, or your style, in any way, moving forward?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think the Kavanaugh hearings have really galvanized the Republican Party. People saw how horribly this number one student at Yale, and when he sat there and said, what I really did is I work so hard of becoming number one in my class, and I could understand that so well, and people understood it. And the Democrats did too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then they made up all of this fantasy fiction, and they knew it was phony, and what they did was disgraceful. I think it was disgraceful, and I really think that's one of the reasons Republicans are doing so well. We're doing very, very well in the Senate, as you know possibly even better than me, because you're a real pro, but we are doing very well on the Senate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Far better than anybody would have thought. And I think the House is going to be close, but I think we're doing well in the house also.
<Joe Hart> <Negative> But how do you heal the divide moving forward?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we have to get past this election, for one thing, we have to, because we're not going to heal it before. But I think ultimately we can come together on immigration. When you look at that disaster going on, and I thank Mexico, because for the first time, they respect the president of our country, and they're in there doing a great job and holding it back, because we have the worst immigration laws ever of any country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I think we can really heal. But I think we have to wait till after the election.
<Joe Hart> <Neutral> Speaking of immigration, the world is watching that migrant caravan right now --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Horrible.
<Joe Hart> <Positive> -- moving into Mexico, possibly heading for the U.S. What are you prepared to do, what do you think is appropriate to do at this point?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, if necessary, I'm going to call up the military, we're going to stop them at the border, because we have the worst laws any nation has ever had, and were made by the Democrats, and we can't allow hundreds of thousands and millions of people to pour into our country. We have no idea who they are. There are plenty of criminals in that group, and you understand that, that's just common sense, but you understand that, and we're not going to allow them to come into our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, Mexico is stopping them far from our border, and I appreciate it. I asked them to do that, and they're doing it, and I very much appreciate Mexico's stance. They've never done a thing like this for our country. I think they respect leadership now. But, pretty much that's the story. We're going to -- we're not going to allow it to happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We can't allow it to happen. But, ultimately, we're going to come up with a great immigration plan, because we have to. And I think we can really heal the country. I think immigration is one of the three or four main parts that have to be healed.
<Joe Hart> <Neutral> On a lighter note, you say Nevada you don't say Nevada. Did you practice that a lot?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have a little bit, because one time, a number of years ago -- you know I have property in this state. I -- I proudly pay a lot of money to a lot of people that work at my property, and properties. No, I -- I know how to say it, it's Nevada. But it takes -- most people don't say that, but I do. I don't have the courage to say it the other way when I'm in this state, is that right?
<Joe Hart> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Did I say the right way?
<Joe Hart> <Positive> Absolutely, you did.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good.
<Joe Hart> <Positive> Okay, well, thanks for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Joe Hart> <Positive> I think we're out of time. I'd like to ask you about Yucca Mountain, if that's all right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure.
<Joe Hart> <Negative> Nevadans are against it, polls show. Nevada's congressional delegation is against it. Are you intent on moving forward? And how intent are you moving forward?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm -- I'm very inclined to be against it. I know Dean Heller is very much against it. He's been fighting it. And, I think he should do things where people want him to happen. So I would be very inclined to be against it, and we will be looking at it very seriously over the next few weeks. And I agree with the people of Nevada.
<Joe Hart> <Negative> Even though millions has been budgeted for Yucca Mountain?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's all right. I mean, hey, it's not going to be the first time in this country, that's for sure.
<Joe Hart> <Positive> Okay, good to hear. Appreciate that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Joe Hart> <Positive> Mr. President. Nice to meet you. Can we get a picture with you before we go?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, sure.
<Joe Hart> <Positive> That'd be great.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> And joining us now, Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, thanks so much for joining us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> So, Mr. Trump, you're being faulted for a tone allegedly encouraging violence by every candidate in the race, John Kasich, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders. Take a look at this new ad from an anti-Trump super PAC which is airing on national cable today.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> [Begin Video Clip] Donald Trump campaign violence.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would like to punch him in the face, knock the crap out of him. They'd be carried out on a stretcher, folks. I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. [End Video Clip]
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> Now, protests on the campaign trail are obviously nothing new. I have seen one in every previous election I have covered. But, in every one I have seen before, the leader on the stage tries to lower the temperature, not raise it. Do you ever consider whether you should be trying to lower the temperature when these protests erupt?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think, in many cases, I do lower the temperature. I tell the police, please take it easy when people are punching the police and trying to hurt people. When I say things like "I would like to punch him," frankly, this was a person that was absolutely violent and was like a crazed individual. A lot of them are -- you know, I don't even call them protesters.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I call them disrupters. A lot of them come from Bernie Sanders, whether he wants to say it or not. And if he says no, then he's lying. Bernie Sanders, they have Sanders signs all over the place. And they're made by the same people that make the regular Bernie Sanders signs. They're professionally made. And we have great rallies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have by far the biggest rallies. We have 25,000, 30,000 people at rallies. And out of that, you have had very little problem. And then what I did with Chicago -- and I could have gone. It would have been easier for me to go and make the speech, and you would have had a clash, because you had professional disrupters, thousands of them, from Sanders and to a smaller extent Hillary.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hillary doesn't have very much fervor. I will say that. And so people don't care that much. But you have Sanders disrupters going over there. You had Ayers there. You had a lot of people there that I don't think is so good to be there. And I'll tell you what. I think what I did -- and I have gotten a lot of credit for it, not from CNN.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I watched John King this morning. That was a total kill job, the entire show. I was amazed at that show. It was like a total kill. But I'll tell you what. I got a lot -- I have gotten a lot of credit from other networks, not from CNN. I have gotten a lot of credit for the fact that...
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> Well...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... I canceled and postponed the other day in Chicago...
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... because, frankly, if I went up, we would have had my -- my supporters have tremendous love of this country.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're tired of our country being ripped off by everybody. And I will tell you, you would have had a tremendous clash. And a lot of people would have gotten hurt or worse. And by canceling it, everybody dispersed beautifully. The police did a great job. The Secret Service was fantastic.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And there was no injuries, no nothing. So, I should get credit, not be scorned...
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> So...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... on your program by John King all morning long.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> OK. Well, that's not my program. But, in any case, this morning, sir, you tweeted: "Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disrupters aren't told to go to my events. Be careful, Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours." That sounds like a threat. It doesn't sound like lowering the temperature. It sounds like making things perhaps even worse.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's not a threat. It's not a threat. It's not a threat at all. Look, my people have said, we ought to go to his rallies, because, you know, it's sort of interesting. When liberals and super liberals -- and I don't even call them liberals, because I have many friends that are liberal, and I think they're wonderful people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These are beyond liberal. These people are bad people that are looking to do harm to our country. But when these people come into mine, you know, everybody thinks I'm a bad guy, when, if my people went into one of his rallies, they'd say, oh, this is a terrible thing. They would be arrested and all sorts of things would happen to them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If conservative Republicans ever went into his rally, you would see things happen that would be unbelievable. And Bernie would be, oh, poor, Bernie, isn't that a shame? There is a horrible thing -- there is a horrible thing going on in the media. We are treated so unfairly, and I'm treated very unfairly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, you know, this morning, you had your political consultant say I had 5,000 people in Dayton, Ohio. Well, I had far more than 5,000 people. We had a hangar that was filled with people.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> Mister...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It had to be 10,000 or 15,000 people.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> I think people -- I guess, Mr. Trump, the point is that people are getting hurt, and people are actually concerned that somebody might get seriously, seriously injured before this is all over, and that you are not taking down the temperature. You are, in the views of many of your fellow Republicans, making things worse, inciting, encouraging violence.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> And you're a leader, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> My fellow Republicans...
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> You're the front-runner of the Republican Party.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me. Excuse me. My fellow Republicans are running against me. They are losing big league. In Florida, we have a man, Marco Rubio, who doesn't even show up to vote in the U.S. Senate. He's a disgrace. He's weak, very weak on illegal immigration, wants to give amnesty to everybody. He's a person that I don't think he could be elected dogcatcher in Florida, frankly, but I'm running against... [Crosstalk]
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> All right, but, with all due respect, sir...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In -- if you look at -- excuse me. Excuse me. If you look at Ohio, we have a man that voted for NAFTA. NAFTA has destroyed Ohio, and now he's voting for TPP, I mean, in Kasich. And give me a break. They're running against me. So, obviously, if I were in their position, I would be saying the same thing. We have rallies of 25,000, 30,000 people, and you haven't even said anything about danger in our rallies until Friday.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the danger was ended by a very good managerial decision not to have that particular rally, to postpone it.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> I -- well, I said something about it at the debate on Thursday night, because people are worried about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How many people -- and, Jake, you made a statement. Jake, could I ask you a question? You made a statement that, at my rallies, people are -- it's dangerous. Now, other than for the other day with Chicago and the one man that rushed the stage and Secret Service did a very good job, but, other than that, with thousands of people, 21,000, 25,000, 35,000 people a few weeks ago in Alabama, how many people have been injured at my rallies?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Zero. Zero. There's been nobody injured.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> I -- I don't think that it's zero. It's -- it's...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you make it like everybody is being broken down and injured, because CNN reports very, very unfairly about me, I'll tell you what. So, out of all of these rallies, with thousands and thousands of people, and nobody is even close -- by the way, Bernie gets peanuts compared to what we get. And I say we because it's me and -- I'm just a messenger, because there is a lot of anger in this country, and it's anger at incompetence.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's anger at the border. It's anger at trade deals that are so bad for us and all our jobs are being taken out of the country. There is a lot of anger. I didn't need to do this. I have a wonderful life. I have a great, great company. I didn't need to do this. I wanted to do it, because somebody has to do it.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> I would just ask...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Our country is in trouble.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> I hear you, sir. I hear you, sir, about the causes of the anger. I would just, ask as a fellow American, if you could consider whether or not dialing down the temperature, trying to bring down the temperature, might be a healthier thing, both for your campaign and for the nation at large. But that's all the time we have.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> Thank you so much for joining us, Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, if you would report it right -- well, you should report it right, because we have had no injuries at my -- at my events with thousands of people. You just don't report it that way. So, you know, do what you have to do.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> Thank you, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
