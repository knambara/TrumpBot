<Rich Zeoli> <Positive> All right, we're here in the Oval Office with the President of the United States, President Donald Trump. Good morning sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning.
<Rich Zeoli> <Positive> Pennsylvania, obviously incredibly important for you. You won Pennsylvania. They said you couldn't do it, and you did, and you're gonna win again, I believe. The USMCA, the trade deal, very, very critical to Pennsylvania jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it is, but I mean, beyond even USMCA, Pennsylvania is now having the best year they've ever had because of our policies. We have more jobs. We're helping the steel. We're helping the refineries. We're helping agriculture. Pennsylvania's had the best year they've ever had, over the last couple of years, since I'm president, and I love the state.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I went to school in the state, as you know. I went to college there. I went to the Wharton School, finance, and it's an -- it's a great place, and I hear we're doing even better than we did on the day of the election so I'm happy about that.
<Rich Zeoli> <Positive> When you think about -- there was a war on coal before you became president. A war on fossil fuels. All the Democrat candidates have said they want to end fracking, which is hugely important to Pennsylvania.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Chuckles] There was a war and everything. They had a war -- they have a war on everything. They have a war on themselves, OK. These people that -- you know, I think they're stone cold crazy, if you want to know the truth. [Laughter] But, there's a war on everything. They're using impeachment for reasons that it was never intended.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a -- I just watched a little bit of the hearing. It's a joke what's going on. Everyone is just -- they can't even believe it. They've politicized this to a level that it was never meant to be by the founders, and that'll be over soon, just like everything else. Don't forget -- and you were with me from the beginning, and I won't forget it. But the fact is, you remember, this started long before the election.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, they've been after me from before the election, and Schiff gets up yesterday and he starts making a speech, and, I guess, in California over the weekend, screaming about how he's going to take the president out, and now he's in charge of a committee where the Republicans have absolutely no rights, no due process, no witnesses, no lawyer, no nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is a horrible thing happening. But here's the bottom line: we'll win, and Pennsylvania is going to win. We have things, and, you know, happening in Pennsylvania, as you know with -- with various plants opening up: auto plants, steel plants. Nobody's ever seen anything like it.
<Rich Zeoli> <Negative> And, you know, Mr. President, I talk to people all the time who say this impeachment thing is blowing up in their faces, because they turn around and go, why are you getting nothing done for us? USMCA is a great example, right? They -- they should have moved on it by now, but they won't move on it, because all they care about is going after you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nancy Pelosi is incompetent. She has no idea what's going on. We're going to end up losing Mexico and Canada. They've been waiting for months. They call me they say, Sir, when is this going to happen. It's up to one person: Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House. She doesn't want to put it up. She admits it's an incredible bill, replacing, by the way, the worst trade bill ever, which is NAFTA, where we lost thousands and thousands of companies and jobs, millions and millions of jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> NAFTA was the worst. This is gonna be the -- one of the best trade deals -- maybe the best trade deal ever made. We're gonna lose it pretty soon, because Mexico and Canada, they're waiting for many months, and she's playing, probably, politics, but she's basically incompetent. She hasn't done anything. She's Speaker of the House.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She hasn't done a thing, other than this phony impeachment, and I think it's going to blow up in her face. But, this deal is ready to go. I mean, I'm concerned that if she holds it much longer, they're going to just say thank you very much, and they're going to just say, let's go back and let's just do our thing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That can happen.
<Rich Zeoli> <Negative> Well, that's going to backfire on them, Mr. President. The workers want to see results. I call her Batty Pelosi. I mean, you're the master of nicknames, but that's what I call her. I just think that she's losing it, and, who would you love to run against the most? What -- who's your dream crazy candidate to run against the most?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's hard to believe, out of 325 million people, that's the best they can do. I watched some of them this weekend, with the pandering, with the begging. I've never seen anything like it. So, you know you never know. I never want to talk too much, because you still have an election to run, and crazy things can happen in elections.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look how dirty they were with the filthy, dirty dossier that they produced on me. With all of the things that they've done, they're doing -- they do books on me, and they have nobody signing the books. That's all the same group that we have right now. I don't even call it deep state. I call it bad people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I see it, you know, people testifying. I see people going over and testifying, and these are just a lot of bad people. But we have a lot of good people too. Fortunately, they more than surmount the bad -- the bad ones. But USMCA is something that should be approved immediately. If it's not approved immediately, Mexico, Canada they're going to say goodbye, sayonara.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We appreciate it. And it's such an incredible deal for us. And, you know, look, they picketed. When the deal was made, they picketed in those countries, because they weren't so happy with the deal. Nancy Pelosi is going to blow one of the greatest deals ever made.
<Rich Zeoli> <Negative> Mr. President, I'm grateful you said I was with you from the beginning. It was my honor to be with you from the beginning. There are a lot of Never Trumpers, though, and I see -- I think that they're angry that you want to bring the troops home. They're angry at you that you don't want to start any new wars.
<Rich Zeoli> <Positive> I mean, that's -- that's what who is turning on you, as I see it sir.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they're even angry when I got al-Baghdadi. I mean, they were -- they couldn't believe it. I got al-Baghdadi, who's the number one terrorist in the world. I mean, the founder of ISIS. He's trying to rebuild ISIS, because I was the one that knocked out 100 percent of the caliphate. When I took over three years ago, the caliphate was all over the place, and I knocked it out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Then I knock him out, and I -- literally they made him into a religious leader. The front page of The Washington Post, they made him into a great, wonderful, religious leader, as opposed to what he is, which is a horrible terrorist, the number one -- but you look at that -- and even the deep-staters. You know the deep-staters, in a certain way, the Never Trumpers, I find, are almost worse than the Obama and Clinton people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Never Trumpers are -- there's something about them. They're -- they're out of business. There aren't too many of them left. They're on the respirator, as I say. But the Never Trumpers are -- these are people that if you took, with all the judges that -- you know, I'll be up to 182 judges very soon. That's a -- federal judges, Court of Appeals, District Court and two Supreme Court judges, and we rebuilt our military.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We got rid of the individual mandate in Obamacare. We're going for things that nobody's ever done before. We're protecting our Second Amendment. You do all of these things, and you say a, John Smith is the President, all of these Never Trumpers would say he's the greatest President that ever lived. But with my name on it, I still have to fight, but that's OK, because you've been with me from the beginning, and I will never forget it.
<Rich Zeoli> <Positive> Mr. President, it's my honor sir. Thank you so much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Rich Zeoli> <Positive> God bless you, bud.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Renee Passal> <Positive> Well, thank you again for taking the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Renee Passal> <Neutral> So, I'm from the Iron Range --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Renee Passal> <Positive> Mr. President, where mining is a way of life, and your policies have supported the industry. What would you like to say to the men and women who work in the mines, and want to work in the future mines?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I want to say congratulations, because when I started, it was closed. President Obama closed the Iron Range, he closed that whole area. You couldn't do anything. They have the finest iron ore in the world. They say -- I don't know what that means exactly, but I've heard that for a long time -- makes the finest of everything, and I opened it. Took a lot of heat and from various people, including environmentalists, and I was very proud to take it, and I'll never forget, a man came up to me and said, "Sir, you saved our way of life." And it just -- I still remember it like -- like today, said, "You saved our way of life, by opening up the Iron Range." So, now they're doing fantastically, and I'm very proud of it.
<Renee Passal> <Positive> Very powerful. Thank you. Your administration has been working hard on innovative strategies and health care. How do you think this will help Minnesotans?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it's really good. Obamacare has been a disaster. We got rid of the individual mandate, as you know, which was the worst part of Obamacare, and what we're doing is, we're coming up with really good policies and really good -- one -- one thing also, we're saving 180 million people from getting terminated from their private health care, which they want so badly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, they -- they love it. And under our opponents plan, all of that goes away, and they have the privilege of not choosing a doctor, just as they did, and just as President Obama said wouldn't happen, and it did happen. You don't get your doctor. You don't get your plan. You don't get anything. So, we're doing really well in the health care front -- front, but getting rid of the individual mandate -- and preexisting conditions we take care of. So very important to remember that the Republicans are taking care of preexisting conditions.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we have tremendous plans, and we saved that 180 million people, so they can keep their own plan, which almost all of them love.
<Renee Passal> <Negative> Now that you're here in Minnesota, would you like to address the criticism from Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it's very foolish that you have a President of the United States coming. I think you should cherish it, not because of me, but I think it's such an important position, especially helping -- now I'm going to help the people of Minnesota, and this great city anyway, frankly. But, you know, when you have the opportunity to have a President -- look at the kind of crowd we had.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Seventy-eight thousand requests for tickets, and I guess the arena will hold, probably, 20,000, and it's packed. So, I just think that, you know, I wish him a lot of luck. But I think you have to treat Presidents differently than that. It's good for your city.
<Renee Passal> <Neutral> Any other messages for Duluth and northern Minnesota tonight?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We love you. We're going to win Minnesota. Almost won it last time, first time in decades that a Republican almost won -- almost won it. But we came very close. But we have Pete Stauber, and we have Tom, and we have so many others that have won. I think we're gonna have tremendous success here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They see what's happening. They see Omar and what a disaster she has been. And I really think that we're going to have tremendous success right here in Minnesota -- I mean it's just -- and remember please the Iron Range, because it's one of the things that I'm most proud about -- getting it open. That was not easy, but we got it open and it's flourishing.
<Renee Passal> <Positive> Thank you so much. Mr. President
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Renee Passal> <Positive> Enjoy Minnesota.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. I will.
<Renee Passal> <Positive> A pleasure.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Mr. President, welcome back to Meet the Press.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Let me start right in, what happened last night?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, you had a situation that was very bad because the night before, they shot down an unmanned drone. And the unmanned is a very big factor. The fact that there was not a person on it, a U.S. person on it, or anybody. And that had an impact on me. I said, "Well, you know, we got a little problem." And I think they did that on purpose because they understand that they will be hit very hard if that were a plane with a person in it. And I think they knew that there was nobody there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So we had a very, you know, modest but pretty, pretty heavy attack schedule.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> And this is a pre-plan that you had, something that if they did something, you had something --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, we had it --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- these were sort of ready-made plans --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sure, we have many of them --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- to use if necessary, right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, I have so many targets you wouldn't believe.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have targets all over.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> So did you green light something? Or had you said --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Nothing's --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> If we do it, I'll do this. What was, what was the order you gave?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Nothing is green lighted until the very end because --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Ok.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- things change, right?
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> So you never gave a final order?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, no, no, no. But we had something ready to go, subject to my approval. And they came in. And they came in about a half an hour before, they said, "So we're about ready to go." I said, "I want a better definition --"
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Planes in the air? Were planes in the air?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, no. "We're about ready to go." No, but they would have been pretty soon. And things would have happened to a point where you wouldn't turn back or couldn't turn back. So they came and they said, "Sir, we're ready to go. We'd like a decision." I said, "I want to know something before you go. How many people will be killed, in this case Iranians?" I said, "How many people are going to be killed?" "Sir, I'd like get back to you on that," great people these generals.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They said, came back, said, "Sir, approximately 150." And I thought about it for a second and I said, "You know what? They shot down an unmanned drone, plane, whatever you want to call it. And here we are sitting with 150 dead people that would have taken place probably within a half an hour after I said go ahead." And I didn't like it. I didn't think it was, I didn't think it was proportionate.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now that doesn't mean --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> So what should the response be right now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think the response should be -- Well, first of all, as you know, we've done very massive sanctions. We're increasing the sanctions now. But the response is always going to be very strong. I built up a lot of capital. I've had a lot of people that aren't Trump fans saying, "I can't believe." You know, a lot of them said, "We're going to be in World War III the first week." Didn't work out that way.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're doing great in North Korea. We're doing great in a lot of different places. We knocked out the caliphate in Syria. We knocked out 100%. Remember I was going to leave it?
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> It's not 100%. Not everybody says it's 100%, even --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, no, no, the caliphate.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Ok.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, the caliphate, which is the land.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> The land.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The area --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Fair enough.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- is 100%. You never knock these people out.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> No, you won't.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> These people are stone cold crazy. And they walk into a store and they'll be wired up for bombs and they'll blow -- it's a horrible thing. So I never say that. I don't want to do what other presidents have done or other people have done saying, "We won," because you don't win so conclusively. I would love to have the day where we can win.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, I remember when I was young I'd go on airplane and I'd walk up, I'd buy a ticket, I'd go on a plane. Nobody thought about bombs and nobody thought about security. You'd walk in, you'd give the ticket to the person at the gate and you'd walk into a plane. Today it's like, a big deal. So what happened is I said, "I'm not going to do it. I'll save it. If they do something else, it'll be double."
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You think they were trying to provoke you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, I don't think so. And I think it was very important that they, to them, don't forget, their economy --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> They don't -- they, they --you don't think they intended to get you to respond militarily?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, their economy is shattered. Shattered.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> So what's the message you think they're sending?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Their inflation is through the roof. They've never had, the highest in the world right now. Worse than any place. They're, they're living not well.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> So put yourself in their shoes, what do you think the message they're trying to send you with this, with this drone?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think they want to negotiate. And I think they want to make a deal. And my deal is nuclear. Look, they're not going to have a nuclear weapon. This isn't about the straits. Do you know that China gets 91% of its oil from the straits? We don't even need the straits. We have, we are now, because of -- since I came in, we're the number one energy producer in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay? Actually by far. And if I get the pipelines approved through the environmental process, which I will in Texas, we'll go up by another 25%. But we're way ahead of Russia, we're way ahead of Saudi Arabia. And I think that they want to negotiate. I don't think they like the position they're in. Their economy is, is absolutely broken.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> So you sent a letter to the Ayatollah via Prime Minister Abe. And the Ayatollah seemed to say, "I'm not talking to you."
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I didn't send a letter, no.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> What was the --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I didn't, I didn't send a letter. No, no --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Was it a verbal message? What did Prime Minister Abe carry on your behalf?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Prime Minister Abe's a great guy. He's a friend of mine. And he obviously is close to them. I think he was their, their largest buyer of oil from before.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> But did he, did he deliver a message from you to them?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No. He wanted to do something.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Ok.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> According to Prime Minister Abe, they went to him, it's according to the prime minister, and they said, "What do we do with Trump? Can we make a deal? Is there something that can be done?" That's what Prime Minster Abe told me. I said, "Do you mind if I say that if I have to?" And he said, "Not particularly." So they came to Prime Minister Abe. He then called me. I said, "Send the following message: you can't have nuclear weapons.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And other than that, we can sit down and make a deal. But you cannot have nuclear --"
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> No other --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- weapons.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- conditions other than that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You cannot have nuclear weapons. And they would have had them with President Obama. He gave them $150 billion --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> What is your deal?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Remember this.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> I understand. But what is your deal --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But, Chuck, you have to remember this.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- going to look like with them?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let me explain something. Number one, you have to look at the sites. Some of the most important sites we weren't even allowed to look at or inspect, okay? Number two, the term was not long enough.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Ok.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There's like a short number of years left. After a very small number of years, he's talking about a country, after a very small number of years, they have a free pass to nuclear weapons. You can't do that. So I want to be able to inspect all sites. They cannot have ballistic missiles, which under the agreement, isn't even covered.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And as you know, that agreement wasn't even approved by Congress. A lot of people don't know that. That was an agreement that he couldn't get through Congress. He was not authorized, really, to do that deal.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Congress did give him some authorization to do that. It gave him the power to cut the deal.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It wasn't ratified by Congress.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> It wasn't a, it wasn't a treaty.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was very, very short of what it should have been. You know that.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Don't you think though -- does it at all tell -- what does it tell you that the Iranians haven't violated the agreement yet? That they are trying hard not to violate this agreement?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, you see, I think they have violated the agreement because I think in the areas that we're not allowed to inspect they're doing things. And I think they have been for years.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Europeans don't think they're violating the agreement.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I don't care about the Europeans. The Europeans are going out and making a lot of money. The Europeans are fine. But they're going out and making a lot of money. They're selling, in France, they're selling cars to Iran. They're doing other things. And let me tell you, we're very good to Europe. We take care of them.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> NATO, we spend a tremendous amount, a disproportionate amount. On trade, the European Union's taken, really, they have really taken advantage of us for a long time. Just to finish, we have great relationships with Europe. I don't mind Europe getting in the middle. Europe wants to make a deal too. Europe would love to see a deal be made.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Are these going to be separate deals?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By the way, Europe --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Do you want to do a separate deal with Iran? Or do you want to get everybody involved in the same deal? Get the Russians, get the Chinese?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't care which, what kind of a deal. It can be separate or it could be total.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> But it's one-on-one talks, you and the Ayatollah?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> All it is -- all it is --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Is it one-on-one talks, you and the Ayatollah, or you and the President?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It doesn't matter to me. Here's what I want, anything that gets you to the result. They cannot have a nuclear weapon. It's not about the straits. You know, a lot of people covered it incorrectly. They're never mentioned. They cannot have a nuclear weapon. They'd use it. And they're not going to have a nuclear weapon.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Did you send a message --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And it's not about the oil.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- last night? You know, Reuters is reporting that you sent a message to the Iranians saying, "I don't want war. I want to talk."
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Wrong. It's wrong. I did not send that message. I did not send that message. I don't know who --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Ok.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know who would have said that.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Send a message right now to the Ayatollah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean it's fake news.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Then send a message right now to the Ayatollah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Wouldn't be much different than that message.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Which is?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm not looking for war and if there is, it'll be obliteration like you've never seen before. But I'm not looking to do that. But you can't have a nuclear weapon. You want to talk? Good. Otherwise you can have a bad economy for the next --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> No pre-conditions?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- three years. Not as far as I'm concerned. No pre-conditions.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> And you'll talk anywhere?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Here it is. Look, you can't have nuclear weapons. And if you want to talk about it, good. Otherwise you can live in a shattered economy for a long time to come.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> If you, are you, do you feel like you were being pushed into military action against Iran by any of your advisors?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have two groups of people. I have doves and I have hawks.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Yeah, you have some serious hawks.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have some hawks. Yeah, John Bolton is absolutely a hawk. If it was up to him he'd take on the whole world at one time, okay? But that doesn't matter because I want both sides. You know, some people said, "Why did you put --" You know, I was against going into Iraq for years and years. And before it ever happened I was against going into Iraq.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And some people said, "Oh I don't know." I was totally against and I was a private citizen. It never made sense to me. I was against going into the Middle East. Chuck, we've spent $7 trillion in the Middle East right now.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Why is this our problem? This is a proxy war. Iran and Saudi Arabia are in a fight to the death out there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah. You're right. You're right. And that's another thing I've done --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Candidate Trump, candidate Trump for years would have said, "Not our fight." Why are you involved?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because of nuclear weapons. It has nothing to do with oil.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> So the minute you get them to do nuclear weapons, you want out of the Middle East?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's all I care. I don't care about -- Well, we're going to protect Israel. But I have nothing to do, absolutely nothing -- and we're going to protect Saudi Arabia. Look, Saudi Arabia is buying $400 billion worth of things for us. That's a very good thing.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You used to say we don't get anything in return --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We are now.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- for protecting Saudi Arabia.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know that this --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You feel like they're now paying for --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- this morning --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- the American protection?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- I spoke to the Crown Prince, this morning. And we had a great conversation. I said, "This is a very expensive operation. You and the other nations that we're protecting have to pay."
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Did you talk --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And he said, "Yes."
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Did you talk to him about the U.N. report about Jamal Khashoggi?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I did not because it really didn't come up in that discussion. I called about one reason.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> I understand.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I called about one -- I didn't call about that. I called about one reason. There's a very expensive operation. Unlike President Obama and unlike everybody else, I'll say others too, not just President Obama. You've got to pay for it. We cannot, we, we just don't want to go in and, and protect the Middle East and protect Saudi Arabia and everyone else and not get reimbursed.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> So this is why you're overruling Congress and, and letting all these weapon sales happen in Saudi Arabia?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Economic development and that. But economic development.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Never mind the humanitarian disaster --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A million jobs.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- that's taking place in Yemen?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A million jobs -- No it's going to end. It's going to end. By the way, who's causing it though? If you look at it, Iran goes into Yemen. They start firing rockets at Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia has to protect themselves, Chuck. But it's, it's a million jobs and probably more. They buy massive amounts, $150 billion worth of military equipment that, by the way, we use.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We use that military equipment. And unlike other countries that don't have money and we have to subsidize everything. So Saudi Arabia is a big buyer of America product. That means something to me. It's a big producer of jobs.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> It makes you overlook some of their bad behavior?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> I mean --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't like anybody's bad behavior.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Are you going to -- The United Nations said they'd like the United States to order the FBI to investigate Jamal Khashoggi's death and possibly MBS' --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think it's, I think it's --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- involvement in it. Will you allow the FBI to do that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think it's been heavily investigated.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> By who?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By everybody. I mean --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> By the FBI?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've seen so many different reports.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> What about the FBI?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Here's where I am, you ready?
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Uh-huh.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Iran's killed many, many people a day. Other countries in the Middle East, this is a hostile place. This is a vicious, hostile place. If you're going to look at Saudi Arabia, look at Iran, look at other countries, I won't mention names, and take a look at what's happening. And then you go outside of the Middle East, and you take a look at what's happening with countries.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay? And I only say they spend $400 to $450 billion over a period of time --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> So --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- all money, all jobs, buying equipment --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> That's the price. As long as they keep buying --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, no.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- you'll overlook some of this behavior.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I'm not like a fool that says, "We don't want to do business with them." And by the way, if they don't do business with us, you know what they do? They'll do business with the Russians or with the Chinese. They will buy -- We make the best equipment in the world, but they will buy great equipment from Russia and from China.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Chuck --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Yeah. Alright.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Take their money. Take their money, Chuck.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> What would a candidate Trump have said about a president who, on his watch, had Iran shooting down a drone, a Venezuelan dictator thumbing his nose at you, Obamacare still on the books and no results yet on the border? The border getting tough --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, let's, let's take a look. Let's take a look --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> I just say -- what would candidate Trump have said about that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay, let's take a look. The border's doing great. Mexico's been fantastic. They've been trying to get a deal with Mexico for 45 years, right? So for 45 years, they couldn't get a deal. I got one in one day. I said, "We're going to put tariffs on and we're going to either have a deal or not. We agreed in one day." Mexico just moved 6,000 people to their southern border.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> 6,000 troops to their southern border. The border's working out well. And the wall is being built. I mean, a lot of people don't like to talk about it. We're building the wall. We will have 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year and that's hard because the Democrats don't want to approve it. We just beat them in a big lawsuit, as you know, in Washington, in D.C. We just beat them in a very big lawsuit.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> But does it frustrate you that your border numbers are worse than Obama's?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, because the people are coming up because our economy is so good. They're pouring up because the economy is so good. Obama had a lousy economy. It was a dead economy.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Can I ask you about that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Our, our economy is good.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Let me show you this chart. Do you see that chart?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> It's the unemployment rate from the peak of the recession.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Your economy is great. I'm not saying it's not great. But this recovery started and in the 28 months that you've been president and the last 28 months of Obama's presidency, he averaged more new jobs than your first 28 --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's because he started off with a, with such a bad base. I mean, he hit --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Ok. But it is -- is it not a continuation?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, but Chuck, you have to understand, nobody was working. The whole place was a disaster. And I don't-- I'd never take that away.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Ok.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But it's very easy --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Alright.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- because when that turned around they pumped a tremendous amount of money into the economy. He also had a Federal Reserve person who kept the interest rates low. I don't. I don't have that privilege.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Sounds like you do now. Do you feel like you have --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, no, no.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- do you feel you have sent --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He raised them far too fast.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- the threat --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He raised them far too fast.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- your threat to demote him, do you think that's had an impact?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I didn't ever threaten to demote him.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> There's been some talk that you might demote him to the number two slot.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I, I, I'd be able to do that if I wanted but I haven't suggested that. I mean --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> That's not a threat --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, it's not --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- that's just a reminder that you can?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, no, I have the right to do that. But I haven't said that. What he's done is $50 billion a month in quantitative tightening. That's ridiculous. What he's done is he raised interest rates too fast.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Do you worry it's going to hurt --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've been proven right.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- your reelection?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think the economy's so strong we're going to bull through it. But I'm not happy with his actions. No, I don't think he's done a good job. I think this, if he didn't raise rates Obama had very low rates. So Obama was playing with funny money. I wasn't. I'm playing with the real stuff.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Let me ask you this.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Wait, wait. Obama had somebody that kept the rates very low. I had somebody that raised the rates very rapidly. Too much. He made a mistake. That's been proven. And yet my economy is phenomenal. We have now the best economy, maybe in the history of our country. One -- just to finish off, when I took over, this country, the economy was ready to collapse.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You take a look at the numbers. It was ready to collapse. And if I didn't win --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> I just showed you the numbers. It was not ready to collapse.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No no, no, that's -- You showed me unemployment numbers.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> That was unemployment. It was not ready --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Excuse me.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- to collapse.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Excuse me. Take a look at your GDP, take a look at your jobs, take a look at your optimism.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Ok.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Take a look at all of the charts. When I took over from election day on, I mean, you show me one chart which, where I did --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> It was the unemployment rate.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- well in that too, but I'm not --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Ok.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- talking about that. Take a look at some of the optimism charts and everything else. It went from 57 to 92. Nobody's ever seen anything that --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You're right. You're right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- right after I won.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> The optimism, you're right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, optimism is a big part of success in business. Okay.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You were always hard on Obama. You thought he wasn't enough of a cheerleader.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He was not a cheerleader.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> If you could have one do over as president, what would it be?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it would be personnel.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Who is it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would say if I had one do over, it would be, I would not have appointed Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. That would be my one --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> That's your, in your mind, that's your worst mistake?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, that was the biggest mistake.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Is Bill Barr your Roy Cohn?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He should've never -- I think he's a very talented, very--
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> But do you know what I mean by that? You've always said --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, no, look --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Where's my Roy Cohn? Is he your Roy Cohn?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You have to understand, Roy Cohn, but I had many, many lawyers. I mean, a lot of lawyers. Roy was one of them. He was a tough guy. Bill Barr is a -- First of all, Bill Barr --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Is he cut from the same cloth, do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Bill Barr is a very, he's equally tough. He's a fine man. He's a fine man. The job he's done is incredible. He's brought sanity back. I think he's real -- I don't think, I know, he's respected. You know, he loves the Department of Justice. He saw what was happening. He has done a spectacular job. Now he's in the process of doing something and I stay away from it. I really, I stay away from it. But I think he feels that what's happened in this country was a very bad thing and very bad for our country.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> I want to ask what's going down with the, these, the children in these migrant camps. The stories are horrible, Mr. President. You have children without their parents. You have kids taking care of kids.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You've, you've read these reports. I know people are coming to you. I know you think this is the Democrats' problem.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Forget it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Why aren't you doing something?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Are you ready?
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> They're in terrible shape down there, Mr. President. Down in Homestead, Florida, that's where I grew up, it's, the conditions are terrible.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I agree. And it's been --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Do something.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- that way for a long time.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Do something.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And President Obama built the cages. Remember when they said that I built them? And then it was 1914 --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Do two wrongs --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Excuse me.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- make a right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was 2014. Chuck, just listen for one second.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Ok. Alright.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Separation, President Obama, I took over separation. I'm the one that put it together. What's happened though are the cartels and all of these bad people, they're using the kids. They're, they're, it's almost like slavery.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> But let's not punish the kids more.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No this has been happening --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Aren't you -- the kids are getting punished more.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You're right. And this has been happening long before I got there. What we've done is we've created, we've, we've ended separation. You know, under President Obama you had separation. I was the one that ended it. Now I said one thing, when I ended it I said, "Here's what's going to happen. More families are going to come up." And that's what's happened.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But they're really coming up for the economics. But once you ended the separation. But I ended separation. I inherited separation from President Obama. President Obama built, they call them jail cells. They were built --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Let's talk about what's happening now.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- by the Obama --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Your administration, and--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm just telling you --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> --you're not doing the recreation. You're not even schooling these kids anymore. You've gotten rid of all that stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're doing a fantastic job under the circumstances. The Democrats aren't even approving giving us money. Where is the money? You know what? The Democrats are holding up the humanitarian aid.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> It looks like these kids are being used as, as some sort of -- is it hostages? They're being held --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, they are being used.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- hostage.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They are being used by very bad people on the other side where they actually get --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> But now they're politically being used.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> --paid, where money is being made using them because our laws are so bad. Because if you have a child, you have an advantage. You know that better than anybody. And what should happen, Chuck --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> But why let the political debate hurt these children?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Chuck, we could --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> They could be impacted for years.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If the Democrats would change the asylum laws and the loopholes, which they refuse to do because they think it's good politics, everything would be solved immediately. But they refuse to do it. They refuse to do it.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Let me ask you this.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know what? If they change those, I say, I used to say 45 minutes. It's 15 minutes. If they changed asylum and if they changed loopholes everything on the border would be perfect.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Let me ask you this, why do you think Nancy Pelosi has held off her impeachment caucus?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because I think she feels that I will win much easier. I mean, I've been told that by many people.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Do you think impeachment's good politics for you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think I win the election easier. But, you know, I'm not sure that I like having it. Look, I did nothing wrong. I was spied on. What they did to me was illegal. It was illegal on the other side. I did nothing wrong. So impeachment's a very unfair thing because nothing that I did was wrong. And if you look at the Mueller report, there was no collusion.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This was all about collusion.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Nowhere in the Mueller report --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This was about conspiracy.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> By the way, Mr. President, you say no collusion. There is not a single, I've read this Mueller report, both, both parts of it --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Use the word collusion, or use --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- there's not one place it says nothing happened.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Use the word collusion. Use the word conspiracy.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> It never says no collusion.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'll be honest with you, nobody even mentions Russia anymore since the Mueller report. They don't mention it, in all fairness.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> I --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Nobody mentions Russia anymore. And it was about Russia. It was a hoax.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Let me ask you this --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Wait a minute.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- during the campaign --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Wait, wait. We'll give you the time that you need.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> What hoax it was?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was a hoax. The Russian hoax with me.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You don't believe it happened?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I had nothing to do --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You don't believe the Russians interfered --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What they did with --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- in our election?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- respect to the election is different. We're not talking about that. We're talking about --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> The idea that you were conspiring.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- my campaign working is a hoax.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Fair enough.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay. Good.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> But going back, on WikiLeaks, knowing now that that was stolen foreign material, do you regret using it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I, I wouldn't have. But this was well-known. I think it was in papers. And, again, I'm going back now a long ways. But --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> It was all rumored to be Russian stolen property.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Wait a minute. But --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> So why'd you use it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> --but how would I even know that? I made a speech. It was in there about WikiLeaks. I'm not a --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Right, but I'm saying knowing now --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- WikiLeaks person.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Knowing that they are a Russian intelligence --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hey, Chuck.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- asset --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Ok.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- do you regret it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let me tell you-- WikiLeaks, et cetera, that's not my deal in life. You know, in other words, I don't know about WikiLeaks. It was a strange name. But there were stories about something WikiLeaks that they had information. And I say it in a joking manner at a speech. Joking. Everybody laughing. Everybody having a -- And they made it like it was serious.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, I don't want anything bad to happen to our country. Anything bad happens to this country, I will end it and I'll end it fast. I don't want any of that to happen.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> There's one part in the Mueller report, your, your son, Donald Trump Jr., did cooperate and appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right. That's right.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> In the Mueller report, it says that he did not voluntarily sit for an interview with Mueller's team. And then there's a redaction. A Grand Jury redaction. Did he involuntarily sit?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know. I can only tell you this --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Is it possible he was --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- my son --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- subpoenaed by the, --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I, I really don't know.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- you don't know if he was subpoenaed?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But let me tell you what I do know.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> So did you not read the Mueller report?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let me tell you, I read much of it.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> The unredacted version or no?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I read -- No I didn't.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Ok.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I didn't. But let me just tell you --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> So if he was subpoenaed --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know what I read? I read the --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- if he was subpoenaed you wouldn't know?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- I read, I read the conclusion.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Ok.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, he was subpoenaed. Ultimately he was subpoenaed to sit before the Senate Intel --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> But was he --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- and he did that.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Was he subpoenaed by Mr. Mueller?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know. But I don't think so.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> If he was subpoenaed was he going to appear before the Grand Jury or was he --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- just going to plead the fifth?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I really don't know. But you can certainly ask him. I just --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> But you don't know?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- don't know. It was, it was -- He sat, my son, he's been treated so unfairly. He sat for many, many hours before these committees. I think, my impression is, that Mueller took all of the information from the committees and he used that information. How much, how much can you talk about something? Remember the phone calls, the three phone calls?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was such a big deal. Three phone calls that were made to a special type number.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay? And everybody said, "Oh, he called his father." That went on for a year. In other words, before this so-called meeting and after the meeting, "He called his father," the biggest story. Headlines all over the place. And then it turned out, and I give Mueller credit because Mueller was the one that found out through I guess the phone companies or whatever.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Somebody found out, maybe through the FBI. Big investigation on who the calls were made. If they were made to me, it would have sounded like you, wait a minute, they turned out that it wasn't to me. It was to a real estate person and a NASCAR person. Two great people, have nothing to do with Russia. Have nothing to do. And you know what?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> People hardly even put the story in. My son was treated unfairly. My son, he spent 20 some odd hours and then he went back again.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> But he never --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He was a very innocent, young man and he was treated very badly.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You're going to see Vladimir Putin in a week.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes. I'm going to see many people.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Are you going to address him directly about interference in 2020?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I may.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Are you going to tell him --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I may.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- not to do it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I may if you'd like me to do it, I'll do that.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Because some -- Well, some people think that your answer --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know what? Here's what you do --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- that your answer last week invited him to do it again.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, that's not true. That's not true.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Are you going to tell him not to and what are the consequences?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> My answer last week was both. I said both. I'd do both. Except they didn't put it on. And when they did put it on people understood. But they didn't put it on because they put a different segment on. So they ask me a question. But when I said, "Yeah, I'd do both," people saw that in the last version of it because the thing played like all weekend and on Friday.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So it's just more fake news. Chuck, there's so much fake news. It would be so good if --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> That's why I'm interviewing you one-on-one --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's fine. That's why I like --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Let me ask you this.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's why I like doing --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Do you think you've been --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I like live interviews better, you know why? Because you can't cut the answers.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Guess what? I'm not -- You're going to enjoy the fact that I'm not going to over-edit this interview. That I promise you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Ok. Good.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do you think you've been more successful in business or the presidency?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think, well, I can't be more successful in politics. I mean, I ran once and I'm president, right? So you have to say that's about -- there's nothing-- it's never happened before, right? So I'm one for one and I hope to be two for two. But my business has been a tremendous success. I actually said to the lawyers, "I'd like to show my financial statement.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> My financial statement's great." I built a great business --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You could release your tax returns any day you want.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I actually don't believe -- You don't learn from tax returns. And I'm under audit, Chuck. I've been saying it. I'm under audit. But you don't learn from tax returns.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> I was under audit.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But you would learn from a financial --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> I had my tax returns.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- statement. And I would like to release it. I've built a great company. They like to -- For instance, banks. Banks. I could have borrowed from banks. But I didn't need to because I had money. I did things, in fact, a lot of people over the last couple of years were really surprised. "He paid all cash, he didn't use banks." I think I've been tremendously successful in business.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think I've been tremendously successful in show business with The Apprentice. I mean, I did one show and it was a great hit, as you know, from NBC.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Yes, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I guess you have to say I've been really successful at politics.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> The Republican Party has changed in your image. Do you think you caused that change or do you think the party was changing and you were the leader they selected?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think common sense caused it. You know, I'm about common sense. People say, "Are you conservative?" I guess I'm conservative, but I'm about common sense. I'm about we need borders. We're going to have borders. And we have strong borders. And by the way, Mexico has done a great job. It's slowed down so much.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But we have an amazing economy and people want to come up. But it's slowed down so much. But I'm about borders. I'm about great health care. Obamacare is a disaster. I got rid of the individual mandate.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> By the way, why is the economy doing so well if Obamacare is still law of the land? You had said in 2011 --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We are managing --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- "Obamacare's going to destroy the economy." Obamacare's still here and --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because I've managed it great.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- the economy's great.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I had a choice. I could have let it implode and killed it or I could have managed it --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You're still trying to kill it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, no.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Why are you still trying to kill it with the getting rid of preexisting -- If you -- This lawsuit that the Department of Justice joined, it could get rid of --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am in favor --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- coverage of preexisting conditions.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am in favor of preexisting conditions. I am fighting --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> So get rid -- so drop the lawsuit.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We will --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> So drop your aspect of the lawsuit.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It has nothing to do with it. The lawsuit is one thing. We are going to put in a bill, total preexisting conditions. And the Republicans are in favor of preexisting conditions.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Mr. President, you had full Republican control and they couldn't pass anything.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Chuck, are you ready?
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> What makes you think you're going to get it done this time?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We had a negative vote from John McCain. It was a surprising vote. But I got rid of the worst part of Obamacare which was the individual mandate.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Ok.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We will always protect pre-existing conditions. And the reason Obamacare continues is my decision. Wait, I made a big decision.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Ok.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have a man named Azar, our secretary, he's fantastic man, Alex. A total pro. I could have managed Obamacare so it would have failed or I could have managed it the way we did so it's as good as it can be. Not great, but it's as good -- It's too expensive and the premiums are too high. I had a decision to make.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I could have politically killed Obamacare. I decided not to do it. But still it's not good. We're going to come up with great health care if we win the House, the Senate and the presidency.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Are you prepared to lose?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No. Probably not. Probably not.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Very hon -- I mean, you joke --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It would be much better, it would be much better if I said, "Yeah."
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You're, you're --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It would be much easier for me to say, "Oh yes." No I'm probably not too prepared to lose. I don't like losing. I haven't lost very much in my life.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You didn't like the fact that you lost the popular vote. That bothered you, didn't it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think it was a -- I mean, I'll say something that, again, is controversial. There were a lot of votes cast that I don't believe. I look at California.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Excuse me.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> But that's a --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Take a look at Judicial Watch, take a look at their settlement where California admitted to a million votes. They admitted to a million votes.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> A million votes of what?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Take a look at judicial --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> What are you talking about?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Judicial Watch made a settlement. There was, there was much --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> About what?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- there was much illegal voting. But let me tell you about popular vote. Do you have a second?
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Yes, because you were, you were a big fan of it --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There are two --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- until you weren't
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I like popular vote.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think I do better with a popular vote. But I didn't campaign for the popular vote.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You're right. I --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You didn't see me campaigning in California or New York. If I -- if it was up to the popular vote, I would have been I think even better. I won 306 to 223, which was a lot in the Electoral College. But it's like you're training for the 100-yard dash versus the mile.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Yep. You're, you're totally right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's totally different.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> If it's the popular vote, you campaign differently.--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I went to Wisconsin. --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- I don't disagree.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- She forgot. I went to Michigan. She didn't go to Michigan enough. I won Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. I won places that she didn't do a good job. What can I tell you? No, maybe I did a great job. You know, I never get credit for that. They always say she was a lousy candidate. I actually think that Hillary Clinton was a great candidate.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She was very smart. She was very tough. She was ruthless and vicious.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You'd rather run against her again, wouldn't you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You only talked about her in your announcement speech.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You spent a lot of time talking about her.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No. I would actually rather run against Biden.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Than Hillary.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think that would be my preference.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sleepy Joe. He's sleepy. She was not sleepy. Let me just tell you something, the Electoral College is tougher for a Republican to win than the popular vote. At least me. I feel that I go to three places. I went to 19 or 21 states. I went to Maine four times because I wanted to get one. And I did get it. And that's the beauty of the Electoral College.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, I've been a proponent of the other sometimes and I change. But I will tell you, the Electoral College brings you to many of the states in this country.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You, you have joked about a third term. You've joked about these things.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I only joke.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I joke. And I say "Watch, I will drive Chuck Todd crazy."
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You will, you will accept the re -- Ok. You will --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, there won't be a third term.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You will accept the results?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> 100%. Sure.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> And you will accept whatever happens in 2020.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sure.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You lose, you'll be like -- you're not going to like it but you walk out.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In fact, I said at a speech recently, I said, "Watch. We'll drive the media crazy. Let's go for a third time and then a fourth." And some of the media said, "He's going to do it."
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Speaking of driving people crazy, when you were asked about Mike Pence in 2024 and you, and you, and you paused a minute about endorsing him as your successor, that got a lot of people going, "Is Mike Pence 100% on your ticket in 2020?"
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, look, look -- 100%, yes.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> 100%?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh yeah.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> There is no wiggle room?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's been, he's been a terrific vice president. He's my friend and --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Ok.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- a lot of things. No. Zero. Zero.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> So why'd you hesitate in endorsing him in being, succeeding you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because it was a surprise question.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You hadn't thought about it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, you know, I'm not even thinking of it. It's so far out. I mean, It's so far out. That would be the only reason. Now what happens in 2024? I don't know that Mike is going to run. I don't know who's running or anything else. I will say this, I think it's a tremendous embarrassment to Joe Biden that Obama has not, that President Obama, I like to say that because it's respect for the office and respect for him.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Do you speak to any of the former presidents?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Who's the last one you did?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I speak to Bush.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> With President Bush?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I speak to Jimmy Carter.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You do? What about President Obama?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have not spoken to him --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> But George W. Bush, you do?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- pretty much from the beginning.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> And Jimmy Carter?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have spoken to Bush, I have spoken to Jimmy Carter, yes.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Do you get --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I like Jimmy Carter. You know, Jimmy Carter's oftentimes come to my defense. I don't necessarily agree with the way he ran things and that's okay. And he understands that and so do I. But he came to my defense on numerous occasions. And he thinks that I was treated the worst of anybody he's ever seen by the press.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> During --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't think he's including you.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Every new season, every new season of The Apprentice, you had something new to roll out. What's your big new idea for your re-election?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think that the economy has tremendous upward potential despite the fact that we're doing really well. I think when we really unleash some of the things --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> But what's your new idea?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- that we're going to do --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> What is the new big idea?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I also think that health care is going to be very important for me. I will tell you. If we win the House, the Senate and the presidency I will get tremendous health care because --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Do you think Democrats --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- Obamacare is a disaster.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Do you think Democrats won the House because of health care?
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. President, you have the Rio Grande behind us these are the guys on the frontline. You're giving them encouraging messages right behind them, as 500 pounds of drugs that they have captured from this river.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think they won because of preexisting condition.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Nothing to do with me. Because if you know almost every race that I campaigned for somebody they won. But I couldn't devote too much time to the House, there's too many people. But if you look at some of the Congressmen that I did go for and went for, they won like in Kentucky, et cetera, et cetera.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> So your one new idea is going to be health care?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Just one thing. Ohio governor, he was behind, great guy.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> He was.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Mike won. Georgia, President Obama was there. Oprah was there. Michelle Obama was there. It was going to be a big celebration. She was the star of the party. I went there for Brian. Brian Kemp. Brian Kemp won. Florida, Ron DeSantis --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> He ran as you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He was going to lose. He was low in the polls. I endorsed him. He went up 60 points after I endorsed him. Ron won. And he's been a great governor of Florida. You know, I've always heard that an endorsement is nice to have but it doesn't mean anything. I'm driving people up 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right. They are incredible people. We've just spent some time together, and we had a whole group meeting -- we also had that was just covered on your network and other networks. And it's incredible, the job they do and we really appreciate it. That's right. They have a tremendous amount of drugs that they just captured right behind us and that's what they do. And we had a barrier, a steel barrier, a concrete barrier, call it whatever you want.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It wouldn't have. We wouldn't have the problem.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I have some shots that we'll show in this. People can walk across the river and take them about what a minute and a half two minutes. That's that's all true that if there is no barrier all those drugs get in if these guys can carry over every inch of you know the 2,000 miles.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right. They have easy access into the United States. We've built a lot of wall we've renovated tremendous amount of wall with money that we've already gotten and we're continuing that. But now we really just want to get it going and finish it up and we're going to build the new wall and it's common sense really is when you think of it whether you're into the world of law enforcement like these incredible folks behind us that understand the wall so easily.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean it would make the job so much better and they could also go to other areas because we have the wall you don't need so many people we would probably pay for that many times in one year. If you think about it many times. So it's not a money thing it's a political thing. They look at the 2020 race and they're not feeling too good about it. They'll do whatever they can to win.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I have tapes of maybe 20 Democrats they all use the same phrase manufactured crisis. Interestingly they're best friends in the media. They're all using the same word manufactured crisis. So we have drug cartels. We have gangs that we're dealing with 90 percent of America's heroin crossing our southern border.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And then of course we've had homicides and we've had sexual assaults 100000 violent assaults. What do you say to that talking point. The media and the Democrats are using this as manufactured?
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Well, when you show up, you bring a lot of people.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We bring something very good.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> I'm curious, did you see Jon Stewart's pretty passionate plea on behalf of 9/11 responders in front of Congress?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I was very impressed, yes.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Are you going to -- He's frustrated with Mitch McConnell. He feels like Mitch McConnell's the guy standing in the way of this bill. You're a New Yorker first. I know that in you. I've got to think Jon Stewart got to you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, well --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Are you going to tell Mitch McConnell to --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well you know I watched last night I saw on your show last night actually where you had anchor after anchors using the exact same word it's manufactured man. Sounds like they're in collusion a little collusion. That's the real collusion. OK. That's the real collusion you take a look because they all use the exact same term.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean literally the exact same two words but they had manufactured. I said Where did they come up with that. It's a manufactured crisis. No it's a manufactured soundbite because it was just a soundbite but every virtually every you know I call it the fake news. I'm sure you haven't heard because you're not fake news actually you're real news.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And there is some of that. No there is some of that around unfortunately and these are great people. These are patriotic people that do it correctly but you know when I hear that term manufactured and you see every single group using it it's very sad.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> We lose 300 Americans a week 90 percent of the heroin comes into the country in the last two weeks. We lost our Officer Singh right in California. Then Piers Cochran had his parents on the show the other. I don't know how you recover after losing a child killed by illegal immigrants. I've met and I've interviewed so many Angel moms and dads meeting.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> They're going to say that to them the people that lost their loved ones their sons their daughters their parents.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know many of the people that aren't getting their check they get it. They're going to get it soon. But many of the people that are with us are 100 percent. They want us to win this battle. These people want us to win. Everybody wants us to win this battle. It's common sense. Death is pouring through.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have crime and death. And it's not just at the border. They get through the border but then they go all they filter into the country. And you have MS13 gangs in different places like Los Angeles and you have gangs all over Long Island which were knocking the hell out of there should be no reason for us to have to do this they shouldn't be allowed in. And if we had the barrier they wouldn't be able to get in.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Okay, so the point everybody that I have met and spoke spoken to they all say tell the president if you see him hold the line. Now you said earlier today that it's likely that you're very likely going to declare a national emergency how soon will that happen?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now if we don't make a deal with Congress most likely I will do that. I would actually say I would I can't imagine any reason why not because I'm allowed to do it. The law is 100 percent on my side. So if we can't make a deal with Congress then we should be able to make a deal with Congress if you look Democrats in Congress especially the new ones coming in are starting to say wait a minute we can't win this battle with Trump because of the fact that it's just common sense how can we say that a wall doesn't work.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I liked what Jon Stewart did. I actually did. And I actually have a meeting on that subject next week. So we'll see what happens.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> So you think you will --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know it's a very complicated subject for a lot of reasons.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> I understand that it is. But --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I have a meeting --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- do you think that Jon Stewart had a point that Congress hadn't done enough?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have a meeting with that, on that subject with -- Well, when you say Congress, billions of dollars has been passed.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> I understand that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay, billions.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They show on helicopters empty fields or people just running through. And you put a wall they can't run it through.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> What are the options though if you declare a national emergency. The Pentagon also has the funds available that they would be able to help support the building of the wall?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If we don't make a deal with Congress which we should be able to really just common sense and there's some compromise needed. And look they know that the walls work you know what works a wheel and a wall. They call it a medieval thing. Well you know I'm looking at all these very expensive cars all over here loaded up with machine guns and every single one of them has wheels.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a wheel is an old thing and it a wall is an old thing, there are two things they work. They work a wall would be so effective it would solve so many killings and so much death and drugs and human trafficking where they tape of women on their face they tape them up and they put them in the back of a car or a van and they drive right through our border.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Right. But the fund was about to run out.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Memorials have been, have been built.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Tremendous amounts of money. But there are still people that are sick. I have a meeting on it next week.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> All right, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I guess the next most important question is when you do that would you expect they're going to go judge shopping to go to the Ninth Circuit or go to California to start the process is there are your attorneys telling you there's an expedited way perhaps through the Supreme Court.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They are saying there possibly is and hopefully we wouldn't even have to go through. The law is very clear. I mean we have the absolute right to declare a national emergency and this is security stuff. This is a national emergency. If you look at what's happening and you just heard the statement they came in last week or this week from Pakistan and different people.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Did you get to see Sara Carter last night people from Bangladesh
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they come in through the southern border because it's really considered the space and the place where they can get in. And we want to close it up. These people have done the greatest job. It's hard work and it could be a lot easier and it would be virtually 100 percent effective. And Nancy and Chuck know that but it's politics it's about the 2020 campaign it's about running for president.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's what they're doing they're already doing it. It's a shame.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> We got to put the country first. When you see you when you see the same Democrats Hillary, Obama, and Biden, Schumer all supporting this as you know in 2006 2013. Right. They're not supporting it now is it because you are the President and they don't want you to get a win. Shouldn't the win be about the country being safer more secure?
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> I appreciate the time.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you very much.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Thank you, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They know what I'm saying is 100 percent right. And it's not only us it's everybody saying it. These people said everybody says it. If you don't have a barrier whether it's a steel barrier or a concrete wall substantial and strong you're never going to solve this problem. You're never going to solve it. And I don't need this look I could have done something a lot easier I could have enjoyed myself I haven't left the White House because I'm waiting for them to come over in a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know that I stayed home for Christmas I stayed at the White House for new years and I think it tweeted Christmas Eve all along whereas Chuck and Nancy my family I told them stay in Florida and enjoy yourselves. But the fact is I want to be in Washington. I mean I considered very very important.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Last question: time -- timeline before you think you have to go the route and declare a national emergency?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think we're going to see what happens over the next few days. They should do it immediately. Look, we're not going anywhere we're not changing our mind because there's nothing to change your mind about. The world works. It's not a question, like, well, maybe it won't work. It will work 100 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now we're adding onto that equipment to find drugs that are hidden in cars. I mean we have this incredible equipment. We're adding sensors we're adding drones. But what we need is we need the barrier. If we don't have a barrier, if we don't have a steel or concrete barrier, we're all wasting a lot of time.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> And lives will be saved. I know you're thinking about the furloughed employees. You support them getting all their back pay?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> One hundred percent. I support them tremendously. But I also support families like the Singh family and others and others by the hundreds and by the thousands that have lost somebody because our policies are so bad and especially at the southern border. They've lost, or they've had people so badly hurt but they've lost him they've lost their lives they've lost they've lost their heart out of the family.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I support those families. These Angel moms you know the Angel Moms very well and so do I support them too.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Does it mean a lot to you guys that the president's down here?
<Unidentified Border Patrol Representative> <Positive> Yes absolutely.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And is he describing the situation accurately?
<Unidentified Border Patrol Representative> <Positive> Yes sir.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And if you get the wall, drugs will stop -- you can stop the cartels human trafficking drug trafficking the gangs there?
<Unidentified Border Patrol Representative> <Positive> Yes it will help improve.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> By what percent?
<Unidentified Border Patrol Representative> <Negative> Like the chief said ,the majority of our traffic is -- is usually coming through areas that don't have a wall just like this. 515 pounds of dope.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. President, thanks for taking time. Thank you guys for what you do, too. Thank you, we appreciate it.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> We have a very special guest, President Trump just walked into the room. I stood up and shook hands and he's with us right now. Mr. President, thanks for being with us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well it's only because I like your show.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> Oh, thank you very much indeed sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I watch you.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> Really fast, first lady, Melania in some trouble on the plane this morning, everybody OK?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're fine, I just spoke to her. They came back, she got on another plane, I said, I hope this plane's better than the first one but yes, they had a problem.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> What was the problem?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, they had a problem but she's fine.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> OK, does anybody ever say to you, you're doing an awful lot of media and you like it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I don't like it, I like getting the point across, I've heard you say many times that the economy isn't covered properly and it's not. That the economies not covered properly by these so called "mainstream media" and it isn't.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We went up almost 600 points yesterday and they didn't even have it on the major news, you couldn't find it any where and the economy is doing probably better than it's ever done in history and they don't even talk about.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And that's because they have their opinion and they'd like to keep their opinion going the way they have it. They do not treat us fairly and therefore if I do the news, they all want me on the news, so I can talk about it myself.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> Are you going to keep up this pace of media after the mid terms or is this a run up to the mid terms?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Probably not, no this is just for the mid terms. We want to win, we want to get the republicans nominated and we want to get them elected. We need republicans, you know they talk about majority, we have a majority of this much, I always say if somebody has a cold, just a minor cold, we no longer have a majority.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, we need Republicans and we'll have tremendous border security when we do that, we'll continue with the tax cuts because we have other tax cuts planned, we're going to do a lot of cutting of the budget, also by the way, which I know is going to make you happy but we're going to do a lot of cutting.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> You're going to cut some spending?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We are, we're going to cut spending absolutely and we had to...
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> That's [Inaudible] Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not as tough as you think and frankly there's a lot of fat in there but we had to get the military done last time. You know, President Obama let it go and I could say beyond President Obama, the military was in terrible shape. Now we've got $700 billion approved and we got $716 billion, two years, and our military is rebuilding like it's never been, really never happen before.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We got a raise for the people, they haven't had a raise in 11 years, we got a raise for the great people in the military and you know we're doing a lot of things, a lot of great things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But now I'm going to also do some cutting of the budget because there's a lot fat, in order to get that $717, $716 billion we had to give up things to the democrats that I hated to give up, that you wouldn't have liked but I had to. But we had to rebuild the military.
<Stuart Varney> <Neutral> What's the big deal, economically in the next two years?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I think we have a lot of things but you know, very big still we've cut regulations more than any president ever and you can go four years, eight years, it doesn't matter, this tremendous regulations that we can be cutting still and we're doing it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, it used to take 21 years to get a highway built, you know, bad case, but it would take 21 years, we're trying to bring that down to two and maybe even one and by the way, if it's not right, we're not going to approve it but we're not going to take 21 years to find out whether or not we can do it.
<Stuart Varney> <Neutral> Is that part of the implementation of the infrastructure rebuilding?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's part of that and it's going to start, infrastructure is going to be starting after the mid terms and we think that's going to be an easy one. But we're going to infrastructure, we're going to have everything, just more of the same. Look what's happened with our country and if you look at China they're down $20 trillion and we're up $11.7 trillion dollars in worth, that's a tremendous number.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> Ready to start talking with China again or are they ready for you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think so, I told them they want to make a deal and I said you guy's aren't ready yet, you're just not ready because look, they've been $500 billion a year our of country, it's time that we stopped, OK? We've rebuilt China, you know that better than anybody, you talk about it more than I do I think and it stopped and you see what's happening with China, it's a whole different ball game.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, now they're paying 25 percent tariffs on $250 billion hasn't affected our economy, has it, cost's haven't gone up, inflation still low, very low, hasn't had an impact that we see except for one, billions of dollars are pouring into the treasury.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> Saudi Arabia, we got to find out exactly what happened, when we do find out and if punishment is required, any idea what kind of punishment it might be?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I hope we're going to be on the better side of the equation, you know we need Saudi Arabia in terms of our fight against all of the terrorism, everything that's happening in Iran and other places but Iran's been the leader.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Iran has been set back very big when I knocked out the Iran deal, you know it's a different country than it was. When I first came in, if you look through it and you take a look, oh a day before I came in, Iran was taking over the Middle East, they were going to take over everything, from Syria to Yeman to this -- now they're way pulling back, they're having riots in the street, they are a mess as a country and that had to do with the day that I pulled that horrible $150 billion deal we gave them -- the Iran deal, the Iran nuclear deal. We pulled it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're going to come back and negotiate because they're really -- I'm not going to say they have no choice, but they're going to come back and negotiate. And if they don't, that's fine, too.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> Well, we're not going to walk away from Saudi Arabia.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't want to do that.
<Stuart Varney> <Neutral> That's an ally --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to do that.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> - with Iran.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do not want to do that, and frankly they have a tremendous order -- $110 billion. Every country in the world wanted a piece of that order. We got all of it. And what are we going to do? Again, I've had some senators come up and some congressmen that said, "well, you know, sir, I think what we should do is we should not take that order."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said, "who are we hurting? It's 500,000 jobs. It'll be ultimately $110 billion. It's the biggest order in the history of our country from an outside military." And I said, "we're going to turn that down? Why would we do that?"
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So hopefully it's working out. We'll find out. We'll get down to the bottom of it. I hope that the King and the Crown Prince didn't know about it. That's the big factor in my eyes, and I hope they haven't.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Mike Pompeo just left. He went to Turkey as you know. He's coming back late tonight. I'm seeing him either tonight or tomorrow, and we'll find out.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> Has anybody every said to you, "Mr. President, let me have your phone. I want to take your phone away from you for just a brief, shining moment. We don't want anymore of these tweets." Anybody ever try that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, and I don't think I'd be talking to you if I did that. That's a way of getting out the message. Look, we have fake news. Everyone's fake. You look at what's -- and I'm not saying you and some of the people on Fox.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not all of them, but some of them, but there's so much misinformation being put out. That's my only form of communicating really other than having a press conference every hour. If I do a press conference every hour.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, we're communicating very well. The polls are going through the roof. I think the Republicans are going to do well in the midterms, and I'm doing a lot of work on this. But to be honest with you I get such phony news. Everything's a fake.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Even yesterday I gave an interview to AP and the headline was totally different from everything I said. The headline was just terrible. Headline -- everything else was perfect. You know, the quotes were all perfect and they've been criticized for it. You know, where did they come up with that headline?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So if I gave that up -- it's social media. I don't call it tweeting. I call it social media. It goes on your show. Every time I do something you say, "we have breaking news. We have breaking news," whatever it may be, but I really believe if I didn't do that, Stuart, number one I probably wouldn't even be here talking to you.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> But you like it, too, don't you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do like it. It's a form of getting out the truth.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> And you like the press conferences.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I enjoy them.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> You never miss an opportunity. When a question is shouted at you, you almost always respond.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What's funny, sometimes I get a really nasty person with a horrible, stupid question from like CNN because they're just so horrible and so fake. But, you know, I get this horrible question from some reporter at CNN. Then I'll hit the reporter back just modestly hard, and the next thing, "President hits reporters, terrible, freedom of the press."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I say what do I -- they hit me so viciously, I give them a little jab and the story is Trump hits reporter. So, you know, it's pretty unfair stuff, but again you get out there whether I do it this way or whether I do it through social media, but we're definitely getting the word out. We have the greatest economy in the history of our country, and it's not being reported.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The -- you go to NBC -- which is terrible, terrible new organization -- but you go to NBC, CBS, ABC, I mean, CNN we don't even talk about, but you go to these things. Take a look. I think the other day is was 94 percent, and that's of good stories. In other words, they take a good story and make it bad to neutral.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> It's never going to change.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's what they say --
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> Any negative will always be the headline.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But that's why I do what I do because I can sort of go over that.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> You seem to be really enjoying it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have no choice.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> You do enjoy it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do I have choice? May I ask you?
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> You really enjoy it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You enjoy what you do, too.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> Yes, I do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's why you do it well.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> I just want to thank you very much for being on the program.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, thank you. And enjoy the White House.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> Thank you, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We love having you.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> Thank you very much, indeed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> Yes, sir. There will be more Varney after this.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald Trump says the Republicans have to fight fire with fire, Trump calling the presidential campaign vicious, even worse than the 2008 campaign waged against Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Here is Donald Trump.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> [Begin Video Clip] Donald, nice talk to you, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hello, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, let me go straight to your Twitter account, and one of your most recent tweets is, "I'm really glad that Mitt Romney no longer says what a nice guy Barack Obama is." Do you want to go beyond 140 characters and tell us what you mean?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am just so happy about it because for a period of time, Mitt was going out and saying, He's a fine man, he's a wonderful man. And frankly, you know, based on this campaign, on Hillary's campaign, on other campaigns that he's run over the years, it's not so. And I think Mitt sees that. And I haven't heard him say that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now, maybe he does, but I haven't heard him say that over the last few weeks, and I'm very happy about that. And so are a lot of other people.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, so if he's not a, quote, "fine man," as you say, what is he?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, he's somebody who will say some very nasty things. He is a person that is not the nice person that some people think. and his popularity rating, while high, I think if people knew the facts, the rating would actually be extremely low.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What do you make then, there is a huge gender gap, if you say the people don't necessarily like President Obama the gender gap in the women polls show that the women really do like him, vis-a-vis Governor Ryan?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Maybe they don't know him. Maybe they don't get what is going o. I think this won't be a popularity contest, this is a contest based on jobs. It will get down, that last month, it will get down to jobs. If you look at the $716 billion out of Medicare by the Obama administration, if you look at what is going on, I think when it comes out, it is going to be a lot of things are going to be neutralized, but it will get down to how is the economy, and the answer is not good.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And how is unemployment? They say 8.3, but the real number's probably 16 percent and some people could even say 21 percent because that's the real number. The real number is not 8.3 percent. It's 16 and possibly 21 percent, and that's catastrophic. I think the president -- it will be a close race, but I really think that the president has a problem in the numbers don't improve, and you don't have much time to improve them.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> When you talk about 16 or 20, you are talk about this underemployed and people who are so disillusioned. One number that correlates is the African-American unemployment rate. If you look at how many African-Americans are looking for jobs and can't get jobs, that compared to the national average of 8.2 is 14.1 percent.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What -- how can he win with a 14.1 percent unemployment rate and get that vote?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's an amazing number. It is much higher than that because you are correlating it to the 8.3 and that's not a correct number either. So the number would be close to 30 percent. That number is just crazy. And almost to a point where you would say, how can somebody, if you are African-American, how you can vote for the man?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's let you down. He has really let you know.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> In terms of the African-American, I am sure that you know that the gaffe -- actually the campaign is not calling it a gaffe, the Republican campaign is calling it a gaffe of Vice President Biden said to a predominantly African-American community in Virginia, putting you back in chains. And there was some gasps and boos and some cheering.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But there has been a left talk about it in the last two hours. What do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think it's a terrible statement. I think it's something that probably he wished he didn't say. But he was not reprimanded or stopped. They backed him up 100 percent. Look, this is a very vicious campaign that is being waged against Mitt Romney and the Republicans. Vicious. And if the Republicans are not going on fight back and fight with fire -- because if you are not going to fight fire with fire, it is not a very good picture.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They are going to have to get very, very tough and be very, very smart, which they are -- and they have to go out there and do it. If they don't have to be politically correct, they shouldn't be politically correct. I will tell what you, what he said about chains and what other people have said about other things are vicious.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Have you never heard language like this. This is worse than Hillary. Hillary was one of the worst, meanest campaigns wage against Hillary Clinton, ever. In fact, they say it was number one in the annals of our country, and this is making it look like baby talk. The Republicans are going to have to be very, very smart and very, very tough.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Governor Palin last night "On the Record" and Senator John McCain have both said that Vice President Biden, they think that president Obama should find someone else to run with him as vice-president. In fact, Governor Sarah Palin went further and said, if he wanted to win, President Obama should pick Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I watched the show and I watched Sarah, and I think she's terrific. She is a terrific person. Her husband's a great guy. I was a little surprised she said that because, frankly that, gives people ideas. Maybe it would be an even tougher race. I was a little surprised that she said it. And who knows? But I have a great respect for her.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I really think that, you know, she has been a very, very poorly treated person by the media, unfairly treated, really unfairly treated, because I have gotten to know her well and she's a great person.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What do you think of Congressman Paul Ryan? Is he a good tactically, good addition to the ticket or not?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I will tell you this, he has energized the party. People that were obviously going to vote for Mitt are really now energized and want to do it even more so. That's a great thing. He is obviously bringing some things up that should be brought up and have to be brought up. And people are questioning -- they think it was a pretty bold -- and I think it was.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think it was a pretty bold choice. But I have watched him the last three or four days, the Republican Party is totally energized. So in that sense, I think it's very good.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Who is going to win?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think that Mitt Romney is going to win. I think it's going to be close. I think when it gets down to it, it will be about the economy and jobs. Obviously, the record on jobs and the record on the economy is dismal and I think that the Republicans are going to win and I being that Mitt Romney is going to be your next president.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> In the swing states, which are the states that that we are looking to see, which are so important to both candidates and tickets. There are at least, Indiana Ohio and Virginia. Unemployment rates below the 8.3 percent. Now, they have Republican governors. But nonetheless, the numbers, I realize, if you are unemployed, you don't care what the number is in your state.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But your thoughts on that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They all have Republican governors and the states are doing much better. Possibly, though, people are not going to be remembering the Republican governor. They are going to maybe, maybe it makes it harder to win those states. But in the end they also see what is happening to the country. They so what China is doing and OPEC is doing and what every country is doing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We don't have a country that we do business with where we are doing well. Everybody takes advantage of the patsy. We are viewed as the patsy. We're viewed as the foolish, stupid, use any word you want to use, a real weak, ineffective group of people and group of leaders. So I think whether they have low or high unemployment, they look at the country and they see what is happening and I think that the Republican candidate in the name of Mitt Romney is going to win.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, suppose that you couldn't run your business enterprise at all. And suppose that governor Mitt Romney is elected president. You could pick any job in the administration, what do you think Donald Trump would be best suited for and enjoy most?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> First of all, I am not looking for a job.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I know you are not. What would be intriguing to you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think I would be a great job at secretary of commerce because I wouldn't let China rip us off and India and all of these countries that are taking advantage and very intelligently from their standpoint, but not form out standpoint. But I wouldn't let OPEC, I wouldn't let some of these countries that just laugh at our stupidity, they won't be laughing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So I think I would be great as secretary of commerce, if have you to know. But I really love what I am doing. I run a big business. It is doing great. I love what I am doing. But if you asked me that question, secretary of commerce, I would do such a great job.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, Donald, thank you for talking to us. We'll see you at the convention.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Very good, Greta. Thank you.
<Question> <Neutral> [Question not in transcript, relating to health care]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd rather see repeal and replace because I -- I can do either way. If you remember, it was -- you know, it was an idea that I had very early on, repeal. Trouble with repeal is you'll have millions of people out there that -- well, it's like we just got the highest confidence in many years; you know, people out there that will say, well, you know, how do we know we're going to have health care? And I hate to do that to people.
<WSJ Reporter> <Neutral> But you've been concerned about that, right --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've always -- I'm always concerned about that. I don't like it. I don't -- I don't like it from that standpoint. Now, with that being said, you might be able to make a very good deal because I think there's a lot of pressure on the Democrats. But the Democrats are nothing more than obstructionists. That's all they can do. That's all they seem to be good at. So they're obstructionists, so what they will do, even though it's for the good of the country, they will obstruct. They can't do anything about Obamacare, and I understand that. They don't want to vote against it. But now, once it's done -- it was my original theory: once it's begun, now they can get together. They can do something. But they won't do that. There's too much -- and this isn't with respect to me; this is years. É I mean, if you look at what's been going on over the last long period of time. I actually asked people that are political people -- I could ask you people -- you know, is it the worst you've seen it? And I've had every single person, no, actually there's certain other times that were worse. There were certain times in Obama's administration that were worse.
<WSJ Reporter> <Negative> The partisanship, you mean.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You think -- yeah, the partisanship. So, anyway. So I'd rather see -- I'd rather see replace. I'd rather add the replace. And we have a very good plan. That's the one thing, we really have a good plan.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We've covered a lot of territory. It's a very, very difficult situation because you move a little bit to the left and you lose four guys, you move a little bit to the right all of a sudden you have a bloc of people that are gone. You have about a one-inch road and it wheels through the middle of the valley, and if it's even slightly off -- it's a very difficult -- it's a very difficult thing, always has been.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, if you think, Hillary Clinton, smart person, she was the first lady of the country, her entire life was spent -- her entire eight years was spent trying to get health care. Never even came close. Obama -- and one thing I have to say, I'm here now exactly six months. Obama took would you say a year and a half?
<WSJ Reporter> <Neutral> Yeah.
<WSJ Reporter> <Neutral> He took a year and a half, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because people were saying, Trump has not produced. I honestly believe for six months I have done more than just about any president when you look at all of the bills that were passed, 42, 43. [Break in Transcript]
<WSJ Reporter> <Positive> What are you most proud of in the first six months?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A lot of things. I think I'm proud of the Supreme Court choice. And that's not just a nomination, that's getting him through. I'm very proud of opening up regulations. One of the reasons you see optimism is because people can actually use their land.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They can farm their land. I've had tremendous and tremendous -- look, I had 45,000 people there yesterday. It's the biggest crowd they've ever had, and they were -- they were going wild yesterday in West Virginia. But people can actually use their land and they can build.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think one of the things that I have to be very proud of is the VA. I think we have a great, great administratorÉ and a great secretary, David Shulkin. He's -- he was actually approved 100 to nothing, by the way.
<WSJ Reporter> <Negative> What about your disappointments? Any disappointments in the first six months?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd have to let you know. I have to see where we are with this. Let's see. Maybe it doesn't work, but I think it's going to. And, you know, it is -- it would have been easier to start with taxes, but this is better if it works, OK? If it works, this is better.
<WSJ Reporter> <Neutral> More generally.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think, you know, depending -- so if you asked me that question in a month or really at the end of the year, because we hope to get this. We hope to get taxes and then infrastructure. And then I'm going to do a very big -- we're doing very big trade deals, and we're looking forward to that. But we want to do, ideally, this first.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, a lot of people said you should have started with taxes or you should have started with infrastructure. Well, infrastructure I'll actually have bipartisan support, and I can use infrastructure to carry other things along. So I don't want to waste it at the beginning, if that makes sense. [Break in Transcript]
<Question> <Neutral> [Question not in transcript, on Apple building plants in the United States]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But one of the things we're doing that, so Gary and I are working -- because I said, you know, Gary [Cohn], we're going to have Foxconn come in. We're going to have a lot of companies that are coming in. Foxconn's coming in with a big plan. We have Tim Cook I spoke to, and he's promised me three big plants -- big, big, big. I said, you know, Tim, unless --
<WSJ Reporter> <Negative> Really? Where?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We'll have to see. You can call him. But I said, Tim, unless you start building your plants in this country, I won't consider my administration an economic success, OK? And he's called me and he says, you know, they're going forward, three big, beautiful plants. You'll have to call him. I mean, maybe he won't tell you what he tells me, but I believe he will do that. I really believe it. [Break in Transcript]
<Question> <Neutral> [Question not in transcript, relating to reappinting Janet Yellin chairwoman of the Fed]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a lot of respect for her, and I like her. I've met her just a couple of times, but I like her. It's early to make the decision.
<WSJ Reporter> <Negative> Does that mean it's possible you would keep her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do like low interest rates. I mean, you know, I'm not making that a big secret. I think low interest rates are good. I like a dollar that's not too strong. I mean, I've seen strong dollars. And frankly, other than the fact that it sounds good, lots of bad things happen with a strong dollar. É I would say yes, she is in the running to stay.
<WSJ Reporter> <Positive> Is Gary [Cohn] a candidate? [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He doesn't know this, but yes, he is. [Laughter]
<WSJ Reporter> <Neutral> Are there other candidates?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I actually think he likes what he's doing right now.
<WSJ Reporter> <Neutral> That's what he tells us.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don't tell Gary what I just said.
<WSJ Reporter> <Neutral> Are there other candidates?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, there are two or three. But she is -- she is in the running, absolutely. I like her. I like her demeanor. I think she's done a good job. I'd like to see rates stay low. She's always been -- you know, she's historically been a low-interest-rate person, a believer.
<WSJ Reporter> <Neutral> Do you have a time frame for announcing a decision?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say sometime by the end of year, probably. [Break in Transcript]
<Question> <Negative> [Question not in transcript, relating to taxing the wealthy]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The truth is the people I care most about are the middle-income people in this country who have gotten screwed. And if there's upward revision it's going to be on high-income people. You know, I was with Bob Kraft the other night. He came to have dinner with me. He's a friend of mine. And as he left, he said, Donald, don't worry about the rich people. Tax the rich people. You got to take care of the people in the country. It was a very interesting statement. I feel the same way. [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We want -- look, the job producers we're going to take great care of, but we have to take care of middle-income people in this country. They built the country, they started this whole beautiful thing that we have, and we have to take care of them. And people have not taken care of them, and we're going to.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I mean, I have wealthy friends that say to me I don't mind paying more tax. And I'll tell you what I sort of don't like, is when they -- you know, you'll do your charts in The Wall Street Journal and they'll be brilliantly done, very nice, and they'll show that a rich guy who made, you know, $25 million last year is going to pay less than he was. In a certain way, I don't like that. I'd rather take that difference and put it into the middle-income and put it into corporate.
<WSJ Reporter> <Positive> You should be able to get Democrat support for that, right? I mean, you can reach across the aisle --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, except they're obstructionists. If they weren't obstructionists, I would normally get Democratic support. So we don't anticipate that. We don't Ð [Break in Transcript]
<WSJ Reporter> <Negative> On steel tariffs, you committed to imposing steel tariffs. You haven't done that, but you still --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we're waiting -- we're waiting till we get everything completed. We don't want to do at this moment. We're going to -- we're going to wait till we get everything completed here. We're going to see. It's a very unfair situation. They're dumping steel in our country. It's extremely unfair. But we like to keep it as simple as -- we like to keep very complicated subjects as simple as possible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we're waiting till we get everything finished up between health care and taxes and maybe even infrastructure. But we're going to be addressing the steel dumping at a very -- fairly soon.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We -- just so you understand -- we have massive reports. You know, a lot of this stuff you can't just walk in and say I'm going to do this. You have to do statutory studies. And then you have to wait 90 days. And then you have to do another. And you have to wait another 20 days. It doesn't go that quickly. It's like NAFTA. You know, you have a six-month termination. I was ready to terminate NAFTA.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was looking forward to it, frankly, because NAFTA's a horrible deal for the United States. And then I got a call from the president of Mexico, who's a terrific guy, and I got a call from the prime minister of Canada. And they heard I was getting ready to terminate it. And they said: Would you have a meeting with us first? I said, yes. And if you look at my speeches, I've always said, either renegotiate it or terminate it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, renegotiating it is easier. And we're in the midst of a renegotiation right now. So we'll see. And maybe we'll have to terminate it. I happen to think NAFTA's one of the truly bad deals -- I mean, outside of the Iran deal, which is one of the worst deals in history --
<WSJ Reporter> <Negative> Do you think it's salvageable? Do you think NAFTA's salvageable?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It may be salvageable.
<WSJ Reporter> <Negative> What do you need for that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would say -- I would say it may be salvageable. But certainly, I have an obligation to give it a shot.
<WSJ Reporter> <Neutral> What are you looking for specifically --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm looking for fairness.
<WSJ Reporter> <Positive> But what does that -- can you give an example?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it means -- look, our automobile industry has just left us and gone to Mexico -- I mean, a big chunk of it. And it's very unfair for them to take our companies, built their cars, and then sell the car back into our country with no tax. It's very unfair. They fire all our people in Michigan and Ohio, and they take it, and they build a car. And now they sell the car back in with no tax. It's not fair. [Break in Transcript]
<WSJ Reporter> <Neutral> You mentioned the Iran deal, but it's been certified as in compliance twice now. It comes up again in September. Would you -- is there going to come a point where you just --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're doing major studies. Oh, I would be very surprised if they will be -- look, we've been extremely nice to them. We've been extremely nice to them in saying they were compliant, OK? We've given them the benefit of every doubt. But we're doing very detailed studies. And personally, I have great respect for my people. If it was up to me, I would have had them noncompliant 180 days ago.
<WSJ Reporter> <Negative> Do you expect them to be declared noncompliant the next time?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Personally, I do. I do.
<WSJ Reporter> <Neutral> In September?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think they'll be noncompliant. I think they're taking advantage of this country. They've taken advantage of a president, named Barack Obama, who didn't know what the hell he was doing. And I do not expect that they will be compliant.
<WSJ Reporter> <Positive> Will you overrule your staff on that, if they come back with a recommendation --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, sure. Sure. Look, I have a lot of respect for Rex and his people, good relationship. It's easier to say they comply. It's a lot easier. But it's the wrong thing. They don't comply. And so we'll see what happens. I mean, we'll talk about this subject in 90 days. But, yeah, I would be -- I would be surprised if they were in compliance [Break in Transcript]
<WSJ Reporter> <Positive> OK, if I may, can I ask you quick, Mr. President, we've talked about your achievements and disappointments. I was reminded of President Eisenhower, when he left office, said that his two biggest mistakes in officer were both sitting on the Supreme Court. From things you've been saying in the --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So far I can't say that, right?
<WSJ Reporter> <Positive> From the same -- from the things you've been saying in the last week or so, and tweeting, it sounds as though you may think that maybe your biggest mistake is running the Justice Department. Is that --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm disappointed in Jeff Sessions, yes.
<WSJ Reporter> <Negative> Do you want him to leave?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Number one, they should go after the leakers in intelligence. I don't mean the White House stuff where they're fighting over who loves me the most, OK? [Laughter] It's just stupid people doing that.
<WSJ Reporter> <Neutral> Anthony's already taken care of that. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know, that's just -- and Anthony [Scaramucci] will handle that. [Laughter] I can -- Anthony can do that out of his back pocket, OK? I'm talking about intelligence leaks. I'm talking like the story about Syria that was in The New York Times the other day. I'm -- which by the way, was a decision made by people, not me. But, you know, they wrote it 100 -- it was in the --
<WSJ Reporter> <Neutral> The Post, I thought. It was in The Washington Post.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was in The Washington Post. That was not something that I was involved in, other than they did come and they suggested. It turns out it's -- a lot of al-Qaeda we're giving these weapons to. You know, they didn't write the truthful story, which they never do. So all of those things are very important.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, no, I'm very disappointed in the fact that the Justice Department has not gone after the leakers. And they're the ones that have the great power to go after the leakers, you understand. So -- and I'm very disappointed in Jeff Sessions.
<WSJ Reporter> <Neutral> You can fire him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, Jeff -- I could. But we'll see what happens. But I was -- I appointed a man to a position. And then shortly after he gets the position, he recused himself. I said, what's that all about? Why didn't you tell me that you were going to do that, and I wouldn't have appointed you? But I appointed him. And shortly thereafter, he recused himself. So I think that is a --
<WSJ Reporter> <Positive> You also suggested in Cleveland today they should be going -- or, yesterday -- they should be going after Hillary Clinton. Is that --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I didn't -- I wouldn't have wanted to. But I see the way they go after us on a witch hunt, you know? The Russian -- the Russian story's all an excuse for the Democrats losing. In fact, if you read the book, "Shattered," they have a whole chapter where they sat the day after the election and they said: Yeah, Russia. It was Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, you know, Trump was involved. OK, the one thing interesting, you never heard me even associated with anybody. But, no, that's a total witch hunt, the whole Russia story. It's a hoax. It's a hoax. We had no collusion with Russia. We never dealt with Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People that were on the campaign, like Corey, came in yesterday. It was very interesting. He was being interviewed. He said -- I was watching, Corey Lewandowski -- he says: I was here from the beginning. And I must be honest with you, I never dealt with any Russians. He was only the campaign manager. I can even look at Hope. She was here from virtually the same day that Corey started, those two. Hope, how many Russians have you seen involved in the campaign, OK?
<Hope Hicks> <Positive> None. [Laughs]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK? You know, I mean, it's sad. So they do that. And I say, that's fine. But then we should really look at real crimes, because real crimes are what Hillary did with 33,000 emails, where she deleted them and bleached them after getting a subpoena.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Real crimes are what's happening and what happened with the uranium deal. And also -- I mean, you can say the speeches made while she was secretary of state where they paid her a fortune, Podesta owning a big company in Russia -- they talk about me. I have nothing to do with Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I put out a letter from a very -- from the biggest law firm saying Trump has no involvement with Russia. I don't. I have no involvement. I mean, I had Ms. Universe there, like, nine years ago, eight years ago, something like that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I have nothing to do with Russia. So -- and it's very funny, because all of these people that have been on the campaign, some of them right from the beginning -- Anthony's another example. You've been there. You know --
<Anthony Scaramucci> <Negative> [Inaudible] I said from the podium on Friday that's there's nothing to the Russia story. I said on the weekend there was nothing to the Russia story.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, Anthony came in to see me before it all began. And he said, I want to back you for president. This was before the June 16th day. I said, Anthony, I'm not really sure that I'm running. I'm not sure. I may, but I'm not sure. He said, you got to run, you got to run. I want to endorse you. I said, but I'm not sure. This was a few months earlier than when I ran. And he was leaving and he was disappointed. I say, Anthony, what are you going to do? He goes, I got to back somebody, because that's the way he is. That's his personality. And he went to a very good guy named Walker.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Then I came after the hedge fund business. So he wasn't in love with me for a short period of time. And he backed Bush. And that was OK. But his first choice was Trump. I think it's important to say that because, you know. [Break in Transcript]
<WSJ Reporter> <Positive> Just on Sessions, just one thing. Would you like to see him step aside? Would you like to see him resign? Would it be in the country's best interest just --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm just very disappointed in him. I'm disappointed in, you know, a number of categories. I told you, the leakers. He should have -- he should be after them. So many people say to me: Why are they going after you on nothing and they leave Hillary Clinton alone on, you know, really major things? And it is -- so I'm disappointed in him. And don't forget, when they say he endorsed me, I went to Alabama. I had 40,000 people, you may have been there, remember, in Mobile?
<WSJ Reporter> <Negative> I remember.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I had 40,000 people. He was the senator from Alabama. I won the state by a lot, massive numbers. A lot of the states I won by massive numbers. But he was a senator. He looks at 40,000 people and he probably says, what do I have to lose, and he endorsed me. So it's not like a great, loyal thing about the endorsement. But I'm very disappointed in Jeff Sessions.
<WSJ Reporter> <Negative> Are you willing for the status quo to continue, though? At what point do you say enough?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm just looking at it. I'll just see.
<WSJ Reporter> <Neutral> What about Bob Mueller?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a very important, very important thing.
<WSJ Reporter> <Positive> I mean, but, Bob Mueller is also really the one leading this investigation. It's his job to see --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're going to see.
<WSJ Reporter> <Neutral> And he's investigating Russia -- your Russian connection --
<WSJ Reporter> <Positive> He's the Russian guy. So Sessions has recused himself, but is Bob Mueller's job safe? There is speculation --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, we're going to see. I mean, I have no comment yet, because it's too early. But we'll see. We're going to see. Here's the good news: I was never involved with Russia. There was nobody in the campaign. I've got 200 people that will say that they've never seen anybody on the campaign. Here's another -- he was involved early. There's nobody on the campaign that saw anybody from Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We had nothing to do with Russia. They lost an election and they came up with this as an excuse. And the only ones that are laughing are the Democrats and the Russians. They're the only ones that are laughing. And if Jeff Sessions didn't recuse himself, we wouldn't even be talking about this subject. [Break in Transcript]
<WSJ Reporter> <Negative> You also -- you brought in Anthony [Scaramucci], obviously. Are you planning other changes -- are you planning other changes in the White House? After you brought in Anthony, are you planning other changes?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, we'll see. We'll see. I do say this, I believe we've done more than just about any president of the United States in six months. And I was going to tell you before, so a lot of times I'll turn on television or I'll read in The Wall Street Journal, right --
<WSJ Reporter> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- what's Trump doing? He hasn't produced health care. I'm not even six months yet, right? So these guys went eight years -- Hillary Clinton, eight years, got nothing. Obama went a year and a half, almost two years, and they had to sell their soul.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They had to give away the state of Nebraska in order to buy that vote. And that was two years. I'm six months. They got to give me a little break, OK? And today we're having a big vote, and we'll see what happens. But today's vote is big, because once you get in -- once you're allowed to talk a lot of --
<WSJ Reporter> <Neutral> But we can't expect any more staff changes in the immediate -- in the immediate future?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think so.
<WSJ Reporter> <Negative> No?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I'm very happy with Anthony. I think Anthony is going to do amazing. [Break in Transcript]
<WSJ Reporter> <Neutral> Would you consider pardons, Mr. President, given the investigation is --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what? I don't even think of pardons. Here's why, nobody did anything wrong.
