<John Dickerson> <Positive> Good morning. And welcome to Face the Nation. I'm John Dickerson.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Donald Trump joins us by phone from New York.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> Mr. Trump, I want to start with the immigration plan you put forward this week. It got a lot of coverage, a lot of conversation from your rivals.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The biggest criticism of that plan is that it will be so expensive. It's not just the wall, which you say you want Mexico to pay for. But it's also the job of deporting 11 to 12 million people. How are you going to pay for the whole thing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, John, right now, we're spending $130 billion a year. And that's a very low number by comparison to what it really is.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're having tremendous trouble. You know, when you look at Ferguson and you look at Saint Louis, like the other night, and you look at, let's say, Baltimore and Chicago, the gangs, you know, many of these gang members are illegal and they're tough dudes. They will be out of there so fast, your head will spin.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Those numbers aren't calculated in the $130 billion. We're a nation of laws. We have to do what we have to do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, actually, it will be a lot less expensive to do it properly. And you know the good people are going to be expedited to come back. But you have to do this, John.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We are nation based on laws. And we're based on borders.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We don't have a border. We don't have laws. People are walking in past these really fantastic Border Patrol.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have Border Patrol people that are fantastic. They can do their job. But they are told not to.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And people are walking into the country right past these people and they're told to stand back. It's absolutely disgraceful.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> I want to ask you. You say the good people will be expedited. Who are the good people?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the people that have done a good job, they have been here a long time, they have worked hard, they have recommendations from people. And we're going to get wonderful people coming back into this country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm not only talking about from that standpoint. And, you know, we're building a wall. And it's going to be a great wall.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK? And, by the way, Mexico will pay for it. It's going to be a great wall, because I do -- I know how to build. And it's not going to cost nearly as much as what they are saying for a crummy wall, but this will be a wall with a very big, very beautiful door, because we want the legals to come back into the country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We also want people of talent to come into the country. We want people to go to our colleges. You to go Harvard, you go to Wharton, you go to Stanford, and you are immediately thrown out as soon as you're finished getting a degree.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You can be number one in your class at Princeton and be thrown out of the country, and you have -- you're forced to go to work in China, where you want -- and you want to be in this -- you want to be in our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will have that changed and changed quickly. We want people of talent.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Let me ask you about the good people. So, they're here now, undocumented now. They will leave the country, and then you would have them come back through that beautiful door.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> Isn't that rewarding people who jumped the line in the first place?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you could say that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we have lot of good people that have been here. They have done a good job. It's a tough situation, but they have lived here sometimes for 10, 15, 20 years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, in some cases, they haven't been good people and there have been problems.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we know -- now, I will say this. Our country doesn't even know how many people we have in it. We have no idea how many illegals are here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have heard the number for five years and longer of 11 -- 11 million people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Every once in a while, you will hear 30. We have no idea, John. They're coming in.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're pouring in. We have no idea how many people are here. But we have to get them back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have to get them back where they came from. And the good ones, we will expedite. We will work on it and we will expedite.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know what it's called? It's called management. Right now, we have political hacks running the system. We have people that have no clue how to manage things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> With good management, we can do this very, very well.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Let me ask you a question about your campaign. You have made -- you have talked about how no one owns you, you're paying for it yourself.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> If you got into the general election, where Democrats are maybe going to spend upwards of a billion dollars, are you going to foot the bill for that, too?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think what would happen is people -- I don't want lobbyists.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, I know people that want something. I have been doing this all my life. I have been a very big contributor to many, many people of all size for many, many years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want lobbyists. I don't want special interests, but certainly people -- we have lot of money coming in.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A woman sends in $7.23 the other day. It was cute. She writes this beautiful little letter.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's what she had. But we have lot of small contributors. I would even take big contributors, as long as they don't expect anything, because the only people that can expect something from me is going to be the people that want to see our country be great again.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Those are the only people. So, certainly, I would take -- I actually like the idea of investing in a campaign, but it has to be no strings attached. I don't want any strings attached.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, these lobbyists come in. I turned down $5 million last week from a very important lobbyist, because there are total strings attached to a thing like that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's going to come to me in a year or two years and he's going to want something for a country that he represents or for a company that he represents. That's the kind of money I won't take.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> Let me ask you about a constituency that may have -- be interested in you.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> You told Time magazine -- you said
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Would you change that? And how would you do it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would change it. They're paying nothing. And it's ridiculous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to save the middle class. You know, the middle class -- the hedge fund guys didn't build this country. These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, by the way, when the market collapses, like it is now, the market is going down, they're losing a fortune.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Half of them, look, they're energetic, they're very smart, but a lot of them, it's like they're paper pushers. They make a fortune, they pay no tax. It's ridiculous, OK? This -- and some of them are friends of mine.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Some of them, I couldn't care less about. It's the wrong thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The hedge fund guys are getting away with murder. They're making a tremendous amount of money. They have to pay taxes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to lower the rates for the middle class. The middle class is the one, they're getting absolutely destroyed. This country doesn't have -- won't have a middle class very soon.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> I want to ask you about this question about your conservatism. There's been some people who wondered what you are. And Jeb Bush has basically spent the week saying you're not a conservative.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, prove him wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, you could say that about Ronald Reagan, because Ronald Reagan was a Democrat with a very, very liberal lean. And he actually became Republican who was fairly conservative. I wouldn't say he was the most conservative, but fairly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he talked about he evolved as he got older. And I have also. And don't forget, I -- when you label me -- I was never a politician.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, it never really mattered what people called me. It didn't make any difference. Also, I was in Manhattan, where everybody is Democrat.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you get the Democratic nomination for city council or anything, that means you won the election, even though the election hasn't taken place. It was like automatic.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So, I was from an area that was all Democrat. And, frankly, over the years, I have -- and especially as I have gotten more and more involved, I have evolved. And I have taken positions that are different than the past.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I feel strongly about them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I have also taken the position of common sense. When I look at what's happening to our country, our country is going down. We're going down, John.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm going to make this country great again. I'm going to do the right thing for the country.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> All right.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> Well, we will look forward to catching up with you out on the campaign trail.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> Mr. Trump, thanks so much for joining us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, John.
<Kevin Phillips> <Neutral> Donald Trump joins me now live from Chicago.
<Kevin Phillips> <Positive> Donald, good to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nice to see you.
<Kevin Phillips> <Positive> Well, let me ask you first about Barack Obama. Is it true at one point you would have thrown your support behind him? I was hearing possibly if he would have picked Hillary Clinton, you would have been right there with him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm a big fan of Hillary's. She's a terrific woman, s he's a friend of mine. I think she was treated very poorly, and I think it's hurt Barack Obama quite badly. But she is a terrific woman.
<Kevin Phillips> <Positive> Well, let's talk about the situation that we are in right now. I mean, who better to talk to than you, who has obviously done very well with money.
<Kevin Phillips> <Negative> Who do we blame for this mess?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it all starts with our president, wouldn't you say? I mean, he certainly has not done an outstanding job, he will never go down as one of our outstanding presidents, and it has to all start with George Bush.
<Kevin Phillips> <Negative> There is a lot of concern though that John McCain is another George Bush. Why do you disagree with that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think so at all. I know John McCain very well. He is not another George Bush. He's very different than George Bush, and I really think he will be a great president.
<Kevin Phillips> <Positive> I think he's going to do a really good job. He is a tough guy, he's a smart guy, he's a very, very bright guy. He is a very, very -- he's just a quality human being. I think he will be a great president.
<Kevin Phillips> <Negative> So what is it about him that makes him different from George Bush, Donald, with regard to economic plans, regard to fiscal policy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think more than anything else, it is the man's solidity. People respect him when they see him. I don't think they respect George Bush, but they respect John McCain. When they see him, they respect him. He is a man worthy of respect. And this country no longer has respect. What we need more than anything else is just that word, respect.
<Kevin Phillips> <Positive> All right. Let's talk about the issue of the economy right now.
<Kevin Phillips> <Negative> Warren Buffett coming forward, saying, hey, I believe in Goldman Sachs; therefore, I'm going to sink $5 billion into the now-tarnished investment bank, and possibly sink in another $5 billion more. Would you consider doing anything like that with your money?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I do it in the form of real estate. I'm buying a lot of real estate right now, and that's my business, that's what I love, that's what I know the best. And I'm buying a lot of real estate, and I'm buying it, frankly, at very good prices. This is a great time for people to go out and buy real estate, better than maybe any time in the last 30 years.
<Kevin Phillips> <Negative> Now, I've looked at some of your properties before. It ain't cheap, my friend. So when you look at the average American who is desperately trying to keep afloat and to afford a mortgage, yes, you are building real estate, but it's for those that can afford it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But this is a great time. When you say the average American, this is a great time. You go to the bank, they have thousands and thousands of houses each bank. Pick the one you like and make a deal. They will finance it for you, they'll do everything for you. They want you to take it off of their hands.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is an unbelievable time for people to buy real estate. It's a great time for people to go out the buy a house. I just bought something, a big club in Colts Neck, New Jersey. It cost $109 million to build it, and I bought it for a fraction of that. Colts Neck, New Jersey, is one of the best locations in the country. There are so many great opportunities right now. Go out and buy real estate and make a good, tough deal.
<Kevin Phillips> <Positive> Donald, the average person can't even fill up a tank of gas right now, and you're talking about getting a good deal on a cool $109 million.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. What I'm saying is, you go to the bank. You want a house, you go to the bank, you make a deal with the bank. You buy a house and you pay some interest on the loan. They'll give you the money. They've already put the money in, so they don't have to create a new loan. This is a great time for somebody to go out and buy a really nice house.
<Kevin Phillips> <Positive> Are you saying that we can trust banks right now? There are lenders we can trust that if you are making, say, $45,000 a year, you could go ahead and buy a house at this point?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have some great banks and some great bankers. I know many of them. I also know some very bad bankers, to be honest with you. But we really do have some great institutions, and what really this country should be doing liquefying. They should make those institutions liquid. In other words, give them -- get money into those banks so they can loan money to people to go out to do deals, to buy houses, to build buildings, to do office buildings, and get the country back on track. Right now the banks are out of business.
<Kevin Phillips> <Positive> All right. Let me ask you this question, because you obviously know these institutions and know money very well.
<Kevin Phillips> <Negative> The bottom line is there was a lack of oversight, and a lot of people were allowed to do a lot of things that were fraudulent and corrupt. And a lot of it, you know, hard-working people are suffering for it now, Donald.
<Kevin Phillips> <Negative> You know, should these regulators be held accountable for what they didn't do, and is it easy to cheat the system?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't say the regulators. I think you had some very bad people and you had some very greedy people. And as I said before, you had some very bad bankers. But you also have great bankers. You have people that really love the country and they do a good, fair, honest job, and really -- and they're good at it.
<Kevin Phillips> <Neutral> Well, where are they when we are in the tank right now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, part of the reason you are in the tank is because of the bad ones. They had some very bad people. And hopefully they are under investigation right now, they'll be and they will be put into the clinker, because there were some bad dudes out there.
<Kevin Phillips> <Neutral> Donald Trump , live from Chicago.
<Kevin Phillips> <Positive> Good to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
