<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> Now to the race for the White House in 2012. The new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows a surprising surge for one potential Republican candidate, and it is a name that you will recognize. Donald Trump is in a tie for second with Mike Huckabee among likely voters in a Republican primary; Mitt Romney leads.
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> But among Republicans who consider themselves tea party supporters, Trump is the number one choice. On Wednesday we sat down with him for an exclusive interview, and I began by asking Trump about his potential run.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, this is very serious. I admit I always take things seriously, but I've never taken it seriously like this. This is a very serious time in my life. I hate what's happening to the country. I wish I didn't have to do it. I wish this country was running so great, and I wish Obama was the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln and I wish this was the greatest place in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What we're doing is unbelievable. If you look at what's going on, where our jobs are disappearing to foreign countries, where the oil -- you're going to be paying seven or $8 dollars a gallon for your oil very soon.
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> But do you blame this all on Barack Obama?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I blame a lot of it. It's been a terrible presidency. Look at Libya. We go in, we don't want to really remove Gadhafi, but we're going to go fight and we're going to this, and now nobody knows what's happening. And it looks like Gadhafi is going to beat the United States?
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> Would you as president say 'let's get more aggressive? Let's put boots on the ground if we have to?'
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm only interested in Libya if we keep the oil. If we don't keep the oil, I'm not interested. I don't know who the rebels are. You know, they make the rebels like it's some romantic, beautiful novel, the rebels. I here the rebels are al-Qaeda, I hear they're Iran-backed and Iran-influenced. Where were they getting those weapons before we came along?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> From Iran. Gadhafi's going to go around saying he won the war against this country. When you ask me what I'd do, I'm only interested in Libya if we get the oil.
<Meredith Vieira> <Positive> All right, so everybody wonders what the Obama doctrine is, asking a question. What...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He doesn't have a doctrine. He doesn't have a doctrine.
<Meredith Vieira> <Neutral> Would you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Do you truly believe...
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> What's your doctrine? What would your doctrine be?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> About what? With respect to what?
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> Foreign affairs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Foreign affairs is we take care of ourselves first, OK? We don't build schools in Afghanistan. We go to Afghanistan, we build a road, we build a school. Two days later they blow up the road, they blow up the school, we start building the road and the school again. In the meantime we can't build schools in Alabama, in New Orleans, in Texas, in New York, my place where we're always fighting to try and get school money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're spending trillions and trillions of dollars. My thing and my doctrine would be build, build, build.
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> Some positive news for you this new poll, NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll that shows you surging to second place among potential GOP candidates for 2012. Why do you think that you are connecting with voters?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that I connect with people because I happen to be smart, I happen to have a lot of common sense, I happen to know what I'm doing, I built a great company. And, by the way, if I run, I look so forward to filing a declaration because it's a great company. I built a great company. And I'll make that decision sometime prior to June.
<Meredith Vieira> <Positive> What are you waiting for? What are you waiting for?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I think I was -- well, I hate to say it. I have the number one show on NBC. [Clip from The Apprentice]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Is that the correct statement? I mean, "The Apprentice" is doing great, "The Celebrity Apprentice." And I am not allowed to run...
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> What does that have to do with...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it has a lot to do. It sounds so trivial and I hate to even bring it up, but I'm not allowed to run during the show. You know, you're not allowed to have a show on and be a declared candidate. It's a great show and it's got phenomenal ratings and until that show is over I can't declare because otherwise NBC would have to take the show off the air and I think that would be very unfair to NBC.
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> Recently you spent a lot of time talking about President Obama's birth certificate, or lack thereof. You don't seem convinced that he has one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm not convinced that he has one. I've had very smart people say, 'Donald, stay on the China issue, stay on the Saudi Arabia issue, stay on the India taking our jobs and the Mexico, which is NAFTA, which cleaned out New England.
<Meredith Vieira> <Positive> Get off the birth certificate issue.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Get off the birth certificate issue.
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> Why don't you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because you know what? Three weeks ago when I started I thought he was probably born in this country, and now I really have a much bigger doubt than I did before.
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> But based on what?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know what? His grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya and she was there and witnessed the birth, OK? He doesn't have a birth certificate or he hasn't shown it. He has what's called certificate of live birth. That is something that's easy to get. When you want a birth certificate it's very hard to get.
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> But it's considered...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me, excuse me.
<Meredith Vieira> <Positive> ...the equivalent and in...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's not the equivalent.
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> No, wait, in the state of Hawaii they said they have seen this...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Meredith, it's not the equivalent.
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> ...document, it is evidence that he was born in the United States. That's good enough for them. Scholars have looked at...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A birth certificate is not even close. A certificate of live birth is not even signed by anybody. I saw his. I read it very carefully. It doesn't have a serial number, it doesn't have a signature. There's not even a signature.
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> Do you believe he's lying?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm starting to think that he was not born here.
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> Do you believe he's lying?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He spent -- listen, Meredith...
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> Donald, come on, just answer.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Meredith, he spent $2 million in legal fees trying on to get away from this issue, and if he weren't lying why wouldn't he just solve it? And I wish he would because if he doesn't it's one of the greatest scams in the history of politics and in the history, period. You are not allowed to be a president if you're not born in this country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He may not have been born in this country, and I'll tell you what. Three weeks ago I thought he was born in this country. Right now I have some real doubts. I have people that actually have been studying it and they cannot believe what they're finding.
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> You have people now down there searching -- I mean...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Absolutely.
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> I mean in Hawaii.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely. And they cannot believe what they're finding. I would like to have him show his birth certificate. And can I be honest with you? I hope he can. Because if he can't -- if he can't and if he wasn't born in this country, which is a real possibility -- I'm not saying it happened, I'm saying it's a real possibility, much greater than I thought two or three weeks ago -- then he has pulled one of the great cons in the history of politics.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And beyond politics.
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> Do you consider yourself a tea partier?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so. I'm very proud...
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> Yeah?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...I'm very proud of some of the ideas they put forth. And the big idea is they want to stop this ridiculous, absolutely killer of spending that's going on. What's going on in this country, the way we're spending money like drunken sailors, we are just absolutely going -- and ultimately we're going to destroy our own freedom.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You can't do it.
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> But they want to stop it even at the cost of shutting down the government.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, excuse me...
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> That's a possibility.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me...
<Meredith Vieira> <Positive> Are you in favor of that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...excuse me. It's really shutting down the government, it's cutting costs. The kind of money that you're talking about is peanuts. And I think the tea party has done an amazing service for this country because people now, even very liberal Democrats, are starting to think for the first time, well, maybe we can't just keep giving everything away.
<Meredith Vieira> <Positive> But if there were...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I think they've performed a great service.
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> So if there were a partial shutdown of the government come Friday, that would be OK with you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In my opinion -- you know, I hear the Democrats are going to be blamed and the Republicans are going to be blamed. I actually think the president would be blamed. If there is a shutdown, and it's not going to be a horrible shutdown because, as you know, things will sort of keep going.
<Meredith Vieira> <Positive> Well, it's a partial shutdown, right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But if there is a shutdown I think it would be a tremendously negative mark on the president of the United States. He's the one that has to get people together.
<Meredith Vieira> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm a deal man. I've made hundreds and hundreds of deals and transactions. He never did deals before. How can you expect a man that's not a deal man that never did a deal, other than frankly becoming president of the United States, he never did a deal, how's he going to corral all these people to get them to do a deal?
<Meredith Vieira> <Positive> So how would you do it now? Now you're in the Oval office right now, it's Wednesday.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would get everybody together and we'd have a budget and it would get done.
<Meredith Vieira> <Neutral> They've all gotten together.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that's because they don't have the right leader. You don't have the right leader. This is the president of the United States has to get this done, and I think he probably will. Now, I don't say "he." But I think he and the group probably will get it done, but it's pretty sad because the whole world is looking at us and laughing at us.
<Meredith Vieira> <Positive> You've criticized Obama quite a bit in this interview and in the past. What do you think he has done well?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Get elected. I think he did a great job when he ran for office.
<Meredith Vieira> <Neutral> That's it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think Obamacare is a total disaster. I think the thing that he did best...
<Meredith Vieira> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...best of all is get elected. He got elected. He ran an unbelievable campaign. I want him to do well. If I had my choice of having Obama do great as a president and do a really great job for this country and not running as opposed to running and doing -- I'd prefer that he did a great job. I love this country but this country is going to hell.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would run a great, great country. This country will be great again. It is not great right now. We have huge deficits, we have huge unemployment, we have a huge problem, and we're not respected. We're not respected in the world. The world laughs at us. They won't be laughing if I'm president.
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> Back now at 8:35 with more of our exclusive interview with Donald Trump. During our conversation we talked about his possible run for the presidency, and I asked him if he thinks Americans would take him seriously as a candidate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My father would have never believed I turn out to be a big television star. He wouldn't ever have believed it. I was always a good builder.
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> But, you know, there are people -- wait a minute, there are people who'd look and then go the other -- they'd say, you know, 'The guy, he has a reality show.' I mean...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not a reality show.
<Meredith Vieira> <Neutral> ...is this the keep of person that's presidential?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. Not a reality show, a huge successful reality show.
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> Still a reality show. And these are people who would say -- they look at Donald Trump, they think -- well, they don't think George Washington, for example. They think this is the guy who has the reality show, says "you're fired" every week. This is the guy who had the infamous cat feist -- cat fight with Rosie O'Donnell, sort of a self-promoting...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That she started and that I finished.
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> ...pompous.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, she started and I finished. And she wished she didn't start it, believe me.
<Meredith Vieira> <Neutral> What makes you presidential?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And what I -- I've made a tremendous success. I put hundreds of thousands of people to work. I have built a great company, which if and when I file you will see my numbers are phenomenal. Great cash, great company.
<Meredith Vieira> <Neutral> People wonder about your numbers, actually.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great values. Well, they're going to see. Because if I file -- and one of the reasons I'd frankly like to file is I wouldn't mind showing people it's a great company. Tremendous cash, very little debt, very big values, tremendous values. I've built a great company. And...
<Meredith Vieira> <Positive> Does that translate into building a great country?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I think so, I think so. Look, I am different than a lot of people. One of the things I do is I love this country. I hate what's happening to this country. This country is in serious, serious trouble. We're the whipping post for nations all over the world.
<Meredith Vieira> <Neutral> Is your goal to be president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I would rather not be in a position where -- I wish I had -- I wish we had you, myself, everybody, somebody who was great. We don't. We don't have somebody that's great. And I don't think he ever will be great. And by the way, when he was first elected, I said, 'I hope he's going to be the greatest president we've ever had.' I know this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will be better than anybody. I will do the best job. If I decide to run, I will do the best job. I will be best for this country. And you may say, 'Oh gee, that doesn't sound like George Washington.' Well, guess what? Before George Washington ran, he didn't sound like George Washington either. I will be and do a great job if I run and if I win.
