<Howard Stern> <Negative> Fred might raise his daughter to come up and blow your ass up. Donald Trump, you're on the air.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Howard?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hey, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Howard, we have to have the new fight.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now you're talking.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, people are driving me crazy. Please call Howard. Please call Tom.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Here's what we got.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That last fight was a great success.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Not only was it a great success but we are so ready for this. I want to do a quick,Nicole Bass and Joey Buttafuoco. Nicole Bass, I think, could kick Joey's ass.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> She's in amazing shape.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's pretty tough looking, I'll tell you.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But Joey said, there's no way.
<John Melendez> <Negative> Here's the deal. Forget that Nicole's a woman for a second. Look at him side by side. You will remember --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is Nicole doughy?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No.
<John Melendez> <Negative> Cap, remember this, Crazy Cabbie looked 50 times more intimidating than Stuttering John and John beat his ass
<John Melendez> <Neutral> No. But what I'm saying is -- Yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> And you thought China would do a lot better against Joey than she did.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Joey's is a tough guy. You know you look at Joey I mean, he's a pretty tough guy. I'd still say Joey would win but --
<John Melendez> <Neutral> What would you think of his boxing skills?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What happens, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he's just a rough guy. I mean, I think that Joey would probably win but you know she's pretty scary. Would you date her, Howard?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I think she's tough. Tough on the eyes. Let me ask you something. What happens if in the middle of the fight, Amy Fisher rushes in and shoots Nicole in the face?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> That's not fair. That'sâ€¦
<John Melendez> <Negative> No shooting below the belt.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well first of all, John was unbelievable, how he did that. I saw him the night before. He was just so ready and he was unbelievable. But you know the job John did, I don't know if he's gotten enough credit, was just amazing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It was.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the fight was amazing. And I hope you like the Taj.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, please. Never mind the compliments to John. What you did with the KublaCon suite and the various fun things that we did. Melania on the helicopter alone was worth the trip.
<John Melendez> <Neutral> Boy. Oh, boy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We did a lot of fun. It was great. The Taj --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She had some little white pants off it on.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, really?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know the folks out there drives me nuts, Howard. They're saying that might be another fight you have to get it, Mr. Trump. You have to get this. This is why I'm calling. Can you believe this?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now, you're going to get it, you're going to get it. But you're gotta talk to tom, let's see if this works out.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Everybody calls you Mr. Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They call me Mr. Trump except Howard. Howard doesn't call me mister.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> If you have a billion dollars you're automatically Mr. Trump.
<John Melendez> <Neutral> Hey, call me Mr. Trump.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Mr. Trump's life is so incredible, I had no idea. Like, we were sitting there waiting in his personal $9 billion helicopter because he was coming back from the Miss Universe pageant. And he took his private jet into New York to get on the helicopter to come to Atlantic City.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> So, he privately jetted to New York to get on the private helicopter to go to Atlantic.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> How did you like Miss Universe, by the way?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, she beautiful.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Isn't she beautiful?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And by the way, did you know she doesn't do anal?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I heard the show at the show actually. I couldn't believe the show.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> She spends a lot of time with you, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no. I heard the show. I'll tell you what, she's really beautiful and, you know, they beat NBA that night with the highest rating of the evening.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She says you're her mentor.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well that's very good news to me. I tell you what. Honestly, I mean, as you know in person, she's even more beautiful, I mean, she's unbelievable.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Did she want to have sex with me after the interview.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so, she was very attracted to you, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She says --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank goodness. May -- maybe the interpreter cleaned some of the questions up.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> She said she has to share an apartment with Miss -- Miss Teen USA and Miss USA.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Miss Teen USA.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You got them all holed up in one apartment.
<John Melendez> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't what you did on the show, but everyone thinks it's my apartment, and it is. It's one of my thousands. I mean, you know, they all think it's my personal apartment that they're all sharing. So, I got more calls on that one.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He's got some life. What have we done already today? Like, where are you now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, now I'm in the office. I'm working.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What are you doing? Why work so hard?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because of your show I'm getting phone calls from all my executives in Atlantic City. The Taj Mahal finished number one again, as you can see why.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thanks, Taj.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because it's the best and it finished number one. They're all excited about that. And now they're more excited about getting the new flight down to Atlantic City.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Where is Melania?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Melania is upstairs sleeping.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What does she shower.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What? You're making an appointment to be there?
<John Melendez> <Neutral> Did she call us from the shower.
<John Melendez> <Neutral> Did you have sex this morning?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Was that John?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> John, after I did that nice -- They have to admit that nice. Do they know you're gonna do this to me?
<John Melendez> <Negative> No. I'm just -- She's hot.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's a very very high quality.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Let me ask you a real serious question. How much money have you made today, so far?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it depends on what the value of real estate is. Although there's a great story today in The Times about the values of real estate and apartments and everything. I don't know if you saw it on the home section of The Times.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No. But you know, I mean, John did ask me --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Saw it. I read -- best I read the post.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] has gone up in value a lot, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right. But John -- Donald, John asked me yesterday if he should invest in real estate in New York City since September 11.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why do you say so, yes?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, real estate has been, you know,
<John Melendez> <Positive> Well, here's the question, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> For one thing, Howard, for one thing interest rates are so great. And you know condominiums have gone up like 50, 60, 70% since September 11. And the stock market's gone down by like a --
<John Melendez> <Negative> Yeah. But, Howard, [Inaudible] a terrorist is what I'm saying.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know what, John, it's very interesting, what's happened in New York is amazing. I mean, the the purchase of real estate has gone through the roof. All forms of real estate. People want to be New York.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know, it's the greatest time.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> John's very worried.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You got to be worried. But you know, John, if you would've bought after September 11, you probably would have made over 100% almost.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is that really true?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah. It's gone up. It's gone through the roof. Especially the purchase. Now, the rentals are about flat. The office market is somewhat flat, the hotel market's not great but the purchase of -- I'm starting a new building on 50 19th Park.
<John Melendez> <Positive> You want to sell me apartment?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want to sell Howard an apartment but I want to sell you one on the west side, John.
<John Melendez> <Neutral> All right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Nice.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you know, Howard, I'm starting a new building on 50 19th Park and people are going crazy.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Even the terrorists themselves want to buy apartment here.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> They're trying to get in.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Because they want to blow up the building.
<John Melendez> <Positive> I'd like to live in the Trump Tower. Mr. Trump, We would like to buy three apartment. Three apartment because --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, we have really amazing --
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You're not helping Donald.
<John Melendez> <Positive> Republicans with publican. [Inaudible] I'd like a gym in my room please.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> By the way, Mr. Trump, no furniture necessary in the apartment. I want a butler to pleasure me. Hey, you know, when I was in the KublaCon suite, Mr. Trump provided a butler, I was talking about this issue on the air, I didn't know what to do with the butler. I'm so --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What did you do with the butler?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm so low-class that like the butler stand there waiting for me to order him around, and I didn't know what to do with --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And you don't know how.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And the guy wouldn't leave, and you know --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Was he good, Howard?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Was terrific.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What did you tell the butler to do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you're like me. I don't like that either. Robin, I'd rather be in a 300 ft. hotel room with a television. You know, I don't need the big suite thing.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes, I agree.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They are amazing suite.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What did you have the butler do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He stands there and does whatever you want. You know some people insist on a butler, they have him go down and get tickets, go down and do this, go down do that, do everything. R
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Will they unpack for you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They'll do everything.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Will they wipe you?
<John Melendez> <Neutral> Wipe my butt, butler. I need that butt wiped from my butler.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm a -- I'm a high ruler.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> The terrorist want the butler.
<John Melendez> <Neutral> I'm going to beg that barker on red.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Did you like the suite, Howard?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, man. I loved it. I tell you, you built a beautiful place.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, we need to go back down there. Seriously, we have to get -- You know get some other fight going. You know another thing you might do. First of all, I'd love -- And was talking to Tom about this, and maybe it affects the radio a little bit. But, if you did that fight at night, you know, we could've sold according to the authorities down there, and Jerry Gormley, as you know did a great job, the head of the boxing commission. But according to those guys we could sell 35,000 seats.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Wow.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Oh, I believe it. That was the most -- Was that not fun, or what?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Atlantic City is an easy sell. You know when entertainers go to other cities and they die and then they come to Atlantic City and you can't get a ticket, it's truly an easy sell.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And especially when it comes to you and your events. But you know we might very well use the convention hall the next night do 15-16,000 seats and do something really amazing because --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, I actually have a pretty good undercard for this one too but -- All right, I'm going to talk to you about this. I'm hoping we come back down to see you unless time screws things up.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Tom is terrific and I hope we can do it. And you just take care of yourself.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right. You're your real gentleman. Thank you. That's Donald Trump who obviously is very successful.
<John Melendez> <Neutral> He's got the life, man.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Ah, you don't know. I saw it firsthand.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> At least he works. Some of these guys don't even work.
<John Melendez> <Neutral> He didn't inherit it all.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He's not some like Saudi prince who just -- you know.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> So, I don't resent him as much.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. I mean, he worked for it.
<John Melendez> <Positive> Well, did he took --
<John Melendez> <Positive> Well, did Howard Stern took --
