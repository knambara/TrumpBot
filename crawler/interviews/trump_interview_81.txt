<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nice to talk to you, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> All right, Donald, I know that Miss California, Miss Carrie Prejean, her future, whether she keeps the crown or not, are all in your hands tonight.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's actually true, and we're having a news conference tomorrow at 11:00 o'clock at Trump Tower, and Carrie will be there. And we're reviewing lots of things tonight and we're reviewing lots of things tomorrow morning, but we'll be having a news conference to announce certain things tomorrow.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> All right, so I know you're not going to tell us exactly what's going to happen tomorrow at 11:00, but let me ask you a couple quick questions. Have you made your decision already?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Probably so.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What's your criteria? What are you weighing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, first of all, I always like to give the benefit of the doubt to somebody. And I did that with Tara Connor, and she's really made me very proud because she's come through beautifully, at least so far. I mean, she was really suffering from major addictions, and she's really done a great job and we're all proud of her.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And so that was a great thing. And most people didn't think I should do that. I took a lot of heat for doing it. So I was very happy with it. This is a very different case. And we'll see what happens. But we are determining tonight, certain things have already been determined, and you know, hopefully, you'll be at the news conference.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Well, here's what I don't understand, is that -- and -- is I don't -- what could be the possible disqualifier, that someone didn't like her answer at a pageant? That couldn't possibly be it, the substance of it. And she -- an she won. They voted for her. Or it's possible these pictures, and then you look at the pictures from Miss Rhode Island -- and so I mean, what could possibly be the disqualifier?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, there are a couple of disqualifiers, Greta, but I can't really talk about it now because we're going over that late tonight.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> What does she say? Does she have an opportunity to make her case with you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She will tomorrow morning. She's actually coming in tomorrow morning prior to the news conference.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> Are you surprised at how much attention this has gotten?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's amazing, what happened. And I will tell you this. The reason it's gotten this tremendous attention is because she's a great beauty. If she were a good-looking person, if she were an average-looking person or if she were a poor-looking person -- frankly, this is an issue that's discussed every day by millions of people and nobody talks about it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Which...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, because of her great beauty...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> ... issue, the gay marriage issue or the pictures?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Greta, because of her...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> The pictures or gay marriage?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think -- I'm talking about the issue relating to the question, the famous question about, Should a man be able to marry a man versus a woman or a woman with a man? So it's a very interesting question. It's a very complex question. It's a tough question, certainly, for a beauty pageant, but it shows how relevant these pageants really are.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, for years, they were saying, Oh, are they relevant? Well, they got good ratings on television, but people would say, Are they relevant? Well, the fact is, if you look at what happened initially to Tara with alcohol and drug addiction, that's a very relevant subject. If you look at what is happening now with the whole question of gay marriage, that's a very relevant situation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So the beauty pageants are bringing things into focus very clearly.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> But it may be a relevant question, something that -- you know, that many states are -- are debating. Some of them made decisions. But when I judged a different pageant, the Miss America pageant, when I judged the answer, it wasn't whether I agreed with the person, the woman who was answering the question.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> I looked at it more to see whether she had thought it out and had reached her opinion on whatever issue it was with -- you know, with -- with -- you know, thinking it through, and with some -- you know, some fact and had given it consideration and could deliver it well. So is it substance on this that she's being questioned about?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, let me just state that the Miss America pageant, which you mentioned -- and it's too bad you were on there because it's sort of wasting time -- the Miss America pageant is off the air. The Miss America pageant has -- you know, that was a big pageant and that one essentially ceases to exist in any very strong form because, as you know, it's on cable now, barely, and it's no longer on network television.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Miss USA and the Miss Universe are on network television and Miss Universe is broadcast all over the world. Now, those are the two that I own. But Miss America has gone down very, very, very substantially from its glory days, and maybe it's because it is not relevant enough or it doesn't ask relevant enough questions, Greta.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, we could ask very simple questions, like, Did you have a good lunch today? And people would probably not find it very interesting. We're asking very tough questions. This was a tough question. But if you look at the other questions that were asked of the other contestants, they were also very tough questions.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, tomorrow...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But there's a big difference because the Miss America pageant is no longer essentially on network television.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, quick question. I know tomorrow is the 11:00 AM press conference. But are we going to see "The Apprentice" come back again?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, they've renewed it, as you heard. We got great ratings last night, as usual, and they're bringing it back. NBC announced about two weeks ago that they're bringing it back. It's had a great season, "Celebrity Apprentice," and we're now coming back for a ninth season of "The Apprentice."
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> Well, of course, I know it's very popular and people will be watching that, as well as 11:00 o'clock tomorrow, the big answer. Thank you, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So long, Greta.
<Pete Hegseth> <Negative> You're here in Billings. There's a big hurricane going on in Washington D.C. What is your message to the good people of Montana?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll tell you what I think the country and even the world are seeing what's going on. The level of popularity, the wor- the level of love, not only in this room, but all over the country, outside of that little swampy area -- the level of love is incredible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Our country Pete is doing better than it's ever done before. The markets are the highest. The  jobs are the best. We've cut your taxes massively. We have... So I mean, what we've done on regulation, I think it's probably really the big secret, because, frankly, it may be even more important than what we've done with taxes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Today, we have, as you know, a great future Supreme Court justice, going on, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and we just had a brilliant young fantastic justice approved, Justice Gorsuch,  that's going to save, hopefully, Your second amendment and so many other things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I mean the level of love in the country is beyond belief. Outside of that little area, but the level of hatred there is also beyond belief.
<Pete Hegseth> <Negative> Yes. Let's talk about that area  just a little bit. Folks here may have seen an anonymous column written in The New York Times. And I think that this audience would say an attack on the people that voted for you. Are you closer to knowing who did it, and what should be done if you find out who did it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well number one, The Times should never have done that, because really what they've done is, virtually, you know it's treason.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You can call it a lot of things. But to think that you have somebody in all of the cabinet, so many people, as you know, they came forward. They're writing editorials. They're all saying, you know, it's got to be at a fairly low level, because so many people today -- I was just coming out, and I see all the people that are saying such great things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have a lot of love in the administration, and the White House is truly, as you would say, a well-oiled machine. It is working so well. And, you know, we have -- I heard you say yesterday, we have thousands of people that in theory could qualify.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So they take one person out of thousands. But what's unfair -- I don't mind when they write a book, and they make lies, because it gets discredited, we  just discredited the last one, we discredited all of them because it's lies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, I'll tell you, when somebody writes and you can't discredit, because you have no idea who they are, usually you'll find out it's a background that was bad. It may not be a Republican. It may not be conservative. It may be a deep state person that's been there a long time. You don't know where. It's a very unfair thing, but it's very unfair to our country and to the millions of people that voted, really, for us. They voted for us.
<Pete Hegseth> <Negative> Another issue this crowd is often fired up about, is the wall, a commitment you've made. Washington hasn't been so good at that. There's another budget showdown coming up --  [Crowd chants Build that Wall]  Well, Congress hasn't been very good at funding that wall. You've got a budget showdown coming out this month. Will you --  would you shut down the government if wall funding is not included?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So -- So we've started the wall. We've spent now close to $3.2 billion  where -- in different parts of California. We're doing an 80-mile strip, but we are looking to get the rest of the funding.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Here's the thing. I have a lot of great Republicans. We need Republicans elected in the midterms. We have to get Republicans. And we are getting the wall done. I've had so many people -- good people, great people. They'd rather not do it before,  they'd rather do it right after the election. They don't want to do anything to upset the apple cart.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, my inclination -- if it was up to me, I'd shut down government over border security. And I guess, when you get right down to it, is -- it is up to me. But I don't want to do anything that's going to hurt us or potentially hurt us, because I have a feeling that the Republicans are going to do very well. We have the strongest economy we've ever had.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think we're going to do really well in the midterms, between the tax cuts and all of the other things we have done. So, most likely, I will not do that. But we're going to do it immediately after the election. I have that commitment from Mitch McConnell, from Paul Ryan from everybody. We do it right after the election, where, hopefully frankly it'll be easy because we'll have more Republicans not less.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're doing very well in the Senate races. And I think we're doing really very well in the House. We'll see how it comes out. It will be an exciting day, I can tell you that. Nothing will be as exciting as our day, almost two years ago. Can you imagine? It's almost..  almost three years. So, we're going to get the wall. We've already started the wall, and will -- we'll continue onward.
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> Mr. President, tonight is the first NFL game. They don't have as many viewers as they used to. [Crowd boos] From Colin Kaepernick, to the NFL, to now Nike, who's going to win this cultural showdown of standing for the anthem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We are. I don't know what the NFL is doing. Honestly, I don't know what the NFL is doing. From what I understand it's in contracts that you have to stand for the national anthem. In fact, they have somewhere, it says you will stand, you will have the helmet on the ground and the hand on the heart. That's what it says. I don't know why they're not enforcing it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And in cases where they don't have it -- you know they had a new thing, where they don't have to do that. You don't have to kneel. You can go back into the locker room. I think that's worse than kneeling in a certain way. You're going back in. That shows you just have no respect for the anthem or the flag.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't like what Nike did. I don't think it's appropriate what they did. I honor the flag. I honor our national anthem, and most of the people in this country feel the same way. They feel the same way.
<Pete Hegseth> <Negative> One more quick question, back to Washington. Rudy Giuliani just told the AP that you will not be answering any questions written or in person to the so-called special counsel. Can you confirm that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look. There was no collusion. Even in these crazy books, they don't talk about collusion. There was no collusion with Russia. I love this country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, if we get along with China where we're doing very well in trade -- you notice what's happening, you see what's going on, and with Canada, and with Mexico, and with different places. But, if we get along with China, if we get along with Russia. If we get along --  just a little while ago, a very nice statement came out from North Korea. You probably saw that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By the way, you don't read that in the papers, because when it's nice, they don't put it in. Kim Jong-un said very nice things. He said we want to get denuclearization during the Trump administration. It just came out, and I hope you heard what I said, because you don't read that in the fake news media.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You just don't. I mean, they don't want to write it. They only want to write bad when it comes to us, and it's a shame. The -- the level of unfairness and bias in the press is actually incredible. But in the meantime, we're winning folks. Be happy, because we're winning. We're winning.
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> Last question. You're here in Montana for a reason. I have -- I have a feeling you would like to get rid of one Jon Tester and replace him with somebody else. The VA is a personal passion of mine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good.
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> What -- what happened to Ronny Jackson was a shame. Is that going to be a focus of your remarks?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all, you have a new man. Matt. Do we love Matt? [Audience cheers] So Matt is -- he's, I mean they know him so well here. He's been so successful. He's running for the Senate. And frankly, what Tester did to a phenomenal man. Admiral Ronny Jackson. My doctor. He's an admiral. He's a doctor. He's like a perfect -- he's just a great person. And what they did to demean this man, and he held up because he's strong. But most people could never take it. Ronny Jackson: We love you. It should never have happened.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But what Senator Tester did, and what he said that turned out to be false, was incredible. And you see that in politics. People say things that are totally -- they're -- they're doing that with Matt. They're saying bad stuff, and they figure, hey, we'll correct it after the election's over. Let me tell you, you have a winner here. He's going to win, and he's going to give us his votes, because Tester is never going to give us a vote.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know he did a commercial. I feel -- I feel a little bit guilty, because he did a commercial today, and everyone saying it's like a love letter to President Trump. That's because I won this state by many, many points. And so, is that right? I mean, he did like, it's a love letter. I shouldn't say bad about it. The fact is we're never going to get his vote.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> On the Second Amendment, if he can get rid of it, he'll follow Schumer, he'll follow Pelosi, he'll follow Maxine Waters. And, the problem we have, as a group, he will never, ever vote for us. He didn't vote for Judge Gorsuch. Justice, now Justice Gorsuch. He didn't vote for tax cuts. He didn't vote for the things that we need.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, you need to elect our friend, and he's going to be a phenomenal Senator. You've got to vote against Tester. You got to vote -- he will never -- remember this. Remember this. I -- in a way ,I feel very guilty saying it, because I almost thought I made the commercial about me, and it was his commercial. But he'll never vote for us. And that's ultimately what's important.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So stay with Matt. Be with Matt. I think he's leading in the polls right now. Is there a poll --he's two points up. You're going to have somebody that's going to be with us. He's going to vote for us. And he's going to be a great, great Senator for your state. Great. Thank you.
