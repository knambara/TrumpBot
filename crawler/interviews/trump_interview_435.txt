<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, I'm a rich guy, you're a poor guy, just listen. The first thing you do and I have to tell you that Tom is right you ought to throw A. J. the hell out.

<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thank you, Mr. Trump. Well, now even all your enemies are coming back to get you A. J...
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> I have a gag order against Trump. I can't talk about it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Is that right? What do you mean you have a gag order?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Gag order on what?
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> I don't want to talk about it. But him and I -- him and I --

<Howard Stern> <Negative> This was last time you were on the show and you talked. He got a gag order against you?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Donald, what is a gag order?
