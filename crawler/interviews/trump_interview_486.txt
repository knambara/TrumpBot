<Don Imus> <Negative> [Inaudible]. Anyway, please welcome to the program now. You don't have to sort of... bring in my old friend Donald Trump, good morning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> How are you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm okay.
<Don Imus> <Positive> I remember I was telling Charles. I was just talking about it. Sitting there watching you make that statement and I thought that was great given that --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I see it a lot too, Don.
<Don Imus> <Positive> I mean, I see young people come to New York and they think they're going to take New York by storm, and you remember Midnight Cowboy which was probably one of the all-time classics, and Jon Voight. They come to the city, they think it's going to be easy, they're going to be models, they're are going to go into your business, they're going to go into something, and it's going to be just so easy, and they end up in a year or two years of rejection, just rejection after rejection. It's just a tough place, it's a great place. I think it's the greatest place on earth, but it can be mean and they end up in a very bad position.
<Don Imus> <Negative> Now in the Tara case, she won the Miss USA contest, she came to New York. Guys are calling her up wanting to fly her to Paris in G-5. She came from Kentucky and all of a sudden she's meeting these hustlers with the G-5s many of them are your friends and my friends, sadly. I mean, I have to say, sadly and they're all after, and she didn't know which way to go.
<Don Imus> <Negative> She started drinking and she started really going out, like Ivy League and wasn't doing a job. Everyone wanted her fired, including the people at the Miss USA contest and the Miss Universe contest. They all wanted her fired and I wanted her fired and then I met her and I said, "I'm not going to fire her."" It was something that really a lot of people liked. Then as you know
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Then Rosie O'Donnell got on the air, and I got a call from a friend of mine, and I got a call from my wife. She said, "Darling this woman Rosie
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's what I said to somebody. I said, "If anybody who knows Trump or even casually
<Don Imus> <Positive> You would've called. I know you well, Don. I've known you for a long time. You would've used the same words that I used.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Wait a minute, that's me.
<Don Imus> <Negative> You might have gone. I don't know. You might have got a step further if that's possible. I'm not sure what we're...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, I would have. I would have gone a lot further than you did, but that's me.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Yesterday, I did Meredith Vieira on The Today Show and she's very nice, but she starts off by saying, stuff about The Apprentice. I'm there about the Apprentice which it goes on Sunday. I'm sitting there waiting to have an Apprentice question. She says, "Donald
<Don Imus> <Negative> I said, "You asked me the question. I don't want to talk about that slob. You asked me the question."" Then she goes
<Don Imus> <Positive> He just plays it over and over, he loves it. He said, "It's unbelievable."" I think part of the reason
<Don Imus> <Negative> You called her a degenerate." I said
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Don Imus> <Negative> She said, "You called her crude. I said
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's basically I'm telling the truth and lot of people -- I think the reason it became so big. It's the number one thing on the internet for the last week and so was the Miss USA hiring or firing. I mean that thing turned out to be this with two monsters, and it was started by Rosie. She said a lot of things that were incorrect, she said I went bankrupt.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm on the cover last month of the Forbes 400. I'm on the cover, and she said, "I went bankrupt."" Now
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If I asked them for 10 cents, they'd laugh at me, and they'd be very happy. They'd say, "Oh man
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Actually, my one sister called she said, "Geez
