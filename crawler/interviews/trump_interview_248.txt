<Jane Robelot> <Positive> It's time to go to Miami Beach where beautiful women -- the most beautiful women from around the world are beginning one very exciting weekend. And Jose Diaz-Balart, the fox in the henhouse, is in the middle of it all. Good morning, Jose.
<Jose Diaz-Balart> <Positive> Good morning, Jane. About two and a half billion people around the world will be watching Miss Universe tonight. Of course, you can see it right here on CBS. And toni -- this morning we have two very special people, Donald Trump, who owns Miss Universe along with CBS, and Alicia Machado, the current Miss Universe. Thank you both for being with us.
<Alicia Machado> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Jose Diaz-Balart> <Negative> Donald, let's start with you. Casinos, hotels, high-class buildings, why Miss Universe?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, somebody has to own it and I figured it might as well be me. And then I sold a piece to CBS. I sold half to CBS and we're partners and it's been a great partnership.
<Jose Diaz-Balart> <Negative> Why Miami Beach?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a great place. And I live in Palm Beach. I'm at Palm Beach quite a bit and it's convenient from that standpoint. But I know Miami Beach very well and it's a great place. And they've treated us beautifully.
<Jose Diaz-Balart> <Neutral> For the first time in the history of the pageant, viewers can actually participate. There will be a call -- a question up and the viewers can actually call in and vote. Now let -- let's bring up the question. It says, 'Should a pageant title holder be required to maintain her physical appearance during her reign?' Why do you think this is an important question the viewers would care about?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's something that really has come up over the last year. And Alicia has done an incredible job. She really has turned out to be one of the great Miss Universes I will say.
<Alicia Machado> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And she had a little problem during the middle where she gained a little weight and a lot of...
<Alicia Machado> <Negative> I don't think so.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. And she's probably right.
<Alicia Machado> <Negative> I don't think so.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. And so...
<Jose Diaz-Balart> <Positive> Let -- let's talk about that debate because, you know, it's interesting. The viewers are going to make a decision today and they are going to vote in one way or the other. Alicia, do you think that that should matter? Because, after all, you were voted in as being the most beautiful woman in the world.
<Alicia Machado> <Positive> I am the most beautiful woman in the world.
<Jose Diaz-Balart> <Neutral> I certainly don't doubt that.
<Alicia Machado> <Positive> With 20 pounds or no pounds, I am the most beautiful woman in the world.
<Jose Diaz-Balart> <Neutral> Do you not think that it's important to maintain a certain look during that year?
<Alicia Machado> <Negative> Yes, of course. But I think all women in the world have a problem with the weight.
<Jose Diaz-Balart> <Positive> Right.
<Alicia Machado> <Negative> And I -- I think maybe I had some problem with it, but I'm -- I'm fine now. And I think 15 pounds is -- is nothing with 20 years old. And I think the most important for the next Miss Universe, and that is no more dinners, no more lunch, no more breakfast...
<Jose Diaz-Balart> <Positive> True.
<Alicia Machado> <Negative> ...and no more when you travel, diplomatic dinners and -- and parties.
<Jose Diaz-Balart> <Neutral> I think Dona -- what Donald is talking about -- and I think most people agree -- that there is a look to Miss Universe.
<Alicia Machado> <Neutral> And more time for go to the gym is very important, because when you have -- when you are Miss Universe, you don't have time for nothing.
<Jose Diaz-Balart> <Negative> Right. Donald, how do you think that this Miss -- this Miss Universe will be different from the others?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know that it's going to be different. We have many beautiful women and it's actually incredible. I was over there today and the women are magnificent. And so I don't think it's going to be different. It's going to be more of the same and it's going to be terrific. It's going to be a terrific program. We have wonderful entertainment and a great location.
<Jose Diaz-Balart> <Negative> Alicia, very quickly, advice for the new Miss Universe?
<Alicia Machado> <Positive> Good luck. She need it.
<Jose Diaz-Balart> <Negative> Donald, this is the first time you've been on -- on national TV since the rumors have come out which -- which you -- you've talked about a little bit about your impending separation from Marla. I know it's not something that's comfortable to talk about. It's not, certainly, something that I enjoy asking about. How are you doing? How are you two doing? What's...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're doing really great. And she's a very great professional. She's doing the show tonight and she's going to do a fantastic job. She's a very, very professional, very talented woman. And we're really doing great.
<Jose Diaz-Balart> <Positive> Yeah. And she's -- she's going to stay with the child, I'm told?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh yeah, absolutely. She's a terrific mother. I mean, her best asset, frankly, is that she is a terrific mother. And Tiffany is -- is a wonderful child. And I'm very happy about that because Marla is such a good mother.
<Jose Diaz-Balart> <Positive> Well, two and a half billion people will be watching Miss Universe. We certainly hope that you will be one of those two and a half billion people. Alicia Machado, Donald Trump, thank you so much for being with us on This Morning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you.
<Jose Diaz-Balart> <Positive> And on Monday, we will have the results from that poll that we'll be taking tonight on CBS whether you think it's important that the Miss Universe maintain a certain physical appearance. Right here on This Morning on Monday, we'll bring you the results of that poll. And tonight, if you can, call in. Let us know what you think. Back to you.
<Jane Robelot> <Negative> OK. So it starts at 9:00 tonight on CBS. That's Eastern time. And it's live. Jose, have you had an opportunity to take a look at some of the contestants for tonight's pageant?
<Jose Diaz-Balart> <Negative> Jane, I've -- I'm going to be -- I'm asking Donald if I can be an informal judge of the contest tonight. We'll see what Donald says.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Jose Diaz-Balart> <Positive> Thank you, man.
<Jane Robelot> <Negative> OK. What -- who's your pick -- Miss who? Who's the next Miss Universe, Jose?
<Jose Diaz-Balart> <Negative> I think the next Miss Universe is Alicia Machado. What do you think of that, huh? Let's extain -- extend her reign one more year.
<Alicia Machado> <Negative> No, please.
<Jose Diaz-Balart> <Neutral> Re-election.
<Alicia Machado> <Negative> No, please.
<Jane Robelot> <Positive> She says she's ready to have a life.
<Jose Diaz-Balart> <Positive> That's right.
<Jane Robelot> <Positive> Alicia, Donald, Jose, thanks.
