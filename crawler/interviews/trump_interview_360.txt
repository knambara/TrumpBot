<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> With us now by phone, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Donald, we read quiet a few polls; you're ahead in all of them. Of course, you would tell us. Especially I want to focus on the one in Florida right now. You're a good bit ahead in Florida, and despite all that good news, you seem to be at war with many people on the right. Why is that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [On the Phone] Well, I don't think war. I like to be treated fairly and have a good relationship, as you know, Joe, with many, many people. But I like to be treated fairly and when I'm not fairly treated I let people know it. I don't think that's -- I don't think it's a war.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> What's going on with Fox News? You know, you and Roger have been friends for a long time. There was a misunderstanding after the first debate, you guys patched it up. But now you're saying you're not going on Fox News again and they say it's because they won't bow down to your demands. What's the truth there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't think I've been treated fairly on Fox News. Now, you know, it's sort an amazing thing because I'm leading every single one of the poles. I guess their poll just came out. I was told I'm leading that poll by a substantial margin. But I don't think I'm being treated fairly on Fox News and I let them know that and I'm not going to be doing it for a while.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> In what way are they not treating you treated fairly? Your beef seems to be Bill O'Reilly. You and Bill have been friends for a while.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, Bill is OK. I think various things happened. I mean, it has to do with polling too. They don't put up the good polls.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They don't put up polls. If I'm leading big in a poll, they don't put it up. And we actually questioned them about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why don't you put it up? Well, we haven't had the chance. It's ridiculous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, it's sort of funny. The Florida poll came out and the headline was that Rubio surges past Bush. And I said I guess that's too bad; I guess I'm not in the poll.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I had 31.5 percent. They were down in the teens. And I said that's sort of an amazing thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's an amazing headline. It's Rubio surges past Bush is the headline and I'm the one that's leading the poll by a lot. So I don't know, I get treated very fairly by some of the media.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And some of the media does not treat me fairly. Fox does not treat me fairly. Megyn Kelly, I mean, you had this loser on last night, this guy Lowery, I've never even heard of him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was so out of control; he lost control of himself. It was actually sad. He lost control of himself last night with what he said and I guess you got to take a guy like that off the air. But I watched it actually; I was actually watching. I was on a plane that came back from South Carolina. We had an amazing day in South Carolina, frankly, incredible, with the crowds. And I will tell you I've never seen anything like it, the level of hatred of him, of George Will, of Krauthammer.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that's because I guess maybe they were so wrong, because they said, number one, I wouldn't run. And then after I ran they said, well, he's just doing this for fun, he's just having a good time. This isn't about having a good time. It's about making America great again. So you know, I mean, all of them have been so wrong, and the level of hatred and animosity is incredible.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> At some point, though, shouldn't you ignore pundits? Most politicians just ignore pundits, let them go their own way, and focus on the issues. At some point, shouldn't you just -- you know there are people you would term haters out there. At what point do you just stop those fights and start focusing on what's happening in Syria, what's happening with taxes, what's happening with the debt and a lot of these other issues.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that a lot of people would not ignore if they had a certain degree, if they were into -- you know, I have this thing called Twitter and Facebook, which is amazing actually. It's like owning The New York Times" without the losses.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I have almost -- I have actually now But I'm able to use it and I use it well. And you know, you're able to fight back. In the old days you didn't have that. What would you do? Call a press conference to announce that somebody lost control of his mind on television last night and made a total fool out of himself? You couldn't do that. But with Twitter, you can with one tweet, 140 characters, you can knock somebody out. Pretty cool.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Well, Donald, the thing is you're right now at odds with Fox News. We know how powerful they are in the Republican Party. And you're at war with Rich Lowery, who is the editor of National Review"
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think anybody reads it, Joe. I think it has no power whatsoever, I'll be honest. I think it has no power whatsoever. And he's not a respected guy.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> I read it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're the only one. [Laughter]
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Well, I have no friends. That is true, but I don't think I'm the only one. But Donald, at what point do you start fighting Democrats and liberals and people on the left instead of these sort of intramural wars with Republicans?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think you know me and I think you know that I'm a fighter and I know how to fight, and I have a fight now with these, the remaining people that are candidates. Because you have two battles.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have this battle and then you have the other battle. But you have to get through this one before the other one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm looking at guys like Marco Rubio, who has the worst voting record in the United States Senate. And -- young guy, although he sweats more than any young person I've ever seen in my life.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've never seen a person sweat -- I've never seen a guy down water like he downs water. I've never seen -- they bring it in in buckets for this guy. But, you know, I have various people I have to knock down before I get to the other race. And when I get to the other race, I will win that race. If it's Hillary, which is hard to believe it's going to be with what she's done. You know, General Petraeus has been destroyed for doing a fraction of what she's done, and it's hard to believe she's going to get to the starting gate. But assuming she does, I think Hillary is not going to be hard to beat.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Katty Kay.
<Katty Kay> <Negative> Mr. Trump, it's Katty here. Why did you call Hillary Clinton shrill?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't think -- and I heard your comment, Katty, and I know you've been commenting a lot of negative things over the weeks and months, but that's OK. Don't feel bad. I heard the comment and I think the word shrill doesn't apply to women exclusively. I know men that are shrill, and it's just an expression that I thought of. As I was speaking, I thought it was an accurate expression She's gotten very loud and very boisterous and that can happen the men too, Katty. Please, if you don't mind, that can happen to men.
<Katty Kay> <Negative> It's just, you know, you never hear people say it about men.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me. Excuse me.
<Katty Kay> <Negative> We never hear that word said about men.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's gotten very loud and obnoxious and, frankly, I know many men that become very loud and obnoxious also. But I've noticed that she -- I don't know, there's something going on with her. There's really something going on. I think she's going to make a terrible candidate just as she was a terrible Secretary of State.
<Katty Kay> <Negative> I mean, would you call any of your male competitors in the Republican race, would you call them shrill? Have you called them shrill? It's just that, to women, when you use a word like shrill --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but I would. I would call Rand Paul shrill.
<Katty Kay> <Negative> '-- it definitely sounds sexist.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Katty, I would call Rand Paull Ssrill. I think he's shrill. I don't think that's a term that applies exclusively to women at all.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> I will say for the record I think Mika has accused me offset of being shrill. [Laughter]
<Katty Kay> <Positive> She may well be right.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Yes, so we'll see. So you just called me shrill too. See, men can be called shrill.
<Mike Barnicle> <Negative> Donald, you're doing very well in Florida and you activated actually both parties in much of the country to talk about immigration over the course of your campaign. But CBS Miami this morning reports that Mar-a-Lago, your beloved Mar-a-Lago, you've requested anywhere from -- at Mar-a-Lago, they've requested anywhere from 70-90 H-2b visas a year since the year 2008 to hire workers at an average pay of $10-12 an hour. Why would you be importing workers from overseas rather than hiring workers from Florida?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because during the season, Mar-a-Lago is a seasonal job, which is very hard to get people in Florida for seasonal jobs. And during the season, in Palm Beach, Palm Beach is probably the hottest real-estate maybe in the world. And during the season in Palm Beach, it's very, very hard to get help. You can't, you know, we're talking about Mar-a-Lago the club is closed for the summer. You know, the expression Rich people don't like heat." And we close Mar-a-Lago and we open October -- like October 1st. And from that
<Mike Barnicle> <Neutral> Yes, yes, I do.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> These are all legal visas, but they -- we have to bring people in, which tells you, I mean, you can have jobs out there in certain communities that are doing well. But in Palm Beach, getting help in Palm Beach during the season is almost impossible. So we go through a very legal process and bring people in through legal visas.
<Mike Barnicle> <Negative> But you've also said and it's sort of joined up with importing workers, you've also said repeatedly that you believe the American Dream is dead. Do you really believe the American Dream is dead?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't say that. I say the American Dream is dead but I'm going to make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before. And then the press always cuts me off when they show the tape.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They say the American Dream is dead and they cut me off. My wife said to me the other day, she said that's a terrible thing you said.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said what did I say? She said you said the American Dream is dead. I said no, no, no.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I watched it, because of TiVo, I said oh that's terrible. Look what they did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was -- I think it was actually Fox to tell you the truth. I said -- and it was a beautiful statement. Everybody clapped, they stood up, they went crazy. I said the American dream is dead but I'm going to make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and they cut it off. And I said wow, what a terrible statement that is. So just like you just said that because you saw the same thing that everybody else did. I never say the American Dream is dead, except when I add those other words. But sometimes in television they cut off those words because it makes me look a little bit coarse.
<Donny Deutsch> <Negative> Donald, it's Donny. How are you, sir?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi, Donny.
<Donny Deutsch> <Positive> Let me ask you a question. I asked this to you on the phone a couple of weeks ago and I didn't get an answer and I just -- I want to hear the entire question. I know you want to win because you are all about winning.
<Donny Deutsch> <Positive> You are all about the deal. You are all about beating the other guy and I say that as a compliment. Do you want this job -- and let me finish the question -- because in this job, 95 percent of what you have to do -- I don't mean you, anybody -- are things you don't want to do. That's what that job is. If you call Barack Obama, if you call George W. Bush. You can't fire Congress. It is the ultimate non-autocratic job. It's just the way our country is set up.
<Donny Deutsch> <Positive> Have you thought through, literally, literally coming to that office every day and what that job would be? And at the end of the day, I know you pretty well, my friend. Do you actually want that job or do you just want to win?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, look, it's not a question of wanting to win or wanting the job. I know I can do a great job. There are things being done now that are so incompetent. These are grossly incompetent people that are running our country.
<Donny Deutsch> <Negative> I'm talking about you though; I'm talking about you. Forget all the other people, I'm saying -- [Crosstalk]
<Donny Deutsch> <Positive> January 30 --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have grossly incompetent people running our country. I know I can do a great job. And you know, my slogan, make America great again. I can make American -- I can do that. I can make America great again.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Let me go at it from a different angle. Are you going to be willing when your law that you pass through Congress rests on a Congressman from Boise, Idaho, who you're going to have to fly out and sit in his house and hang out with him and beg him and give him whatever he wants in the appropriation bill to get his vote? I mean, are you going to be willing to do that sort of -- sort of slogging?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I am. And, you know, Obama has not been willing to do that, Joe. That's why he signs executive orders all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He has not been willing to do that and I am. You know, you and Mika know me pretty well, and Donny.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've been in politics all my life. I've been doing politics all my life. In Europe, I've made a fortune dealing with China.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've made a fortune dealing with China. I've made a lot of money dealing all over the world. I deal in politics all over the world.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If you look at, you know, politics in the United States, I know most of these guys. Now, I know them from the other side.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know them as a contributor. I used to be the fair-haired boy. Now I'm sort of an outsider. It's sort of funny. Four months ago I was the fair-haired boy. They loved me. They came over. They'd do whatever I wanted them to do. They'd ask for contributions all the time. I was one of the big contributors. And now all of sudden they're sort of, in one day with the announcement that I'm going to run for president, I've become an outsider which is fun. But I've been dealing in politics all my life and I'll get them to do the right thing.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> All right, Willie.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Hey Donald, it's Willie.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi Willie.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Good to see you this morning. I want to ask you about veterans issues, because you've gone out of your way to talk about veterans on the campaign trail and good for you on that. I just want to get a little more specific about it.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> The VA has been a disaster. I think you'll agree. We have some of our veterans who fought overseas for us, who come home and wait months and months and months and years for an appointment. Some of them die before they get their appointment. What specifically would you do about the VA? Because we've got a CEO from the private sector, Bob McDonald, good man, competent man, who's come in and he's found it challenging enough. What would you do to change the situation for our veterans?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he's not doing the job. And as you can see, I have tremendous support from the veterans. It may be as high as anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, I have the most support from the veterans. And what I would do is very simple. Two weeks ago on Wednesday, the veterans had the longest wait in the history, in waiting rooms in the history of the VA.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are being treated worse than illegal immigrants in many cases. It's a disaster for the veterans.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And what I would do is to break up that back jam. They cannot wait seven days to see the doctor and the doctor tells them I'm going on vacation, we can't see you now, sorry.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We are going to open it up so they can go -- they don't have to wait, they can go to private doctors, they can go to private hospitals, they can go to public hospitals, and we'll pay the bill. And that will end up being a lot cheaper than having them waiting forever.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the way, waiting and dying, because you have thousands that are dying waiting to be cured of things that can easily be fixed. So I will open it up so they can go to private hospitals and private doctors, and, by the way, public hospitals and we'll pay the bill.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And frankly, that's going to be, and we'll work out a system, that will be a lot better and they love it, they love the concept, and I believe it's going to be a lot cheaper. It's not a question of the money. We're being run -- the whole country is incompetently run. But the VA may be the top of the list. They will be so happy if I get elected president. Believe me.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Donald, we got to let you go, but really quickly, before you go, you had an interview with Scott Pelley, 60 Minutes. He kept asking you about birtherism. You kept brushing it off saying you weren't going to talk about that anymore. Are you not going to talk about that anymore?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't talk about that anymore, Joe. You know what I talk about? Hey Joe, I talk about the vets. I talk about what we're going to do to bring jobs back. I talk about the military. I don't talk about it anymore. And the problem with talking about it, you talk about it, that's all people want to talk about. They don't want to get on to trade with China, how we're getting killed. They don't want to get on to how badly treated the vets are. They don't want to talk about immigration. So I don't talk about it anymore. I talk about jobs and other things.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So you're not going to talk about it at all the rest of this campaign?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't talk about it, Joe. I mean, people ask me a question and I say I want to talk about jobs, I want to talk about trade, I want to talk about other things. And you know what? They immediately go on to it.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Hopefully, we will have a campaign that does focus on jobs and trade and Syria and Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I agree.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Issues that matter. All right, Donald Trump, thank you so much for being with us. We greatly appreciate it as always.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Tim Russert> <Positive> But this morning, in an exclusive interview, businessman Donald Trump tells Meet the Press that tomorrow he, Trump, is also leaving the Republican Party to join the Reform Party. He is filing this form with the New York Board of Elections. I interviewed Mr. Trump at our NBC Studios in New York on Thursday
<Tim Russert> <Positive> Donald Trump, welcome to Meet the Press
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you very much, Tim.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> You are a registered Republican.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Correct.
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> There is a form that is being filed Monday, tomorrow, with the Board of Elections, which says what?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it says that I am joining, as of Monday, the Reform Party, which in New York is the Independence Party. And I look forward to doing so.
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> Why are you joining the Reform Party?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, for one thing, I really believe the Republicans are just too crazy right. I mean, just what's going on is just nuts. And I'm seeing the Democrats as far too -- I mean, Bradley and Gore are so liberal, it's just too liberal for me. And I really think they've hit a chord, they've hit a very good chord, and I guess I'm very popular in that party, and it certainly looks that way.
<Tim Russert> <Positive> This will be read as a further indication that you are seriously thinking about running for president on the Reform Party.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it may very well be.
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> Should it be?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so. Yes. I absolutely think so.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> There have been some polls taken recently by Newsweek and ABC News. Let me put those on the board: And they say that 77 percent told ABC News, 73 percent told Newsweek, they would not vote for Donald Trump under any circumstances. That's a lot of people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, it's interesting, because on ABC I'm their star and on Newsweek they put me on their cover last week. And, you know, I saw some poll where I guess -- hey, polls are very interesting. I could put out a poll -- Would you vote for the brilliant entrepreneur Donald Trump?" -- and everyone's going to say yes. Or I could put a poll -- "Would you vote for this terrible human being named Donald Trump?" -- and they're going to say no. So
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> But that wasn't scientific. It was only 100 people from the street.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know if it was only 100. You know what? They got the highest marks on the O.J. Simpson coverage and lots of other coverage. So you can say what they want.
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> From some...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So the point is, they did a poll and I win the election, according to their poll.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> But if three-fourths of the American people three months from now are saying that they won't vote for you under any circumstances, would you then still run?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I would only do this if I felt I could win the election.
<Tim Russert> <Positive> Win the election?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A lot of people say they're not going to vote. And if you look at those polls -- Because he's not going to run. There's no way that he's going to run. Why would he run? He gives up a lot by running." And I do. I'm the biggest developer by far in New York. I am the most successful developer in New York. And New York is the hottest city in the world. So
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> Many people who have been watching you, who know you, who like you, say this is all just a public relations stunt. I went back to consult the bible
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I haven't heard this. Is that true?
<Tim Russert> <Positive> Your book, and let me read what you wrote: You can have the most wonderful product in the world
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that's true. And I think it's certainly been true in my case because there certainly has been a lot written. I mean, when they hand me the cover of Newsweek and -- they said, Mr. Trump
<Tim Russert> <Positive> The Daily News had this to say. And let me put it on the board: Trump's decision to spend up to three months weighing a candidacy has the potential to generate tens of millions of dollars in free publicity for his empire of buildings
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Probably true. Probably true.
<Tim Russert> <Positive> Is that what you're really after?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I am really looking at this very seriously. And I think if I do it -- and I wouldn't do it unless I thought I could win. I'm not looking to get 21 percent or 19 percent or 15 percent and they say, Oh
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> Tomorrow Pat Buchanan is announcing that he will be a candidate for the presidency on the Reform Party.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just think it's ridiculous. I mean, he wrote a book...
<Tim Russert> <Negative> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because -- look, he's a Hitler lover. I guess he's an anti-Semite. He doesn't like the blacks, he doesn't like the gays. It's just incredible that anybody could embrace this guy. And maybe he'll get 4 or 5 percent of the vote and it'll be a really staunch, right-wacko vote. I'm not even sure if it's right. It's just a wacko vote. And I just can't imagine that anybody can take him seriously.
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> When will you decide whether or not you truly can win and, therefore, decide to run?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think probably by January, February, March at the latest I'll make a decision.
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> Any time anyone runs for president, they're scrutinized. And they look into people's background...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> ...the so-called character issue. The so-called c…
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> This is what you told CNBC last year which raised a lot of eyebrows and I'll put it on the screen: Can you imagine how controversial I'd be? You think about òClintonë with the women. How about me with the women? Can you imagine? This is what you told CNBC last year which raised a lot of eyebrows and I'll put it on the screen: "Can you imagine how controversia""is is what you told CNBC last ye"
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I mean, I think there is a certain controversy to me. And I am single. And I do go out with women. And I do respect and adore women. And some women love me and probably some women don't. But I am certainly controversial. But I also am a great businessman. I'd make the greatest treaties that this country has seen in a long time. Other countries wouldn't be ripping us off like they're doing, when you look at what Japan has been doing to us for so many years and decades. I mean, they wouldn't be ripping us like they are, and things would happen.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> But when you say that if the president had had a fling with a supermodel rather than Monica, he'd be a hero.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I didn't say that. I said there are those that say that, If he had a fling with a supermodel
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> Do you believe it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's possible.
<Tim Russert> <Positive> Let me show you what you said about women in your book and give you a chance to respond.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right.
<Tim Russert> <Positive> This is helpful: Women have one of the great acts of all time. The smart ones act very feminine and needy
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know that. I mean, you're married to an incredible woman. And I'm sure she manipulates you beautifully.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> When women see or hear that on the screen, however, don't they say...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think they respect it.
<Tim Russert> <Positive> ...Donald Trump
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm saying women may be beyond us, you and I. I mean, they're smart, they're cunning.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> They're killers.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They're killers in many respects.
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> That's what you said.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Absolutely. I'm not saying all, but I'm saying in many respects. And I've seen women that are so tough they make us wince.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> Let me move on to some issues...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You haven't met any of those women?
<Tim Russert> <Positive> But first -- when I run for president, I'll answer all your questions.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK.
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> One of your former wives -- Marla -- had this to say and let me put it on the screen, give you a chance to respond: If òTrumpë is really serious about being president and runs in the general election next year
<Tim Russert> <Positive> When people look at the presidency, they want to think of traditional family values. Do you think they're ready to elect a twice-divorced man?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know. I mean, certainly these are the things I'll be looking at. I think the answer is yes. And as you say, you know, you can cite all sorts of polls, but you also know the polls that say I'd do very well if I ran in the election. We'll see what happens. I mean, if I think that that's going to be a great impediment, I'm not going to bother. Again, I don't want to end up the day after the election, back in my office in Trump Tower. It's a beautiful office. It's a great place to be. But either I run and win or I just don't want to run at all. So if that's going to be an impediment, I wouldn't bother.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> You have a new book coming out, The America We Deserve"... ""ou have a new book coming o"
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Correct.
<Tim Russert> <Positive> ...which I've had a chance to have some excerpts given to me by your office. Let me talk about some of the issues. One is North Korea. And you say that you, as president, would be willing to launch a pre-emptive strike against North Korea's nuclear capability.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> First, I'd negotiate. I would negotiate like crazy. And I'd make sure that we tried to get the best deal possible. Look, Tim, if a man walks up to you on a street in Washington -- because this doesn't happen, of course, in New York. But if a man walks up and puts a gun to your head and says, Give me your money
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not talking about -- I'm not talking about us using nuclear weapons. I'm saying that they have areas where they're developing missiles.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> No, but taking out their nuclear potential...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do you know that this country, Tim...
<Tim Russert> <Negative> ...would create a fallout.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Tim, do you know that this country went out and gave them nuclear reactors, free fuel for 10 years? We -- we virtually tried to bribe them into stopping, and they're continuing to do what they're doing and they're laughing at us. They think we're a bunch of dummies. I'm saying that we have to do something to stop. Ideally...
<Tim Russert> <Positive> But if the military told you, Mr. Trump
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You give me two names -- you're giving me two names. I don't know. Do you want to do it in five years when they have warheads all over the place, every one of them pointing to New York City, to Washington and everyone of our -- is that when you want to do it, or do you want to do something now? You'd better do it now. And if they think you're serious -- I deal with lots of people -- if they think you're serious, they'll negotiate and it'll never come to that.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> Tax cuts: The Reform Party platform says no tax cuts, no tax cuts and we pay off -- till we pay off the entire debt. Donald Trump says, cut taxes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think you can do a combination of both. I think if we go back and negotiate with Japan and Germany and lots of countries, France, that are just ripping us -- Saudi Arabia -- you look at these deficits that are just ripping us big league, I think you can do a combination of tax cuts and pay off the national debt. I mean, this country loses trillions of dollars in -- in bad deals that we make with cou -- really, countries like Japan with the cars. You try and sell an American car in Japan. By the time it gets off the boat -- the boat is sitting there 40 weeks as they're trying to get the first car off the boat. I mean, they're just ripping us, and they're ripping us big league.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> How big of a tax cut?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A substantial tax cut in line with the top Republican numbers.
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> $ 800 billion?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. In line with the top Republican numbers, which aren't going to happen. But they'd happen if I was involved.
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> People will say to Donald Trump, Who are you to tell us how to run a government
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what? You know what? Absolutely. And I have -- of the 71 companies I have -- and by the way, those four that I threw into a chapter -- and they were just four -- not me, personally -- these were just four out of many, many companies in very bad times caused by the Bill Bradleys of the world who created a ridiculous tax structure for the country in order to save money -- those four companies did very, very well. In other words, I use the system as -- to my advantage and there's nothing wrong with that.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> Social Security: The Reform Party platform says privatize Social Security. Donald Trump says that's a dumb idea.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't like the idea of privatizing Social Security. I think it's certainly something that could be looked at. I think the Social Security system is in very serious trouble. Obviously, it's always going to be backed by the country, but I think it's in very serious trouble. I would look at privatization. I don't know that that's the answer.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> But you'd open to it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm open to it, yes.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> Immigration: The Reform Party platform says, Let's hold back on immigration. Let's bring the numbers down." Donald Trump says? ""mmigration: The Reform Party platform says
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I agree. I agree. I think that too many people are flowing into the country. We have to take care of our own first. We must take care of our own. I agree with that 100 percent.
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> Trade: NAFTA, North American Free Trade Agreement?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Bad. Really bad. I hate it. I never liked it. And the only reason we're doing all right is that the economy is OK right now. If the economy goes down the toilet, the NAFTA will be a disaster for this country. And there's a real chance that that can happen.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> Most-favored-nation trade status for China. Repeal it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say generally speaking repeal it. I'm not happy with what's going on. You talk about nuclear powers. I mean, they're testing weapons all the time. China -- to me, that says bigger problem. I mean, they're going wild with nuclear weapons and we have to have it stopped.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> You say that we may be headed for a crash. What do you base that on?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, all you can base it on is your instinct. And I hope it's not true. And I'm not sure that it will be true. It's always ups and downs no matter how you do. We're certainly in a little bit of a down period right now, and we may go further down. I hope that's not true. I don't think it will be true. It won't be true if I'm in there. But there is a possibility for some very tough times ahead from an economic standpoint. And if that happens, financially, if that happens with the country, where we go into a recession or beyond that, like we had in 1990 and '91, which was largely caused by politicians -- if that should happen, Tim, we have some real problems. We're going to have a very, very depressed place.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> How long do you think we have before we might enter a recession?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that if things aren't properly done, 12 to 14 months. I think we could enter into -- hey, look, I don't know what you call it right now. If you look at the New York Stock Exchange, you know, General Electric and -- your company -- and lots of huge companies are going up. But 90 percent of the companies go way down, and they are way down. They're at all-time lows. So I don't know what you call it. But I think times really aren't as good as people think right now. And times could be heading bad. I hope that's not true.
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> What would you do right now to stop it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, for one thing, I think that the choice of people -- and in all fairness to Clinton, between Rubin and Greenspan, he's made two really good -- these were his two best appointments, in my opinion. But the choice of people and the choice of leadership financially speaking -- hey, who knows better about hard times than me? I had a company. It was doing well. I had tremendous debt, like this country. And in 1990, the whole country -- it just went very, very bad. Friends of mine went bankrupt, they went out of business, never to be heard from again. I went out and my company is now much bigger, much stronger, much more powerful than it ever was before. So, I mean, I understand this stuff. I understand good times and I understand bad times. I mean, why, is a politician going to do a better job than I am?
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> Let me ask you about some social issues. Do you think gays should be allowed to be married?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's something I haven't given lots of thought to. I live in New York City. There's a tremendous movement on to have and allow gay marriage. It's just something that is too premature for me to comment on.
<Tim Russert> <Positive> How about gays serving in the military?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It would not disturb me. Again, I'd want to talk to lots of experts within the military. But it's not something that would disturb me. I mean, hey, I lived in New York City and Manhattan all my life, OK? So, you know, my views are a little bit different than if I lived in Iowa, perhaps. But it's not something that would disturb me.
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> Did you serve in the military?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I did not.
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> What reason?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I got very lucky. We had lottery numbers. And I guess this was my biggest factor of luck in my life, because during the Vietnam War, I had a very, very high -- my date, which was June 14th, was a very high date in the lottery, so I never got drafted, so I was very lucky.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> Partial-birth abortion, the eliminating of abortion in the third trimester: big issue in Washington. Would President Trump ban partial-birth abortion?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, look, I'm very pro-choice. I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I listen to people debating the subject. But you still -- I just believe in choice. And, again, it may be a little bit of a New York background, because there is some different attitude in different parts of the country. And, you know, I was raised in New York, and grew up and work and everything else in New York City. But I am strongly for choice and, yet, I hate the concept of abortion.
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> But you would not ban it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> Or ban partial-birth abortion?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I am pro-choice in every respect and as far as it goes, but I just hate it.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> Like anyone in public life, there have -- things been written and said about you which have been extremely critical. In fact, you've written books very favorable about yourself; several books have been written unfavorable about you. I want to give you a chance to respond to one charge, in particular.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right.
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> And this was a fellow named John O'Donnell who worked with you. And this is what he said.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By the way, he worked with me. I hardly even know the guy. He did work with me, but I hardly even know them. And he wrote a book and it's ridiculous. But anyway, go ahead.
<Tim Russert> <Negative> He says that -- and he quotes you as saying: ...I've got black accountants at Trump Castle and at Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. Those are the kind of people I want counting my money. Nobody else... Besides that
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I never said it. I don't even know...
<Tim Russert> <Positive> Donald Trump...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hardly know this guy. He was running one of my casinos for a short period of time. He was fired -- we fired him because he wasn't doing a very good job. He wrote this nasty book. He made up stuff. This is like Jon Lovitz on Saturday Night Live
<Tim Russert> <Negative> You've never said anything like that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've never said anything like it, ever.
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> Another book written suggested that because you are in the construction business, because you're in the casino business, you've had relations with members of organized crime.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> False. I mean -- you know, the funny thing about the casino business, in particular in Atlantic City, as an example, you have to go through a very brilliant casino control system. Every check you write, every deal you make, even outside of Atlantic City. I'm talking if I build a building in New York I send in papers as to who's building it, who's the concrete people, etc., etc. Everything I do is under scrutiny. And one of the things different, I think, about me is that my life has been, Tim, a very, very open book. More so than virtually any politician that you interview on Sundays.
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> But you've never had to meet with, to do business with any organized figure in order to build buildings or do...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I never have had to, and, to be honest with you, being a celebrity at a very high level is a good thing. Because they sort of -- and they're -- I'm not saying the mob doesn't exist. But they want to keep it low. They want to really keep it low. The last thing they want to do is meet with Donald Trump and have 500 paparazzi taking pictures. The answer is no. And I think, in that way -- and I must tell you, I think, in that way, celebrity has been a positive for me.
<Tim Russert> <Neutral> What do you think the most important issue facing our country is?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I happen to think -- as I said before, I really think that the world is becoming an unbelievable part of nuclear weapons. You look at India, you look at Pakistan, you look at North Korea, China. The world is becoming a very, very dangerous place. My uncle, who was a great professor at MIT -- he passed away, Dr. John Trump -- he said that some day you'll be able to have a suitcase, walk into the middle of Manhattan and the island is gone for 200 miles around. And you know what? That was 20 years ago he told me that and he's not so far wrong. We have to control the nuclear problem or you and me and everybody else -- we're not going to be around here to be talking about, Gee whiz
<Tim Russert> <Positive> Donald Trump, we thank you for joining us. And if you, in fact, announce for president, we hope you'll come back to Meet the Press.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, nice to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And always glad to be in your office.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Or the conference room.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... we love having you with this great crew.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, I want to go to some recent tweets of yours. Have you -- you had a recent tweet in which you talked about food stamps being up 45 percent. Why is it up 45 percent?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, the economy is terrible. The world is not doing really well, although some parts of the world are doing incredibly well, but we're leading the world in terms of not doing well. And it's got to change. So obviously, food stamps are going to be up and a lot of other bad things are up also, including, if you look at unemployment, if you look at the real number of unemployment -- you know, I see where they try and say it's coming down.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have a friend who's a very, very brilliant economist who said that our real number is probably 20 or 21 percent. But we don't count it like we used to in the old days. You know, in the old days, if you were unemployed, you were unemployed. Today, if you stop looking for a job, they don't consider you unemployed, so...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Or if you're underemployed, if you were a CEO of a company and now you're a part-time job at...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, they don't consider that, either.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Underemployed. Well, underemployed I leave out. But if you stop looking for a job, now all of a sudden you're not in the statistics. So it's a problem. The country has some very serious problems.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Speaker Gingrich made a remark -- I think he referred to the president as the "food stamp president" and it set off a lot of people -- some people thought it might be racist and there was a horrible criticism of...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, Greta, everything is racist. If you ask any question or criticize the president it's always racist. If you ask how come he doesn't reveal his marks in school, was he bad student? The answer is yes.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> How do you know that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because I've been told. And I hear that his one college he was a very bad student and then he got into Columbia where he was a great student. And then he got into Harvard. Maybe it's not but that is what I hear.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I guess I am less confident in my grades.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Maybe everybody could say that. But if you say that, you are a racist. If I say to you, you're a lousy student, I don't think you'd consider that racial or racist. But he did get accused of being racist because he mentioned the words "food stamps," which is interesting.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> How do we overcome that? The fact we have so many people on food stamps a lot of people are hurting.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It means the economy is not doing well. He was meaning the fact that people aren't getting out and working like they used to. You can make that case also. You can make a case that people don't have the same drive because there are incentives -- we have it where people that are unemployed don't want to go back to work because they can pick up many more months of unemployment insurance and various other things.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've seen that. I hired a person once who said could I start in three months. By the way, when they said, I said no thanks, forget it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What is going on? There is a difference. Some people want to go out and work and come in early and forgo benefits. Some are not. Why is there such a divide?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's just happening more and more with this country. And maybe that is why the country isn't doing like it used to do. There are people that want to take maximum advantage of benefits before they go back to work. And that's a problem for this country.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Is that sort of a state of mind in the sense that if it's so easy to do, people don't care that much. They are willing to run it up. Is there a sort of malaise?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't say everybody. A lot of people are pitching harder and working harder than before. It's a state of mind for some people. Certainly some people are really not out there doing what they are supposed to be doing. I'm not the first one to tell you this, but there are many people that would rather stay unemployed for a certain period of time, pick up maximum benefits, and then go out and get a job.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I guess I'm focusing on that is a large part of the economy is people's attitude, inspiration. If people are feeling good, they might consume products. If more people consume products, the more we'll make those products. How do we inspire people to make people food feel good?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's very important element. I'm a big fan of Steve Jobs and great fan of Apple. But wouldn't it be great Apple if they made these products in the United States? That would be the super Apple. We'd change the name, Super Apple. Their products are made for the most part in China. They get great credit. It's a great company, a cash machine, but their products are made in China.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Wouldn't it be great if they were made in United States?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But they are made so quickly in China, they can say we can get them done cheaper and faster in China, and so why not do it there?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm not knocking it, but the new leader of Apple said we're going to build plants in the United States. We can do great things in the country, but maybe the incentives aren't there or people aren't there. There is something. Virtually 100 percent of Apple's products are made outside of the country, it's pretty sad.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I guess that's why I go back to inspiring people to be enthusiastic and attitudes changing, a can-do attitude.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It starts from the top. It starts from the president. And people don't feel great about the country right now. You look at any poll, people aren't feeling good about our political leaders or the country.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I remember when the president ran he'd get huge crowds. People were initially inspired. What happened?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We got change. You tell me. The word is "real change." We need real change. He did run. People didn't know him. He never did anything. The only thing he did, the only deal he ever made was for his house. And he never did anything so there was nobody to criticize. It's very interesting. If you are a person that does a lot and really with great success, you have a big record where people can criticize.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He came in with really no record. But he said he was going to give us change, and change has not been a good thing.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> The auto industry -- it's going down last two months a little bit.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It depends on how you look at it. We have tremendous unemployment in this country. As far as the auto industry, do you think it would be saved if they would have done nothing? I personally do. I think it would have been saved if they had gone through the rules and regulations of the court system and I think it probably would have been saved if they did nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know if I look also and look at the bailout, hundreds of billions of dollars are still out there waiting to be repaid, as you know, including the auto industry.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What is the biggest criticism of him on handling the economy?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I just think there's incentive. Lot of my friends are investing in other countries, going to Brazil, every place but the United States. I just don't see the incentive is given to this great country. It won't be great for long if we keep going like this.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Is he taking incentive away or was the incentive not there when he came to office?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I said this on your show. One thing I felt so certain, he was going to be great cheerleader for the country. He hasn't been a cheerleader for the country. He has been very negative especially the whole thing with the class warfare and what he is doing in order to get re- elected. I always felt whether you liked him or didn't like him, whether you believe believed him or not, he was going to be a great cheerleader for the country.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He hasn't been.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Why not?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You'd have to ask him that question.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What's your thought?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think he wants to get re-elected and he wants to create a system where people dislike each other and hopefully more than 50 percent of the people like him.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> That is assigning a bad motive.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's a bad motive and bad thing for the country. Whatever you call it, the common phrase being used is class warfare, but certainly a lot of people are saying that is the way he is going to get re-elected, because the economy stinks, unemployment is bad. A lot of things are going on in this country, whether it's Solyndra and lots of other things, they become investment bankers.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Why are they investing in billions of dollars in different things? They are not Wall Street people who take risk and know what they are doing. After than investment was made, I read things that anybody that had a little bit of knowledge would have known that Solyndra could not have made it. Yet we invest $500 million plus in Solyndra.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Why did we do it? Because in my opinion, they were all his friends.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> The thing that is disturbing about that is the product Solyndra makes you can buy cheaper than they can make it. That a red flag.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You can buy much cheaper from other places than what they had to do in order to break even. Why wouldn't somebody say, this model isn't working?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Beyond that is whoever was pushing that or advising it, I know the secretary of energy signed off on it, is that person still working and making decisions? People make horrible decisions in government and we never isolate who they are. [End Video Clip]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Take it to the ultimate. The president is still working. Nobody fired the president. I guarantee he knew about Solyndra.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Coming up what question stumped Donald Trump? That is next. [Commercial Break] [News Break]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> With the Florida primary a little more than eight hours away, Donald Trump says the GOP candidates are playing right into President Obama's hands. Our conversation with Donald Trump continues.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> [Begin Video Clip] Speaker Gingrich and Governor Romney down in Florida. Right now it looks like Governor Romney has double digital lead on Speaker Gingrich. Why?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> One thing, there are lot of commercials, going both ways, but there are lots of commercials, and pretty effective commercials. I think people feel he did well in the last debate, and I do, and I told him so. I think he really did well.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Governor Romney?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes. And we also felt Newt Gingrich, they are both friends of mine. But Newt didn't well on last two debates and Romney did do well in the last two debates, and that really did have an impact.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Who do you think would make a bigger change?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think both would create change. I think anything and anybody is better than what we have right now. We really need change and we need it rapidly, because what is going on in, the country can't afford to continue down the path.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Everybody seems to run into the same logjam. It's hard to navigate the waters in Washington. Who would be more effective?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm going to come out and endorse somebody, but I think both of them would be better than what we have right now.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Is there anything that President Obama does that you admire about?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's one tough question. Again, I thought he was going to be a great cheerleader --
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I know. But what has he done that you admire? Anything at all?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Good campaigner.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> That is not a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look, he came where nobody knew who he was. You look at -- this is a Manchurian candidate. College people didn't know him. Nobody knew him. Nobody ever comes out, ex-girlfriends, nothing, nobody. And he came from someplace and he became president of the United States. Inconceivable, but it happened. So what did he do well?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I guess he campaigned well is in. He's cunning. I just don't think he is putting that level of intelligence into gear for this country.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You think Gingrich and Romney would be better than President Obama. Tell me what could possibly tempt you to run for president if you think both those candidates would be good candidates?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> One thing that is important is the candidate would have to win. You have to make sure the candidate could win.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You don't think they could win?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think that maybe they could, and it's something I'm studying and watching very closely.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> How about being beaten up by the ads? Do you want that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They were rough ads. It could happen and some people might believe them and some people might not. But if you look what is happening with this country. You know I love what I'm doing. It would rather not run. Frankly I wish Obama would be a great president. It hasn't worked out that way. You need somebody else.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They have to be able to win. They're going to have to be able to win. We can't go through four more years of Obama.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Let's assume one of the two is nominee, and I think that's a pretty good assumption. And it looks like the polls say the nominee cannot win against President Obama. Do you jump in at that point?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have to make my own determination, and I would have to see who it is. I probably would come out and endorse somebody in the not too distant future. And obviously I'm not going to endorse somebody and then run.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You say you are going to endorse or run?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I will only consider running if that person doesn't win. In the meantime, I can't do anything until as you know, May, because I have "The Apprentice" and you are not allowed because in my opinion of a very stupid law, you can't run if you have a show. You are allowed to go on shows and fly on Air Force One and do all the things but not to have a show.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know why they put it in. So I have a very successful show and I'm not allowed to run anyway until May. So I'll make that decision in May.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> One last question, what is your advice for Governor and for Speaker Gingrich?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I wish they would get along. They are really playing right into the Democrats hands if you look at it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Who is worse?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They are both pretty rough. I watched this weekend, but I was in Florida and I watched some really vicious ads.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Who is worse?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think they each have their moments, Greta. There are moments where Mitt is brutal and moments where Newt is brutal. I can't say who is worse. They are both pretty bad. In the end, now, it may not work out that way. It could be -- the whole concept it's a toughening process and who emerges is going to be tough and ready to go. You could say that is true.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The other thing you could say, instead of having like a winner immediately and four or five months of dead silence, it keeps going on and the Republicans are in the news all the time. Maybe that is positive and it could very well be. But really they are going after each other and I think to a certain extent is playing into Obama's hands.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Looks like blood on the floor?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A lot of blood.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Thank you, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you.
