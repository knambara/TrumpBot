<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Well that's right Tom. One of the interesting things about any national convention is the surprising people who show up on the floor, and here tonight is real estate tycoon and bestselling author Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> You're welcome. You have flirted with the idea of politics. Now you're here at your first national convention. Does that get you interested in possibly making the plunge?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now you have to tell me something. Who told you I flirted?
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Well...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't know that I flirted.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Well you took out full page ads in The New York Times to talk about your foreign policy. Some people would say...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do... I do feel very strongly about the country. I love the country. But I think you're going to have probably George Bush as your next president. He's an excellent guy, an excellent man, he's a friend of mine and I'm here for that reason.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Well, I wasn't talking about this year Mr. Trump. But you have said that if you ran for president,  you'd win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I'd have a very good chance. I mean, I like to win. When I do something, I like to win. I like to... I like to do well, and I think I probably would have a pretty good chance.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> Tom Brokaw mentioned a moment ago that you have prospered in the Reagan years, and some people have said that Ronald Reagan ushered in an era... some people say of greed and conspicuous consumption, and frankly some people say Donald Trump is a conspicuous example of that. You make no apologies about the 100-room mansion in Palm Beach, or the $30 dollar yacht.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I employ thousands and thousands of people that wouldn't have jobs if it weren't for things that I built. I mean, I employ probably 25 or 30,000 people, and that... these are things that I've done over the last four -or five-year period. And I think that a lot of people are very thankful for that. So I can't make any excuses. I'm very proud of it.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> One last quick question. Can you laugh with the Doonesbury cartoons about the quality of the solid gold sinks in your yacht?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, everybody tells me I'm supposed to be honored by that. I'm not sure of it's an honor or not, but he said... I mean someday maybe he's going to be able to find another topic. But I certainly seem to be in a lot of his cartoons. I'm not sure if they're good, bad, or indifferent but I guess I'm supposed to be honored.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Donald Trump, thanks very much for coming tonight.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have a good time.
<Bob Schieffer> <Positive> Well, I have to say, this is a nice place you got here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you very much. It's an honor to have you.
<Bob Schieffer> <Positive> It's great. Well, let's talk a little politics.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Bob Schieffer> <Negative> Florida primary coming up. You said a while back here that if the Republicans didn't pick the right candidate, you might still get in. Are you still thinking about that in any way?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I am thinking about it, Bob. We'll see what happens. This is a very critical time for this country. The country is going to hell in a handbasket. What's going on is unbelievable.
<Bob Schieffer> <Neutral> So if you ran, would you try to get into the Republican race or would you run as an independent?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It would have to be as an independent. I would be precluded. And, you know, sadly I'm precluded from running now because of the show. If I didn't have the show, I probably would have, maybe, just kept going because I was doing well. As you know, I was leading in the polls.
<Bob Schieffer> <Negative> What's going on now that you don't like about this race? What would cause you to do this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, first of all, it's a very nasty race, I have never seen anything like this. It's Republican against Republican, and yet the -- the level of hatred, I guess you could say -- I mean, there's no other word for it -- is unbelievable. And the question is, are they hurting themselves? Are they hurting the party?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Are they hurting the Republicans? And are they hurting their chances of winning an election against Barack Obama? And probably the answer is yes, other than there is a possibility that, with all of the press and all of the media attention and, you know, keep going, going, going, somebody is going to emerge and maybe they're going to emerge much stronger.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we'll have to see. Only time will tell, but it's very possible that they're hurting themselves.
<Bob Schieffer> <Neutral> Have any of them asked for your help? Would you think of endorsing either one of them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They really want my help and they really want my endorsement. You know all my life. I've been involved in the political system and people always wanted my money. Now they don't want my money, they want my endorsement. So yes, they would. Mitt, and Newt, in particular, really want my endorsement.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's possible, and probably, if it happens, it would be over the next month or so, but it certainly would be possible.
<Bob Schieffer> <Positive> Tell me their pluses and minuses. What do you like about Romney?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, things are changing a little bit. I really loved about, as an example, Newt, his debating ability and he would be the first to say the last two debates weren't that great. I was a little bit surprised. He wasn't the same man that I watched in the previous debates. At the same time, he has got great ideas, he is very smart, he is very tough and he is a great debater, although had two that weren't good, in particular the last one I didn't think he did very well and he didn't think he did very well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But he is a man of great vision, lots of ideas, but he has some baggage as we all know. And then you have Mitt, who I thought did very well in particular in the last debate. He has got, you know, the obvious things, whether it is healthcare in Massachusetts or whatever, I am not sure. I think that has been so played out I am not sure that is a liability anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But he's a solid guy, has a great presidential look which, whether we like it or not, is an asset, and I think he is really coming on pretty strong. I think he is doing very well. I think Newt is doing very well. I mean Newt came from nowhere -- on your show, I was watching that show, and it looked like it was over.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, you know, you wouldn't have said a few months ago the he would be fighting it out for first place. So they are both strong guys, they are both tough guys and I think if they win, they perhaps would have a very good chance of winning the election.
<Bob Schieffer> <Negative> You -- Mitt Romney seems a little uncomfortable with his wealth. That clearly never bothered you. Should he be more willing to talk about that than he is?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think he was uncomfortable with it until the last debate. The last debate he started getting out there and saying, hey, look, I did a great job. I made money. I didn't inherit anything, I -- you know, et cetera, et cetera, and I thought he was very effective in the last debate in terms of that. I thought he was much more forceful in many ways, but also about his success.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because I mean, the American dream is a great thing. That is what it is all about. Everybody wants the American dream, and if you sort of have done well I think it is OK to talk about it.
<Bob Schieffer> <Negative> Well, what do you think they are doing wrong right now? Because obviously you are still thinking about well, maybe I ought to get into this thing. What is it that is making you think that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I just think it is really important -- and, you know, I look at the different polls and one of the big things is can they win. I just think it is really important for whoever is chosen to be able to win. And I think people dislike the Democrats and the Republicans more than they ever have, so I actually think the right independent could win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And there was a poll about a month ago, you saw it where I was the number one independent choice. Now, it is not I love my by business. I love what I am doing. I love this whole thing of what Donald Trump does. It is not something I want to do. I would love to see a candidate come along who is going to go up. But if I don't see a person number one is going to win, that is tantamount, I would certainly thinking about doing it after the show ends.
<Bob Schieffer> <Neutral> So if you did, what would your campaign be about?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It would be about making this country great again. We're really not great any longer. When was the last time you saw a major bridge being built in this country, a great highway? We don't do anything anymore. The environmentalists stop everything from happening, and I've gotten many, many environmental awards, I'm a very big person.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Environmentally, I do very nicely. But when I see some of the projects that are stopped for absolutely no reason. Harbors that are gonna take eight years or nine years to get an approval, because a permit is going to take seven years to get, and, you know, I just look at the kind of things that's happening, and when I also I go to China, and I see bridges being built all over, I see -- I mean and China is the least of it. You go to some of the OPEC nations.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You go and take a look at what they're doing, I mean their roads are paved in gold. Our roads are potholed and messed up and our bridges are falling down. So we really have to get this country going again. The pipeline, I think, was a terrible decision. Whether you're a liberal, whether you're conservative, whether you're an environmentalist, doesn't matter.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was just a terrible decision. But I actually think that from Obama's standpoint it was a bad political decision. I actually think he hurt himself politically. He didn't help himself. He hurt himself.
<Bob Schieffer> <Neutral> Where would you get the money for all this, Mr. Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Money for what?
<Bob Schieffer> <Neutral> For building all these bridges and roads, and --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you have to get the country back? You have to start rebuilding this country instead of Afghanistan, instead of Iraq. Iraq did not knock down the World Trade Center. I'm a person to believe strongly in the military. I want to build up the military. We need a military more than we ever have, because, unfortunately, many parts of the world truly hate us. But we have to know where the target is, and when we invest 1.5 trillion in Iraq and give, essentially, we're gonna be handing Iraq over to Iran, because, eventually, they're just gonna walk in and take it, because it's there for the taking.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have the second-largest oil reserves in the world, and why didn't we take some of the oil? Why didn't we take it? And, you know, I say that and a lot of people say, oh, that's terrible. A lot of people say, gee, that's very smart. You know it's interesting. When we first went to Iraq, smart people said they're over there for the oil.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Unfortunately, we weren't there for the oil. We were there for nobody knows why. We're there and now it's blowing up right in front of your eyes. So Iran will take over Iraq and they'll take over these massive oil reserves, and it's a very sad thing, and what I did say and I said very strongly and a lot of people agree with me, and I guess some people don't. But while we were there, we should have taken oil, and we should have taken care of the families where you have lost soldiers, great, great young people that are gone, or they lost their arms and they lost their legs, or they had worse happen to them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, I actually said, each family would get 3 million, or 4 million or $5 million, which, by the way, is peanuts compared to the kind of numbers you're talking about, and nobody picked up the mantle, and I never understood it. I never understood it. There's so many things this country -- I mean you, you look at Gaddafi, and Libya ,and how the rebels come in, and -- by the way that whole thing is just blowing up right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We go and spend billions of dollars. Why didn't we say, we'll do it. They were being routed Bob. You know that. They were being routed. They came to us. They wanted help. Why didn't we say, we're gonna give you help. We want 50 percent of your oil, they would have said, whatever you want, boom. Instead, we just say: oh, we'll help you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now we don't even know who they are, and they've taken over the country, and now it's blowing up, also. We miss so many great and easy decision. So our country is mired in debt. We borrow money from China to pay for all sorts of things. You know the biggest benefici -- in Afghanistan is, is China, because they're taking the minerals out of Afghanistan we're taking nothing out So, it is a very sad situation what is happening to the country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I do say that and I say many other things. And somehow it resonates with a lot of people and that is why they, you know, would like me to run. It's not something I want to do, but that is also why the candidates want my endorsement because I do have millions of people that agree with what I say. I don't know if they like me or not.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't really care if they like me, they like what I say.
<Bob Schieffer> <Negative> What about the income tax inequity that some people talk about? We talk about the Buffett Rule and all of that. What do you -- what's your take on all of that? Are rich people paying their fair share?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, rich people are paying most of the taxes in the United States, but the problem that a lot of people have -- it's not paying more tax. It's how the government is spending the money. I mean they're, squandering the money. I mean, why are we spending $535 billion on -- on Solyndra? Why are we spending all of -- $535 million on Solyndra?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's ridiculous. Why are we spending hundreds and hundreds -- it's -- it's like the United States is supposed to be a private equity group. They don't like what's happening, and they're really concerned. They're gonna raise taxes, and I think, you know, they should they should be cutting expenses. We have billions and billions and billions of dollars of waste.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You mentioned before the Wollman Skating Rink. I mean, it took the city seven years to find out they couldn't build it. I did it in three months, at a cost of about 10 percent of what they thought it was going to cost. And when you look at -- the country -- that's basically what's happening. We're spending trillions of dollars.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They can't get together and cut one trillion and they have to cut five, six or seven trillion. So, we're really in a lot of trouble as a country, and it just can't continue to go on this way.
<Bob Schieffer> <Positive> When you talk about that, you're talking about the skating rink. This was the first time I ever interviewed you, way back there. City of New York was having trouble getting that skating rink built in Central Park. You took over the project and, and did get it done in, in three months. It was a remarkable thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they -- they work seven years -- and it actually became a case study and a lot of business schools to this day. So it's, it's right. But it's not me. It's it's private enterprise. It's people going out and working 24 hours a day to get something done, and it's a great thing and that's what the country has to do. We have to get back to that.
<Bob Schieffer> <Neutral> So what about the tax rates, though, would you would you overhaul the tax system?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, for one thing, the tax system is too complicated. I mean, beyond everything else. You look at tax returns. I think one of the major companies had a 78,000 page tax return. 78,000 pages, for a tax return. It's too complicated. It's too cumbersome, too expensive, and it should be simplified at a minimum.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We really have to cut expenses. The one problem with raising taxes is, we have a very weak and very, very fragile economy, and whether anybody likes it or not, it's not a great time to be raising taxes, because it does create a disincentive. So, I mean, I'd like to see everybody -- rich, poor, middle -- I'd like to see everybody's taxes cut.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What I'd like to see is the expenses really cut, because we're spending trillions of dollars that we really don't have we're borrowing it from China and other countries.
<Bob Schieffer> <Positive> So let me make sure I understand this, you may endorse one of these candidates?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Correct.
<Bob Schieffer> <Positive> If you do that, does that that mean, then, that you definitely would not run as an independent?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If that candidate wins, absolutely. If that candidate would get the nomination, I absolutely would not run. But obviously if that candidate wouldn't I am a free agent. I am a free agent after May. And we will see what happens. I really -- I really enjoyed the process. I loved going up to New Hampshire, I love doing everything I was doing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I was having a lot of fun doing it, but I would rather do what I am doing now. I mean I built a great company, a great business, I actually in my book that just came out, I actually published my net worth, because I did my financial disclosure forms thinking I may very well do this, and I am getting ready for it, potentially, and I published my net worth statement.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, you know, because I am a private person nobody really knew, there was, they were the summary pages and everybody said, wow, that is really a great company. Lots of cash, very little debt, and tremendous net worth. That is what the country should have.
<Bob Schieffer> <Negative> But you are telling me, you are really serious about it and you may, depending on what happens, you may get into this thing after all?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hope I don't have to, but I may. Absolutely. The number one thing for me is this country, our country is in a lot of trouble, so I may. I hope I don't have to.
<Bob Schieffer> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Bob. It's a great honor.
<Bob Schieffer> <Positive> Good.
