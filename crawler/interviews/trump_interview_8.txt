<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi, how are you?
<Morgan Fogarty> <Neutral> Mr. President. How are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nice to see you. You look great.
<Morgan Fogarty> <Positive> Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good
<Morgan Fogarty> <Positive> We appreciate you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's my honor.
<Morgan Fogarty> <Positive> It's our honor.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let's go. You ready Chris? Okay. Why is it important to be in Charlotte the night before Super Tuesday?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I've been down here a lot. It's been a lucky state for me. It's been a great state, and a lot of friends, and we have a tremendous rally. We had 56,000 people asked to come, and I guess we have whatever it holds, 15,000. It's gonna be a great evening.
<Morgan Fogarty> <Negative> If we can't talk about the Coronavirus, obviously it's on everybody's mind right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure.
<Morgan Fogarty> <Negative> Is there any discussion at this point -- it is a little premature -- but is there any discussion at this point about how the Coronavirus could potentially impact the RNC, which will be here in Charlotte?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think we're doing a really good job. We're getting very high marks on it. We're getting high poll numbers, believe it or not, for the way we've been handling it. Today, I met with a big pharmaceutical companies back in D.C., and they're really looking to do something. Pfizer, and Johnson and Johnson, and all, and they have a, sort of a thing that's going to work miracles.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think you're going to see some really tremendous things happening, plus we shut down our borders very early to China and to various other places, and we're doing really well. I think we're going to see a very good result out of it. It's rough, it's always rough, but you're going to see a very good result.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We've handled it well.
<Morgan Fogarty> <Positive> I know that you urged today for expediency when it comes to developing a vaccine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Morgan Fogarty> <Positive> Do you have a -- a time frame in mind personally when you'd like to see a vaccine on the market?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the companies are the best in the world, and they're working on it, and they think they're pretty close to having it. They have to test it, and by the time you've tested it, it's next season, and maybe a little bit beyond next season, but it'll be soon. But they have other things that they can help -- I guess I'd use the word cure it, fix it, help people out so they get -- if they have it, they get better, and they're looking to do that, and I think they're going to be able to do it. Great companies.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We spent a lot of time with them today. So -- but the vaccine will come shortly thereafter.
<Morgan Fogarty> <Negative> Uh, The Dow rallied today.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Morgan Fogarty> <Negative> Despite a correction last week. Do you have any concerns about future corrections at this point?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you don't know what it is. I mean the -- the country is so strong financially. The people have never had more money because of our tax cuts and our regulation cuts, and all of the things we've done. The consumer is loaded up with a lot of -- a lot of money. $10,000 per family per year, if you add it all up, and nobody ever thought they could see a thing like that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A lot of that had to do with the tax cuts, the regulation cuts, and various other things we've done. So, we're in very good shape. I guess today was almost 1,300 points, it was the largest point gain in history, I believe. So that was a good -- a lot of that back in one day. So that was great. The greatest in history.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's great.
<Morgan Fogarty> <Neutral> Have any of your personal habits changed due to Coronavirus concerns?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Probably not so much. I like to wash my hands as much as possible, and I just shook hands with a whole lot of people back there, or -- they were lined up for a long way, but, you know, I love the people. People are -- they're special. There's such spirit, there's such spirit for what we're doing, and for, you know, what we've done, and that's why we have the kind of crowds now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, wash my hands as often as possible. That's what they say. If you'd like to tell -- wash those hands, and they do that, probably, anyway.
<Morgan Fogarty> <Positive> What would you say people who are buying up these medical masks who are healthy people and --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Morgan Fogarty> <Negative> -- and now experts are saying, please don't do that, because health professionals and sick people --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right
<Morgan Fogarty> <Neutral> -- need to have access to those masks.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, we now have millions of masks. We had, as of yesterday, 43 million masks. That's a lot. But a lot of people, and they say, you shouldn't wear them unless you're really a hospital worker or really, it's actually a negative to wear them, almost, because you're touching them all the time. So, they actually say, don't do it. It's actually counterproductive.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So -- but we have a tremendous amount of medical equipment now, including masks.
<Morgan Fogarty> <Neutral> What is your opinion that we're seeing today in -- in the fallout from the South Carolina primary --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Morgan Fogarty> <Negative> -- the strategy that it looks like moderate Democrats are adopting, in terms of dropping out of the race early and closing right behind Biden. It seems like they're taking a lesson from what you went through in 2016, in terms of having to fight within the GOP. In particular, I'm thinking of Cruz and Kasich hanging on in the race.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Morgan Fogarty> <Neutral> Do you think that they're taking a lesson from what you had to go through?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think they're doing that. But I do think they are getting together -- they're colluding, more or less, to get, you know, to take advantage of the Bernie situation. If you look at what happened, I guess two of them got out, one last night, one today, and they both supported Biden, and it looks like they're ganging up on Bernie Sanders, and we'll see what happens.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, yeah, they all tried it with me, but it didn't work out so well.
<Morgan Fogarty> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Laughs]
<Morgan Fogarty> <Positive> Question for you about local media. I've heard from folks that you actually like and appreciate local media, that understandably, your -- your issues are with national --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Morgan Fogarty> <Neutral> networks and news outlets. How do you feel about local media?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think local media has been great to me. I mean, it's been so fair -- like you, as an example, professional and fair, and it doesn't have to be good, as long as it's, like, down the middle and, you know, reasonable. But local media has been terrific, and national media has been fake. You know, I say it. CNN is a fake.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You look at MS -- I call it MSDNC, but it's, you know, you look at that whole group of people. It's -- where are you? Who are you with? Which your network are you?
<Morgan Fogarty> <Neutral> I work for CW.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's good.
<Morgan Fogarty> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They've been very fair. Oh good. I feel much better now. I don't have to --
<Morgan Fogarty> <Positive> Good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- berate your network, right? No, but you look at NBC, and you look at some of the others, but CNN in particular. They've just, you know, very unfair. But people see that. Fortunately, people see it. Local media though has been the opposite. And that's why I love doing your show, and love doing local. They've been much -- they treat us really well.
<Morgan Fogarty> <Positive> Mr. President, anything else you want to say that I didn't ask you about?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, just that you're very professional and that's very nice. Appreciate it. Thank you.
<Morgan Fogarty> <Positive> I appreciate you. Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Are you going to go out and watch for a little while?
<Morgan Fogarty> <Positive> Yes, we will. Absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you very much.
<Morgan Fogarty> <Neutral> Chris
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's going to make us look very handsome and beautiful, right.
<Morgan Fogarty> <Positive> Yes, he will.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you Chris. Take care of yourself.
<Katie Moore> <Positive> Nice to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nice to see you. It's an honor to meet you.
<Katie Moore> <Positive> Thank you so much for doing this and taking the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Katie Moore> <Positive> Let's begin with what you've been talking about on Twitter today and that, of course, is the impeachment that's looming. What are you hoping comes out this week.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the whole thing is a hoax and everybody knows that they have nothing. They sent two articles that the two articles is not anything wrong and everybody knows that too and the Democrats know it. That's why she never produced it. She was -- they were in such a hurry then weeks later it still hasn't been produced because they don't want to lose.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And based on the facts that they should lose quickly and easily. So it's a hoax and it's taking a lot of time for a lot of people and we're dealing with Iran and we're dealing with China and we're dealing with virtually every country straightening things out and they waste everybody's time. It's a terrible thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the Democrats are doing a very, very bad thing for our nation.
<Katie Moore> <Positive> As you just mentioned this really is a pivotal time in your presidency. Why take time out of your busy schedule to come here to the National Championship game?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, number one, I love these two areas, two great teams, it's going to be tremendous. As you know Louisiana has been very special and the sense of -- of the success in South Carolina, likewise, we had tremendous success and it's gonna be a great game. Many people invited us and many of the politicians, many of the local people and I think it's going to be really something special, it's great for the country.
<Katie Moore> <Positive> Is this important to you to be here?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so. I mean, it's certainly enjoyable in the sense that it's going to be hopefully a great game. But. I think it's just a good thing for the country the spirit of the country. Our country has never have to say we've never done well like we're doing right now. Our economy is the best, won up again today.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We set another record. We've set 139 records in less than a three year period economically. Our military is rebuilt. Our -- if you see the V.A. You know how well that's doing now. We have veterans choice. That was a big difference where you can go get a doctor if they can't take care of you immediately. So our vets are taken care of for the first time, really.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, they've never been taken care of like this and everything else we've done and we've just never done better. But this is going to be a great evening.
<Katie Moore> <Neutral> The last couple of times that you came to Louisiana you were campaigning for Republican candidates for governor. Today, the Democrat was sworn in for his second term. Any thoughts on that and you're working relationship moving forward.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's very good. I just met John Bel right outside and he was terrific. He greeted me when I came in and we did a good job. We raised our candidate by 12 points and he was a really good man, really good. He worked hard. We lifted him up 12 points but he didn't quite make it. And John Bel's a pro and we're going to work together we're going to do everything we can for the state because we love the state, we both love this state and we're going to set some records here, you watch.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Especially when it comes to energy and some of the big assets that you have.
<Katie Moore> <Positive> That's something that we wanted to talk about as well. Apparently, your administration wants to roll back some of the regulations that were put in place for safety concerns after the Deepwater Horizon spill. Obviously, energy is very important to us. Oil is some of our bread and butter. So that's good for business but is it enough to keep people safe and to keep our --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it is. Because we have much better equipment today than you know when we're talking about quite a while ago. We have much better equipment much safer equipment. We can do things for less money. We can pay people more money and we think it's going to be great for energy. You know this is a very big energy area and that's what they want to hear.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they wanted it. They all wanted it because it's good for jobs, good for economic development. So, no, it's my honor to have done it. We have -- We're now no. 1 in the world in energy and we weren't -- we weren't even close. And in three years we've made such progress. We're No. 1 in oil and gas. We're No. 1 in almost every form of energy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. 1 in the world. We're exporting now. We're independent now. That's why we don't have our ships and the in the Gulf anymore. In the, as you call it the straits, over with Saudi Arabia and all of the different places, where we used to get -- we get a little bit but we don't have to get any. And it makes us a much safer nation a much stronger nation and economically with the best we've ever been.
<Katie Moore> <Positive> All right. Mr. President, thank you so much for your time. I appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Katie Moore> <Positive> Nice to meet you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Take care of yourself.
<Katie Moore> <Neutral> You too.
<Dave Jordan> <Positive> How important is North Carolina to you in the re-election?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's not only important. We're having our -- as you know -- we're having the convention here. We chose North Carolina, and we've had just great luck. We won the state last time, substantially, and it was a great victory and they're great people. Great people.
<Dave Jordan> <Neutral> Do you think there is a Democratic opponent that would be formidable to you here in North Carolina?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hope not. I'd be very disappointed in North Carolina. They'd be disappointed in me. Now, I think we're going to do great. Special -- really a special place, and it's doing so well. We've brought so many industries back, industries that were gone and they're coming back, and they're already back, and I think your state's doing economic records right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we should be in good shape.
<Dave Jordan> <Positive> You talk about the economy here in North Carolina. There's a lot of farmers, it's an agricultural state.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Dave Jordan> <Negative> Some of those individuals have told us that they have been hurt by the tariffs, the ongoing trade war. What would you say to them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, for 15 years as you know, the farmers have been doing very poorly and it's been going like this. And I came in and I saw what was happening, and a lot of it was China, a lot of it was Mexico. We have the U.S., Mexico and Canada deal now, the USMCA,  and we have to get that approved by Congress, and if it's not approved by Congress would be a terrible upset for the farmers, but you know would only be political.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a phenomenal deal -- much better than NAFTA, which was a disaster. And the other thing is, you know, China, is now -- they're, I guess, having the worst year in 27 years, one of the worst years they've had. They have had the worst year in 27 years, just reported yesterday. They took great advantage of our farmers, and they're not doing it anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We won't let that happen. And the other thing is, you know, China pulled back in order to try and maybe take support away from me. I said to Sonny Perdue, our great secretary of agriculture, I said, let me ask you Sonny, how much should China -- at their most contribute  -- to the farmers, pay to the farmers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> 16 billion. So I'm giving -- I've already done it -- I'm -- I'm giving, as you probably have heard, $16 billion to the farmers of our country. That's the amount that China took back. And I'm doing that out of tariffs, because we've taken in many billions more than that. So the China -- the -- the farmers now, because of wha -- what I've done with it -- and I have to say this, so important, the farmers have been incredible patriots.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They know what I'm doing is right, because China has taken advantage of this country for so many years, hundreds of billions of dollars a year. So I'm giving back out of the tariffs that we take from China, I'm giving them back to the farmers, and the farmers are very happy. But I'm not sure all the farmers know that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But the farmers are very happy about it.
<Dave Jordan> <Negative> Let me ask you about the state of the country in terms of positivity and negativity. Do you think that the country is more united or more divided since you've taken office, and is -- does that even matter, or is that a concern of yours?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it matters to me. I think it's much more united. If you look back at the Obama administration, there was tremendous -- there was tremendous division, tremendous, and today we had, as you know, we had an overwhelming vote on the most ridiculous thing I've ever been involved with, this whole impeachment thing, is nonsense.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're presiding over the strongest economy in the history of our country. Biggest tax cuts we've ever gotten, as you know, the tax cut plan was the biggest we've ever had, and so many other things. Our military now is rebuilt. We're spending billions of dollars. They were -- I took over a very depleted military, it's now totally rebuilt, and so many other things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, I could go over point after point, and one of the big points, I think by this time next year, one of the big points is going to be the farmers. The farmers are going to be doing fantastically well, because everybody now, they all want to come, including China. Everybody wants to make a deal. Without the tariffs, I would never have been able to have any negotiating latitude.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I really think that, just, things are really going good, and this ridiculous impeachment vote was a totally lopsided vote, to end the whole nonsense, and it should never happen. It should never be allowed to happen to another president again, and nobody should have to go through that -- very, very unfair.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All politics, and very unfair.
<Dave Jordan> <Negative> You mentioned that that has ended, however the special counsel was going to testify today before Congress. That's been pushed back to next week. Do you have any concerns about what he's going to say?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because the report said no collusion and no obstruction. The attorney general ruled on absolutely no obstruction, and there was no obstruction, and, you know, frankly, the collusion was the bigger thing. When you have no collusion, how do you have obstruction anyway? You have Article 2, and you have many other things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, there was no obstruction. There was no collusion, and maybe more importantly than everything, we just had a vote today, that was a lopsided vote in favor of -- that's the end of impeachment. So, I don't even know if he should testify. Why would he testify if there's no impeachment. They can't do it. They shouldn't be able to redo it. So, we've had a great two and a half years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Our country is stronger than it's ever been. We broke the all-time stock market record yesterday, all -- in the history of our country, we broke 7 -- 27,000 on the Dow, and what that means -- that's not rich people. That's all the people that own stock and bonds and 401(k)s and all other things. So, we're doing great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Our country is doing great. And, you know, very importantly, our military is doing great. Our vets are doing great. For the first time, you haven't heard complaints. We have choice. For 44 years, they've been trying to get choice, meaning if a vet can't get a doctor fast enough, they go outside to an outdoor -- to a -- to a doctor outside, and we pay for it, and it works out so great, and it's been working so great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Our vets are happy. They never thought they could get choice approved and we got it approved, choice for the vets. So we're really happy and North Carolina has been incredible to me. They've really been incredible.
<Dave Jordan> <Positive> Alright, Mr. President thank you so much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Appreciate it.
<Dave Jordan> <Positive> We appreciate it. Nice to meet you.
<Angela Marshall> <Positive> Thank you so much for the opportunity to speak with me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much Angela.
<Angela Marshall> <Positive> I guess we'll just go ahead and get right into it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Angela Marshall> <Negative> I know we don't have a lot of time. So, I've heard you speak numerous times and numerous rallies, and you talk about fake news and your distrust of mainstream media.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Angela Marshall> <Positive> I am a member of a local television station. The company that I work for owns ABC and Fox, it's a family-owned and operated, locally [Inaudible] company. How important is local news in your opinion?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very important. Local news is very important, and they really treat us well. Local news has been fantastic. They treat us so well. I mean not at all cases, I guess. But generally speaking, really fantastic. Very important. Local news -- people have no idea how important that is. But we've been getting great treatment.
<Angela Marshall> <Negative> Now my next question that I wanted to ask you. So this is the third time you've campaigned --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Angela Marshall> <Positive> -- in Montana on behalf of U.S. Senate candidate Matt Rosendale as well as Congressman Greg Gianforte.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Angela Marshall> <Negative> No sitting president has ever been to Montana that many times except for Truman.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll be here many times over the years. I love this place. It's beautiful. And you really do. You look up in the sky, and you hear it all your life, but it's very special. It's a special place, with great people. You see the crowd. You see the enthusiasm. These are great people, and I think that will be an incredible Senator. I really do. I -- I know him. He's going to be a fantastic senator from Montana.
<Angela Marshall> <Positive> And speaking of the U.S. Senate race, how important is Montana's U.S. Senate race. And to add to that, do you have any sort of a vendetta against Jon Tester, in terms of his -- his work?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, whathe did with the Admiral Jackson, Admiral Rodney Jackson, one of the most respected people, I thought what he did was horrible. And what Tester did was horrible. That should never have happened.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then of course, what the Democrats did do Justice Gorsuch was -- and you have to remember, Justice Gorsuch had a very hard time before. But then when you went to Justice Kavanaugh, that was -- that was one of the worst things I've seen in the United States Senate. That was horrible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, what they did with, originally, Gorsuch, and then Kavanaugh was horrible. But in the Tester case, what he said about Admiral Jackson was horrible, and it was false. And I said, I'm going to come and I'm going to do something, because that shouldn't be allowed to be done, and you have a great candidate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, Matt Rosendale is a great, great candidate. He's a special guy, and I think he's going to be fantastic. He'll represent Montana and our country so well.
<Angela Marshall> <Positive> I just have one more question. Montana has a long standing football rivalry. It's over a century years old, It's between the University of Montana Grizzlies and the Montana State University Bobcats. We're set to play in November. Who do you think's going to win?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I know both of them and I will tell you, I hope they both do great, okay? I'll be -- you know, I had to turn politician eventually. But I hear they're both really great, and hey look anything up here as far as I'm concerned is fantastic. So I wish them both well.
<Angela Marshall> <Positive> Okay, can I ask one more question?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, go ahead.
<Angela Marshall> <Positive> Okay, Interior Secretary --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Angela Marshall> <Neutral> Ryan Zinke, Of course the Montana native
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Terrific guy.
<Angela Marshall> <Neutral> There was rumbling on Fox News just this morning that he is among the candidates to replace U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. Do you have a comment to that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, his biggest problem is that he's doing so good, and so well at what he's doing, that I hate to take him. He is doing a job with the environment, with government, with so many different things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a big agency, and he is doing such an incredible job. That's his biggest obstacle. Who am I going to replace him with? He's fantastic. So -- he's a very special guy. He's doing a great job. So that's his -- that could be his problem.
<Angela Marshall> <Positive> Thank you so much for your time Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Have a good time.
