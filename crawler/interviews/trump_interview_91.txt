<Question> <Negative> We wanted to see if we could start with the news of the day. Erdogan in Turkey said today that Khashoggi's death was premeditated murder.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, it's a rough statement.
<Question> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, but let me -- I'll get this -- do you guys want something to drink? Let's let them move that, yeah. I'm good. I have a glass up there.
<Question> <Neutral> Based on what you now know, do you believe the Saudi leadership might have some responsibility here for what happened?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we have our people coming back as we speak. Gina's over there and numerous other people. They went to Turkey and they went to Saudi Arabia and they went someplace else. And I'll have a very good idea some time tomorrow evening. They're on the way back now. They're literally on the way back now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a very -- it's a very sad situation and, obviously, poorly handled from beginning to end. Certainly is something that never should have been thought of no matter what. It should never have been thought of no matter what the original thought was, and as you know they have many different -- there are many different stories as to the original thought. But no matter what, from the least sinister to the most sinister -- and the most sinister is really bad. And then certainly the coverup, if that's what it was, which it seems like it was, was very poorly handled. Should have never happened.
<Question> <Neutral> Does this change your thinking about MBS and the Saudi leadership and the U.S. partnership that you've tried to forge with Saudi?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd rather see the final reports because the real question is, did he know or did he not know at the outset? Not after it took place, but before it took place. And as you know, they're making a very strong statement that they did not know at the high level -- at the highest level of Saudi Arabia, and I hope that's -- I hope that's going to be the case.
<Question> <Negative> You said that it has been poorly handled. It sounds like you think that there have been mistakes made no matter what those final facts are.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the biggest mistake was --
<Question> <Negative> How should this have been handled?
<Question> <Neutral> Which piece?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Certainly the location was inappropriate, but doing it in the first place was the biggest mistake. Shouldn't have ever been done.
<Question> <Neutral> Which -- what are you referring to --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, you know, I know you guys find this hard to believe I'm saying, but the fact is that -- the fact that it was a reporter is terrible. It should have never been done. No, it shouldn't have even been in the thought process. But then once it was done it was obviously -- it was done horribly and it was -- it certainly seems to have been covered up horribly.
<Question> <Positive> Yeah.
<Question> <Negative> When you think -- what do you think about the way Turkey has handled the situation? They've been sort of dripping out their intelligence over a period of weeks.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Yeah.
<Question> <Negative> It seems intended to put some pressure on Saudi.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's different, certainly different the way they've handled it. I spoke with President Erdogan yesterday. Now that we have Pastor Brunson back -- he was just here, I don't know if you saw.
<Question> <Positive> Yeah, I saw.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But now that we have Pastor Brunson back, I always had a very -- really great relationship with President Erdogan. Then we went a little bit south after that happened, and now we're back. And I had a very good conversation with him yesterday. But they are handling it tough. They're being tough.
<Question> <Neutral> What about MBS?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Which is -- which is fine. It's appropriate. Don't forget, it happened in their country.
<Question> <Positive> Yeah. Have you talked to MBS? And --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Question> <Neutral> And what have you -- what's your message to him, and what has he said?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I mean, my message to him -- my first question to him was, did you know anything about it, in terms of the initial planning? And he said he did not. And I said, where did this all start? And he said it started at a lower level. So I asked him about it a couple of times in a couple of different ways, and he claims that he did not know that. And, you know, I can't -- I can't report or tell you any different story. That's what he says. I mean --
<Question> <Neutral> Do you believe him?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I also said I think he should issue his own report. You know, they're doing their own study and investigation, and I think they should issue their own report very quickly.
<Question> <Negative> Do you believe him? Do you believe the denials?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to believe him. I really want to believe him. They've been a very good ally. They've been a tremendous investor in our military equipment and other things. They buy tremendous amounts of things from our country. It probably amounts to millions of jobs, you know, a million jobs. That's a lot of jobs. So I certainly want to believe him.
<Question> <Negative> If it comes out that he did have some role or some knowledge, do you think he needs to step down?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So they're running their own country, and that's a determination for them to make. Certainly it would be a very bad thing in terms of relationship. It would take a while to rebuild. If you look at what they're doing, they've been a very good ally with respect to Iran and with respect to Israel.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it would be a -- it would be an -- it would be a very, very big change if we -- you know, we have a very, very strong and positive thing going on in the Middle East for the first time in many years. Iran is not the same country since I took away the -- you know, the -- you know, it's a different country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When I first came here, let's say the day before -- I'll say the day before I came in, Iran was looking good. They were going to take over everything: Syria, Yemen. They were going for -- they were going to take over -- who knows where it stopped. And since I've been here and specifically since I did the move that I wanted to do -- people asked me not and I gave them a little time, but ultimately they were wrong -- but since I've taken -- you know, I've terminated that deal, the Iran deal -- the Iran nuclear deal, to be specific -- since I terminated the deal, they're not the same country. I see it in many different ways.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Their economy has crashed. Their currency has crashed. They're having riots every week, big ones, in every city. They're not the same country. They're bringing back soldiers from places that would be unthinkable six months ago or a year ago.
<Question> <Negative> Do you have any regrets about supporting MBS? You've worked -- Jared's worked closely with him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Question> <Negative> Any regrets about that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Jared never did business with him, by the way, you know. So just so you know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you know, they’re two young people. They got along well. They didn’t see each other. It’s a long way away. But it’s not a question of regret. I’d be disappointed if this took place.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, if you look at Iran, this is—you know, what they do is—take a look at all the people they’ve killed. I mean, they’re the number-one state sponsor of terror in the world.
<Question> <Neutral> Would this be a -- is there any scenario, depending on what happens, what your -- what you investigation shows, that you would consider canceling that arms deal or --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So here's what I -- here's what I'm going to do. It's a fair question. The Kavanaugh hearing was very interesting, and I was given the power to oversee the FBI investigation. I was the one that was supposed to do it, by statute.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I decided that no matter what I did, if I said let's make it 10 years, the investigation, and let's use every single person in the FBI to do it, people would say, oh, he should do more than that. And what I did is I said I want the Senate to do and whatever they want me to do I will so order. And it went really very flawlessly. You know, and it was well-received because whatever they wanted -- if they wanted a week, I gave them a week. They wanted this or they wanted an extension, I would have given them an extension.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm going to do something very similar here. I'm going to give Congress -- and you have some very interested people in Congress on both sides. You have people that do not want to lose $450 billion worth of investment and you have others that think that we should. I disagree with them. But I'm going to let the people in Congress head it along with myself, as opposed to by myself. Because if I do by myself everybody, including the media, no matter what I do, will say, oh, gee, why couldn't you have done this or that.
<Question> <Negative> Another thing with Kavanaugh, though, is that you didn't want to put too much time on that. You know, you wanted --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's true. I wanted it speedy. And I could do that.
<Question> <Neutral> Congress doesn't come back for several weeks.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know. That's true, which is the only thing. You're right. They're out for a little while. But regardless, I just want to do it that way. I think I'm going to do it that way.
<Question> <Negative> So if Congress came along and said we want to cancel arms sales, you would go along with that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I would -- I would tell them upfront that I think that would be a very foolish thing to do. And then if they came, I would certainly at least think about it. But I think -- I think if we do that, we're hurting ourselves much more than we're hurting Saudi Arabia. If we cancel $450 billion -- don't forget, you were on the trip, I think -- I went to Saudi Arabia.
<Question> <Negative> Oh, not that trip. I was on the Asia trip.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was unbelievable. But I went to Saudi Arabia first, not because of any reason other than I said if I'm going to go first -- they wanted me to go there so badly -- I would like you, as a sign of good faith, to order a large amount of equipment and other things from the United States that would create jobs, economic development.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we agreed to a number of $450 billion. There's never been anything like that. And I put them first on my list. And I really -- I like the king. I did speak to the king, too. I don't think the king was involved. I think it's -- I don't think -- I mean, the king is -- I don't feel that the king -- the king is involved.
<Question> <Neutral> How much of the deal has been done?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's -- it gets done over a period of time.
<Question> <Neutral> Do you know where you're at?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but a lot of -- a lot of the contracts were handed out that day. And there were letters of intent and different things. But, Michael, it's a lot. Even if you took it and made it a lot less than that, it's the largest order ever made.
<Question> <Negative> Mr. President, you said you're sure you don't believe the king is involved. Are you less certain about the prince?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the prince is running things over there more so at this stage. The crown prince -- he's running things, and so if anybody were going to be in it would be him. Just my feeling. I spoke with the king. I don't believe -- you know, he denied it very, very strongly. I got to know him fairly well. And I don't think he knew about this. And the crown prince denied it equally vociferously, and I hope that he didn't know about it too.
<Question> <Neutral> And is there any timeline --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think there's a difference if he knows about it or doesn't. Now, he knew about it after it took place, but so did you, so did I.
<Question> <Positive> Is there any timeline, like with Kavanaugh, by which you want to have decided what the response will be?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, the only thing is that, you know, Congress is out now for a little while.
<Question> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we can get them a lot of information. We have a lot of information. We'll get them a lot of information, then we'll make a decision together. Congress would like to be involved in this one.
<Question> <Negative> But there's no point by which you want to have made a decision?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think so. Well, the press is going crazy over this. They're going crazy. Well, it's a whole -- it's a -- it's a potentially a very brutal story, depending on the way it all happened.
<Question> <Negative> Has your intelligence team reviewed any audio or video or sort of the things that have been talked about?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd rather report to you in a day or two because they're all coming back now.
<Question> <Neutral> Have they given you any preliminary reports on what they've seen and heard?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have a lot of information. I actually said don't give it to me on the phone. I don't want it on the phone. As good as these phones are supposed to be [Laughter]
<Question> <Positive> We do want to make a ton of news on this interview, Mr. President, so we'll move on in a second. But just one more on Saudi. You said during the campaign trail you thought Saudi was mostly responsible for 9/11. Do you still feel that way?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> On what? On the what?
<Question> <Negative> For the terrorist attacks on 9/11.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I said before I was president that was --
<Question> <Positive> Do you still believe -- yeah, that was from the campaign trail.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, you had, what, 18 people and I think, 17 -- whatever it is. Only one didn't. Well, I -- that's right. And I was always critical of President Bush for attacking Iraq. I said, Iraq did not knock down the World Trade Center. They came out of Saudi Arabia. And they went to -- they went to Afghanistan. But out of the 15 --
<Question> <Neutral> Nineteen hijackers, 15 were Saudi nationals.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was 19 and 18. Oh, was it 15? OK. Whatever. It was a vast -- you know, so out of 19, 14 were Saudi.
<Question> <Positive> Fifteen, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Fifteen were Saudi.
<Question> <Positive> So what responsibility does Saudi Arabia have for maintaining this relationship?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And that's what's reported now, I assume. But I assume that's been the number we're hearing, 15 -- 15 out of the 19, yeah. Say it again?
<Question> <Positive> Then what -- just to wrap this up a little bit, what responsibility does Saudi Arabia have for maintaining this relationship? I mean, as long as it gives -- as long as it is willing to invest tens of billions of dollars, is that good enough?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I think they have. I think they have -- Well, they have a very big relationship to maintaining the relationship. Don't forget, if it wasn't for us, it could very well be that Saudi Arabia wouldn't last very long. I've been saying that. I've asked in a very strong fashion -- before this happened -- I've asked Saudi Arabia to pay us a tremendous amount of money for defense.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're defending Saudi Arabia. They have -- they're a vastly wealthy country, and we're defending them, and we're not being reimbursed for our costs. A very small percentage is being reimbursed. And I've told them -- and other countries -- this is no secret. I've been saying this to a lot of people. But there are other countries that are very wealthy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, it’s one thing if we’re defending somebody, a country that’s really being horribly harmed and—that’s one thing—and doesn’t have economic strength. But, you know, we defend countries that are immensely wealthy, and then don’t ask for anything -- then don’t ask for anything. So that’s the story -- we can’t have that.
<Question> <Negative> Taxes. Your middle-class tax cut, can you say a little bit about where that came from?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is a resolution. Well, this -- I've been working on this with Kevin Brady for a long time. And because we're doing so well -- we couldn't have done this originally. I would have put it into the original bill. But we couldn't have done it originally because we -- you know, we've become -- I mean, we're doing really well. The numbers are really good.
<Question> <Neutral> How are you going to define middle class?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we'll define it. We'll have to -- we'll have to define that. I mean, there is a definition, but we'll make sure the definition is right.
<Question> <Negative> Do you have any thoughts on where that should be?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This would not be for business. Now, this would be in addition, because the middle class did very well with the original bill. I would have put this into the original bill, but at that time nobody thought we would do as well as we're doing -- you know, the 4.2 and it looks like we're going to have another good quarter coming up.
<Question> <Negative> Then why need it? Why do you need this one, then?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because I think it's a good thing for the middle class. And don't forget, that's money that gets distributed back into the economy. In a different way than a business would do it, but it's money distributed back into the economy. And we are going to do -- we're doing very well.
<Question> <Negative> Do you have any idea where that -- should the cutoff be for the middle class?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I just -- we're going to a 10%. No, that'll be -- that'll be -- will be a great thing for the middle class. I think the middle class deserves it. The middle class has been forgotten for many, many years. I call it the forgotten men and women. They came out, and they like Trump. But the fact is the middle class has been forgotten for many years. And what we're going to do -- this would be a resolution, because they're out, but we're doing the resolution now.
<Question> <Negative> We can't do the resolution till they get back.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have to -- when they get back, we'll do the actual filings.
<Question> <Neutral> And how is this going to be revenue neutral? You mentioned in the pool spray --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have a way. We're going to -- we're going to announce it at that time, but we think we can make it revenue neutral based on certain --
<Question> <Positive> Wall Street Journal readers would really like to know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In fact, if you call Kevin Hassett, let him tell you, because I was going over it. Kevin will give it to you. You know Kevin very well.
<Question> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And this is money that comes back, because it's money that's going to be spent on buying cars -- hopefully cars made in the U.S.A., by the way -- but it's going to be spent on things that we make and sell in the United States.
<Question> <Positive> Right now, three weeks ahead of the election, where we're at; the economy, as you say, there's a lot of positive signs. What are the biggest risks right now for the --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Fed.
<Question> <Negative> The Fed?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> To me, the Fed is the biggest risk because I think that -- I think interest rates are being raised too quickly. I think, to me, the biggest risk is the Fed, because my trade deals are great deals. And the tariffs -- you saw what I put out today on the tariffs, I guess, did you see I put out a little social media.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have a lot of money coming into this country, people don't realize. And ultimately, I'll use it to negotiate. And if they don't negotiate a free -- don't forget, they wouldn't even meet with President Obama, Europe and these other countries. They wouldn't even meet. You know, the European Union wouldn't even meet. They said, we are very happy with the deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm not happy with the deal. And if they don't do the right thing, I'll put tariffs on the cars. And if they do, there won't be any tariffs. And tariffs are a great negotiating -- now, tariffs essentially ended in 1913, and the country was rich. If you read some of McKinley's speeches, they were very interesting. He talked about we will not allow the outsider to come in and take our wealth from us without having to pay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I could never have done it without tariffs. Without tariffs I could have never made the deal.
<Question> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because I said, look, fellows, I say that -- I say that all the time. I have nothing to hide. If I put tariffs on cars coming in from the European Union -- Mercedes Benzes, you know, the BMWs, all of them; millions of cars pouring in. If I put a 25% or a 20% tariff on those cars, the money would be staggering that we would take in.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They wouldn’t meet with Obama, the European Union. Japan wouldn’t meet with Obama. And they wouldn’t meet with us either. After a few months I said, all right, that’s all right. So I called them up. I said, listen, we don’t have to meet with you anymore; we’re just going to put tariffs on your cars coming in. They were in my office the next day.
<Question> <Negative> A lot of people say that tariffs are really the biggest threat to the economy long term.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We don't have any tariffs.
<Question> <Neutral> But you're saying it's the Fed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's so much nonsense, OK. This is your story. We don't even have tariffs. I'm using tariffs to negotiate. I mean, other than some tariffs on steel -- which is actually small, what do we have? I didn't put them on the USMCA. We have a trade deal. I didn't put them on in South Korea. We have a trade deal. That was the worst deal. That was a deal made by Hillary Clinton. It was a horrible deal. We made it into a sound deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I didn't put tariffs. Where do we have tariffs? We don't have tariffs anywhere. I read that today: We're worried about the tariffs. You know what happens? A business that's doing badly always likes to blame Trump and the tariffs because it's a good excuse for some incompetent guy that's making $25 million a year.
<Question> <Negative> Just to go back to the Fed for a second --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But think of it, Michael. We don't have tariffs. Where do we have tariffs? I'm talking tariffs. I'll use tariffs. I mean it. I've said I was going to put tariffs on European Union cars, right? They came to my office. We made the concept of a deal. We'll see what happens. But they agreed to a deal that they wouldn't even talk about. There's no tariffs.
<Question> <Negative> So -- sorry -- if you think the Fed is the biggest risk, though, are there circumstances where you would consider trying to remove the chair?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. I'm just saying this. I'm very unhappy with the Fed, because Obama had zero interest rates and I have almost normalized -- and maybe normalized, depending on who you're talking to -- interest rates. You give me zero interest rates and you show me my numbers with zero interest rates. He had phony numbers because it was based on zero interest. Well, you know, he had -- he had zero interest.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> lus, Obama took something where there was a lot more provision -- you know, there was a lot more potential for gain because, you know, it was at the bottom of a cycle. But forget that. Obama had zero interest rates. A very great guy last week was saying, 'If you give -- if you take what Trump has done and you leave interest rates where they were when I took over, we'd have the greatest -- well, we already do; we already have -- but we'd have the greatest economy in history.
<Question> <Negative> And why not talk to Powell about those frustrations? Have people told you not to?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because in theory he's supposed to be independent. But I'm not happy with what he's doing at all.
<Question> <Negative> Do you regret hiring him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it almost looks like he's happy raising interest rates.
<Question> <Negative> What do you mean?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just don't like what he's doing. And I will let -- I will let him know through you because I leave him be, independent.
<Question> <Positive> Yeah. How is he supposed to interpret these? Because you said it's supposed to be independent.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's supposed to be interpreted. He can interpret it anyway he wants. I'm just telling you I've done very well with instinct. My instinct is that he's raising it too much. When we make -- when we -- every time we do something great, he raises the interest rates. We do great. How the hell do you compete with that? And Obama -- remember, this is very important -- Obama had zero interest. He had --
<Question> <Negative> Why do you think he's doing that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He was supposed to be a low-interest-rate guy. It's turned out that he's not.
<Question> <Neutral> Knowing how he's behaved, would you have picked somebody else, in retrospect?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Too early to say, but maybe.
<Question> <Neutral> What level of action from him would it take for you to step up --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there'll be a point when I would have to find out. Look, there are a lot of people that agree with me, just so we understand, you know. I read them all. I read everybody. There are a lot of people that agree with me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I have a hot economy going. Every time we do something, he raises rates. Now, what does that do? That means we pay more on debt, right? That means we pay more on debt and we slow down the economy, both bad things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, when there's inflation, which there's not of any consequence, I'm all for it. I'd even do it more. I'd rather do it slower and heavier, at a later date, if we need it. But the point is that you give -- you give me the interest rates that President Obama was paying -- anybody can do that with zero interest. But we're paying almost a normalized rate. Some people think we're paying a normalized rate. How many increases has he had? Five already? Five? Five. Five increases.
<Question> <Neutral> Do you think --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we had a good quarter.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> One more question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We had a good quarter. We're making, boom, and we have an interest-rate hike. So I like him as a person. I am not -- I disagree with him as to the raising of the rates. What I'd rather do is keep the rates low and pay amortization.
<Question> <Negative> I know we're running short on time here. I had a few things --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, let me just say, because to me that's maybe the most important. I would like to see the rates be low and pay amortization, pay off debt. And when he keeps raising interest rates, you can't do that.
<Question> <Neutral> I think you were about to express what level of action from him would it take for you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No level of action right now. But all I'm saying is that I would like to pay -- I would like to have interest rates low and I'd like to pay off debt. But you can't pay off debt when he keeps raising the interest rates. I mean, we had a case where he raised the interest rates right before we have a bond offering.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So you have a bond offering and you have somebody raising interest rates, so you end up paying more on the bonds. Now you tell me, does that -- does that make sense? To me it doesn't make sense. You understand what I'm saying, Michael, right? With that being said, I'm not happy, and that's my only expression. It's the only thing I can tell you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What I'd like to see is the interest rate be lower, and I'd like to form the rest of it in the form of amortization, and even more than the combination of interest rate plus amortization. I'd like to -- plus the gap.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd like to pay amortization and start reducing debt. But how do you do that when he keeps raising interest rates on you? I'd like to let all of that interest that he's raising pay off debt, and we could do that. We'd pay off a lot of debt.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> Sir, your next meeting is here, so maybe you guys --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> -- have one last question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So with all the -- I'm not doing anything. I'm independent. But I'm allowed to say what I think. That's what I think. I think he's making a mistake. I want to pay amortization. You can't pay amortization when he's raising interest rates, OK?
<Question> <Negative> I wanted to ask you --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> To the extent that they're raising them.
<Question> <Negative> I just wanted to ask you, before we have to go, about your former lawyer, Michael Cohen. He --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> About who?
<Question> <Neutral> About Michael Cohen, your former lawyer. He said that you ordered him to arrange these payments during the 2016 campaign.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've discussed that so much. Nobody cares about that.
<Question> <Negative> But do you feel betrayed by your former lawyer --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he's not allowed.
<Question> <Neutral> -- that he's now turning on you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, he's a lawyer. He's got tremendous legal liability. He's a lawyer. It's unthinkable that a lawyer would tape a client, that a lawyer would make statements to -- he's got tremendous legal liability. He shouldn't do that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I’m surprised that he did it, but one of those things. But that a lawyer would tape a client, that a lawyer would make statements to people, he’s not allowed to do that legally.
<Question> <Neutral> And you're saying --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's got -- he's got -- all I can say is he's got tremendous legal liability for doing that.
<Question> <Negative> And you're saying you never discussed any of these payments with him during the campaign --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've made all the statements.
<Question> <Neutral> -- that he did it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why do I have to say it again? I'm just saying a lawyer can't do that. Now, he represented me on very small things. He was like a public-relations person. But he was also a lawyer. A lawyer can't do that. Can you imagine a lawyer taping a client? I've seen lawyers that are very tough, very smart. They've told me, they've said they've never heard of that before. They've never even heard of it.
<Question> <Neutral> What was your reaction when you found out that he had decided --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was surprised.
<Question> <Neutral> -- to make this payment?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was surprised. Who knew? Anybody would be surprised. Now, of the tapes, there was one tape and that -- it was a meaningless tape. There were many other tapes, though. He taped many, many people. He was taping many people. Hey, I wasn't his only client. He was -- you know, he had clients. He had a lot of clients, I guess, over the years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The other thing is -- this wasn't me. This was having to do with the taxi industry or something. But he has -- and financing, but nothing to do with me. But for a lawyer to tape a client is unthinkable. I've dealt with -- I've spoken to lawyers that were tough people, that have seen it all. They'd never heard of that one. But remember this, that the one little tape, but he also taped many other people -- many, many people.
<Question> <Negative> Many, yeah. Were you angry?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And those tapes, as I've heard, are unbelievably complimentary to me.
<Question> <Neutral> I've heard that too.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> We've got to go.
<Question> <Negative> Were you angry when you found out that he had made --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK. Well, wait a minute, that's a big point. But, you know, they're unbelievable. OK, so this is used in writing.
<Question> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to hear it on the radio or anything.
<Question> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We'll do it again, Michael.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hey, Michael.
<Michael Scherer> <Positive> Hey Mr. President, Thank you for taking the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely. How have you been, OK?
<Michael Scherer> <Neutral> Yeah, it has been a wild couple months. You keep us busy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, it's been good though. It's been good.
<Michael Scherer> <Positive> Do you want me to give you a quick overview [of the story]?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, it's a cool story. I mean it's, the concept is right. I predicted a lot of things, Michael. Some things that came to you a little bit later. But, you know, we just rolled out a list. Sweden. I make the statement, everyone goes crazy . The next day they have a massive riot, and death, and problems. Huma [Abedin] and Anthony [Weiner], you know, what I tweeted about that whole deal, and then it turned out he had it, all of Hillary's email on his thing . NATO, obsolete , because it doesn't cover terrorism. They fixed that, and I said that the allies must pay. Nobody knew that they weren't paying. I did. I figured it. Brexit, I was totally right about that . You were over there I think, when I predicted that, right, the day before. Brussels, I said, Brussels is not Brussels. I mean many other things, the election's rigged against Bernie Sanders. We have a lot of things.
<Michael Scherer> <Negative> But there's other things you said that haven't panned out. The peg for this story is the wiretapping hearing on Monday, in which [FBI Director James] Comey and [NSA Director Mike] Rogers testified about your tweets there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah well if you'd look at, in fact I'll give you the front page story, and just today I heard, just a little while ago, that Devin Nunes had a news conference , did you hear about this, where they have a lot of information on tapping. Did you hear about that?
<Michael Scherer> <Negative> I have not, no.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now remember this. When I said wiretapping, it was in quotes. Because a wiretapping is, you know today it is different than wire tapping. It is just a good description. But wiretapping was in quotes. What I'm talking about is surveillance. And today, [House Intelligence Committee Chairman] Devin Nunes just had a news conference. Now probably got obliterated by what's happened in London . But just had a news conference, and here it is one of those things. The other one, election, I said we are going to win, we won. And many other things. And I think this is going to be very interesting.
<Michael Scherer> <Negative> So you don't feel like Comey's testimony in any way takes away from the credibility of the tweets you put out, even with the quotes?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I have, look. I have articles saying it happened. But you have to take a look at what they, they just went out at a news conference. Devin Nunes had a news conference. I mean I don't know, I was unable to see it, because I am at meetings, but they just had a news conference talking about surveillance. Now again, it is in quotes. That means surveillance and various other things. And the New York Times had a front-page story, which they actually reduced, they took it, they took it the word wiretapping out of the title, but its first story in the front page of the paper was wiretapping. And a lot of information has just been learned, and a lot of information may be learned over the next coming period of time. We will see what happens. Look. I predicted a lot of things that took a little of bit of Time. Here, headline, for the front page of the New York Times , "Wiretapped data used in inquiry of Trump aides." That's a headline. Now they then dropped that headline, I never saw this until this morning. They then dropped that headline, and they used another headline without the word wiretap, but they did mean wiretap. Wiretapped data used in inquiry. Then changed after that, they probably didn't like it. And they changed the title. They took the wiretap word out.
<Michael Scherer> <Negative> One of my ideas here is that throughout the campaign and now as president, you have used disputed statements, this is one of them that is disputed, the claim that three million undocumented people voted in the election...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I think I will be proved right about that too.
<Michael Scherer> <Neutral> The claim that Muslims celebrated on 9-11 in New Jersey...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well if you look at the reporter, he wrote the story in the Washington Post .
<Michael Scherer> <Positive> But my idea is that whatever the reality of what you are describing, the fact that they are disputed makes them a more effective message, that you are able to spread the message further, that more people get excited about it, that it gets on TV.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well now if you take a look at the votes, when I say that, I mean mostly they register wrong, in other words, for the votes, they register incorrectly, and/or illegally. And they then vote. You have tremendous numbers of people. In fact I'm forming a committee on it.
<Michael Scherer> <Negative> But there's no evidence that 3 million people voted with...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We'll see after the committee. I have people say it was more than that. We will see after we have. But there will be, we are forming a committee. And we are going to do a study on it, a very serious problem.
<Michael Scherer> <Negative> Is there anything different about making these kinds of predictions without having the factual evidence as President?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm a very instinctual person, but my instinct turns out to be right. When everyone said I wasn't going to win the election, I said well I think I would. You know it is interesting, somebody came up to me and said the other day, gee whiz, the New York Times and other people, you know other groups, had you down at one percent, well, I said no I think I am going to win, and people smiled, George Stephanopoulos laughed , you remember. He thought it was very cute, and very funny. Other people smiled. And some people, the smart people or the people that know me didn't laugh at all. There are people that know me, like Carl Icahn and many others, that didn't laugh at all, they thought I was going to win, because they understand how I, they understand me. They get it. But you take a look and guess what, I won, and I won easily. I predicted Brexit. Remember they said there was no way to get to 270? Well I ended up at 306. I had election night, 306. But there was no way to get to, in fact I went to Maine four times, four times I went to Maine, because I had to get one vote, because there was no way to get to 270, but I ended up getting to 306. Brexit, I predicted Brexit, you remember that, the day before the event. I said, no, Brexit is going to happen, and everybody laughed, and Brexit happened. Many many things. They turn out to be right. And now today, Devin Nunes, just had a news conference.
<Michael Scherer> <Positive> I'll look that up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, just had it. Now the problem, the thing is, I'm not sure they are watching anything other than that, let's see members of Donald Trump transition team, possibly, oh this just came out. This is a Politico story . Members of the Donald Trump Transition team possibly including Trump himself were under surveillance during the Obama administration following November's election. House intelligence chairman Devin Nunes told reporters, wow. Nunes said, so that means I'm right, Nunes said the surveillance appears to have been ... incidental collection, that does not appear to have been related to concerns over Russia.
<Michael Scherer> <Negative> But so incidental collection would not be wiretapping of you, it would be wiretapping of...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Who knows what it is? You know, why, because somebody says incidental. Nunes is going to the White House.
<Michael Scherer> <Neutral> Nunes has also said that he has no evidence that your tweet was right, previously.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he just got this information. This was new information. That was just got. Members, of, let's see, were under surveillance during the Obama Administration following November's election. Wow. This just came out. So, ah, just came out.
<Michael Scherer> <Negative> Mitch McConnell has said he'd rather you stop tweeting , that he sees it as a distraction.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Mitch will speak for himself. Mitch is a wonderful man. Mitch should speak for himself.
<Michael Scherer> <Negative> But you don't see any problems caused by these kinds of controversies. Does this, when we are talking in the press about whether the president was wiretapped or not, is this good for you or bad for you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Probably neither. Probably neither. What I said, look I said, Donna Brazile had information , and she had information on Hillary's debate questions. I said why didn't Hillary apologize. Donna Brazile just admitted that that was right. I said the election was rigged against Bernie, a lot of people agree with that one, a lot of people hated the statement when I made it.
<Michael Scherer> <Positive> But I grant you some of those. But you would agree also that some of the things you have said haven't been true. You say that Ted Cruz's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald .
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well that was in a newspaper. No, no, I like Ted Cruz, he's a friend of mine. But that was in the newspaper. I wasn't, I didn't say that. I was referring to a newspaper. A Ted Cruz article referred to a newspaper story with, had a picture of Ted Cruz, his father, and Lee Harvey Oswald, having breakfast.
<Michael Scherer> <Positive> That gets close to the heart...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why do you say that I have to apologize? I'm just quoting the newspaper, just like I quoted the judge the other day, Judge Napolitano, I quoted Judge Napolitano , just like I quoted Bret Baier, I mean Bret Baier mentioned the word wiretap. Now he can now deny it, or whatever he is doing, you know. But I watched Bret Baier, and he used that term. I have a lot of respect for Judge Napolitano, and he said that three sources have told him things that would make me right. I don't know where he has gone with it since then. But I'm quoting highly respected people from highly respected television networks.
<Michael Scherer> <Positive> But traditionally people in your position in the Oval Office have not said things unless they can verify they are true.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm not, well, I think, I'm not saying, I'm quoting, Michael, I'm quoting highly respected people and sources from major television networks.
<Michael Scherer> <Neutral> Did you see the Wall Street Journal opinion page today , the editorial page?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought it was, I thought it was a disgrace that they could write that.
<Michael Scherer> <Negative> But let me just, the hypothetical they started with, you have to announce to the country or to the world that some serious national security event has happened, and...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The country believes me. Hey. I went to Kentucky two nights ago , we had 25,000 people in a massive basketball arena. There wasn't a seat, they had to send away people. I went to Tennessee four nights ago. We had a packed house, they had to send away thousands of people. You saw that, right. Did you see that?
<Michael Scherer> <Positive> Yes I did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The country's not buying it, it is fake media. And the Wall Street Journal is a part of it.
<Michael Scherer> <Negative> Ok. So you don't worry that your credibility, that if you've cited things that later turn out to be wrong, based on anonymous sources that that hurts you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Name what's wrong! I mean, honestly.
<Michael Scherer> <Negative> Fox News said...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Brexit. Wait a minute. I predicted Brexit. What I said about NATO was true, people aren't paying their bills. And everyone said it was a horrible thing to say. And then they found out. And when Germany was over here I said, we are going to have a great relationship with Germany but you have to pay your NATO bills, and they don't even dispute it, ok. So what have I said that is wrong? Everyone, I got attacked on NATO and now they are all saying I was right. I got attacked on Brexit, when I was saying, I said long before the day before, I said the day before the opening, but I was saying Brexit was going to pass, and everybody was laughing, and I turned out to be right on that. I took a lot of heat when I said Brexit was going to pass. Don't forget, Obama said that U.K. will go to the back of the line, and I talked about Sweden, and may have been somewhat different, but the following day, two days later, they had a massive riot in Sweden, exactly what I was talking about, I was right about that.
<Michael Scherer> <Neutral> But even in that Sweden quote, you said look at what happened on Friday in Sweden. But you are now saying you were referring to something that happened the following day.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No I am saying I was right. I am talking about Sweden. I'm talking about what Sweden has done to themselves is very sad, that is what I am talking about. That is what I am talking about. You can phrase it any way you want. A day later they had a horrible, horrible riot in Sweden and you saw what happened. I talked about Brussels. I was on the front page of the New York Times for my quote. I said Brussels is not what it used to be, very sad what has happened to Brussels. I was absolutely lambasted. A short Time later they had the major attack in Brussels. One year ago today. Exactly one year ago today. And then people said you know Trump was right. What am I going to tell you? I tend to be right. I'm an instinctual person, I happen to be a person that knows how life works. I said I was going to win the election, I won the election, in fact I was number one the entire route, in the primaries, from the day I announced, I was number one. And the New York Times and CNN and all of them, they did these polls, which were extremely bad and they turned out to be totally wrong, and my polls showed I was going to win. We thought we were going to win the night of the election.
<Michael Scherer> <Neutral> So when you...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then Time magazine, which treats me horribly, but obviously I sell, I assume this is going to be a cover too, have I set the record? I guess, right? Covers, nobody's had more covers.
<Michael Scherer> <Neutral> I think Richard Nixon still has you beat . But he was in office for longer, so give yourself time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ok good. I'm sure I'll win.
<Michael Scherer> <Negative> If you go back to Comey testifying that he and the Justice Department have no information to back up your tweet, the head of the NSA testifying that there is no information to back up your tweet, or the claim made by Judge Napolitano...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> On front page of the New York Times , OK? It's in the title of the front page. And I would like you to officially I know you are going to write a bad article because you always do [mention] wiretap data used in inquiry of Trump aides. OK. Wiretapped data used in inquiry of Trump aids. Ok? Can you possibly put that down? Front page, January 20th. Now in their second editions, they took it all down under the internet. They took that out. Ok? But that's the way it is. And then they just had a news conference now where they turned out, you watch. You watch.
<Michael Scherer> <Neutral> That is different...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not criticizing anybody, I'm just saying.
<Michael Scherer> <Negative> That is different that the president wiretapping you which would be a crime outside of a court.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I don't know where these wiretaps came from. They came from someplace. That is what they should find out. And you know the real story here is about the leakers. OK? You don't write about that. But the real story here is, who released General Flynn's name? Who released, who released my conversations with Australia, and who released my conversation with Mexico? To me, Michael, that's the story, these leakers, they are disgusting. These are horrible people.
<Michael Scherer> <Positive> And apparently there is an investigation into that as well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well should be, because that's where the whole, who would think that you are speaking to the head of Mexico, the head of Australia, or General Flynn, who was, they are not supposed to release that. That is the most confidential stuff. Classified. That's classified. You go to prison when you release stuff like that. And who would release that? The real story is, they have to work, intelligence has to work on finding out who are the leakers. Because you know what? When things get involved with North Korea and all the problems we have there, in the Middle East, I mean, that information cannot be leaked out, and it will be by this, this same, and these people were here in the Obama years, because he had plenty of leakers also. But intelligence has to find out, who are these people. Because the biggest story here is, who is leaking this classified information.
<Michael Scherer> <Negative> But isn't there, it strikes me there is still an issue of credibility. If the intelligence community came out and said, we have determined that so and so is the leaker here, but you are saying to me now, that you don't believe the intelligence community when they say your tweet was wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not saying no, I'm not blaming. First of all, I put Mike Pompeo in. I put Senator Dan Coats in. These are great people. I think they are great people and they are going to, I have a lot of confidence in them. So hopefully things will straighten out. But I inherited a mess, I inherited a mess in so many ways. I inherited a mess in the Middle East, and a mess with North Korea, I inherited a mess with jobs, despite the statistics, you know, my statistics are even better, but they are not the real statistics because you have millions of people that can't get a job, ok. And I inherited a mess on trade. I mean we have many, you can go up and down the ladder. But that's the story. Hey look, in the mean Time, I guess, I can't be doing so badly, because I'm president, and you're not. You know. Say hello to everybody OK?
<Michael Scherer> <Positive> Thank you very much, Mr. President.
