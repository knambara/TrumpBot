<Crystal Britt> <Positive> Mr. President, first of all thank you for doing this interview.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Crystal Britt> <Negative> Talk about being in southern Illinois. Why come to Murphysboro. Why is it so important?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Mike Bost is a great congressman, who has fought very hard for the steel industry. We brought the steel industry back fully. It's incredible. It's talk of -- it's the talk of the country, in a sense, and I thought that I should reward him, actually, and he's got a close race.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can't imagine it being close, actually. Mike Bost, he's the congressman from the area. So I said I'd come up here. Usually, I don't do it for a single congressman. But, you know, we have the two others, who are terrific. So, between the three of them, and I think they're going to do fantastically well. They're great people.
<Crystal Britt> <Negative> And the upcoming midterms. You mentioned that that was a big deal, and again, I told you, you know, we're -- we're not far from here, over in southeast Missouri.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Crystal Britt> <Neutral> So what about the McCaskill-Hawley race? And I know that's a big one for you, too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Josh Hawley is one of the stars of the party. He's young. He is a brilliant guy. He is doing unbelievably well. She's been a terrible senator. She has not represented her people well. She votes against tax cuts. She votes against Justice Kavanaugh, as an example, who was a star, who's great, you know, Yale, and top of his class, and so many other things, Brett Kavanaugh. She has been so bad to her people and what they represent. So Josh Hawley really is a star, and I think that he is going to go places like few others.
<Crystal Britt> <Neutral> Will we see you in southeast Missouri anytime soon?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm actually -- I'm coming back. I believe Josh is leading, and actually, maybe even leading by a decent number. But, I'll tell you what: I want to give him every chance of winning. That's a race that should be won. She should've lost last time. And, frankly, a mistake was made by somebody, and it didn't work out that way. But she got very lucky. We can't let that happen a second time. She has not represented her people well.
<Crystal Britt> <Neutral> Will we see you possibly in Cape Girardeau?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That could be. But we're going to be back in Missouri, I think sometime soon. Next week.
<Crystal Britt> <Neutral> Columbia, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I believe so, yes. I believe so.
<Crystal Britt> <Negative> Well, talk about -- you know, today, we had the horrible tragedy that happened in Pennsylvania.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Crystal Britt> <Negative> Talk about -- you mentioned, if there would have been an armed guard there, that things might have been different. Do you think that that's unrealistic, or do you think this is a chance for maybe church leadership to start rethinking security?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's the endless debate about guns or no guns, and the problem is that if you go with the other route, no guns, the bad guys are always going to have guns. So they're going to walk in, and we'll be totally defenseless. You have to have them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, if you, I mean literally, if you don't -- you take a look at Paris, the nightclub where almost 500 people were killed over a long period of time. Just one after another after another. And I always say, if just one person had a gun, where the bullets could have flown the other way, you wouldn't have had that tragedy like that. So, I understand both sides of the argument.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, I mean, this madman walked in -- I will say this law enforcement did a fantastic job. A few of them were hurt very badly, but they did a fantastic job. But you have to have protections. Remember this: the bad people the bad ones will always have guns. And how do you counteract that? They're always going to have guns.
<Crystal Britt> <Positive> Mr. President, I know you have a tight schedule, but just a couple other quick things. Can you address the tariff situation?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Crystal Britt> <Neutral> I know you spoke with some farmers today, we have a lot of farmers here in the heartland.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Sure.
<Crystal Britt> <Negative> Can you ease any concerns?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there are no concerns. We just made the deal by using tariffs. We just made one of the great deals ever, with Mexico and Canada. The deal is finished. The USMCA. We don't want to call it NAFTA, because NAFTA was a disaster , and for the farmers -- you remember this: from the time I was elected, if you go back 15 years before, the farmers had been on a constant decline.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, they're starting to go up. We're making a deal with, well, we're either going to make a deal or something else is going to happen with the European Union, who have treated our farmers horribly. You look at Japan, you look -- everybody treated our farmers badly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, they're starting to treat them good. We just made the deal, finished to deal with South Korea, which was a horror show, and now it's a great deal. And we're using tariffs as -- for two reasons: to negotiate, and if they don't want to negotiate and make good deals for our farmers, and our manufacturers, and everybody else, then we'll put the tariffs on. And if they do, we don't have to put the tariffs on. Without tariffs, we would never be able to make great deals that I'm making.
<Crystal Britt> <Negative> And opioids. Historic legislation this week. Talk about -- this -- that's a big problem around here, Mr. President. Talk about --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a tremendous problem in this area, but it's a tremendous problem all over the country. It's a tremendous problem all over the world. Drugs. If you just take it a step larger. Drugs. And with opioids, we just got $6 billion -- the largest ever, for working on not only solving the problem, and getting people better.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, you have so many people there are so addicted. So we just got $6 billion approved. Opioid prescriptions are down 17 percent. You know, the doctors are just prescribing stuff, but they're down, because now they're being watched, and we're going after them if they're abusive. We've done a very good job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> With respect to that but I must tell you it is a tough problem, and it's been a very tough problem for this area. We just got 15 -- and we just got six, and that six is being used so well. One other thing we're doing: tremendous commercials on drugs, opioids, everything. Why you shouldn't be doing it, why you shouldn't be taking it, why they shouldn't be prescribed, in the case of opioids. And we're really making a big dent. We're making a big dent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And one other thing: we're being very strong on the pushers. The people that sell drugs. We're being really tough, and ultimately that's going to have to be, and probably will have to go, maybe even a step tougher than we already are, and we are tough.
<Crystal Britt> <Positive> Well, I can ask you questions all night. But what would you say to our viewers who are watching, the people in southern Illinois, southeast Missouri, western Kentucky and parts of Tennessee, that's our viewing area. What are you doing to --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, yeah. Those are great states. Great places.
<Crystal Britt> <Positive> What are you doing to help us, here in America's heartland, sleep better at night?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, what we're doing is, number one we're making our country much stronger. The trade deals, and all that we've done, has been incredible. The other thing is our military, look at our military. Our military was depleted, who was in trouble. We didn't even have really ammunition of any kind. I mean, if you look at what was going on. We, in a very short period of time, and already, we're going to have the strongest military we've ever had. $716 billion is being put in our military.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, if you ask the generals, if you ask anybody, we will never have a military so strong. We're going to have protection. We're guarding, up as you know, we're guarding up the southern border. We're not letting people come in. We're setting records of detention, and getting people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This caravan that's coming up is not getting through. It's -- no way it's getting through. And, in fact, I called up the United States military to make sure. People are not going to come through in the caravan. They are going to apply, and they have to come through legally. And we want a merit system, not this ridiculous system that we have. Merit.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So that all of these companies that are coming into the United States, they need employees, they need workers. We want a merit system. We need the workers. You know, we're down to 3.7, it's the lowest in 50 years, 3.7 percent unemployment. We want the merit system. Wo we're doing a lot, and we're hitting on all 12 cylinders.
<Crystal Britt> <Negative> And I'm supposed to ask you if you're going to eat barbecue while you're here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I would. I love barbecue. I'm probably better off not doing it, but that's okay.
<Crystal Britt> <Negative> [Laughs] Probably no time for that. Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great job.
<Crystal Britt> <Positive> Thank you so much for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> All right, Rick and Bubba, we're in the East Wing of the White House, here with the 45th president of the United States of America, Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Pretty fancy place, right?
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> I mean, very nice, very nice.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not so bad. You've come a long way.
<Bubba Bussey> <Positive> We love the cookies, too. You've got good cooks here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true!
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Thank you for lunch. The lunch was fantastic. What do you normally, do you eat a lot, what do you ask for lunch?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't have much time to eat. We're trying to pass tax cuts now and we've got all sorts of things lined up. Tomorrow I head for China and Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Other than that it won't be very busy.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Right. Well, let's talk about it. The tax plan, we've been talking to some of the different members of your administration and, and there seems to be a lot of optimism about it. Of course, the economy is doing great even before this. The corporate tax cut could only make things better.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we're doing great as an economy. We're having tremendous numbers, tremendous stock market numbers. Every day we're hitting new highs and the tax cuts but are really needed to really make this country take off like it should. The tax cuts are going to be very important and I think they're gonna happen, there's tremendous spirit in the Republican Party, and I can tell you the Democrats are worried.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know they're obstructionists and they're worried about it, but I think we're gonna, I think we're gonna do fantastically well, both in the Senate and in the House.
<Bubba Bussey> <Neutral> Can you get it through? That's the key.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so, yeah. I think so. I think that there is, for instance, we were really there on health care, and then we got a surprise vote and we're gonna come back to health care right after this is over, we're gonna get that done. But I will say that I think there's, I mean, you guys know as well as I do, you see what's going on, this tremendous spirit to get the tax cuts done.
<Bubba Bussey> <Positive> Yes, there's a lot of energy out there --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Tremendous energy.
<Bubba Bussey> <Negative> And when you said during the campaign, when you said you could produce 3% growth, you were scoffed at, and there it was -- we just had it this week, I think it was revised up, what, 3.1?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we've already hit it. We had 3.2, and now we have 3, and the 3 is in a tough season because we had hurricanes, we had really five hurricanes. I mean, bad ones, as you know probably better than I do, and that's supposed to be a point. That would mean we would have hit 4, so we had GDP of 3.2 and 3 in the last two quarters and most people didn't think we were going to be there for three years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So a lot of it is the fact that I cut the regulations and the companies are already starting to really get back to work, but the regulations have been very seriously cut.
<Bubba Bussey> <Negative> There's there's a lot of small business that want to reinvest. They want to move forward, but they've been scared because they didn't know what was coming their way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Absolutely, absolutely. They're ready to rock, and this country is ready to rock, and don't forget, other countries have GDP at 11, 12, 13, 6, 7. We were at 1.2 when I came in and it's just not acceptable, and now we're up to 3 and each point in GDP is $2.5 trillion. That's more money than we're talking about to a large extent for tax cuts.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, that's actually more money than we're -- 1 point makes a tremendous difference and nobody can tell me we're not gonna get a point. And we just left the Rose Garden, you saw. We have Jay Powell going in at the Fed and he's a very, very talented guy. I think he's gonna do a great job.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Well, I think Americans, which is the reason why I believe that you won, I think, a lot of us out there have been so frustrated that it seems like the government doesn't have basic concepts how business works and how the economy works, and so many things that government does lacks logic.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Rick Burgess> <Negative> You know, we're small-business owners and we weren't about to add any employees, because everything was so uncertain. Then we went through the thing with Obamacare and then we have this forced on this and we, you know, which you know has just been --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Obamacare, by the way, has been a disaster. [Crosstalk]
<Rick Burgess> <Neutral> I mean, it, it, we've gotta get -- the wheels
<Bubba Bussey> <Negative> It's sinking fast.
<Rick Burgess> <Negative> The wheels have already completely come off. It's not like it's gonna be bad. It's really bad, and the phone calls we get --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we're talking about, as you know, we're talking about ending the individual mandate and giving that to the middle class and giving it to businesses where they, you know, go out and create a lot of jobs. But the mandate has been a disaster. The individual mandate has been a disaster. I mean, people that had insurance before Obamacare, now they have to pay not to have it.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's got to be the most unpopular thing, one of the most unpopular things I've seen in government, and so we're even considering getting rid of the individual mandate.
<Rick Burgess> <Negative> Well, there's a there's a little bit of a frustration, because I think there's people that said, 'We voted for this administration and we want their vision for America to be implemented.'
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, and they're going to get it. Honestly, they're gonna get it. We're gonna get repeal and replace, and we're getting very close to getting it anyway, and Obamacare is exploding and imploding, just as I said it would, and the tax cuts are going to be very important. In a way, I feel a little bit guilty leaving for China and Japan and for South Korea now, because, you know, this is prime time, but I will say the receptivity, and you people know it as well as I do, the receptivity has been fantastic for the tax cuts.
<Rick Burgess> <Negative> What about when you talk about the corporate tax rate, I mean, that's obviously something you're very familiar with, is this enough to re-, to really, I mean --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, this'll be great.
<Rick Burgess> <Negative> I mean, because being the highest corporate rate, that makes zero sense.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Well we're bringing from 35% down to 20. That's a tremendous cut. This will be the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, so this will be bigger than anything we've done.
<Bubba Bussey> <Negative> Historically, those have caused big booms.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's going to be tremendous and also the reason I say for business, business needs it, because we are one of the highest-taxed countries in the world. It's not even close, OK? We're one of the highest-taxed in the world and now we're going down to one of the lower, not the lowest -- I'd like to be there too, but you know you can only do so much, and by the way there is a Phase 2. Maybe we do a Phase 2 if this kicks off like we think it will, but this will have a huge impact on business and a huge impact on jobs.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> If you get another shot at it, the Rick and Bubba plan will be zero deductions and 10% across the board. Everybody pays.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that sounds interesting. That's a very fine plan. Great economists.
<Rick Burgess> <Negative> Be difficult to get through, but it would get it done.
<Bubba Bussey> <Positive> We figure God was smart [ph]. We could live with it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, there are some people that agree with that, I have to tell you. You know that.
<Bubba Bussey> <Positive> Lemme ask this while we have you. We saw the test walls go up. How do you feel about 'em? You're gonna go down and judge 'em, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yea, I'm gonna go down very soon and we're gonna be, when I get back, sometime after I get back from Asia, and we have five and even six test walls up. We call them prototypes, and you know, it's interesting -- we have the, we have the Border Patrol working on it, and they're working hard, and ICE, cause they're the ones you want, and they want a certain vision through the wall right, because, if you think about it, you can't just have a concrete wall that you don't know who's on the other side. So they want to have a vision through the wall, and, no, those are some great prototypes. There's one or two in particular that we like and I'll be going there over the next three or four weeks.
<Rick Burgess> <Neutral> I'm not trying to tell you what to do, but I'd go with Israelis. If anybody knows how to build a wall it's the Israelis.
<Bubba Bussey> <Neutral> Wait a minute, Rick, we got a couple of 'em from Alabama.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> That's true, we do have some Alabama ones in there.
<Bubba Bussey> <Neutral> So will you just judge it and put a ribbon on it? How will that --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yea, basically I'll be picking the winner, but I'll be picking it with ICE and I'll be picking it with the Border Patrol, and you just mentioned Israel, but their wall works. 99.9%, 99.9%.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> That's one reason why we thought it was weird that the Pope acted like he didn't like the wall --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's got a big one. When I heard that, that was actually during the South Carolina primary. You know that, right? Remember that? And it was during the South Carolina and I heard that they, that the Pope was sort of against the wall and then I said, 'Wait a minute, let me see some of the pictures of the Vatican.'
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Well, ask the people who had to bury their loved ones over the last 24, 48 hours, because what, it's not immoral and it's not unreasonable to say that -- we're not saying that people can't come into our country. We simply want to vet them out to keep our citizens secure, and that's a reasonable statement.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we want a merit-based system. We don't want lotteries and you can imagine who they put in those lotteries. They're not putting their finest, no, they're not putting you guys in the lottery, OK? They're putting people that -- let's not even talk about it, but they're not putting their finest.
<Bubba Bussey> <Negative> Why is that so hard for people to understand? A lot of people opposed to that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Inconceivable, but I think now they're understanding it and I would like to say, 'Move fast' because in three weeks from now they won't understand it to the same extent. Now I understand a lot of Democrats want to end that lottery system Well, I've been talking about the lottery system for a while. I've also been talking about chain migration. We have to end chain migration, chain migration's a killer, where somebody like him can come in, and they'll bring 20 people, 23 people with him potentially, and in his case he only has a green card. No he's a bad, he's a bad person, he's an animal, as far as I'm concerned and we're gonna be very tough.
<Rick Burgess> <Negative> And if people don't understand that and they don't like it, we keep saying is, 'Don't blame our country who now wants to be secure. Blame the people keep doing these kind of things,' and then and, and that's what's causing us to start vetting. It's not our fault, it's the behavior of those who are coming in that tend to do harm.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we have extreme vetting, and now we have more than that. I mean, you see what we've been doing and we've done a great job at the border, 78% down. And you look at that when, you know, if they went 1% down, it was a big story. We're 78% down, people pouring into the border and that's before the wall.
<Bubba Bussey> <Negative> That's just enforcing the laws that are already in place.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's enforcing the laws. The people on Border Patrol and ICE, you know, they endorsed me and the first time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate.
<Rick Burgess> <Negative> You know why? They wanted, they wanted to be allowed to do their job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They want to do, you know, they actually work much harder now than they used to, and they love it. They're doing their job, they love the country, they're proud of their country, they're doing their job.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Well, thanks for taking time to include us today. It's an honor to be here and and, of course, the last time you were on with us, and you did a liner for us, it made national news, even in the radio industry.
<Bubba Bussey> <Positive> And we appreciate that.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> So thanks.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's true, come to think of it. That's very true. Thank you both very much. This is a pleasure.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Thank you. Donald Trump taking time to be with us here today on the Rick and Bubba show.
