<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Tonight, On the Record, Donald Trump is here. And he is threatening to boycott the next Republican presidential debate. Why? Well, right now, Donald Trump goes On the Record from the Trump Tower. Nice to talk to you, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hello, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I understand that you don't like the rules that CNBC has set for its next G.O.P. debate. Are you seriously thinking that you would boycott it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, the same thing is happening has happened with CNN. They sold the commercial so much and for so much money. It was going to be $4,000 for a 30 second commercial that ended up being 200,000 and 250,000. 250,000 for a 30 second commercial. And same thing is happening now with CNBC. And what they are trying to do, they have sold out all their commercials and they want to increase it by an hour.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now if you look at the debate even though it was pretty boring from last night or the other night with Hillary, and the group, that debate, it was a two hour deal. Now they want to make this an extra hour. And I think it's unfair to the viewers because it's too much, it's too much to watch and they are doing it because they want to make more money.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> So, does that mean if they are going to do three hours that you would say I'm out of here after two hours?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I spoke to Ryans and I spoke to the RNC and so have other people, actually, and you know, they don't like the idea because it's unfair. It's unfair to the viewers. I don't care. I can stand for five hours. I can stand for 10 hours. But, it's unfair to the viewers. It's too long. You know, the Democratic debate, if you look at it, that was two hours and it was too long.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Everybody was bored at the end. They want to make this much longer than that.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So I think it's really important that they make it a reasonable period of time.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. Well, I think you are still in if it's three hours, but you want two hours is what I get out of that. All right, now, do you think you should have secret service protection?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, that's what we agreed to. By the way, Greta, that's what we agreed to. You know, it was agreed to two hours and now all of a sudden, yesterday, they came up with this additional long period of time whatever it may be. But it was originally agreed that it was going to be two hour. I mean, the networks are making a fortune off of this stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They never made money. They always lost money with it. Now they are making a fortune. I wonder why? But now they are making a fortune with it. So, you know, a little bit tough.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But we'll see what happens. All right, should you have secret service protection now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, we are getting the biggest crowds. You know, last night, we had 8,000 people in Virginia. We had 20,000 people in Dallas, Texas. We had 35,000 people in Mobile, Alabama, and 20,000 in Oklahoma. And I know this. If I was a Democrat, they would have it, but it's really up to them. They know what they are doing and I assume they are doing the right thing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Crosstalk]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Are you asking for it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would hope they are doing the right thing.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Have you ask for secret service? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think it would be appropriate because, you know -- we have. We have been speaking with them about it. My people have been speaking to them about it and we will see what happens. But, again, when you have 20,000 people, that's a lot of people. And even if you have some really fantastic guys doing it and this case we have 10 people that are very strong people, when you have 20,000, it's pretty hard to protect, I would imagine.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. Let me ask you a question now about foreign policy. I know that you know about the Doctors Without Borders hospital was bombed in Afghanistan and the Doctors Without Borders wants an international humanitarian fact-finding commission to investigate it. If you were president, would you want this to happen, this organization to investigate it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, look, it was a horrible mistake. And we made it. And it was just a horrible thing that took place. I have been watching that. And I think that's maybe the least of the problems. How does a thing like this happen? This is constantly happening with our country. We don't have victories anymore. We bomb hospitals, instead of bombing targets.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're like the gang that can't shoot straight. I mean, nobody has ever seen anything like this. This is constantly happening with our country. So many bad things. They bombed a hospital. We had a lot of people. You had patients being operated on, innocent patients being operated on. And it just never ends with our country now.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have to start winning. We have to start doing things properly.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What do you think about President Obama's announcement today that he is going to keep troops in Afghanistan longer?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I agree with that announcement because, frankly, if you look at what happened with Iraq, we should have never been in Iraq in the first place, but when we took the troops out, that was the end of that. And now Iran is taking over Iraq as sure as you are sitting there. So I think that probably they have to do that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He is cutting it down to 5,000. Maybe he will leave 10,000. Not that I recommend this at all, but I think you have no choice at this moment because you already see the insurgents. They are already going in there because they all think we are leaving. Probably you have to leave it. It's a shame to have to leave it. You know, at what point do we leave?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> At what point do we get out? But you probably have to leave. Otherwise, the same thing is going to happen as happened in Iraq.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, Prime Minister Netanyahu is not happy with the United States at the suggestion that they are using excessive force in the latest round of problems in Israel. What are you thinking about the United States' suggestion that it's excessive force by Israel?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, Israel is being hit from all sides. And, you know, if you look at this new deal, this horrible, one of the worst contracts ever negotiated, the Iran nuclear deal, I mean, how can Israel be happy with the United States? And in the meantime, they are getting hit on in so many different ways. So I don't blame him for being unhappy with our president or the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're not taking care of them. We are not doing what we are supposed to be doing. And, you know, excessive force. What's the excessive force? They are being hit from all sides and they are being hit very unfairly. And they have to do what they have to do.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Last night, we had a guest here On the Record. His name is Eric Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And I asked him growing up the son of Donald Trump. And here's what Eric said. Listen to what Eric said. [Begin Video Clip] [End Video Clip]
<Eric Trump> <Neutral> I think my best memories probably are we're walking construction sites with him. We go over these big buildings, his building. We followed him around. So I think he kind of taught us the art of the deal, you know, just by being with him. But, you know, we remember -- I remember building Lego sets in his office while he was negotiating great casino deals and other things. And, you know, it was a lot of fun.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, it wasn't teaching him to ride a bicycle, but apparently it was teaching him real estate. What do you think about that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And how to drive tractors. At a young age, he could drive tractors. Well, I have wonderful children. Eric has done such a great job. He helped us rebuild Doral along with Don and Ivanka and did a fantastic job in Miami. And he is actually now in charge of the great Turnberry in Scotland. I bought that a number of years ago and we are renovating Turnberry in Scotland, one of the great resorts in the world, where they have the British Open golf championship.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And he has been absolutely amazing. And I watched him last night. And I said I don't want to go in tonight because I cannot compete with that performance that he did last night. He was great. He looked great and he sounded great. He is very, very smart. And he has done a fantastic job.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, thank you, and I hope that we are looking forward to introducing your wife to the On the Record audience, as well as Ivanka to come here and your son, Don. So I hope you put a little pressure on them, will you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely, Greta, I will.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, thank you, Donald. Nice to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you very much.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right now is Donald Trump who wants to say hello to us. Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Good morning. How are you? I know you're enjoying things.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hello, Robin.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> How are you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wanted to thank you, Howard, for defending me against Branson who died. He was dead on arrival as you probably heard. His show bombed.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know what, you're the greatest.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Why [Inaudible] greatest competitor with these [Inaudible]?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm just competitive, Robin, but you know, this guy goes around for a period about a year. He's telling everybody how great I am. There's no way we want to compete with Donald. He's the great. And then all of a sudden, about a week ago, before the show en -- started, he was saying "Oh
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, you never like to do that, Howard. You only like to pick on a guy when he's down.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I waited and the show bombed. It got lower ratings than Mark Cuban and his show was taken off the air. And you know, so they're both Popstars. The two guys bombed.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, let's review. First of all, Donald Trump's TV show, The Apprentice, is a top rated show. Very successful.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Still hotter than ever, Howard, too.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And hotter than ever.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, it is a franchise [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This has turned out to -- and let's put it this way, Robin, NBC likes me very much.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> All I can imagine. I've heard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you mean? What do they do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did they give you more money?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] I mean they've been very nice.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I bet they'll be a lot nicer.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh really? Getting more money?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm like, Howard, you know.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What's the next move after regular television that I have something on the satellite, that I can [Inaudible]?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Satellite television.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like that movie. You made it, Howard.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You [Inaudible] saying that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I like it too. Believe me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And I'll be talking about it on Letterman Thursday night. But let's talk about you for a second.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love network television. I have to say.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Absolutely, so you went on with The Apprentice and then right away which happens in television all the time. I mean, when I said "Let's grab a billionaire"
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And I put them on TV to copy Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And in doing, so first of all, with Richard Branson. He came on my show. This is why you're great. I had him. He is a boring guy.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Boring.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He said [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh Howard, he's a zero. You know he is. In fact, by the way, in England, you go to England.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They think he's the worst. I mean, you know, they know him better. Hey, look. Here's a guy who spent his whole life pissing away a lot of money, trying to circle the globe in a balloon and I don't what you want to do that. And he failed. He tried it like seven times. He failed and then some guy comes out of nowhere and does it. That's the end of that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So you're, you are saying in the paper -- you're saying here today that here's a guy who spent his entire life working on getting around the world in a balloon and as you said, I don't understand why he got a billion dollars. Do you want to suddenly go around on a balloon and risk your life?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, let me ask you this. If you were on an airline, how could you have a billion dollars? Okay. Let's face it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If you own an airline, you know, it almost has to be sucking wind.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So how can a guy who owns an airline be a billionaire? So I don't believe he's a billionaire.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You know?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think he's a rebel but he's not much of a rebel, Howie. He's not the kind of rebel that you take. Okay?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's not exactly Neil Young. Okay?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So this is a guy that owns an airline and in my opinion, the airline can't be doing very well because no airline is doing well.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So when you --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Let me ask you something. Do you know -- what do you think of his whole, you know, going into space thing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Robin, honestly, you can have the guy. See ? What I like is honesty. When a guy says nice things and then a week before the show, somebody wants him up and said "You know
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I was actually going to say nice things about him. I was going to say "Hey"". I said ""I'm sort of revealing the truth."
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I love when they come on and they hit you and you know the [Inaudible] well, Howard, because you've had it all your life. They come on and then they hit you and then they bomb.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The guy had nobody watching. I'll tell you who beat him. The Gilmore Girls.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh my God!
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> On the WB.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, they were. He was number five, Robin, in his time slot.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But let me ask you something. Would you --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I didn't know there were five networks actually, Howard, until I saw this.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Would you invest -- would you invest money in taking people in a rocket ship into space?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I personally wouldn't.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You wouldn't? Why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because I have no interest in doing that stuff. I mean, it's just not my thing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And is it a money making opportunity really?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't imagine it, Howard. I would say if he does it, it probably isn't.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I can't imagine it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So did you watch the show when it aired? Did you watch the show?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I watched the first 17 minutes --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Where he had somebody which I, you know, which I took a little bit of offense that I'm six feet, three. The other guy's about five foot, two get out of a limousine.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The guy's five foot, two. He weighed about 300 pounds. He gets out of a limousine and it's supposed to be like a take off with me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This long stretch limousine. This is the very beginning of the first program. He has this long stretch limousine pull up and he has this guy. This real [Inaudible] get out of the car and it's supposed to be Donald Trump. I walk over. Shake his hand. He says something.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well, the point is, if he's doing his own show, why would he sit there and attack you? Let him do his own thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, and then they mention my name during the show like --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They jump on some balloon
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. Now, why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Come to think of it, who's going to hire people who want to sit down and have tea on top of a balloon?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, that's the point. I mean, you hire people in business based on their business ability. Why would you hire someone who's willing to get in a balloon?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he really -- it doesn't make any difference because I think he failed so badly. We're probably only helping them because I think he's only got about a week left.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is that why the show [Inaudible]?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was supposed to be a 16 week deal based on the ratings that he's got going. They say, you know, it's virtually impossible to keep it on the air. That's what happened.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you send him a note saying "Hey
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I sent him a note much worse than that actually. I said "You shouldn't use the word billionaire in your title because it's impossible. How is it possible to be a billionaire with
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> So you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Know what I sent? I sent Mark Cuban a note when he bombed, when he failed. He was another one. He went after me, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He said, he went after me on your show.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right. He did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When he failed, I wrote him a note "Dear Mark
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> He's offered to help him.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Is your show successful where these guys fail because of your charisma? Because people want to see Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's only because of my looks. No, I don't know. It's, it's successful because number one, we have a good show.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I will say this. Now, The Apprentice is on in 88 different countries.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's number one in every country. Sadly, however, when we get the Donald Trump of Australia and the Donald Trump of these other countries to go on.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Oh no, they're not using you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no, no, they are using me.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh, okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They play the first one but, you know, some of these countries aren't speaking English, Robin.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right. Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it's, its virtually number one in every country where it is, 88 different countries in England and Australia, that when they get somebody to play my role because I deal with that. You know, Mark Burnett and myself own the show.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> 50-50 so my deal with them and I deal with is that the day after the first airing which is a Trump airing.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They then choose the Trump of Australia with a Trump of England.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's obviously not Branson and I have a feeling that they're not going to choose Branson or the Trump of someplace, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, every time that's been done, the show has bombed the media.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Of course.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I would say that in one way, I'm extremely happy about that. In another way, I'd like to see it work.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, from that standpoint but it seems to work with me and it seems not to work without others so we're going to find out about that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right, let's review. So the point is that Richard Branson, a supposed billionaire, went on TV. His show was flawed because he, he tests people by putting them up in balloons which really [Inaudible].
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> And Donald says he has no charisma.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think his show is flawed because of him. I mean, I think [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He's boring. He's boring.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a boring guy who thinks he's cool with his [Inaudible]. There's nothing worse than somebody that thinks they're cool and that they're not. I mean, Richard doesn't have it. Go ahead.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Take a couple of phone calls. Yes, Ralph. Go ahead.
<Ralph Cirella> <Positive> First of all, the -- that show was pretty much unwatchable to me. Nothing on TV that night. I couldn't sit through it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Ralph.
<Artie Lange> <Negative> I have the same problem, Ralph.
<Ralph Cirella> <Positive> Yeah, I watched the beginning and it was kind of interesting and then it just completely fell apart. I mean, it's just people jumping around a balloon. Who wants to see that? The reason Mr. Trump's show is so great and it's probably the best show on TV right now is they all sit around and once they fail, they all blame each other like rats on a sinking ship. It's the greatest thing to watch.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. So there is a formula that works.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It's the drama.
<Ralph Cirella> <Positive> And it's him too and his staff. I mean, it's great to sit down and watch those guys evaluate why somebody say "Oh
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. It's, it's, it's a real business.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ralph, I don't know who you are but I love you too.
<Ralph Cirella> <Positive> I love you, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And by the way, Ralph would like to glam off you, Mr. Trump, and go on your yacht.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Anytime he wants.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> [Inaudible] Hey, Donald. This is Artie.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hello, Artie.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> I can't wait to see the show starring the Mexican Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hey, Howard. I don't know if you heard this.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I was a little odd [Inaudible] because I'm a fan of the show.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But you know, I got to tell you at my roast
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When he stole the show and I have to be honest with you, Artie. We had every comedian knocking the hell out of me for two hours, okay?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I heard.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He stole the show and I told you that, Artie, and, you know what, Artie? If you didn't steal the show, I wouldn't say it. You know that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> [Inaudible] something. This is really true. I heard from everyone that at the Donald Trump roast, Artie was the killer.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Like just totally killed and I don't know when it airs. When does it air?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hope it doesn't air. I got brutalized.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, I see.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no. My deal with them. You know, the problem with the Flyers roast, it used to be you do it and it was all down to the press.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because, you know, they say a lot of things and exaggerate and they have a lot of fun with you, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, they do every -- they say things that are so bad. It's unbelievable.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. You're a good sportsman.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The deal was it was always off bounds to the press and that was fine. The problem is it's not a bounce of the press. So here I am, reading a front page story in The New York Times about what, Artie, and other people said about me.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What is the worst thing you said, Artie, about Mr. Trump?
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> Oh, you know what? I don't think I could repeat it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You can repeat what you said, Artie. It's okay. I mean, you know, but they said things about me that was so bad and the problem is, Howard --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What was he --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What Artie is saying. You know he's a comedian. You see the smiles. You see the whole place.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> Right. Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But when you read it in the New York Times, nobody knows that he's a comedian or saying it so you end up looking like a jerk. But I'll tell you what's, what's unfair about the [Inaudible]. I told him this. It used to be off bounds to the press.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What? You never knew what was said.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right. You go in and would become -- I mean today, I wa -- I walked into that show. I saw 500 people from the press standing there with cameras.
<Artie Lange> <Positive> Yeah, it was -- you know what, Donald, that was the only tape [Inaudible] and it was like, you know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was unbelievable and you know, look. It was an honor. It was a 100 year. It was biggest roast they had but Artie, you have to say, was that room packed?
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> It was packed. It was a major event. I'll tell you that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was an honor, Alex, but you know, it doesn't translate into the so-called legitimate press if you call that legitimate.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. Yes, Cianci. Go ahead. What do you want to say?
<Cianci (Caller)> <Positive> Hi. Two quick things. Donald, I love you and I always believe that you're a very honest man so please confirm or deny this story that when you dine now, you only tip 18%, 20% if the service is exceptional whatever you told me [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, 20% isn't a bad tip but I usually get more than that, Cianci, you know.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What, what, what --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I usually give -- I would say I give 25-30%. Sometimes, I give 100%. You know, it's a meal.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> What would you tip on, on a $200 meal? What would you tip, Mr. Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would give 30-40 dollars, sometimes depending on the waiter or waitress or whatever.
<Cianci (Caller)> <Negative> I ask because I know some people who I -- have served you and they complain that you only --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can't believe that, Cianci, because if anything, I tip too much. I really give a lot of tip because it's irrelevant. Exactly. If somebody -- if I give somebody 50 bucks, I would say I'd give $50 for two hundred. And I think that's good by any standard house.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Exactly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But generally, I would give more than 25% and I've never been accused of that.
<Artie Lange> <Positive> According to some people, I'm a better tipper than you, which is --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's always possible but I give, I give awfully good tips.
<Cianci (Caller)> <Positive> One last thing, yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Trump -- Donald Trump is saying that he refutes you and says --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible] says he has information that says you gave an 18% tip.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I would never. I don't think I've given -- I, I don't get [?] that service.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, the sad part is how I go to restaurants like [Inaudible], Howard. I'm sure this happens with you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I go to restaurants. No matter what restaurant I go to, they give me a free meal. And they said, you know "Please
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I don't --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's only because like you got your heart [?] and they give you free so if I'm in the gutter but I go to a restaurant, I have to pay every penny, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's right. I, I, I don't really get the free meal thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm shocked.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right, Cianci, is that it [Inaudible]
<Cianci (Caller)> <Positive> One, one, one final thing. Donald, would you challenge Branson to a million dollar stake of Texas Hold 'em live on the Howard Stern Show?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, I've already beaten the guy so badly and you know my, my feeling is when you're up on somebody --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] certain extent although there is a poker sense which I believe in strongly but poker to a certain extent is luck and I don't like to rely on.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You're on or you won already. You don't gamble, do you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't gamble much. Well, I gamble with life, I guess.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, speaking of gambling, I called your show a couple of years ago and people have said it's one of the top five moments in the history of Howard Stern.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm sure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You had AJ Benson sitting in the aud -- in your show. I didn't know he was there. I was going to promote the Miss Universe pageant that I own.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And AJ Benson's just sitting there and he was angry because I had taken away his girlfriend or something.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That was the best.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now somebody said that you rated that because I heard about your Emmy deal today.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Somebody said that you rated that a top five moment in the history of Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Absolutely, it was everything a radio should be.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I haven't heard it in a while. I'd love you to play it sometime today.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right. I will try and do that, Mr. Trump. Congratulations, you are bragging and rightly so. You beat Richard Branson who took you on. He said "I'm going to beat Donald Trump"" and he didn't. And you have -- you
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And not a billionaire.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And he's a moron for riding around in a hot air balloon --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> In a hot air balloon.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Which I couldn't agree with you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I knew the show was in trouble when he starts off driving a jeep --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because he's supposed to be a man of the people, right? And they have this imposter, the Trump impostor, who really if you [Inaudible] this guy, you wouldn't believe that, all right, but they have that so-called Trump imposter. Come in in a super stretched limousine.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> By the way --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't and I don't have that. I only have a stretched limousine.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I don't know if you know it but when we had Richard Branson on, Mary Ann from Brooklyn called up and yelled at him.
<Mary Ann (Caller)> <Neutral> Hi, Mr. Trump. It's me, Mary Ann from Brooklyn and I called him and told him "Why are you copying Donald Trump? He's an innovator. He made this show."" and Mr. Trump
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh.
<Mary Ann (Caller)> <Positive> And your family and you've [Inaudible] Trump village in Brooklyn and Donald Trump, you have the best show on TV.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. [Inaudible] available?
<Mary Ann (Caller)> <Neutral> Howard, I can't wait to see your show on Letterman, Howard. I am counting the minutes for you to go on David Letterman, Howard. I cannot wait.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you.
<Mary Ann (Caller)> <Positive> I love you, Howard. All I need is Howard in my life. Let's get serious, serious. Let me hear my Howard talk. Hear my Howard talk.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Mary Ann.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> [Inaudible] if Mary Ann is available.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would think.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She doesn't yet. But she, she actually looks pretty good.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> She's not available. Isn't she married?
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> No, she married.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> She married.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> She is?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible] she's available.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Anyway, you know what, Donald was saying he doesn't gam -- He didn't gamble twice. And he's about to gamble a third time.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, marriage. You still going through with that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, Howard, she's great just like you have a great one and they know each other.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know if feels so serious. She's, you know, -- it's, it's sort of interesting. I've had the best five years of my life. Really, Howard. I mean in business, in any way possible.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And to be honest with you, she's been with me for that five year period. And the answer is yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You are getting married.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What about you, Howard? No?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No. Marriage is not for me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I love my girlfriend but I don't need to be married. I mean what is she -- unless she's going to have kids
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And she doesn't need to be married either. That's the key. You don't need to be married. I agree with that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Does she need to be married?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No. She doesn't carry [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. Well, tell me that in two years.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, he's got five under his belt, Nelligan.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> David, what's the problem? You're on the air with Donald Trump and Mr. Trump has to go to his very busy day. Go ahead.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Okay, I love the show.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<David Letterman> <Negative> I love it. My family were addicted to it. The problem that I'm having is that this past episode really pissed me off. There's no question in my mind to quit. Pissed you off two episodes ago. And so therefore the activity that you picked, you made sure there was no chance he could win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you have to understand. The fact is that in business, you do have to rely a little bit on the past too. And it was close between him and Ivana as -- Do you believe this, Howard. I have a contestant named Ivana. You think I got set up?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> She might be --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Of all the people, every time I look at her, I get, you know, you get the shakes.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> She's a pain in the ass?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She is a pain in the ass too. The cheap one was a pain in the ass. Now, original Ivana was of course not a pain in the ass.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, please.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's a lovely one.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> She was such a pain in the ass but you can't say that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, she was actually very nice.
<David Letterman> <Positive> If you had to tweak any piece in any activity whatsoever, -- You had eight contestants and you make sure that the activity that they have to sell is one of the -- One of the participants [Inaudible]. It's almost like someone sells fine cars, exotic cars, and that's the activity that you can't give them. How do you use bridal salon when you have one of the participants who owns bridal salons?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know what happened? That was set up. It's a very good question and that was set up long before we chose the participants. And then all of a sudden, it turned out this participant was good at that but if he were really the right guy, he would have fought her even if he lost. He might not have been fired. He gave up before -- he said "I can't beat her"". You have to admit this. He said ""I can't beat her up because she has too much experience with bridal salons""."
<David Letterman> <Negative> That might be true but unfortunately if you look at the statistics, more often than not, the team that loses the project manager is the one. The project manager has not been doing well. Probably 75%of the time if they lose.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hey, this guy really knows the show, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, he's --
<David Letterman> <Positive> I love the show.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<David Letterman> <Positive> I could put up with a lot of the stuff. I like the ego. I love the fact you don't do with anyone first season. You used to talk about I'm going to now show you the greatest mansion in the world and all of a sudden, we're seeing Mar-a-Lago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It is the greatest mansion in the world.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Okay. Fact of the matter is I love this show.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> That's.
<David Letterman> <Negative> I thought that Chris pissed you off so badly that you were going to make sure, no matter what, he was gone. And if we [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well that's a good point because he did badly the week before. The fact is that he blew it because he gave up on this task. Now interestingly, David. Your name is David, right?
<David Letterman> <Positive> Yes. Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Interestingly we started off selling lemonade and nobody wanted any part of the show. You know, the only one that agreed to do in the first series was a guy named George Steinbrenner.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Who was a friend of mine Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now everybody [Inaudible] show.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now, we have General Motors just signed to everybody. We have every -- we have.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> What is the [Inaudible]?
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> The plugs are unbelievable. I got to tell you I was going to ask them how much they get. For instance last week's show, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> The thing that they have to do is they have to open up a bridal salon for four hours and who can sell the most dresses. So they start at Tavern on the green. Welcome to Tavern on the green, the finest restaurant in New York City where many weddings take place. It definitely has nothing to do with it, then the team that wins and I can't remember it. It's a really famous jeweler in New York if they win $50,000.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's called Graff Jewelers
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> Papery?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they pay dearly if that's what you're asking.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> And there's like a six minute
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How much do they pay? I mean because it's
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they paid a lot but you know, they also more importantly, they gave $50,000 to the contestants to [Inaudible]. You know, you know $50,000 that graph buys you may be a really poor set of [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> Because people are --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, $50,000 to buy various, you know, jewelry. They all go eyes opened up but you know, when they got there, they said there's nothing for sale for $50,000.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How much jewelry do you buy your girlfriend?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Not much.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm not a big believer in that, Howard, because, you know, they have to love you for you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hey, when's your son get married?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So he's getting married. Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why you letting him do that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he's marrying a good girl.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, please.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You know, we all have to make that mistake when we're young.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, hey. Hey.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It doesn't have to be a mistake but usually it is, Robin.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> Kind of Bassi. I bet your daughter is dating a guy named Bingo.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's dating a guy named Bingo.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What is a guy [Inaudible]?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a daughter who is so beautiful, Robin.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That she's like, she blows every, you know, when you talk about the other girls, you talk about -- I mean, this girl is -- She was a super like, she was a tremendously successful model then she turned it off and went immediately to college.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She became a great student. She was always a great student and she's great. So yeah, she's got a boyfriend named Bingo.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What does Bingo do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Bingo. I'm not sure it has to do with anything, Robin.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Do you hate him?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's a wasp from that [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Do you hate him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I don't. I think he's a nice boy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Tell the truth.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no he's very nice.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's not who you want.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's very nice. Listen [?] to you, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know you. I don't hear you raving about Bingo.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So anyway, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, bingo.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> There is some adversity in his life.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There's always been -- nothing. Nothing ever goes totally.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So did your boy, did your boy have a prenup?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he will have.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He will.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I guarantee you that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Whether he wants it or not, he will have a prenup.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Is it a rich boy she's married?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right. Yeah. He's okay. He's okay but she's beautiful
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What is she doing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And she's really a good girl.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Does she like the family?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She was a model and now she's a successful something. But I see, I like the family. Family's good. Father's a lawyer.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I saw the picture of the girl in the paper. Very attractive.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's a great girl actually so I think you did very well.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> But Howard, how rich is a son in a sense that like, I don't know what he does for a living and --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> The son works for him.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> So does that mean like when he turns 21, Donald hands over a bunch of money?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How are you going to work that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, Howard, I, I don't know how you feel about this but I've seen some tragedies that I don't know how much time you have but a friend of mine had four children. He was doing very, very well. He did -- well, he was worth probably 60,000,000 bucks so he wasn't like, you know, worth like a lot of money.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> 60
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, see, each one of his four children, $10,000,000 a piece. That was in 1988.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When the real estate depression happened, okay?. He went to his children. He had a 70,000,000 dollar bank loan. He could have bought it out for 20,000,000 dollars. He went to his children. He said "Kids
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> Oh. Oh.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They wouldn't do it. And they said to him "Dad
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He ended up surviving by the skin of his teeth because he's a smart guy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he survived and I saw him the other day for the first time in five years and he said -- I said to him "Jim
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. Right. Right. Right. Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Unbelievable, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But wouldn't you be the same way?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> My attitude is what I'm -- when I go, I'm going to leave my children $6,000,000,000 and you know, that's not good enough. I mean the only risk is, Howard, that --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They tell you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The only risk is -- Hey, Howard, the only risk is they don't want to you to be too wealthy
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, or their spouses to knock you off.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> My attitude is when you go, you leave it and you have and then, you say "Kids
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And along the way, you probably help them out here and there when you want too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, honestly, I -- look, I have great kids but that story had a huge impact on me because I saw it happening and I couldn't believe what was happening.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And his father was really -- I thought the kids loved him and all and they wouldn't give him anything.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, that's -- they're monsters.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Donald, you do have at least your one son working for you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> So --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no. He does very well. He gets a beautiful salary and he's doing a very good job and some day, you know --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And you're buying all the kids apartment.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All my kids will work for me eventually. And I think that's good. You know, they want to if they like it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, if they don't like it, I don't want it to work for me because there won't be any good at it. But
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They'll work for you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Donald Jr. Likes it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think, that's great but you know, my attitude is it's very complicated. It's very complicated also to give money away. You know that, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But you won't, but you won't get Bingo a job.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I will see what Bingo -- how that all works out.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Howard, does Donald Jr. Say they like Donald? Do you feel Bingo is sleeping with your daughter?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> In that apartment you just bought her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Certainly hope it's in the [?] apartment.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It's got to be --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I certainly hope that nobody is sleeping with my daughter because my daughter is not meant to be slept with.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Exactly. Well, at least she's not sleeping with me. Thank God for that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's, that's a minor relief.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Wouldn't that make you, wouldn't that make you crazy? I mean, you got an apartment for her and Bingo gets to go up there and bang your daughter. That's got to make you nuts.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Yeah, it's not Bango.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, I mean Bango gets to go up the apartment. I don't like it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't even like to think about it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right. Listen, Donald Trump, bragging a little bit. Why not? I mean he --
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Show's amazing, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Show's doing well and good for you. I'm proud of you and congratulations.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, [Inaudible] billionaires to watch out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, this probably kills the billionaire deal for about a year or two. You know what happens, Howard. They come back at you in [Inaudibles].
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And then you tell them.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then for about two years, you have a like a free period when nobody comes at you
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, they don't try it again.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, they're not going to try this again. I mean, there's nobody out there that they're going to try again and you know these two guys failed badly. There's nobody out there that's going to happen for. I would say, probably we have a two year hiatus and then, they'll find some other rat around the corner
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And you'll take him off too. All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Howard, good luck with your new deal.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thank you very much. I'm excited about it. I would -- I will talk about it Thursday night on Letterman. I hope you tune in.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I will be listening, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right. Thanks.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Have a good time.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> There he is. Donald Trump, the number one guy, the number one billionaire.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He's the guy that made it work on TV.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I love it. I read the paper [Inaudible]. You know, who the hell goes up in a balloon and he goes and the guy tried seven times and then some other guy was able to do it. He couldn't even do it.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, he's supposed to be a billionaire. He gets beat by some guy who comes out of nowhere. In a balloon. All right, we're going to take a break. We'll be back right after these words. More [Inaudible] coming up. [Commercial Break]
