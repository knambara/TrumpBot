<David Letterman> <Positive> Nice to have you here in the Ed Sullivan Theater. I think it's one of the few properties in this community you don't own.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That is true.
<David Letterman> <Negative> Now it seems to me like last night, you were down in South Padre Island? Is that where it is?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That right.
<David Letterman> <Neutral> In the Gulf of Mexico?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That is correct.
<David Letterman> <Negative> For hosting the... not hosting but looking at the big Miss Teen USA Pageant.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<David Letterman> <Neutral> Now explain to the people, I guess your daughter was actually one of the hosts.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She was. She did a terrific job.
<David Letterman> <Neutral> How old is she? Is she just a girl?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's 15. Ivanka.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Ivanka. Is she like, like a big, like a supermodel?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's becoming a supermodel I guess. She's, she's a beautiful girl. She's doing great.
<David Letterman> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And she hosted the pageant last night.
<David Letterman> <Neutral> Now who is that guy she hosted with?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A young man from The Young and the Restless who also did a great job. It was a beautiful combination.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Well what's his name?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who the hell knows? What do I know.
<David Letterman> <Negative> He's too busy doing this. You don't care. Ahh but now, now you own, you own that pageant?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do. I own that and I own Miss Universe and I own Miss USA, along with your friends at CBS.
<David Letterman> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They got great ratings last night too, I guess you saw. In fact you got great ratings because we got great ratings.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Take anythingI can get, sure. Ahh but what is, what is your, as an investment, now can a person make money in something like that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, what happens is the various places for instance Miss Universe, Venezuela is bidding, Israel is bidding, lots of different countries are bidding. Lots of money to get it. Hong Kong wants to have a fight. Hong Kong has got a pretty well tied up for the 2000 and they're willing to pay many millions of dollars in order to get the pageants.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it's just worked out really terrific.
<David Letterman> <Positive> So but did somebody come to you and say "Hey, you know these ahh these beauty pageants, they're money machines. It's a license to print money these beauty pageants. Or did you have an idea that maybe this ought to be something we all look into.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I take tea, which is basically Madison Square Garden. In this case, wanted to sell certain assets and I liked that asset. I've always liked it. It's great you know, great television, great everything and I bought it. I then sold half to CBS and CBS has been a terrific partner.
<David Letterman> <Neutral> Yeah, I'd like to talk to you after the show because I got my eye on a dog track.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. Very good.
<David Letterman> <Positive> But now, how, how do we describe you, ahh are you like an entrepreneur? Is that what we describe you? Are you a real estate developer? Are you, what are you exactly?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ahh I mean my primary thing is real estate. I do great in the casino business.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Oh that's right. See now the casinos in. That's unbelievable! You own three casinos in the Atlantic City.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Three big ones.
<David Letterman> <Neutral> Now tell me this, Don, can I call you Don?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<David Letterman> <Negative> Or Don. I, like one crap table, one crap table, one 24 hour period, any craft table on the floor. I don't care what the limit is, I don't care if it's a big one, I don't care if it's a low one. What is that gonna turn over in just, in profit? Just in profit. Once crap table.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well you don't know because oftentimes I lose. I mean, we had a man beat us a 5 million.
<David Letterman> <Negative> Oh yeah. That happens once in 20 years and then you put his picture on the billboards and everybody comes in but seriously. Ahh... There it is! But I'm I'm curious about this. One of those crap tables generates an enormous sum of money, doesn't it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They do pretty well, yeah.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Well give me, give me like a figure. We're talking about $50,000 a day, $100,000 a day?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We'll change it around a minute. I've had days where I won 12 million dollars from one man and I've days where I lost 7 or 8 million dollars from one man, one person, one gambler.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Is that true?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, we, it's very big swings. I mean you'd swings and you can lose. I mean the fact is, having the house doesn't necessarily you win. At the Taj Majal, which is now number one in Atlantic City actually by far and Trump Plaza,which is number two in Atlantic City, we had huge swings, both winning...
<David Letterman> <Negative> Are you trying to put yourself out of business?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I, I don't mind when they win because when they win, they come back. But but we do have huge swings both ways.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Now what does it do to you? When you see something like that? Did you just woo! Oh my God! Or you just don't, you just don't care coz you're not.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know over the course of the year, it comes out okay. I mean it really comes out okay.
<David Letterman> <Positive> 12 million dollars a year, 12 million dollars a year and at the end of the year, things look pretty good, from where you said that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very good. It's been pretty good.
<David Letterman> <Negative> Ahh if we went to your ATM machine right now... You know what I'm saying? And I, believe me, this is none of my business so if, at any point, you want to just get up and walk out, I understand perfectly. Many of our guests do. But if we went to your ATM machine right now, put in your little card and punch in your PIN code, like what would be the PIN code?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Gee I, I really would tell you. I really would coz you're such an honest guy. Ahhm and go ahead and then what do you want to know back then?
<David Letterman> <Positive> I just wanna know if you had, like I said to you Don, do me a favor right now, go out and come back with as much cash as you could lay your hands on, what would that figure be?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It would be a lot.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Really? How much, how much money and forgive me if this is embarrassing but I think people are fascinated by money, wealth and power you know. Ahh how much are your worth totally? Your, the Trump businesses, the Trump beauty pageants, the Trump you know rolling rings, whatever the hell you got, I don't know. How much is that empire worth?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know I really don't know. There been a lot of different estimates and I, I really don't know what I'm worth. It depends when you take values of Trump tower and all the different buildings I've built.
<David Letterman> <Negative> It's always influx, isn't it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's always influx. Especially, I love leverage, I love borrowing and when you like to borrow, you could go up and down. I've had days when I'm worth 4 billion dollars and days when I'm worth -900 million dollars. That's a big sway.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Yeah. Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, four, five years ago, I was probably worth minus 900 million dollars. And today, it works out where it's ahh very positive.
<David Letterman> <Negative> Now what, what would you do to turn that around? If you're down...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Works really hard.
<David Letterman> <Negative> You're down nearly a billion dollars, what do you, how do you turn that around?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, times turn it around, work turns it around, intelligence works it around. I mean there was a time where I sort of lost my focus a little bit. I wasn't working like I used to.
<David Letterman> <Negative> Put yourself on a budget.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And the market...
<David Letterman> <Negative> Put yourself on a budget.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You put yourself on a budget.
<David Letterman> <Positive> That's correct.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You put yourself on a budget.
<David Letterman> <Neutral> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And it worked out to a point where now I'm doing better than I ever did before.
<David Letterman> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So really, it was good.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Now but anyway, getting back to the worth of the empire, like is it like ahh a billion dollars? Are you worth a billion dollars? The empire worth a billion dollars?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well there's estimates of worth.
<David Letterman> <Neutral> 2 billion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People are saying that from a billion to four billion.
<David Letterman> <Negative> Uh-huh.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What the number would be, I have absolutely no idea. I really don't. I really couldn't tell you what I'm worth but it's it's not bad.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Now, it seems to me that a guy in your position, a guy in your position who can sit here and honestly say I'm not sure what I'm worth but it's a pretty good situation, the guy in your position then has an incumbency, a responsibility to do something nice for other people everyday of his life.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I agree.
<David Letterman> <Neutral> Now do you do that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do.
<David Letterman> <Neutral> Can you, without embarrassing yourself, can you give me an idea of something nice you've done for somebody recently?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I married Marla and now I'm giving her a big settlement.
<David Letterman> <Neutral> Oh man! Oh man!
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No? That's not what you had in mind?
<David Letterman> <Neutral> Oh man!
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's not what you had in mind, don't you think?
<David Letterman> <Negative> Oh man! See now, if I hadn't said that, people would have booed me.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know.
<David Letterman> <Negative> No, no, no. But you know what I'm getting at? Do you do, do you do good things?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. I give a lot of money away. Ahh and I, I love doing it to be honest. I think we have an obligation to do that and I give a lot of millions of millions of millions of dollars away to charities and different things.
<David Letterman> <Negative> Now do you, do you like talking about it or you'd rather not talk about it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't like talking about it. I usually don't talk about it and people don't like writing about it because it's not my image. They don't like that image.
<David Letterman> <Negative> They like to think of you as kind of a punk. Kind of a scaring punk.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They like to think as a bad guy.
<David Letterman> <Negative> Yeah. Bad guy like a bad guy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah like a bad guy image.
<David Letterman> <Negative> New York it fits better with New York City. A tough guy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah it works better I guess. I don't like it but I guess your friends in the media like it better.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Now ahh then tell us you mentioned your relationship with ahh Marla, that, that's over right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That is over.
<David Letterman> <Neutral> How long were you guys married?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Three and a half, almost four years.
<David Letterman> <Negative> Uh-hmm and it was a huge, when and why? I mean what happened there because...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Why marry?
<David Letterman> <Negative> No, no, no, no, no. It was kinda like a fairy tale.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think that's a lot of people think.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Hey hey Don, it was kinda like a... What's the matter with me? It was kinda like a fairy tale you know marriage with the wealthy Donald Trump and the beautiful wife, Marla. Well did it, can you give us some...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well you know she's a terrific young woman and it just something that you tend to grow apart and it just didn't work out, she just wanted out.
<David Letterman> <Neutral> Will you get married again do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would. I love the institution of marriage. It cost me a fortune but I love the institution of marriage. I think it's a great institution, I think you know it's something I really like.
<David Letterman> <Neutral> How long have you been, how many times you've been married?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is my second time.
<David Letterman> <Neutral> Second marriage and were you thinking that maybe one day you'll get married again?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's always possible, absolutely.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Alright, anything you'd like to say to the world while you're here?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love you all.
