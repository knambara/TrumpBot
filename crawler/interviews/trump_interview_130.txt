<Bret Baier> <Positive> Thanks for the time. What is this -- 26 hours?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm now on my 26th. We've been negotiating with some very good negotiators. Nice to be with you.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> Thank you for having us. You took every question at the news conference.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I took a lot of them. And we had a lot of reporters. I don't know if you saw that room but their credentials were like record kinds of numbers and I took as many as I could. People are really happy about it, and even I would say non-Trump fans, people are really happy. It's something that I'm very proud of. Now, with that being said, I want to get it done, but I believe that Chairman Kim wants to get it done.
<Bret Baier> <Neutral> You do?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do.
<Bret Baier> <Negative> I mean there was one part of a news conference I think you're a kind of joking that six months from now you could say this was a mistake. And I'm never going to tell you that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sure. No, it could happen. I mean all of a sudden --
<Bret Baier> <Neutral> But you don't believe that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's deals -- whether it's this, which is so important or buying a building or doing whatever you may be doing. No, I don't think that's going to happen but I said, you know, I only consider it successful if it gets done. I think we've done something very historic already in one way, but to me success is when it gets done.
<Bret Baier> <Negative> Is the military drawing down in South Korea? You're kind of hinted at that, and is there going to be this kind of tit for tat?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, it's not drawing down at all. In fact, honestly it was never discussed. I'm sure he would like that. It was never on the table. You know, when I met him today, we have a very good relationship I feel. I feel it's good.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know when we have chemistry -- you know it as well as anybody. And you understand what I mean. But when I met him today -- we had done three months, almost four months worth of work prior to my meeting. So we sort of understood that was never on the table.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> With that being understood and, you know, you asking a question like that, I would love to get the military out as soon as we can because it cost a lot of money, a lot of money for us. We don't get paid fully for that military which, you know, I will be talking to South Korea about.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we have 32,000 soldiers in South Korea. I would like to get them home. I would like to. But it is not on the table right now. At the appropriate time, it will be.
<Bret Baier> <Neutral> Do you think China looks at this and says this is kind of what we want? A North Korea that's under control, U.S. that is may be disengaging from the region.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think China really would like to see no nuclear weapons if you want to know the truth because look, whether you are semi-friendly with a nation or not when they have nuclear weapons and you're that close, it can't be a positive feeling. It just can't be.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So China has been very helpful. I think over the last two months, maybe less so. I think the border got a little bit more open. Now, it didn't affect today's negotiation but I think the border opened up a little bit more because China could be a little bit upset about trade because we are very strongly clamping down on trade.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> How strongly?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think very strongly. I mean you will see over the next couple of weeks. They understand what we're doing. With that being said, I have a very good relationship with President Xi, he's an incredible guy. Just, you know, essentially presidential life -- it's pretty good.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> Yes. So North Korea, you know, they have agreed to things before. They have agreed to several things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. But that's with a different president and nobody has taken it this far. And presidents have never met with anybody from North Korea. It's been, you know, delegated to other people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And even if they did meet they wouldn't have been able to pull it off. But this is something that should have been done years ago. I mean you've heard me say it many times. This should have been done 10 years, 15, 20 years ago. This shouldn't be done now where they have an arsenal of nuclear weapons. It should have never allowed to get to this point.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> With that being said, Chairman Kim wants to resolve the problem because he knew that we weren't playing around. I wasn't playing around. He's not playing around. We have a very -- I really say for, you know, for a fairly short term relationship because it was unbelievably hostile, the rhetoric.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Rhetorically it was unbelievably hostile. And I think we have a very good relationship. We understand each other.
<Bret Baier> <Negative> You know, you were asked in the press conference a number of different times in different ways about human rights and, you know, that you called this relationship really good and that he was very talented person. You know, you call people sometimes killers. He is a killer. He's executing people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a tough guy. Hey, when you take over a country, tough country, tough people and you take it over from your father, I don't care who you are, what you are, how much of an advantage you have. If you can do that at 27 years old, I mean that's one in 10,000 that could do that. So he's a very smart guy. He's a great negotiator, but I think we understand each other.
<Bret Baier> <Negative> But I mean he has still done some really bad things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. But so have a lot of other people done some really bad things. I mean I could go through a lot of nations where a lot of bad things were done. Now look, with all of that being said, the answer is yes, I'm going from today. I'm going from maybe 90 days ago because we really started this -- we got a call that he was going to the Olympics. He would like to go to the Olympics and that was sort of the beginning of what we have right now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we are very far down the line. You saw the agreement -- nobody thought we were going to have an agreement like that. And things were given to me as you know from the news conference, things were given to me, Bret, that were not even part of the agreement. I got them after we had signed the agreement.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> And so verification, you are confident you can set up --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm totally confident. And if we can't, we can't have a deal. We have to be -- you know, it has to be verified. But one of the things that really I'm happy is that the soldiers that died in Korea, their remains are going to be coming back home. And we have thousands of people that have asked for that, thousands and thousands of people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So many people asked when I was on the campaign, I don't have any relationship, but they said when you can, president, we would love our son to be brought back home -- you know, the remains.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I asked -- we had pretty much finished and I said would you do me a favor? The remains of these great fallen heroes, can we do something? He agreed to it immediately. It was pretty great.
<Bret Baier> <Negative> Why do you think Kim raced to complete his nuclear program and then decide to give it up?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think psychologically he felt it was important and I understand that. But again, this should not have been happening now. This should have happened years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm not blaming President Obama, I'm saying during Obama, during Bush, during Clinton -- this should have happened. Clinton got played. I mean when you look at what happened, he gave billions of dollars and it was like just a total waste of money.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> So does this summit thing, you seem like you like it, and interacting with these world leaders -- G-7 got a little rocky. And there was a question about that.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> [Begin Video Clip] You left the G-7 summit a few days ago in Canada having determined that Prime Minister Trudeau is weak and dishonest. What do you say to America's allies who worry that you might be jeopardizing our long-term alliances and who worry that you might be treating our historic friends as enemies and our historic enemies as friends?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I had a very good meeting with the G-7. And I left the meeting. And I will be honest we are being taken advantage of by virtually every one of those countries -- very, very seriously. And we are being taken advantage of on trade. [End Video Clip]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It really wasn't rocky when I left, it was great. In fact, I spoke to Prime Minister Abe. It was great when I left. I spoke to him just recently. I just told him about what had happened and he said it's amazing because you left it was like -- I negotiated a different kind of deal than they wanted but I was ok with it I thought. And then I saw what took place at this news conference. I said that is not really what happened.
<Bret Baier> <Negative> So does this make you want to sit down with Vladimir Putin?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but the question was asked by a reporter. It used to be the G-8, Russia was included. And about four or five years ago they expelled Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And a reporter asked me do you think you would be better off with Russia and I said absolutely. You know, we spend probably 25 percent of our time talking about Russia. I said to myself, wouldn't it be better if they were here?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, I'm not for Russia. I'm for the United States. But as an example, if Vladimir Putin were sitting next to me today instead of one of the others and we were having dinner the other night in Canada I could say would you do me a favor? Would you get out of Syria? Would you do me a favor? Would you get out of Ukraine? Get out of Ukraine, you should be there. Just come on.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I would probably have a good relationship with him or I would be able to talk to him better than if you call somebody on the telephone and talk. If I'm sitting like I was with the others -- for instance new prime minister of Italy. He is a great guy. We had a great relationship. He agrees with me on Putin, by the way, I have to tell you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But this wasn't anything that was up for a vote. This was a reporter asking a question. I said yes, I think it's better off as a G-8 rather than a G-7 and a lot of people agree with me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I will tell you as an example, if he were at that meeting I could ask him to do things that are good for the world, that are good for our country, that are good for him.
<Bret Baier> <Negative> In spite of all that he's done to us? Do you think he's going to --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, but he didn't -- I'm not sticking up for anybody. I'm just saying this, he didn't respect our leadership previously. He walked all over them. Look what he did to Obama with Crimea. He took Crimea. He took Ukraine -- I mean sections of Ukraine --
<Bret Baier> <Negative> -- which is why he got kicked out of the G-8.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I know but he didn't respect our leadership. He didn't respect it and so -- but this wasn't me. You know people say well, look what he did. He did it to Obama. Obama should not have allowed that to happen -- even with the voter stuff. Supposedly the FBI went to Obama. They told him about it. He didn't do anything about it.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> Do you think North Korea in this few days here has changed the dynamic in the midterm elections and today where do you think the midterm elections in your head are?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So Bret -- I saw on your show and I've seen 120 days ago we were down 16 points. Now I see Reuters has us up 2 and another one was up 6 and one it was down 3.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's a whole different ball game. I think the economy is so good. I think the tax cuts have been incredible, far greater than even I thought they would be. The regulation cuts have been great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean I've done more in 500 days than any president has ever done in their first 500 days. There's nobody close, and that's not -- that's a lot of people saying that. People that would rather not say it are saying it. And I really think that we are going to do very good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, history is against me because history for whatever reason, you win the election and then you lose lots of seats. I think we are going to do very well, I really do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The economy is doing so well. We are doing so well as a nation. I think we are going to surprise people and if you look at the numbers and if you look at the kind of turnouts like Texas, how many people showed up to vote as an example, how many Republicans showed up to vote -- people were very surprised.
<Bret Baier> <Negative> Mr. President, your people are a little tired because they can't hang with you for 26 hours, so we're going to wrap it up there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're holding up -- I'm very impressed because we are holding up Air Force One for you.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> I know. Thank you -- sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's pretty good. That's a big plane to be holding.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> Thank you for the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Thank you very much -- Bret. Appreciate it.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> Appreciate it.
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> President Trump, welcome back the Watters World. How does it feel?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It feels great, and it feels great to be with you, and you've been so nice, and thank you.
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> Well, flattery will get you everywhere. Now, the last time I spoke to you, I presented a signed photograph of myself at Trump Tower. Have you hung it on your wall yet?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, absolutely, right on that wall.
<Jessie Watters> <Negative> That's fake news. I don't believe it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was fake news.
<Jessie Watters> <Negative> Obamacare repeal could be President Trump's first deal. Are you going to close it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it's going to be... never easy. You know, health care is a very complex subject. I've been saying that for a long time now, people are agreeing with me. They understand. And not complex for the ordinary reason, Jesse. It's complex because you take this group, and you have to make them happy, and they become unhappy. Now you make them happy, and they become... so it's back and forth. The answer is yes, we're going to get something done. I think it's going to be terrific, and it's going to be so much better than Obamacare, which really doesn't exist.
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because if you allow it to exist for another year, it's going to implode. And you know, I've been saying for a long time, just walk away for one year they'll come back. The Democrats who, if you gave them a Democrat Bill to approve, they wouldn't approve it.
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They wouldn't give you one vote. It's really a bad situation out there, so and it's been that way for years, not just now, it's been that way for years. But if I put together a perfect Democrat Bill on health care, or anything else for them to sign, you wouldn't get one vote. It's a pretty bad deal.
<Jessie Watters> <Negative> People like Senator Rand Paul, who you ridiculed during the debate, could mess this thing up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Begin Video Clip] Rand Paul shouldn't even be on this stage. He's number 11, he's got one percent in the polls, and how he got up here... there's far too many people anyway. [End Video Clip]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I like him, he's become a friend of mine, and it's hard to believe I ridiculed, because he's a good guy.
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he means well, and I think, ultimately, we're going to all come together.
<Jessie Watters> <Neutral> It's gonna get done?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We want something done, and also we want to start on the taxes. We're going to cut everybody's taxes, including business taxes, the middle income taxes -- everything is going to be cut.
<Jessie Watters> <Negative> Incomes taxes...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I can't do that until we get this done.
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> The income tax rate. What are we talking about? What would you like to see the top rate be?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we're going to get a big reduction. We're going to bring business down to 15 to 20 percent from 36 and 38, and even higher that, in certain instances. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. We're going to bring taxes way down. And for middle-income we're also getting rid of brackets. We're going from seven to three or four brackets, and that will be such a pleasure.
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> What would you like to see the brackets look like?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I'd like to see zero. If you don't make much, like zero, and that's what's it's going to be it's going to be zero up to a level.
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then it's going to be 12 1/2 percent, 15 percent, It's going to be 10 percent. We're working on the different numbers, but it's going to be much lower than it is right now. It'll be the biggest tax cut since Reagan, and probably bigger than Reagan.
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> Very good, because I need the money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, before we do that we have to get... Good, but you're in that high bracket, I hope . I hope right now, you're in the high bracket.
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> Yeah, well, we saw some of your returns. These people over at NBC News doing everything they can to take you down.
<Rachel Maddow> <Negative> [Begin Video Clip] What I have here is a copy of Donald Trump's tax returns. We have his federal tax return for one year, for 2005. [End Video Clip]
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> I thought you leaked those returns yourself. It made you look good. You made $135 million and paid a lot of dough to Uncle Sam.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, they're bad people. There's something wrong with them. They leaked them. It's illegal to do what they did. I think, you know, I always heard that a tax return was a very sacred kind of a thing. You don't leak them, you're not allowed to. It's criminally offensive, but they put them out and I think it was ter.. I mean, not that... they're good from that standpoint.
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My tax returns are good.
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> Pretty good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All of my tax returns are good.
<Jessie Watters> <Negative> Yeah, but are you going after these leakers hard?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But.. we're thinking about it. We're looking at it. But it's terrible what's going on in Washington. We have a certain establishments out there, that's leaking, and if it gets down to other things, even more important than that, but a tax returns a very important thing and you're not supposed to be leaking them and they do.
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Which is, they just don't respect the law and we have to change that.
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> Right. The anti-Trump resistance is out there in the streets, some of it is in the federal government. How much do you think is that genuine anger, and how much do you think that someone, like President Obama pulling the strings from behind the scenes?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It might be everything you know, there's some anger, and there is great love on our side. I mean look at the crowds outside.
<Jessie Watters> <Negative> Huge.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have... we have crowds. We have Senator Lamar Alexander, we have Senator Corker, we have the Governor of the state, Governor of Tennessee, great guy, and, and they say, they've never seen crowds like that ever. They've been here a long time, They've never seen anything like it, for the country stars, for anything, and that's love. We have great love, that's how we won.
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> You have a lot of love on your side, and then there's also people burning things in the street. You think President Obama wants you to succeed?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know he's been very nice to me personally, but his people haven't been nice, and there's great animosity out there. There's great anger. Leaking is just one example of it, in some cases, a very serious example of it, but leaking and the the the level of anger is hard to believe. So, while he's nice personally, there doesn't seem to be a lot of nice things happening behind the scenes, and that's unfortunate.
<Jessie Watters> <Negative> The media, pretty vicious. Not just to you, but to your family. How do you process that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You just have to go on. You know, we've done a great job in terms of manufacturing, in terms of the market, in terms of business optimism. I don't know if you saw, optimism is up, the highest and 15 years...
<Jessie Watters> <Neutral> Yup.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> .. and much more than that, it'll turn out to be. Things are just going really well for the country. You look at the border, down now: 61 percent since the inauguration.
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Stock markets up 15 percent, almost 16 percent, since the inauguration. Over $3 trillion of value has been created. Many jobs have been created. I mean we're really... look. I inherited a mess, okay? The Middle East was a mess. People wanting to get jobs is a mess, despite the numbers. You know, you hear numbers, but you have millions of people out there that want to get jobs, they can't get jobs, because we don't have good jobs. But they're coming back. Ford is coming back. General Motors is coming back. Fiat Chrysler is coming back. We just had a big meeting in Detroit with the car manufacturers and it was unbelievable. What's going to be happening. So, ultimately, that's the thing that talks, and, as you probably saw the polls that came out today, I'm at my all-time high for this. So we'll just keep going.
<Jessie Watters> <Negative> You're still paying attention to the polls, aren't you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do. I pay... the only ones, I guess I shouldn't have paid attention to was the exit polls during Election Day...
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...Because they was saying, boy, I think I'm doing better than that, and it turned out that we did.
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> Very good. Let's do a Watters World Quiz.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Jessie Watters> <Negative> Don't be nervous.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, I won't, I promise.
<Jessie Watters> <Negative> Chuck Schumer, the president of CNN, and Alec Baldwin. If you had to fire one person, right now, who would you fire?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think the Alec Baldwin situation is not good. Chuck, I'm very disappointed, because he's a guy that should make deals for the people...
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...as a Democrat or a Republican. I thought he'd be a dealmaker, and instead he's just an obstructionist, so I'm disappointed in him. And Jeff Zucker, I mean I got him the job. I recommended him... and I didn't recommend him, I got him the job, and CNN is just, you know, fake news. Who would I say... I just.. I don't want to say, but I will say I'm disappointed in all three. I think the portrayal of me is ridiculous.
<Alec Baldwin> <Positive> [Begin Video Clip] Hi Steve, you look rested. [End Video Clip]
<Jessie Watters> <Negative> Next question. What is going to be done first: building the wall or defeating ISIS?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you see we're doing very well in the Middle East over the last four weeks. That's another thing. I mean, we're not playing games anymore, and relating the generals and the captains and the majors and the people on the ground that graduated from West Point and Annapolis, and they've graduated from the Air Force Academy, and they're out there doing their thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think the wall is going to start very soon. We had almost 200 bidders to build a wall. We have great pricing coming in. We have some great designs coming, and I think the walls going to start very soon.
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> Are you going to pick the design for the wall?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll be very much involved, General Kelly's done a fantastic job. When it comes to design, I'm very good at that stuff, and building on time on budget? That's what I do.
<Jessie Watters> <Negative> Ok, let me know when they break around, I might be down there with a shovel.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Good, maybe I'll be down there with you.
<Jessie Watters> <Negative> Ok, the lightning round. This is the last part. I'm going to name a name, and then you give one or two words to describe that person, ok? Kellyanne Conway.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very nice woman.
<Jessie Watters> <Neutral> Hillary Clinton.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Disappointed.
<Jessie Watters> <Neutral> Mark Cuban.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Backed me all the way, but when I wouldn't return his phone calls, he went the other way, picked the wrong horse.
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> Yes, he did. Vladimir Putin.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Don't know him, but certainly he is a tough cookie, and I don't know how he's doing for Russia. We're going to find out one day, I guess.
<Jessie Watters> <Neutral> Elizabeth Warren.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think she'd lose so badly. I think she hurt, honestly, I think she hurt Hillary Clinton very badly.
<Jessie Watters> <Negative> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I watched those speeches, the anger, the hatred in her heart, and I said, you know, she's really bad for Hillary. I watched that last couple of weeks where she was getting up with that craziness and that anger.
<Elizabeth Warren> <Negative> [Begin Video Clip] I got news for you, Donald Trump. Women have had it with guys like you, and nasty women have really had it with guys like you. [End Video Clip].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Pocahontas would not be proud of her, as her representative, believe me.
<Jessie Watters> <Neutral> I think she's probably going to run against you, Elizabeth Warren.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hope so. What do I have... that would be a dream come true.
<Jessie Watters> <Negative> Snoop, Dogg.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, look. I think it was terrible, because, not because of me, I think it's terrible to do that to any president, any person, I think it was pretty low life. His career is failing, and getting a lot of publicity on it, but I think, I think it was a terrible thing to do, personally.
<Jessie Watters> <Neutral> Bill O'Reilly.
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> Great guy. Nobody would know that. Nobody would understand it, and don't kid yourself, he's a talented guy.
<Jessie Watters> <Negative> I believe that. Last one: Jesse Watters.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Tremendous future, tremendous potential. Should be making good money. Your agents should be very happy, and I enjoy your show, and honestly you've been so nice to me that this is why I turned out of the biggest shows on television, and I here am: Watters World.
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> Thank you very much Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you, Jesse. Great job.
<Jessie Watters> <Positive> Appreciate it.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> The truth is, we don't know what kind of grades Mr. Obama got. College records are private. Schools aren't allowed to release them. And few, if any, modern presidential candidates have released their own grades. George W. Bush didn't, John McCain didn't, and Barack Obama didn't. Some candidates' college grades have been leaked. Now, in his memoir Dreams from My Father But Mr. Trump has doubts about the President's grades and especially his birth certificate. Here's part two of my interview with Trump, unedited, about the birth certificate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The fact is, a lot of people are troubled with this, just like I am. [Crosstalk]
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Yes, but a lot of people believe 9/11 didn't happen, or -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The governor says that he saw, the governor, the previous governor, said that he saw the birth certificate. Now they're saying, oh, it wasn't a birth certificate. It was a certificate of live birth. There was supposed to be a birth certificate. I don't think it exists, Anderson. I hope it exists, but I don't think it exists.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But it wasn't previous the governor. It was the health director for the previous governor, who we've just interviewed on camera, says yes, she has actually seen it. And it doesn't say he's a Muslim. It doesn't say anything -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that's fine. Then you know what Obama should do? Instead of spending millions of dollars on lawyers, he should say it's ok to release my birth certificate. No, he should do that. [Crosstalk]
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> You have said this millions in lawyers -- you have said this idea that he's spending millions of dollars on lawyers to refute this. And in other interviews, you have said he spent $2 million.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have heard over $2 million.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Right. All that is according to an FEC filing. But in truth, though, you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's a pretty big filing. I mean, he's not lying to the SEC -- or the FEC.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But you have no idea what that money was spent on. No one does. You can't say he spent $2 million -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, they say it was spent on lawyers trying to protect him.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Right. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, they say it was spent on lawyers trying to protect him from showing a birth certificate that may not exist.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Well, that's not true. The FEC filing is about lawyers. Candidates spend a lot on winding down campaigns. He also has to defend against FEC investigations into campaign financing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, he spent a lot of money, whether it was millions of dollars or hundreds of thousands, but I have a feeling it was millions. He spent a lot of money. Now, why should he waste money? He could do what I did just a month ago. I called in. I said, you're right, it's a private document. Thank you very much. You can release it. It is a private document, Anderson, but he can release it.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> All right. John McCain, has by the way, spent $1.3 million on legal fees according to Roll Call since the election. But you -- you repeatedly, though, in interviews say that there's no serial number on the live -- on the certificate of live birth. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, what I say is the following, Anderson. What I say is it's a stamp signature, a stamp.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's not a signature; it's a stamp. Anybody can get a stamp. Anybody can make a stamp. But it's a stamp signature. But much more importantly, if you look at your birth certificate or my birth certificate, it's got details all over it, lots of details that you don't have on a certificate of live birth. A certificate of live birth, you can get over a telephone, Anderson. It's not the same thing. [End Clip]
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Well, we will have the final part of my interview with Donald Trump after the break. We just had to cut right here for time. But we haven't edited this interview at all. I asked him why, if he doesn't trust Hawaii's computerized birth record, he thinks he can trust Hawaii's long-form birth record. His answer ahead. Let us know what you think. We're on Facebook. You can follow me on Twitter @AndersonCooper.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> And later tonight, the shocking brutality in Syria, witnesses say troops are gunning down civilians and when other civilians try to go to pick up their loved ones' dead bodies, they got shot at as well. You're going to hear from an extraordinarily brave woman speaking out tonight at great risk to herself. She knows she can be arrested, tortured. But she doesn't want her fellow countrymen killed in silence, murdered in silence. Her bravery is inspiring. Let's also check in right now with Isha Sesay. She's in London where I'm heading in a few hours to cover the royal wedding, which is now three days away -- Isha.
<Isha Sesay> <Positive> Anderson, preparations really picking up speed here. The VIPs start to arrive. See you right here tomorrow.
<Isha Sesay> <Positive> Coming up tonight, a look at Princess Diana's enduring influence on her eldest son, and how she will have a presence in spirit at the wedding. Also, how Prince Charles gets along with his future daughter-in-law. That and more live from London when 360 continues.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> All right, part two of the interview with Donald Trump. Hawaii says the computer generated certification of live birth, which the Obama campaign has -- has -- has put forward, which the state sends out when people request their birth certificate is the authoritative word on whether someone was born there. The state of Hawaii no longer even accepts the old long-form document for official purposes, yet Mr. Trump says he trusts the old, but not the new. So in this, the final part of our interview, I asked him why, if both come from the same source, would he trust either? Isn't this a problem you have with the state of Hawaii, because -- I mean, if some -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. [Crosstalk]
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> -- if some person came to work for your organization and gave a certificate of live birth as proof of identification, you're saying you wouldn't accept it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't have that problem with Hawaii, because they take birth certificates. And until just recently, when obviously they're starting to get a little bit nervous -- [Crosstalk]
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> But they don't recognize the birth certificate you're talking about.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Anderson, they're starting to get a little bit nervous. And until just recently, they said we have our birth certificate, but it's private. We don't want to show it. It's private. We have it. And we also have a certificate of live birth. So, here's the certificate. And a lot of reporters, like George Stephanopoulos, who by the way, was very nice to me except on this issue. He was like -- he was like a crazed lunatic. But I'll tell you what. Until recently, they said we have a birth certificate, but it's private. Now they're sort of saying, well, maybe we don't have a birth certificate. We have a certificate of live birth.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All of a sudden, they're changing their tune, because I'm hearing that the birth certificate either disappeared, one or the other, or never existed. And if that's the case, he has a problem. Let's go on to how gas prices are going to destroy this country.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Well, let me ask you just one more question on this. On Bill O'Reilly's show, you said maybe he doesn't want to release it because it might say he's a Muslim.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, no, I didn't say that. I said there may be something on it. And they asked me like what? I said, well, perhaps because he's a Muslim. Perhaps something. I mean, who knows what's on it? I don't know. But he didn't want to release it maybe because if they had it, there's something on it. Because I can't understand why is he spending all this money in legal fees when all he has to do is say release my birth certificate? [Crosstalk]
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Well, again you don't --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I released mine a month ago. [Crosstalk]
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Again, you don't know how much he's spending on this particular issue.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh he's spending a tremendous amount of money. [Crosstalk]
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But on the long form birth certificate if you're talking about there is no form. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Anderson, he's fighting all over the country on this issue. [Crosstalk]
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> ' -- there is no part for religion on that, just for the record.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Unless he has cheaper lawyers than I have, Anderson, he's fighting all over the country on this issue, and it's getting -- it's bothering them greatly, and they're very concerned. The birth certificate is -- and I will tell you this, Anderson. When I got involved, when all of a sudden the polls had me started to rank number one -- you do admit that I'm ranked number one, do you not?
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Yes, I think tied with Huckabee.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, in almost every poll. [Crosstalk]
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> But I will give that to you, absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But prior to that, I will tell you, when I first started this, which was a few months ago, I had heard this issue for a long time about his birth certificate or the lack thereof and about where he may have been born or whatever. I had heard it for a long time. And I didn't pay too much credence, I didn't pay too much attention to it and then every day that went by, it looked more and more suspicious.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Again, he has released his birth certificate. It is the certificate of live birth. That is -- in Hawaii, that is what is official. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That is not -- Anderson, you're a smart guy. And I watch your show and I like your show. You're a smart guy. A certificate of live birth is not a birth certificate. You know it and I know it.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> The other thing -- and the other thing you have been saying is that -- is that President Obama's grandparents probably planted his birth announcement in the local newspaper.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, and not because they thought he was going to be president because they wanted him to be a citizen of the country. And who blames them?
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But you know that's not possible. The Hawaii Department of Health, the hospital, and the newspaper all confirmed to us -- we were just there -- that that wasn't possible. In 1961, the only way to get a birth announcement was directly from the Department of Health. The newspapers didn't accept birth announcements any other way back then.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But they put it in at your request, Anderson. And we have that checked also. They put it in at your request. And they will put it in at your request.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> They don't.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Plus, the grandparents could also have put it in. What, the newspaper is not going to take their ad? It doesn't work that way. [Crosstalk]
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> It does. And to this day, it works that way. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right, well, what can I tell you? And, by the way, you know when the ad was placed? Anywhere from eight to 14 days later.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Again, it came from the Department of Health. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The ad was placed from eight to 14 days later. So you mean they wait eight to 14 days and then they put in an ad that he was born? I don't think so. [End Clip]
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> And we have more with Donald Trump talking about the Middle East, talking about the situation in Libya and Iraq and what sort of a Trump foreign policy would look like. We will play that in the coming days.
