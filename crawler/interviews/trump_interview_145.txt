<Howard Stern> <Positive> I am terrific. Speaking of terrific, Donald Trump has agreed to call in and share his thoughts on 9/11. Hey, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hello, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It's a sad day, but you are one of those guys who said, you know, keep investing in New York, and people are doing it, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they are, it's never -- I don't think it's ever been better from that stand point, Howard. I guess it has to do with interest rates being so low. But, I don't know. It also has to do with the fact that people really want to buy a piece of the Big Apple, and they really do, it's never -- I've never really seen it like this to the extent.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> We haven't come back to all fully, have we? I mean, the tourism is awful, lot of businesses [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the hotel market is terrible in New York, which means that people can come get a good bargain in all of that and little change. The hotel market is terrible, the office market is pretty average at best, probably, less than average. The condominium market in the residential market though, is extraordinary the condominium sales market for residential is -- I would say the best I've ever seen it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Because of low-interest rates?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think it's that. I think it's the Enron's, you know, the Global Crossing's where they don't want to invest in that garbage anymore, the tired of what they want to get something where they can feel it and touch it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So they buy an apartment. But it's a lot to do with interest rates, it's a lot to do with a bad stock market where, you know, a lot of people have made their best investment by buying shelter, by buying a house.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Probably the most important question I can ask you on a day like today, is where is Melania, and is she naked?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Melania is now in bed. I'm in my office.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And as to whether or not she's naked. I'm not 100% sure.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Take me back and I just want to know a year ago what was going on in your life, where were you when you heard the horrible news?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know normally I'm in my office, but by that time, because it was about 8
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So, you looked out your window and you could see the whole thing going down.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I saw the whole thing and I mean specifically I have two windows that are focused on the building and you know the silhouette of the building.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And you know, he builds those buildings, designed them, so they look at the World Trade Center.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean it's just unbelievable. Wild stuff.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know it's a little bit like you were saying before though, Howard. I'm not sure things are any tougher, they sound tougher but I'm not sure they are any tougher in terms of security, and you know, it's also nice to know your enemies. It's lovely to know you and I have plenty of enemies, we love that and that's fine. But you'd like to know where they are at least, here we don't know, we really don't know the enemy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I know they're skulking around somewhere and you just feel like you're sitting duck.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we have an idea of what the enemy is and a lot of times the politicians don't want to tell you that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you for invading Iraq?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I guess so. You know I wish it was-I wish the first time it was done correctly.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you still against rebuilding the World Trade Center.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm not against rebuilding. I guess the right thing -- You know what Cabby said is really true though, unless you are going to build buildings bigger and better, I looked at the proposals. I don't know if you saw them that came out two weeks ago they were terrible there were 50 story buildings. They were crummy looking shapes, everything was wrong. Now the city is not going to go for it. You know, I don't know how they did this but they got down to one firm and they said, you come up with an idea. They should go out and get the top 15 architectural firms in the world and come up with something spectacular. But, you know, unless you're going to go up that high or higher it's never going to be the same, you know.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So maybe we should do it. Rudy Giuliani says just leave it and let that be a lesson to future generations about what happened here.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Actually, what Rudy said was, there should be a huge memorial and it should contribute to the skyline of New York in the same way that the World Trade.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm starting to agree with that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know maybe we should build a television tower there. Maybe we should do something that would be good. I don't know if you saw it last week the television dial which is substantially taller than the World Trade Center, but you don't have to occupy it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Believe me a statue of you are going to be perfect right there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that would be an idea.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Nobody's going to fly into that, right?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No one, no one would even mess with that.
<K.C. Anderson> <Positive> I would like to fly into that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That would be a lesson for future generations.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, you k now the memorial -- the concept of the memorial is very important but it's also the concept of commerce. And you know, if we don't rebuild something really substantial and create lots of jobs and everything else, in addition to a great memorial, then they've won, at least they've won that part of the battle.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, it's -- it's an awful day today. And I want to thank you for calling in, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right, thanks.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You take care.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You too, bye. A lot of people calling in to reminisce. Congressman Gary Ackerman was on --
