<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right. Joining us now exclusively on the phone, is the president of United States. Mr. President, thank you for taking time for being with us tonight.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you, Sean, very much. It's an honor.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I appreciate you being here. You really have not had an opportunity to react, to respond to the Mueller report, the A.G.'s letter, that summarized the report that exonerated you. No collusion after all these years, as you have been claiming. He left the decision as it relates to obstruction to the attorney general and deputy attorney general.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> They quickly said, no, that does not rise to the level. And I wanted to get your reaction.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we are very happy about it. It's gone on for a long time, almost since the beginning of my term, and you know, if you look at it, we've done so much despite that. But it was a cloud. It was a cloud that most people didn't believe, fortunately. They spent more than $30 million, hundreds of interviews of people, in some cases very innocent people that were put through the ringer.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Millions of document pages, millions and millions of document pages, and after that, there was no collusion, there was no obstruction. It was such a ridiculous thing that happened. On the other hand, you know, you look at, how did this start? How did it start? You had dirty cops. You had people that are about FBI folks.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know so many. They are incredible people. But at the top, they were not clean, to put it mildly. And what they did to our country was a terrible, terrible thing.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Mr. President, we talked a lot on this program about the FISA abuse scandal. And this is what we know, that in August of 2016, we know Bruce Ohr warned everybody at the DOJ and the FBI that Christopher Steele hated you, that Hillary Clinton paid for the dossier, that it was not verified. But still in October, and then three renewal application warrants approved, they were told by the Grassley-Graham memo, the bulk of information came from that phony dossier.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Andrew McCabe said, no dossier, no FISA warrant. There were Russian lies disseminated to the American people before the election, but it also violated the rights of Carter Page and gave a backdoor into your campaign for spying, which I know the media made fun of at the time, when you said it happened.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, when I said there could be somebody spying on my campaign, a lot of things happened. It was like -- it went wild out there. They couldn't believe that I could say such a thing. And as it turned out, that was a small potatoes compared to what went on. When you look at what happened, and when it happened, and the money that was spent, the millions and millions on the phony dossier, and then they used the dossier to start things, and there was no truth whatsoever.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was a fraud and paid for by Hillary Clinton and paid for by the Democrats and the DNC. It's hard to believe. If you wrote this as a novel, no one would buy it. It would be a failure because it will be too unbelievable. Nobody would believe it's possible, the things that went on. And we're getting to the bottom of it, and it's got to be -- I mean, you can never allow this to happen to another president.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This can never, ever happen to a president again, Sean. That was a disgrace and an embarrassment our country, that they were allowed to get away with this. Hopefully, they won't get away with it.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Do you now feel vindicated? Was there anything that the attorney general's report -- I know you have called for obviously the whole Mueller memo to be released, did anything surprise you? And what about the people that were collateral damage in all of this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, people were hurt so badly, so badly. Their lives have been ruined and over -- you know, over something that should have never taken place, an investigation that should have never happened. There was no crime, as you know. You're only allowed to do this legally if there is a crime. There was no crime.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They've all admitted it. Comey, who is a terrible guy, Comey and McCabe and Strzok and Page, the lover, Page, and all of these people, they've admitted in testimony that there was no crime. So they'd started an investigation based on no crime. I will say this, our new attorney general, Bill Barr, is a great gentleman.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've heard about him for years. He's a great man. Had he been there initially, this all would not have happened because what has gone on there is just a disgrace to our country.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, but a lot of -- a lot of innocent people were hurt very badly, and it's very, very sad actually.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> For this to never happen again, what do you think the path is to getting to that point? In other words, the checks and balances that you believe need to be put in place so that a FISA court, in this case, it is not told Hillary paid for Russian lies, its own author doesn't stand by it, but yet it was used to obtain four FISA warrants that it gave a backdoor to your campaign.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> What do you think needs to happen to prevent this from ever happening again? What checks and balances, and what should be pursued or not pursued in your opinion?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm going to leave that to our new attorney general, who has been so incredible, actually. That's based on a lot of people saying, this is a very, very special person. That's what you need in that position. That's a very important position. You need so many different -- you need genius, you need rationality, you need different levels of good.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm also going to leave it to Lindsey Graham. He's head of Judiciary and Senate and a very, very good guy and a very smart guy. You know, I'm just going to let them do whatever they want to do, and I would imagine they don't like what they see, to put it mildly. But you would have to ask them. I think it is much more appropriate -- I purposely did not want to involve myself in this whole thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wanted to let other people do it. And I wish he didn't take so long. You know, we are talking about really longer than, if you think about it, longer than Mueller -- it was many months before that that Strzok and Page were talking about the insurance policy, right? The insurance policy -- just in case Hillary Clinton lost, they wanted an insurance policy against me. And what we were playing out until just recently was the insurance policy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They wanted to do a subversion. It was treason. It was really treason. If the Republican Party had done this to the Democrats, if we had done this to President Obama, you'd have 100 people in jail right now and it would be treason. It would be considered treason and they'd be in jail for the rest of their lives.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it worked out the other way, and, you know, it just is really a horrible situation. And an incredible outcome, or certainly very close to an outcome, and we'll have to see how it all started. But I'm going to leave that to other people, including the attorney general, and others, to make a determination.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it's very, very important for our country to know, because in 50 years from now, and 100 years from now, if someone tries the same thing, they have to know that the penalty will be very, very great, if and when they get caught.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Before I get to the media question, would you consider, sir, a pardon? Look at General Flynn, for example, or Papadopoulos, who has had to spend 12 days in jail. Is that something that you would consider at some point?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, as I told you, many, many people were hurt, incredibly hurt by this whole scam, just a scam. But it's much worse than that. It's at the highest level, and the importance is so -- what it meant our country, it's a very, very dark period, and I think maybe we are shedding a lot of light. We are going to come into a bright, beautiful, sunny day.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But when you mention General Flynn, he was a man who had an incredible record in the military, you see what happened to him. The FBI said he wasn't lying, as I understand it, and if the Mueller group said he was lying, and you know what he has gone through, and what so many others have gone through. I could name names that would just go on for the entire -- your entire show.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a very, very sad thing. I don't want to talk about pardons now but I can say, it's so sad on so many levels.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Let me ask you, I believe you probably have forever branded fake news fake news. I'm not sure if some of these companies will ever recover. I talked earlier in my monologue about, I don't really recall them ever talking about record accomplishments, record low unemployment, African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian-Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment, I mean, some really amazing numbers.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> But I see every second, minute, hour, every day, there are attacks. I will tell you a small snippet. I'm only picking one network in this case, CNN. And just a small snippet of some of the coverage and speculation and things that have been said about you and want to get your reaction. [Begin Video Clip]
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> [Video Clip] Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump. We are looking at the possibility that the president of the United States and those around him during the election campaign colluded with a hostile foreign power to undermine the basis of our democracy. This is evidence of willingness to commit collusion.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> [Video Clip] It does look like collusion, it does look like he's listening to Putin more than he is American intelligence. So, this picture that the president is so desperate to avoid, this picture of collusion, begins to fill in. The president sees the walls are closing in and he's lashing out. He's desperate. He's obviously flailing around because he feels the walls closing in. [End Video Clip]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Mr. President, I could play an hour's worth of coverage of that, for two years it's gone on. What is your answer? What is a reaction to the media? I know you have been very critical. Fake news. Yes?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> As many people have said, and fortunately we have had some incredible people that really were fair. When you mentioned Rush or Mark -- Mark Levin, or Steve Doocy, and Ainsley in the morning, and Brian and Laura, Jesse, Jeanine -- I hope Jeanine's back soon.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> She's back Saturday.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So many people. I don't want to keep going because I'm going to leave out some people. I could again go so long. So many great people have been -- you know, they get it. Nobody has been tougher, nobody, on Russia than me. And everybody -- my enemies say that, when they are reasonable enemies, when they are fair.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You look at the pipeline, exposing that going into Germany. You look at oil with the number one -- I mean, it is what we have done with energy, and oil and gas and that is all competition from -- for Russia. You look at the Ukraine, you look at so many different levels. You look at our military. Look at the fact that we would have been powered by wind, which wouldn't have worked, by the way, because it only blows it sometimes, and lots of problems come about.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we are stronger now as a country then we have ever been. We are doing better financially than we have ever done, our markets are hitting records all the time. I have many, many records of the highest stock market. People's 401(k)s are doing better than they have ever done by far. It's up almost 50 percent from the time I am elected president.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And other countries are way down. You look at China as an example, we are negotiating a deal with China. We're going to make a very good deal with China. China is way down. We are way up. But nobody has been tougher to Russia or on Russia than Donald Trump, President Trump. Nobody even close. And yet, with all of that, we want to have a great relationship with Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We want to have a great relationship with China. All of these things are smart to do. We'll do great with it. But nobody has been tougher. And when I watched all of this nonsense, it was fake news, just terrible fake news, the good news is, based on polls and based on other things, based on where we stand now with the public, Sean, the people never bought it. They get what's happening.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Our country is doing fantastically well. More regulations cut than any other president, and that's only in two years. Nobody's come even close. The big tax cuts, so many things we are going to do, incredible health care that the Democrats, frankly, wouldn't even know how to do. We all become the party of health care, the party of really good health care.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We've done so much and we have so much planned. So when I had to listen to CNN, which is so, so fake, so horribly fake, I would just -- I wouldn't listen often -- believe me, I wouldn't want to listen often. But whenever I did, whenever I thought, I have never seen anything like it. And MSNBC, the same thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The good news is, I heard their ratings last night, both of them were -- they dropped off the folder. They dropped to a level that nobody could believe because now that they see the Mueller report, where you look at their finding -- I mean, the finding was very, very strong. No collusion, no obstruction, no Russia, no nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it's great. I notice your record, you had virtually record ratings last night. So, that's because you have credibility. So I want to think FOX. I want to thank some of those people I just named, but also many others, they have been so fantastic to me, and really to our country. And I really do -- they are really amazing people, great people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it wasn't so easy for them.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Mr. President, you know, one thing I do want to point out often, and I honestly don't see it elsewhere in the media, you did keep your promise on your tax cuts. You did set records, ending bureaucratic regulation, judges, energy independence, trade deals, being tough on Iran, Jerusalem is now the capital, all those things.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I want to ask you -- especially in a minute -- about immigration and health care. I want to first run down some names and get your thoughts. James Comey tonight in an interview suggested maybe he was fired for obstruction. I just played a tape of him saying that he could be fired anytime for any reason or no reason which -- so, your thoughts on James Comey?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he's right about that -- for any reason. If you look at Article Two, for any reason. But despite that, that was an incorrect statement. When you say what I said, there was nothing said wrong there but they did not play the whole interview. When they play the whole thing, you see exactly. I mean, the fact is, it would only get worse.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I said this. It would only get worse if I fired him. I knew that it was going to get worse, not better. I'm not going to fire him and everything goes away. It would be a bigger deal if I fired him, and I knew that. So it was a negative, not a positive. And everybody knew that. But NBC didn't want to play it that way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They wanted to play it a different way. And when you talk about people that are dishonest, when you talk about bad, fake news, NBC, where we had the "The Apprentice" for many years as one of their most successful shows, NBC is as bad as CNN, I can tell you that.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Let me ask you. Adam Schiff is saying there is no collusion. By the way, I think one of the funniest tapes I have played in the show ever is a hoax, you have a Russian talking about compromising material on a naked Trump, which is again talk about and he thinks it's shown to Putin, and he is literally colluding to get information and so he can impact our electoral system.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> But he is still to this day, now prior to the Mueller conclusion, that there was no collusion, none. It was quoted in the attorney general's report. We had a nine-month FBI investigation. They said no collusion.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Lisa Page and Peter Strzok said no collusion. The Senate committee said no collusion. The House committee said no collusion. That is all before two years of Mueller. But yet, this guy is still pushing this conspiracy theory. Thoughts on Adam Schiff?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Schiff is a bad guy. He knew he was lying. I mean, he's not a dummy. He knew he was lying. And for a year and a half, he would go on and just lie and lie and leak and call up CNN and others and just -- you know, I watch him, so sanctimonious, and gets on and says, oh, we want to talk about Russia. He knew it was a lie and he would get into the back room with his friends and the Democrat Party, and they would laugh like hell at what they were doing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a disgrace. And he knew it was a lie. And therefore, in one way, you could say it's a crime what he did, because he was giving, I mean, horrible -- making horrible statements that he knew were false, and frankly, I heard they should force them off the committee, or if the committee chair. He should be forced out of office.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He is a disgrace to our country. And you have plenty of others. But he would go on night after night, talking about collusion, the collusion delusion. And I will tell you this about Russia, if they had anything on me, it would have come out a long time ago, probably a long time before I ran because they would have been much better off.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hope we really get along well with them but they would have been a lot better off with Hillary Clinton as president. In terms of energy, in terms of oil and gas, look at what we are doing with the energy. It's incredible in our country. But that's a bad thing --
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> First time in 75 years -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- competition for Russia. Hillary wouldn't let you drill, there would be no oil, there would be no gas, there wouldn't be anything to compete. Russia, if they were at all for me -- by the way, if you look at all of the things, they were sort of for and against both, not just one way -- but you look at all of the different things, Russia much rather have Hillary than Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can tell you that right now.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You, after the election, I remember, it was a little surprised because I know that a lot of the crowds -- you had a lot of big crowds, chanted "lock her up" on Hillary after the election, you said, let's move on. Do you feel that way today?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, not really. I did feel that way very much, the night I won, they were all screaming "locker up, locker up." Look, she lost 33 -- they deleted 33,000 emails, and they were Bleach Bit, that's a big deal, a very expensive process. And almost nobody does it because it's so expensive. But that's the way you really get rid of it. So she deleted 33,000 emails.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Can you imagine if I did that? Supposing I did that, I gave millions of pages to these people that were --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> 1.5 million.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- the case that was involved with the Clinton Foundation, and another case, Weissmann, you know all about Weissmann, and many others. We gave millions of pages, they found nothing. If they were up have found one bad sentence out of millions of pages, believe me, it would have been front and center. It would have been front and center.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it's true, when I, on November 8th, '16, one of the great nights that a lot of people have had, since they came from the hills and the mountains, they came from the valleys, they came from everywhere, Sean. It was an incredible evening. And, you know, they have been rewarded because our job numbers, our unemployment numbers, all of the numbers that they really wanted are the best we have ever had.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I will say this, I said, you know, let's get back on, let's not think about the past, let's think about the future. But now, I think thinking about the past is just OK because we can never let this happen again in our country or to another president. I'm not talking about me. I'm talking into the future.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We can never allow this treasonous -- these treasonous acts to happen to another president. This was an attempted takeover of our government, of our country, an illegal takeover. If it were the other way around, where I was doing it to President Obama or a Democrat, it would be virtually the maximum sentence that you can find no matter where you look in whatever legal book.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Let me ask you now, I was very critical of the team that Robert Mueller put together. You mentioned Andrew Weissmann, I've gone through his record, was at Hillary Clinton's victory party. Only Democratic donors -- no Republicans at all, no Republican donors. And also Jeannie Rhee who work for the Clinton Foundation as a lawyer, was appointed.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> How do you feel about Mueller today and were you surprised at all, considering the team that he picked in this particular case? It seemed pretty partisan Democrat. And I thought it was extraordinarily unfair to pick that biased a team.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, it didn't seem to be biased. It was biased.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> That's a good point.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was tremendously anti-Trump. It was Never Trumpers, it was anti-Trump. I think in every single instance, I know that Andrew Weissmann was at her -- I guess you'd call it the wake, which was the big evening on November 8th, he was there to celebrate, you know, to celebrate a victory, he was there, and not a happy camper.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But these were people that contributed, most of them, contributed to her campaign. I mean, it was a shocking to see it. So, you know, I wasn't exactly sure -- I know one thing, I had nothing to do with Russia, but I wasn't exactly -- when I looked at the team that was assembled, I wasn't exactly sure what they -- you know, maybe they would take a sentence from here and a sentence from there, I had no idea.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know one thing, I was the most innocent human being -- and they all said it, even Comey said he found no wrongdoing -- and one of the few times he didn't like him because he lied in front of Congress. Brennan lied. Many of these people lied to Congress and nothing happened. And yet with Flynn, where they didn't even know if he lied based on --
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> They thought he didn't.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- what the reports are, and others, look what happened to them on the other side. But these people with so many lies, and lies before Congress, which is just about the ultimate, sworn testimony where Comey told so much, and he leaked classified information. Well, if somebody in our team leaked classified information, it would be years in jail.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So nobody can understand what went on. Nobody really understands one of other thing, when the report came out, why didn't they look at all of these acts on the other side? Was it they only looked at our people? Now, all of that being said, the end result, it took a long time, almost two years, but the end result is no collusion, and no obstruction.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But it took a long time to get there.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Mr. President, you have the ability to release the FISA applications. There was the original applications, the three subsequent renewal applications. We are told, Andrew McCabe said, no dossier, no FISA warrant. That was a backdoor to your campaign before the election. The dossier also was leaked to "The Washington Post," parts of it, and Isikoff and David Corn, to the American people, and, of course, never verified.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Do you have plans to release those FISA applications, Gang of Eight information, the 302s of Bruce Ohr and others, and the five buckets are John Solomon and Sara Carter, as they call it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do, I have plans to declassify and release. I have plans to absolutely release. But I have some very talented people working for me, lawyers. And they really didn't want me to do it early on. Devin Nunes, by the way, and Meadows, you look at Jim Jordan, and all of the people, they worked so hard. And a lot of people wanted me to do it a long time ago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm glad I didn't do it. We got a great result without having to do it but we well. One of the reasons that my lawyers didn't want me to do it is they said, if I do it, they will call it a form of obstruction, so they will say, oh, you released these documents so we would make all of this information transparent.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, and politics you always hear transparency. It would make it transparent. And then they call it obstruction, knowing the people we are dealing with. So, frankly, I thought it would be better if we held it to the end. No, but at the right time, we will be absolutely releasing it. I did the right thing by not doing it so far.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you understand, they would call it something that it wouldn't be. It's the only time you would be transparent where they would say bad things about transparency.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. President, due to testimony, thanks to Georgia Republican Collins, we now have testimony, one thing that shocked me a little bit last week was the testimony of Strzok and Page were both of them suggesting the fix was in on Hillary, because it was being -- every decision was being run through the A.G.'s office.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> That means Loretta Lynch, who also met on the tarmac was Bill Clinton, which brings us to a higher level than maybe we once thought. Do you have any reaction to that with Loretta Lynch, apparently, according to Strzok and Page, running the show, making decisions for the FBI at the time? Remember the interaction between Comey and Loretta Lynch when she said it's an investigation and she said, no, it's a matter.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Well, first of all, Doug Collins is fantastic, the job he is doing. He's been incredible. I wish he were chairman but he's not. But we are not off a match. I think we will retake the House because they see what we've done and we see the confusion and everything. All they want to do is investigate and now the investigation is turning out to be something that is not very good.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> And Nancy Pelosi is smart, she's right and what she is saying because, to be honest with you, especially now after this great result, because I didn't know -- you know, you just can't, when you see the people that we are talking about, you just don't know that you are going to get a no collusion answer. A strong no collusion answer.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> But I will say, I want to thank Doug Collins. I will also say, you start taking a look at what happened on the tarmac. A lot of people say a lot of bad things happen on the tarmac between Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton. I had a lot of planes for a long time. I've never stopped the plane on the tarmac to let somebody on the plane.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> And then they went and they talked about golf and their grandchildren for 40 minutes. It doesn't work that way. What did they talk about? And then she was exonerated. She was given one of the great free passes of all time. I guess Bill Clinton said he was there to play golf, but I know the area very well, Arizona.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> It's a little warm at that time of the year for golf, OK? People -- a lot of people -- is a great state, I love it, but you are not playing a lot of golf right there at that time. So, you have to find out, what happened in the back of that plane that so many things took place after that incident, that meeting between the Attorney General Lynch and Bill Clinton.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> A lot of bad things happened right after that. You have to find out. So, there are so many different things, and it's important for our country that those things be determined and found out. Last question about people -- if you don't mind, I want to ask you about substantive issues. A couple of big things happened in immigration and health care this week.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> The last two, we know that Clapper lied under oath. I believe the statute of limitations, though, has passed. In the case of Brennan, we know that there was surveillance, unmasking, leaking raw intelligence, an increase of 350 percent of unmasking. Samantha Powers, who was working for the U.N., asking for 300 cases unmasked.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> She denies it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> But in that particular case of Brennan and Clapper, and Brennan in particular, multiple times accused you of treason.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Your reaction?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think Brennan is a sick person. I think there's something wrong for him. And I watch -- for him to come out of the CIA and act that way was so disrespectful to the country and to the CIA and to the position he held. And he was not considered good at what he did. He was never respected guy. Tough guy but not a respected guy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But he lied to Congress. And the other night before the report came out, he predicted horrible things. Things he said were horrible. Then today, I guess he said something -- I didn't see it but I heard he said, well, I must have bad sources or bad information. I mean, this is a man who really is either sick or there is some other problem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the way he spoke -- and as you know, clapper lied, and perhaps the statute of limitations ran out on that one but it didn't run out on Comey, it didn't run out on Brennan or Strzok or Page or McCabe. I mean, McCabe, his wife got hundreds of thousands of dollars. He was running the FBI and running all sorts of cases, and his wife got hundreds of thousands of dollars from essentially Clintons, from Clinton's closest friend.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Then he ruled so favorably. I mean, he tried to say he was not involved, I don't think too many people believe that, I did not believe that. But she got all those good rulings. It's really a scandalous situation. It is so badly that it reflects it so horribly, a guy like Ohr with his wife, Nellie Ohr, and GPS Fusion.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She wrote the report, and the goes, gives it to her husband who is at the DOJ, and then he goes and brings it to the FBI, and she's getting paid for doing it. It's incredible.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The things that happened are incredible, and very, very bad for our country.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Well, I hope you are right. I think we got to get to the bottom of it because if we don't, and the media has been no help, the biggest abuse of power scandal. If I may move onto a couple of issues. Conservatives, when you had a 35-day shutdown, you are inviting Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer to sit with you.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You put DACA on the table, Dreamers on the table, you wanted too quickly. They said they wanted the furloughed employees to be paid after 35 days. You decided, OK, the strategy is not working. I was pretty confident, I think I have known you well over 20 years now that you are just changing strategies. But we now know that they could not override the veto and that means how much money now is available for the wall, and what is the status, the progress, how many much more miles need to be built, how many have you repaired, how many miles -- where are we on all of this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have repaired, I mean, literally -- you know, many, many miles. I could give you numbers but many, many miles. We are building many miles. We're going to have hundreds of miles already under construction are soon to be under construction. Billions of dollars will be necessary. It's absolutely vital if you look at what's happening at the border, it's terrible with the human traffickers, the drugs, everything that is coming across, and that goes across the soft points, which are the points without the wall.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we will have hundreds of miles built fairly quickly. Billions of dollars, we took a billion dollars in today. And I'm building and much less expensively than it was in the past. If you look at the past, they were talking about $25 billion to $30 billion. I'm building it for a fraction of that. The wall is better.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's going up faster. The Army Corps of Engineers is doing a great job working with us and we have some real professionals, and the military has been incredible, putting up the barbed wire, essentially, it's barbed wire. It's actually barb wire plus. But it's incredible what they have done. You have seen it. I mean, you know, many, many miles of wire.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If we didn't have it, we would really have a problem. But we are really capturing -- let's use the word capturing -- we are capturing people that are coming in illegally, we are not just releasing them, in some cases, we are running out of room, and many cases now, we are running out of room. The laws are so bad, normally you just bring them back by the laws don't let you do that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Our laws that could be easily changed by the Democrats, but they are so bad and so corrupt on immigration, whether it's catch and release or chain migration or any of the various things that we have to put up with, it's terrible. So -- but we are doing fantastic. We are building -- in fact, into weeks, I'm going to a location, it's going to be in California, believe it or not, they were begging us to build in San Diego, begging us to build a wall and we are just in the process of completing a major stretch of many miles of wall, and we are going to have a news conference there just to show people.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Mr. President, do you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's really good stuff. It's better, less expensive, goes up faster, but it's actually better than what they were doing before. So we are going to have it done and we are in great shape. We got a great support from the Republicans, both in Congress, if you look at our congressmen and women and from the Senate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I really had great support. A couple of them people voted against but you know what? That's OK, they had their reasons. We had great support.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> And you will be able to use, according to the Department of Defense, a significant number of billions of dollars because of your emergency declaration?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Many billions, yes. Many billions. You go to a lot of the generals, they will tell you, this is a national emergency. This is -- we need to defend our country. You have people pouring in. I mean, they are pouring -- we are capturing these people, we are getting them. But, you know, we don't do like other countries, other countries stand there with machine guns ready to fire.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We can't do that and I wouldn't want to do that, OK? It's a very effective way of doing it and I wouldn't want to do it. We can't do it. But we do -- if we have barriers, we have the walls like we are building now, and building -- a lot of people don't think we are building walls, we are building massive, many, many miles of walls right now, and we are gearing up to do many more.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We'll have hundreds of miles of walls built in the very near -- built and renovated, too, a lot of it, we were able to use the old carcass of a wall. We fixed it and we -- for a smaller amount of money, we were able to build a wall that is literally just as good as new. So we've done a lot of work on it, and a lot of talent has been involved, and we've had really a tremendous help, a lot of people agree.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, most people agree. Even the Democrats agree. They don't say that. They go into back rooms, like I said before about Schiff, they go back there and they laugh. But they go into the room and -- everyone knows you need the wall. The Democrats, almost every one of them, voted for the walls in the past.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But now, they don't because they don't want to give us a victory. But they are hurting the country. They are not hurting me, they are hurting the country.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. President, you've heard about the New Green Deal, you see the people that would like to challenge you in 2020. Proposals of as high as a 70 percent top marginal tax rate for individuals, 90 percent for corporations, a wealth tax, the New Green Deal says no oil, no gas, at all. We are now energy independent for the first time in over 70 years, and we are now an exporter of energy because of ending bureaucracy and regulations.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> And then everything is free, everything. And on top of that, we are going to get rid of the combustion engine, and we are going to also get rid of perhaps cows and airplanes and we are going to build high-speed trains and just Medicare-for-All with no other choices. What is your reaction, as you watch this New Green Deal and the comments of all these new candidates?
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Do you have a new reaction to it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't want to speak badly about the New Green Deal, Sean, because, frankly, I'm afraid they will stop using it, because I really do want to campaign against it. It's ridiculous, all right, it's crazy. It will cost $100 trillion. Nobody knows what that means. That means is more money than you have in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it will be catastrophic. It's not going to happen. It's just talk. And, of course, they will campaign on it. They'll say, we're going to give free everything. You're going to end up being Venezuela if that's happening. We have a nice big problem with Venezuela. You look at Venezuela, was a wealthy country not long ago, and now, it's one of the poorest countries.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We'll end up being the same thing. The New Green Deal is ridiculous, but I don't want to speak badly because I want them to keep going forward with it. I really look forward to campaigning, just a little bit early, just like Elizabeth Warren. I hit her too hard, too early, and now it looks like she's finished.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wish she would have been in the race and frankly, I would have loved to have run against her but I would say she's probably finished. But they have plenty left. New Green Deal is going nowhere.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Let me ask you, many presidents have promised Israel that they would move the capital from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. You made a tough position, you got that done. I have known the prime minister of Israel personally for well over 20 years, like I have known you for well over 20 years. I've always viewed Prime Minister Netanyahu as a Churchillian figure with moral clarity, that few people had on the world stage, standing alone often.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And I saw that you -- I thought it was a very big announcement about the Golan Heights being Israel's territory. As you see the rise of anti-Semitism, not just -- we have members of Congress that have said horrible things, but in Europe, and elsewhere, and the dangers of that small country, radical Islam, I just wanted to get your reaction to the importance of Israel as our close ally.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you don't have to go to other countries when you see what is going on in this country -- yesterday, I was very honored to do the Golan Heights. That was something that was promised by many, many presidents over many, many years, and I got it done. Then you look at also Jerusalem, moving the embassy to Jerusalem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> For years, many presidents for many decades campaigned on it. They were going to do it and they never did it because frankly, it was much tougher to do than people whatever ever understand. It was very tough. I understand why they ultimately didn't do it, they didn't get it done, but I got it done. Not only did I get it done, I got the embassy belt for a fraction, a tiny, tiny fraction of the cost of what it was supposed to cost.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And now, as you know, the embassy is open. It's not just designated, it's open in Jerusalem. So, look, I'm very proud of what we have done for Israel. I'm very proud of my relationship with Israel, and what is going on with the Democrats, and with Jewish people and the Democrats and Israel is a shocking to me. You know, I grew up in a world where people really -- and Democrats, they loved Israel.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And now, I'm looking at a world where many Democrats seem to hate Israel. They seem to despise Israel. It is a tremendous surprise to me. What's going on with Israel and the Democrat Party is absolutely horrific. Terrible.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I meant to ask you earlier, Devin Nunes, who's been on this show many times, and I think has been -- when he was the chairman of the House Intel Committee, he wrote and warned everybody, we have watched Russia over the years, a hostile regime, hostile actor on the world stage, we know that Barack Obama, caught on the microphone saying, you know, I'll have a lot more flexibility in my next term, and then the case of Schiff being caught on tape colluding, trying to get information about you to impact electoral system.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> But more importantly, we have known that they have impacted other nations' elections. Devin Nunes warned this country about how hostile they are on our elections. We need free, fair elections. We do know that they tried, attempted to influence, seemingly on both sides. How do we prevent them? We have 250,000 I.T. people working for our government.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> How do we not have the ability to stop this type of hostility coming from foreign powers, hostile regimes like Russia?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all, let me say that Devin Nunes is someday going to be hailed as a great American hero. They tried to destroy that man because he spoke up for good and just and all of the things that you have to speak up for. But most people don't have the courage to do it. He will be someday hailed as a great American hero, what he did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They tried to ruin him. They tried to destroy him. They tried to ruin his life and his family. And he just kept plugging like there was nothing going on. I mean, it was an amazing thing. As far as your other part of the question, in September, if you look, supposedly, the FBI told president Obama all about Russia trying to get involved in some form in the election, and he decided to do nothing about it because he thought Hillary Clinton was going to win.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So he didn't want to do anything because he thought that Clinton was going to win and he didn't want to upset the apple cart. But he knew about it. And the question is, one of the many, many questions, and this is probably not as big as other questions, because you are talking about major, major treason and corrupt -- all the things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But one of the questions is, why didn't he do something? He knew about it. This wasn't up to me. I wasn't president when all this was happening. Why didn't President Obama and the Obama administration do something when they were informed about Russia and the election?
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. President, I only have about another minute and a half. Thank you for being so generous with your time. Will you make it a priority before the 2020 elections to make sure that we have election integrity and beef up our defenses as a country, so no foreign an entity have any impact? And how important is that, and the steps that you are thinking about taking -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's very important to know that Russia or anybody else had no impact on votes. That is very important for people to know. That has been coming out, as you know, from every agency, everybody that has done it. So whether they tried, and how hard they tried, and President Obama knew, the bottom line is, they had a zero impact on the election of 2016. I'm very happy about that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That is what we are all about. We can't allow that to happen in any way, shape, or form. But we are putting very strong safeguards and, this sounds a little old-fashioned, but the best backup is a paper back up, not a computer back up, and we have many paper backups, just in case there is a problem, something which they didn't have before.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we are being very vigilant and working very hard --
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Sir --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- and we have tremendous systems in place, Sean.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Ten-second answer. Will you get now, that the Justice Department on Obamacare, joining with a court decision, will we get that done? We only have 10 seconds.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to do great. We are going along with Texas, we are winning the case, and we're going to have great health care. The Republican Party will be the party of great healthcare. You watch.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And pre-existing conditions and choices?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All included. We're going to have pre-existing conditions, absolutely, and we already got rid of the individual mandate, which was costing people a fortune. It was terrible.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you so much for your time tonight. We appreciate you seeing so long and answering so many questions. We appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Sean.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> That's all the time we have left. Let not your heart be troubled -- Laura Ingraham is standing by live.
<Tom Brokaw> <Positive> A man who's made a lot of money in this city but has taken his New Year's Eve celebrations south is Donald Trump. He's down in Palm Beach tonight at his private club, Maralargo with 2,000 of his closest friends.
<Tom Brokaw> <Negative> Now, Mr. Trump, you're in politics, you're supposed to be a man of the people, shouldn't you be up here with the folks in Times Square instead of down there with the black tie crowd?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you're probably right about that, but we are having a good time down here. We have Gladys Knight coming in a little while, Tom, and it's really been a great evening.
<Tom Brokaw> <Neutral> What do you think the future is going to mean for this country, Donald, in terms of economic trends?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think the country is going to be great. It's the greatest country ever in the world. And I think we have a great future. It's going to be -- it's going to continue to be a terrific country. We love it.
<Tom Brokaw> <Positive> And does that mean that you're going to run for president, or has this just been putting your toe in the water or gaining a little more publicity for the Trump empire?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm looking at it. I'm looking at it seriously, Tom. I mean, polls have shown good, the ratings certainly show good. A lot of things show good. So we're looking at it. And I think I'd do a good job. We'll let you know probably in February.
<Tom Brokaw> <Positive> Looking at February to make the announcement finally?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<Tom Brokaw> <Positive> Don, we've got a -- we've got a helicopter overhead, so I hope that you can hear me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can hear you beautifully.
<Tom Brokaw> <Positive> All right. Final question, what do you think the trends are in terms of where the country is going to go in terms of prosperity and also in terms of consumerism in the 21st century? Are they going to continue to spend the way they have been for the last 10 years or so?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think the country is going to be very prosperous. I think that consumerism is going to be consumerism, the consumer is the boss, and we really have a terrific country, and it's going to stay that way, Tom.
<Tom Brokaw> <Positive> All right, thanks very much, Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Have a great year.
<Tom Brokaw> <Positive> You, too. Happy New Year to you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A great life.
<Tom Brokaw> <Positive> Donald Trump, who has been toying with the idea of running for president, enjoying the publicity, as he always does, at his club tonight in Palm Beach. We'll be back with more right after this.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Morning glory and evening grace America. It's Hugh Hewitt. I love to begin Thursdays with the best interview in America, Donald Trump, who will of course be starring in Saturday Night Live this weekend. Donald Trump, welcome back to the Hugh Hewitt Show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I always like being with you. I don't know, it's always interesting, and you are indeed a smart guy, so I like that. What...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Now do you like doing Saturday Night Live, because you're very good at television. Do you love this opportunity?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've done it before. I've hosted before, and I've been on a couple of times, and you know, Lorne Michaels is a great guy, and have done an amazing job. It's a very, very important show. You know, over the last month, I did, as you know, with Vladimir Putin, I did 60 Minutes, and they got tremendous ratings on that show, and now, I'm doing Saturday Night Live.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So those are two really iconic shows. I will, I think I'll have a good time. I mean, I'll speak to you maybe next week if you want. Then I'll let you know specifically.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I look forward to having a good time. It's going to be a big deal, and they're thinking that this will be one of their most successful shows that they've done in a long time, so we'll see.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> That's true. I never watch, and I'm going to watch it on Saturday night, because you're going to do the cold open. And it's going to be great. So now here's the serious issue.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the cold open is going to be wild. I can tell you, the cold open and the skit right after the cold open, you will, I think you will laugh. You and I are not laughers, right? But I think you will be laughing.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Well, okay, I'm sure I will. Here's the serious issue of the day. Yesterday, 18 year old Muslim student named Faisal Mohammed goes on a rampage at the University of California, Merced. They don't release his name until today.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Why not, Donald Trump? What do you think is going on with the authorities that they don't...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know why, and it's very bad that they don't, and it's a little bit unfair that they don't. And you know, the people of our country have to know what's going on. They have to know what's going on quickly, and you know, it's got to take place. So they just released it, in other words, Hugh, huh?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yes, just this morning, 24 hours later.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Wow. That's...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> So I don't know if it's a jihadist, but you're kind of an anti-PC guy, and I think they held it back for fear of being thought Islamophobic, because it's an Islamic name. Do you think that, is that, do you share my suspicion?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, it's sort of interesting. When the 50 soldiers, these great soldiers were sent over, as you know, our representatives, these are tremendous guys. When they were sent over, they should have been, that should have been quiet, because now they have a big bounty on their head. You understand that, right?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When Obama got up and said we're sending 50 people over to Syria, and to Iraq, I guess, and probably he doesn't even know where they're going, but we're sending 50 going over there. I said wow, that's really bad, because those people now, instead of going over quietly and doing what they have to do, people are watching them, looking for them all over the place. And I said that's something that should be kept quiet. This, I think, is pretty much the opposite.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, now moving, I always ask you if you've got your defense team ready to roll out, yet. Are you going to give me any names, yet?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, no, but I've been really, you know, I've been pretty good in terms of that stuff. If you look at my book, in the year 2000, I said Osama bin Laden. You saw that. You would be impressed with that one, I think.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yes, yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But in the year, in fact, when Morning Joe, somebody was on the show, and they showed off the book, and I said Osama bin Laden, he was a well-known terrorist at the time. And that was before I had aspirations politically, believe me, long before. And I did the book, and mentioned Osama bin Laden, and essentially said he's going to crawl under a rock, and you'd better put him away. And they didn't put him away, and you saw what happened.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You had the first World Trade Center attack, which was a serious attack, but not obviously like what ultimately took place. And all of those people sitting around a table said he actually mentioned in his book before the World Trade Center disaster the name Osama bin Laden. And I immediately thought of you. I said I wonder if Hugh'd be impressed by that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> I am. You pay attention. That's why I'm looking for your national security team at some point.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. No, I have a good team, and I have a team also that's forming.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I must say this. I'd like to see, we had, as you know, Fox came out, I was a strong, strong number one yesterday. They came out last with the numbers, the polling numbers.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know, I want to do down the line. I am, in the meantime, working with people that are terrific and observing everything and reading lots. And it's something that I find, you know, tremendously interesting. Everybody said I'll be the best at, in terms of jobs and the economy, but I actually think that I will be the best in terms of the military and strategy.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> That's where my last question is. Last week, the Pentagon announced they gave the B-3, the strategic bomber contract to Northrop Grumman, and that's going to be billions and billions of dollars. Each one of them cost, they think, about a half billion bucks each, $564 million. Do we need a strategic bomber, Donald Trump? Or should we just stick with submarines and missiles? And if so, do you think it has to cost that much?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, it doesn't have to cost that much. And by the way, they also are giving out, or in the process of giving out, I don't want to speak too strongly about this, because maybe they won't do it, they're giving out a new, as you know, Air Force One, and that's a $3 billion, with a B, $3 billion dollar plane. And I said I guarantee you I could save hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars, and I guarantee you that Boeing would leave something on the table. $3 billion dollar Air Force One.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So you have that. Now when you talk about the bomber, here's what I don't like. I have been reading, and I read one article in particular, where the pilots, and these are great test pilots, and pilots generally, but pilots in testing it said our old planes are better. They perform better.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They handle better. Every aspect, they were saying they're better. So I'm saying wait a minute, if they're better, why are we ordering these unbelievably expensive planes? So I would have some real problems because of cost, and I know I could get the cost down. But what bothers me tremendously is the fact that I heard test pilots saying that the old planes maneuver better, work better, and they like them better.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That bothers me.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yeah, a lot of people like the F-18 Superhornet more than the F-35, but this B-3, the strategic bomber, I think we have to have bomber, but I will probably be bringing this up in Las Vegas, and I want you to be ready for it, along with all of the other candidates, because I think we need to have a national security conversation, don't we, on that debate stage?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We do, and it's got to be reasonable, and it's got to be, we have to get a lot more, we have to get a lot more for our buck. We're putting up the dollars, we're spending unbelievable dollars, and when you talk about planes costing that amount of money, can it be done for less? I guarantee you it can be done for not less, but much, much less. But you check this out. The pilots that were testing it did not like it as much as the old equipment.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's not good, and I think you would agree with that, Hugh.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> I do, and I want to let you go. I just want to get one assurance from you. You're not going to be doing Kurds/Quds in the Saturday Night Live open, are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think so. I don't think so. Actually, somebody did have that idea. I said out of respect for my friend, I will not do that, okay?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> (laughing) Donald Trump, I appreciate the short grab of time today.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Have a great open on Saturday Night Live, we'll all be watching.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Enjoy it on Saturday night. Thank you very much, Hugh. Talk to you next week.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Bye.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Let's talk to the man right now. Donald Trump joins us by phone. Mr. Trump, good morning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Let me talk to you about Corey Lewandowski. This is a guy who's been given am awful lot of credit for getting you where you are right now with your hands on the Republican nomination. He's credited with this whole strategy of let Trump be Trump. You were on the show during a time when he was under fire for the assault charge. You said, I am loyal to this guy. He's got a family. I stick with my people. What do you want to see me do? Discard him?" And now he has been discarded. Why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I was loyal and I am still loyal. He was excellent. He did a very good job. We spent -- I spent much less money than anybody else. I mean, we should take that into a factor and I beat everybody else. And you know, that's a good thing. I would stand up at certain rallies, I'd say I spent far less than this one or that one. And what...
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> But in terms of Corey Lewandowski, is this personal, is this a political view or philosophy, or did this boil down to something personal? It's been reported that your family members, including your daughter, did not want him in the campaign anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's absolutely true. Ivanka has great respect for him and so does my family. We like him. We had a great victory. Hey, Matt, I got more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican primaries.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> One second. You just said something. I want to make sure you know what you've just said. You said that's absolutely true that Ivanka didn't want him in the campaign.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no. Well -- what I said, I was reversing it. I said it's true that Ivanka really respects Corey and it's absolutely true and she likes Corey and I read all his reports about the children and about, you know, all of this. It's all nonsense. It's absolute nonsense.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Positive> But Donald, it sounds like you're saying everything is great with Corey and yet the undeniable fact is that Corey has been fired from your campaign. Why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going in a different direction because this is now different. The primaries, I ran them very lean. I spent very little money. I won in landslides -- biggest vote in history -- and won in landslides and Corey was absolutely perfect for that. We have -- to this day, you saw his interviews yesterday. We have a great relationship. But we're going in a different direction. Corey is excellent.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> I mentioned that -- I mentioned he is the guy who really believed in 'let Trump be Trump,' let him go out there and speak his mind and that got you a lot of success during the primaries. Does this signal with him out that you're not going to do the 'let Trump be Trump' anymore, that you're going to change your tone for the general election?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think so, Matt.  I think I have to be who I am.  I don't want to be a phony like a Hillary Clinton where she reads stuff that's written up by high-priced talent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to be that.  I want to be what I am.  New polls just came out and I'm right there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm right -- you know, with the horrible few weeks I had from the press. I mean, the press is treating me unbelievably unfairly and with all of that bad press that I've had over the last couple of weeks and it's -- believe me, that's manufactured press, 100 percent. I've had days where there should have been good deals and good days and the press comes out negatively. With all of the press, I'm right there in the polls. CNN just announced a poll. I'm right there. Pennsylvania, Ohio, we're practically even.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Negative> We just mentioned those and they are dead heats. Ohio, in fact, is tied. But let's talk about another measure of the last month that you've had and that is campaign fund-raising. The FEC, these federal disclosure forms came out and show you with the $1.3 million raised in -- on hand, excuse me, on hand compared to $42 million in Hillary Clinton's war chest. Now, you understand money. The importance of money. It helps you mount a professional campaign and it's a sign of whether people are supporting you. So how do you explain those lackluster results?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK, let me just tell you this. I understand money better than anybody. I understand it far better than Hillary and I'm way up on the economy when it comes to questions on the economy. But we have a party that -- I mean, I'm having more difficulty, frankly, with some of the people in the party than I -- with the Democrats because they're just -- they don't want to come on. They will probably eventually come on. Honestly, if they don't, it's just fine. I can win it either way. I mean, I may be better off winning it the opposite way than the more traditional way.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Neutral> Can you win it if she raises 42 times what you have?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But let me just say -- Savannah. I've raised a lot of money. But you also have to have some help from the party. But I've raised a lot of money. We raised $12 million this weekend. I was in Texas, I was in Arizona, I was in Las Vegas. We raised a lot of money this weekend. I made like four or five stops and I'm raising that money for the party. Now if it gets to a point...
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Well you mentioned...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Matt, excuse me, if it gets to a point, what I'll do is just do what I did in the primaries. I spent $55 million of my own money to win the primaries. 55. Now, you know, that's a lot of money, I mean, by even any standard. I may do that again in the general election.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> You said -- you just said...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I may -- I have -- excuse me, Matt. I have a lot of cash and I may do it again in the general election. But it would be nice to have some help from the party.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Well you just mentioned the party. So Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, after a lot of hemming and hawing, came out and said he would vote for you. Then on Sunday on Meet the Press he sounded as if he was waffling a little bit.= He told delegates in the Republican Party that they should vote their conscious, which is not exactly saying get out there and vote for our nominee who will be Donald Trump. You said famously a long time ago that he'll support you and if you don't have his support, he'll have problems. Does he have problems now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Paul, first of all, he didn't say support me, he endorsed me.  So did Mitch McConnell endorse me.  With that being said, I'd like to see great support.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And if I don't have great support, I'll go a different route.  Look, I want -- everyone said you could never get to 1,237 -- you know, delegates.  And you know that better than anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They said you can't get to 1,237 delegates because there's 17 people in the race. That's the primary reason. I ended up at 1,570 approximately. 1,570. Way above the 1,237 that people said you couldn't get. Now new polls just come out and despite the fact that I'm being treated horribly, horribly by the press, I'm practically even with Hillary Clinton and she had the best two weeks of her life.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> All right. Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, we appreciate you on the phone this morning. Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> Mr. President, I am so glad to see you. I'm so proud of everything you're doing.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> Let me ask you. You have just gotten back from the G-20. You were traveling around the world. What do you see as the major problem facing the world today? What's the major issue?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well we have many problems. And I was left a very, very tough meal. I will say that. It was a mess. And I think we're doing very well. But North Korea certainly is a big problem. The; Middle East is a total mess. Other than in five months we have done more against ISIS than anybody has done since the beginning. And we're having tremendous success with that. But I would have to say, Middle East is a tough situation. But we're getting it straightened out. And ultimately, we want to start investing money back in the United States at our home. Yeah. But we have to get rid of ISIS. We have to get rid of the terrorists, as you know better than anybody. And the other is North Korea. We have somebody that is -- we will find out what he is. We're going to find out.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> He has launched intercontinental missiles. Is there a possibility that we might want to knock some of those down on the launch pad or right after launch?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we wouldn't want to be speaking about anything. But we're looking at lots of different ways. We're working with other countries, including China. I think China would like to see this problem go away. It's a big problem for them. And, you know, the advantage we have is trade. We have big trade with China. And I have a very good relationship with President Xi, who I like a lot. And I think he likes me. We were just spending a lot of time together. And they are very strong with regard to, as you know, with regard to North Korea.
<Pat Robertson> <Neutral> Will they get tough with North Korea? I know that you were so close when he was there visiting Mar-a-Lago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're going to see. We're going to see. I would say that we had a good chance. They had an election where President Moon got elected to South Korea. He has a much different attitude -- or a much different take -- on how to handle this situation than his predecessor in South Korea. He's perhaps softer on the issue, but maybe not, because I like him a lot. I think he's going to be a strong person. I think he's got strong views -- stronger than people would understand. So we'll see how it all works out. I think China wants to help us. We're going to find out whether or not they do. But China would, in my opinion, like to be able to help us.
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> What's our leverage with them?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, our leverage with China is that China makes hundreds of billions of dollars a year with us on trade. And I want to renegotiate trade deals. But I would certainly be a lot easier in a trade deal if they were going to help us with North Korea than if they weren't. So we're going to see. The relationship is very good with China. It's very good with the president of China, who's a terrific person. We will find out whether or not they want to help. And maybe they do. And maybe they don't.
<Pat Robertson> <Neutral> What about that consortium of Arab nations that went against Qatar. Your secretary of state was not too favorable to what was being done. How are we going to handle that one?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Rex is doing a terrific job. But he and I had a little bit of a difference, only in terms of tone. So we went to Saudi Arabia. We had one of the great meetings ever -- 54 Muslim countries. And I got up, made a speech, got nice reviews. It's almost like you making a speech. But I said, we've got to stop the funding of terrorism. Tremendous money, and they're funding terrorism. So we've got to stop it. So they are working very hard on that. And I believe they're going to do it. It was one of the most incredible two days. As an example, Saudi Arabia put up hundreds of billions of dollars of money going into buying our planes and our military equipment and investing in our country. And I said, you have to do that. Otherwise I'm not going. So they spent hundreds of billions of dollars right in front of us. They were signing and big people from the biggest countries in companies -- General Electric, and all of the big companies. Many of them were there getting contracts. All good work for our workers. That was one of the things. But the other thing is that -- and very important to me -- was the funding of terrorism has to stop. And they fund terrorism -- some of those countries, many of those countries. So we had a tremendous summit. And I think things are going to work out. I think it was a very, very important and very impressive two days. And now, as you know, Qatar -- which a lot of people call it Qatar -- but Qatar is now a little bit on the outs. But I think they are being brought back in. Because they were known as a funder of terrorism. And we said you can't do that. You can't do that. We have to starve the beast, right. And the beast is terrorism. So we can't have wealthy countries funding that beast.
<Pat Robertson> <Neutral> How do we handle that big military installation we built in Qatar? What do we do with that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we'll be all right. Look, if we ever had to leave, we would have 10 countries willing to build us another one. Believe me. And they'll pay for it. The days of us paying for things are going to be largely over. They'll start paying. We go out. We build. We this. We that. But you're right. Qatar -- we're going to have a good relationship with Qatar. And we're not going have a problem with the military base. But if we ever needed another military base, you have other countries that would gladly build it. Believe me.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> You went to the G-20. And you met for the first time, front face to face, with Vladimir Putin. And George Bush had once said he stared into his soul and came away satisfied. What do you think? Can we trust him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, we had a good meeting. I think we had an excellent meeting. One thing we did is we have a ceasefire in a major part of Syria where there was tremendous bedlam and tremendous killing. And by the way, this is now four days. The ceasefire has held for four days. Those cease fires haven't held at all. That's because President Putin and President Trump made the deal and it's held. Now, I don't know what's going to happen. Maybe as we're speaking they start shooting again. But this has held, unlike all of the other cease fires that didn't mean anything. So that was a great thing that came out of that meeting. I think a lot of things came out of that meeting. But I do believe it's important to have a dialogue. And if you don't have a dialogue, it's a lot of problems for our country and for their country. I think we need dialogue. We need dialogue with everybody. Sure. It was a great G-20. We had 20 countries. I get along, I think, really fantastically with the head of every country.
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> Well, you're going to France right away to meet with Macron. And you were there for Bastille Day instead of July the Fourth, that's their special holiday.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right. Well I was invited by the president -- the new president of France -- who is a very good person, very good guy. And don't forget, I terminated for our country the Paris Accord. So that's not that easy for them. But I terminated it, because it was not fair to our country. We have other countries that had much better deals than we did, to put it just in a very simple form. And I said, why do we not have a better deal? And nobody could give me the answer. I said, I'm terminating. So I terminated. But I'm going to be with the president. And I think it's going to be very exciting. It's 100 years since World War I. Turns out to be the exact date. So we're going to watch something that I think will be very beautiful. And I think it's very important for our country to be represented 100 years since the First World War.
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> Lafayette, we are here. We've come back. Here we are. Here we are. Oh that's great. Well back to Putin. What do you think he wants? I know he's said what he wants. But what do you think his game is?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well he wants what's good for Russia. Yeah. And I want what's good for the United States. And I think, like in a case like Syria, where we can get together, do a cease fire -- and there are other cases or many other cases where getting along can be a very positive thing. But always, Putin is going to want Russia. And Trump is going to want United States. And that's the way it is. And sometimes, you're not going to get along on things. And sometimes you will. But we had a good meeting. It was a face to face meeting. It was a long meeting. It was two hours and 15 minutes. Everyone were surprised by the amount of time. But that was a good thing, not a bad thing.
<Pat Robertson> <Neutral> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I think we got along very well. And I think that's a good thing. And that's not a bad thing. Yeah, of course not. People said, oh they shouldn't get along. Well, who are the people that are saying that? I think we got along very, very well. We're a tremendously powerful nuclear power. And so are they. Sure It doesn't make sense not to have some kind of a relationship.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> We used to have that thing called mutually assured destruction -- MAD. And it's still there. Because he can hurt us. He can decimate our country. And we can do the same thing to him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's something you don't even like talking about. But again, we're the most powerful country in the world. And we are getting more and more powerful. Because I'm a big military person. As an example, if Hillary had won, our military would be decimated. Our energy would be much more expensive. That's what Putin doesn't like about me. And that's why I say, why would he want me? Because from day one, I wanted a strong military. He doesn't want to see that. And from day one, I want fracking and everything else to get energy prices low and to create tremendous energy. We're going to be self-supporting. We just about are now. We're going to be exporting energy. He doesn't want that. He would like Hillary, where she wants to have windmills. He would much rather have that, because energy prices will go up. And Russia, as you know, relies very much on energy. There are many things that I do that are the exact opposite of what he would want. So when I keep hearing about that he would have rather had Trump, I think probably not. Because when I want a strong military, you know she wouldn't have spent the money on the military. But when I want a strong military, and when I want tremendous energy, we're opening up coal. We're opening up natural gas. We're opening up fracking -- all the things that he would hate. But nobody ever mentions it.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> Well, Gazprom held Europe by the throat. They were the monopoly. And now the US is breaking into that monopoly with our exports of LNG, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. We are. We have LNG exporting all over. We have taken off some of the regulations that would make it impossible for the energy companies, impossible for banks, impossible for a lot of different things. You couldn't build a house in some places. And many of those restrictions have been taken off. Some are being taken off. We have statutory waits, meaning you have to wait a certain period of time. And the country is doing really well. So the stock market is the highest it's ever been. We have almost $4 trillion in gain. $4 trillion, I hope you're taking advantage of that. We have four -- almost $4 trillion --
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> I'm into the bargain --
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> But when you think of that, that's creating value. We have a lot of tremendous things ready to go, tremendous projects all over the country. Don't forget, when I came in, one of my first acts was the Keystone Pipeline.
<Pat Robertson> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the Dakota Access Pipeline. These two things got approved immediately. They would have never been built. And it's thousands and thousands of jobs. And it was my honor. To me, it was a no-brainer.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> The regulatory burden on American business has been, really, worse than taxes. And you have lifted -- how many regulations have you lifted so far?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, just thousands. And what we've done is we've given the farmers back their land. We've given the home-builders the right to put up a house. You had cases where a farm would have a little puddle someplace -- a puddle. When I grew up, we used to call it a puddle, right -- you too, probably. And they considered it a lake. And if you touched it, bad, bad things happen to you and your family. We've given the farmers back their farms. We have so many things planned in the future too, with the tax cuts and the death taxes. We're ending the death taxes. There's so many things we have planned. But the farmers are so happy now. The home-builders are happy. We have our most jobs ever in our country. Now we have to take care of those people that have given up looking for a job. You have a large group of people in this country that have given up. I would talk about them a lot in speeches. They've given up looking for jobs. They're going to be looking very soon. And they're going to be getting those jobs.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> I was talking to Mike Pence a few minutes ago. And he thinks that possibly that health care bill can go through. There are two pieces of legislation that the American people are really anxious to see put through. One is this iniquitous Obamacare has got to go and be replaced. Number two, we've got to have a tax cut, especially for small businesses -- corporate tax. How far along are you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And number three is infrastructure, which we're going to do also.
<Pat Robertson> <Neutral> Exactly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But number one, repeal and replace. I am sitting in the Oval Office with a pen in hand, waiting for our senators to give it to me. For years, they've been talking about repeal and replace, repeal and replace. I think they passed it 61 times -- repeal and replace. But that didn't mean anything. Because you had the minority, the Republicans. They didn't have the majority, so it wasn't going to get to the president. But if it ever did, Obama was going to sign it, so it didn't mean. Now, we have a president that's waiting to sign it. I have pen in hand. So now it means something. Those other times -- those many, many times that they passed it --
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> What's the hold up?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have very good people. These are very good people. We have 52 senators. It's very hard to get all -- we need almost all of them. You need almost all of them. And that's the holdup. And states are somewhat different. But with all of that being said, has to get passed. They have to do it. They have to get together and get it done.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> What will happen if they don't?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't want to talk about it. Because I think it would be very bad. I would be very angry about it. And a lot of people will be very upset. But I'm sitting waiting for that bill to come to my desk. I hope that they do it. They've been promising it for years. They've been promising it ever since Obamacare, which has failed. It's a failed experiment. It is totally gone. It's out of business. And we have to get this done -- repeal and replace.
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> Mitch McConnell is a tactician of great skill. You think he can pull it off? It's his job.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's got to pull it off.
<Pat Robertson> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Mitch has to pull it off. He's working very hard. He's got to pull it off.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> All right, the next thing is taxes. It looks like to me, lowering the corporate tax to get us in line with the rest of the world is, again, a no-brainer. Can you get that one through?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think after health care, taxes are going to be so easy. Health care is very hard. Health care is hard, because you'll do something a little bit this way, and you pick up that final vote, and you lose four votes over here. Now you it back. It's a very tiny little road. It's about two feet wide. And it goes throughout the country. So health care is much tougher than taxes. No, I think taxes are going to be very well. In fact, our plan is we're talking about massive tax cuts -- the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. We're going to get people back again. We're going to bring back $4 trillion from overseas. Money that can't come back into this country because of our tax code. We're going to bring back $4 trillion -- could be more than that -- from corporations that can't get their money back into our country. We're going to give a tremendous tax cut for the middle class. We're bringing it down to 10%. We're bringing corporate taxes down to 15%. I hope we can get that number approved. Maybe they'll want to do something and negotiate. But if we get what we want, it will be the biggest tax cut and the greatest tax reform in the history of our country.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> Would you settle for the tax cut without reforming the whole tax code? Or would you like to work with the whole thing?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think we can do them simultaneously. The code is too complicated. H&R Block won't be happy. But people go out. They spend a lot of their money on getting other people to do their taxes.
<Pat Robertson> <Neutral> I'm one of them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know. You understand. And it's unnecessary. So simplification is very important. Reform is very important. And the biggest thing to me is tax cut. We are going for very large tax cuts for businesses and for the middle class. Tremendous tax cuts.
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> Chairman Brady is on board with what you want to do. He's a great guy. He will line up. Have you got anybody in the Senate of like mind?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well first of all, Chairman Brady is a great guy. He really knows the subject. He'll never disappoint you. So they're, I think, really good. In the Senate, I think we're going to do very well. Again, like health care -- this is simpler than health care, believe it or not -- but like health care, I think we're going to get it done. And then I want to go to infrastructure. We have to rebuild our country -- our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our schools. We have to rebuild our country.
<Pat Robertson> <Neutral> Exactly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, we will have, in another few months, have spent $7 trillion dollars in the Middle East. $7 trillion. And then if you want to spend $2 on building a school in Iowa or in Pennsylvania or in Florida, they don't want to give you the money. But we've spent -- in a very short period of time -- we will be up to $7 trillion dollars. How ridiculous is this? And here's what we got for it. Nothing. Nothing. The Middle East is a mess. Now, I'm there for one reason. We've got to get rid of the terrorists. That's the reason. And we're almost there. We have really made headway. We've made, as I said, we've made more headway in the last short period of time than they have ever before, by far, during this long period of time. But when you think that we've spent -- we will have spent $7 trillion. Think of it. We've spent, as of a few months ago, we actually have spent $6 trillion in the Middle East. But we have nothing for it. Nothing. I want to rebuild our bridges and our roads. I have a friend who's a trucker. And he loves -- he's very proud of his equipment. He buys it very big. And he buys the best trucks. He's very proud of it. He said in the past, when we went from Los Angeles to New York, it was fine. Now by the time he gets to New York, with all the problems on the roads and potholes, he said I've got to fix my equipment all the time. He wants to go to a different level of truck, meaning downward.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> Where do you go --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have to fix our roads. And we have to fix our infrastructure. So infrastructure is very important.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> Somebody suggested the Federal Reserve has a big slush fund that maybe they could pass over for infrastructure without actually having to raise taxes. How do you get the money for that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, we'll get the money. We're going to get the money. And we're going to grow. And I say it. We're going to grow. We're going to have tremendous growth. We're being held back by all these regulations, which I'm knocking out left and right.
<Pat Robertson> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Even Dodd-Frank, with the banking business. I have people -- friends of mine -- they want to go get a loan. They can't. Great people, and they can't get loans. We're doing things on Dodd-Frank, in terms of the banks. We have many, many things that we're doing. But we're going to have growth. And we're going to grow out of our problems. Hey, we owe $20 trillion dollars.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> The Congressional Budget Office uses this. They don't use dynamic scoring. They use static scoring. Can you get past them so you can --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to get past it. And we're going to get past it to a large extent, because we're going to have a country that's going to be much more dynamic. If we do GDP at 1% -- because we're basically, for the last year, at around 1%. I call countries like I'm friendly with all -- let's say, the top 20 countries where I just left. How are you doing to a major country -- I won't use names -- oh, we are not happy. We are not happy. What's your GDP? 8%. 11%. 10%. 9%. And I say, how you doing? We are not happy. So we're at 1% and we're supposed to be happy? We have the highest taxes anywhere in the world. We're going to lower them. We're going to lower them substantially. We're going to have tremendous growth.
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> I'd like to make a prediction. If you get health care and tax reform, you're guaranteed another four years of office if you want it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well then I'll see you at the inauguration.
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> I am counting on it. [Laughter] Anyhow, well, I appreciate so much what you're doing. By the way, the evangelicals of America voted 83% in the last election for you. And I want you to know there are thousands and thousands of people praying for you all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you Pat, that's so nice.
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> Holding you up.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The evangelicals were so great to me. And they did. They came out in massive numbers. And on top of that, I got 83%. But they came out in record numbers. They never came out like that. And we've really helped. Because I've gotten rid of the Johnson Amendment. Now we're going to go try and get rid of it permanently in Congress. But I signed an executive order so that now, people like you -- that I want to hear from -- ministers and preachers and rabbis and whoever it may be, they can speak.
<Pat Robertson> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You couldn't speak politically before. Now you can. And I want to hear from you and others that we like. Franklin Graham -- I had such a -- Dr. Jeffress, Robert Jeffress, who is such a great guy. Pastor Jeffress. He used to go on television. I didn't know who he was. I'd see him. And he was always speaking so well of me. And you have so many people that I want to hear from. Now they're going to be able to speak. And that's going to be a great thing for Christianity. Believe me -- a great, great thing. And it's a great thing for religion.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> One last thing. It looks like you may have another Supreme Court nominee. Very possible one or more will retire. And have you already got the list ready for the next one?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well we have a great one with Justice Gorsuch. Unbelievable. He's going to be great. And I just have to wait to see what happens. I have a lot of respect for Justice Kennedy. I like him a lot. But we have to see what happens. And we'll be learning. Whatever it is, it is. If there is ever a vacancy, we will put somebody on who is going to be terrific for our country.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> Last question. There seems to be a visceral hatred of you in the part of the left. And they won't quit. Does it bother you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, there's a -- there seems to be a hatred. And it's too bad. We're creating jobs. We're creating value. We're making our country proud again. We're building up our military. We're taking care of our police. Our police have been horribly treated.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> And the veterans, by the way, is being reformed dramatically.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The veterans. We have something where it's accountability. Veterans Accountability Act. We have, where you could be the worst employee in history, you could treat the veterans horribly. You can do whatever you want. They couldn't fire you. They've been trying to get rid of it for 40 years. They've been trying to get in a position where they can do things. I had it passed last week. I just signed it last week. Nobody even talks about it. But you know what? The people know that we're doing these things. The people see the stock market. The people see the jobs report. But it is really unfair, because it's like a witch hunt. It's like a witch hunt. But we take it. We take it. As long as my people understand -- that's why I do interviews with you. You have a tremendous audience. You have people that I love -- the evangelicals. And sometimes, you say the evangelical Christians. But I do a lot of interviews with people, because I can get the word out. Because I'm treated very unfairly by the press. And it is what it is.
<Pat Robertson> <Neutral> You don't mind if we ask you to take on heavyweights and not fight and with light weights anymore?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, we want to fight. The big guys. We want to fight. We have to bring our country back.
<Pat Robertson> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Our country was going in the wrong direction. That's right. You couldn't build. You couldn't do anything. Our country was going in the wrong direction. And by the way, what they were doing to religious liberty. They were destroying religious liberty. You will be saying Merry Christmas again very soon.
<Pat Robertson> <Neutral> We'll count on it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> Well, Mr. President, thank you so much for being with us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> Always a joy to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Such a great honor.
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> We're so proud of what you're doing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> God bless you.
