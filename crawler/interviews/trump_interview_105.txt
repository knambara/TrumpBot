<Jack Fink> <Positive> Thank you Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Jack Fink> <Positive> We really appreciate you sharing your time. What was your reaction when you first heard that Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick asked that you come to Texas to help Senator Cruz and Texas Republicans get out the vote?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Dan has been a friend of mine for a long time, and he is just a great guy, and Ted and I, I mean we went to war during the presidential -- during the primaries. But he's a great person, and he loves this state, and I think he's doing really well, it looks like he's really doing well, and I can tell you we had over 100,000 people apply to come to watch what we're going to be doing in a little while. And -- so Dan did make the initial request, and it was my honor, right away, immediately. There was no thought about it.
<Jack Fink> <Positive> Were you surprised about coming to Texas and having to do that here?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, because I'd do it anyway. I think he's going to -- he's going to do well. I think Ted's going to do well. He's a very superior kind of a guy. You look at academically, and, you know, up here, very important. And he -- he's doing a good job for the state.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can tell you, we worked on a lot of things. When you had the hurricane, Ted was right out there, and John Cornyn, they were out there, they were really pitching hard that you get the money you needed to fix things, and it worked out really well. So, he's done a lot for the state.
<Jack Fink> <Negative> As you know, Democrats have been making a lot of your 2016 tweets about Senator Cruz, repeating the fact that you call him lyin' Ted. What do you say to that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, now I call him Texas Ted. Now I call him Texas Ted. No it's -- Look, it's all fun. And they probably are, I guess they probably do. But, actually I was asked that question a little while ago, I said, No, now we call him Texas Ted.
<Jack Fink> <Negative> Congressman O'Rourke said other day that he thinks that there is enough evidence out there to impeach you, to have the House impeach you. What do you think of that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's is a lightweight. He shouldn't even be running, in my opinion. And, it's -- now they're talking about Kavanaugh, they're talking about -- they want to impeach everybody. They're not going to impeach anyone. They want to try winning. First, they have to win, they have to learn how to win. So far, they haven't.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we have a really good chance of holding the House, and increasing the Senate, looking more and more like we're going to increase the Senate. And they all have to start winning. I will say this: most Democrats have said don't even mention that word, because we're going to lose, we're going to lose if you mention that word. He's one of the few guys that said, oh let's do that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The only thing they could impeach me for is for having created the best economy in the history of, not only Texas, but in the history of this country. We have probably the greatest economy in the history of our country, and, very importantly, just came out today, consumer confidence the highest it's ever been in our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I don't know, are they a peach -- impeachable offenses? But, it's -- we're doing well, the country is doing really well. And, you look at our military being rebuilt, you look at what we've done for our vets. We -- we're very proud of what we've done.
<Jack Fink> <Positive> Given what you say are your accomplishments, in Dallas County today nearly record turnout for a non-presidential year for first day of voting. Dallas County very heavy blue. And so, does that give you any pause?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's good. That's good I think. Yeah, no, I think that Ted's going to get a lot of votes that are blue. I think we're going to get a lot of votes, both red and blue, and I would be very surprised to see anything but a big, fat, beautiful victory.
<Jack Fink> <Negative> Let me ask about the caravan of migrants coming up --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, big problem.
<Jack Fink> <Negative> -- to the United States. Today, you said you alerted the military, you alerted the Border Patrol. What factors will go into your decision whether you call the military to the border, and will that be here in Texas?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's going to be here, and I've just spoken to your governor, your attorney general, I spoke to a lot of your people -- Dan, and we -- we really have got a lot of great people from Texas, and our military people are working together. We just can't let them come in. It's just something we can't do.
<Jack Fink> <Neutral> And what did you tell them as far as the timetable of a decision?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it looks like it's going to be a couple of weeks before they get here. And it's a big group of people, and once you lose control of your borders, you no longer have a country. I mean, you literally don't have a country. So, we're going to maintain total control over our country, our borders.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We pay to -- if you look at Honduras, and you look at El Salvador, we pay hundreds of millions of dollars to all of these countries, and they don't come through for us. And I hope Mexico's going to come through, we're gonna find out soon enough, but I hope they do.
<Jack Fink> <Negative> You said today that you blame the Democrats for the immigration situation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Jack Fink> <Negative> And so, what I'm wondering is, Republicans still control both houses. Why can't they pass anything?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, like in the Senate you need 60 votes. We have 51 votes. I mean, we need nine Democrat votes, so we can't get them. They won't give you one vote. So we need more people. We need more more Republicans elected. In the House we do pass things, we pass them a lot. But we can't get it by the Senate. We need more people. We actually need more people in the House too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we're going to see what happens. But I will tell you, it's a great issue. It's an important day. It's now coming to light, and the Democrats just won't allow legislation to be passed, even though they know it's bad for the country, but they think it's good for them as a party. It's not. It's really not.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They -- I think they overplayed their hand just like they did with, as you know, Justice Kavanaugh, they overplayed their hand, and that was a big loss for them. But they really did. They made a mistake, and I think they have a big mistake coming up. A lot of people say, did they start that, did they infuse money into that? I have no idea. But I'll say, they overplay their hand every time, and it hurts them.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Morning glory and evening grace, America. It's Hugh Hewitt. Later in the program I will deal with the assassination -- murder of Alison Parker and Adam Ward, but I begin today's program with Donald Trump, about whom everyone in America is talking. Donald Trump, welcome back, I say I'd start every show of mine with you, you're such a ratings draw. So just be available more, would you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I'd love to, Hugh. How are you doing?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> I'm great. Now I want to get to the Jorge Ramos thing in a moment. I want to ask you first, though, because of a story this afternoon in the Huffington Post, you've said, you know, you wouldn't run third party if the GOP treated you fairly. Are they treating you fairly so far?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I didn't see any story in the Huffington Post. So I don't know what story that is. What story is that?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> It quotes Michael Cohen saying that asked specifically if Trump would be making a formal announcement that he would pledge not to run third party, Cohen replied only Mr. Trump can sign that oath, and when he does, you can rest assured he will live by it. And Mr. Cohen indicated you had, you'd pretty much been happy with the way the GOP had been treating you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They have been treating me fairly, I think very fairly. And you know, maybe it's, you see the kind of polls that are coming out. They've been so terrific and so high and so wonderful. The one that just came out in New Hampshire, a Public Policy has been, I guess it's 35%, and way in the lead.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And all of them, and so I'm very honored by that, and I will say that the RNC and the Republican Party, I think I've been treated very fairly over the last period of time, yes.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> So are you ruling out a third party run?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's not something I'd want to do, and at some point, I'll you know, actually totally commit. You know, I didn't think it was appropriate to commit during the debate, because it was, you know, just, I was a little surprised by the fact that they even asked me at that debate, but that was okay. But at some point, look, I want to run. I'm leading in the polls by a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to run as a Republican. I want to get the nomination, and then I want to beat the Democrats, and I think that's our best chance for a victory. I think we will win. And we have to energize, because you know, last time, sadly, Hugh, a lot of people did not get out and vote.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I still, to this day, don't understand it. But a lot of the Republicans and a lot of conservatives just never got up to vote. They just weren't energized, and I think this time, they're going to be plenty energized.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> But I've told you before, I'll just say it again. I think your numbers go up the day you take that pledge.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've been told that by a lot of people. Steve Wynn is a good friend of mine, and he's a great guy from Las Vegas. You know, he's done a fantastic job.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Of course.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he says the same thing. He says when you go and you actually do that, and make that firm, firm commitment, your numbers are going to bounce, and maybe bounce quite a bit. So you're saying that also. So now I have two very smart people that tell me that.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Well, okay, you can make that announcement anytime in this conversation you'd like.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> I want to turn to Jorge Ramos.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> I loved that interview yesterday when you called yourself a builder. I immediately thought you're also a television pro with many seasons under your belt. The moment that Ramos stood up and started to orate, did the light go on in your mind that this was a television moment?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not really. I mean, you have to be careful. I had a lot of cameras. You know, there was a tremendous crowd.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We had 4,000 people there, and you saw the room. It was packed and energized. And likewise, before I went out, I mean, literally, just before I went on stage, I did this press avail, as they call it, or the press conference. And there were tremendous numbers of reporters there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was packed. It was, you know, a room that was just absolutely packed with moving television cameras and everybody else. And I'm getting ready to start the press conference, and I actually picked on one person, and I said listen, go ahead, and it was actually Fox. It was Carl Cameron.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then I said another one, and all of a sudden, a man stood up and started like screaming at me. And I said who is that, and he just started, and he wasn't saying can I speak. He was just telling me things. He wasn't like, you know, asking questions.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was just telling me things. And it was a very loud, shrill voice, and I said what's going on over here. And ultimately, I figured he was a Univision person, and I figured that was Jorge, and you know, I just didn't think it was appropriate the way he behaved. He was screaming, and I thought it was actually very unfair not so much to me, which I guess you could say it was, but it was certainly very unfair to all the other reporters that were waiting with their hands up to take questions.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I would have gotten to him, 100%. I have no problem with doing that.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Yeah, what he did was, it was not professional. I've been doing this for 25 years. It wasn't professional. But it was successful for him, and it was also, though, very successful for you because of the way you handled him.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> And I was actually reminded, do you remember when the Iraqi threw the shoe at George W. Bush?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> And he didn't blink, and he just carried on?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> That's what it reminded me of. And you see why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that may have been his best moment, if you want to know the truth, which is pretty sad to say. But the truth is I didn't think in terms of television. I just said you know, who's this guy that's screaming? I don't think, I think when you're doing a lot of live television, you don't necessarily think that you're on live television, but that was live all over the place. And I just thought it was inappropriate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The first thing I thought, it was really unfair, because they had so many people with good, you know, sitting with hands up, and wanting to ask questions. And this man was standing up and really shouting quite loud. Now you didn't hear the extent of it, because you didn't have a microphone. Had he had a microphone on, and yet you still heard him, because he was shouting so loud.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But if he had a microphone, he would have blasted everybody out of the room. So it worked out fine, and it probably was good for him. And actually, at the end, by the time we finished, I mean, I didn't think he was such a bad guy. I'm glad I invited him back, because I think maybe I would have been criticized if I didn't invite him back with some people, you know, the concept of getting him out, which people didn't mind, but I think they wanted him back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it was an interesting evening. Had I...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Oh, you know what the most interesting part of that presser was, Donald Trump, when you brought up Normal Vincent Peale.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, yes.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Now I know about Dr. Norman Vincent Peale. Many people might not. How often did you hear him preach? Do you have a favorite book of the Bible or a favorite verse? And do you have a favorite hymn? If you were a churchgoer at the Marble Collegiate Church, that's a big deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Well, I was, and I just, I just Norman Vincent Peale. You know, he would talk, and we go to church, and you go to church, and as good as we are, sometimes, you know, you could, you can leave church and you're not so upset. I used to be, I used to love his sermons.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I used to love his, he would speak, and he'd bring things from the Bible, Hugh, he would bring them into modern day territory. I remember he was talking about Alfred Sloan, who had tremendous difficulties as a young man. He founded General Motors. And he would talk about Alfred Sloan, who was a friend of his, a great friend of his.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He had great friendships with very substantial people. And he's talk about him, and Alfred Sloan had an alcohol problem, and he had lots of difficulties. And he got rid of these difficulties, and he'd bring it into sort of a modern day feeling, meaning, you know, bring it updated. And he would give, he was one of the best speakers I've ever seen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you would literally leave church, and you would say I could listen to another three sermons. I was there when he made his last sermon, and it was very sad, because he became, you know, he was very old, and he was almost unable to finish the sermon. He was clutching, you know, the podium. And he was reading, and he was clutching, and he said, I can't go on any further.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was there in that room. You know, the amazing thing about Norman Vincent Peale, when some churches were empty, his church always had overfill areas. Maybe that's why I'm always glad that I always have overfill areas, right?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Did he leave you...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But he would always have, they had rooms throughout the church, Marble Collegiate Church, where they'd have like cameras, they'd have closed circuit televisions. And if you didn't get there early, you wouldn't be able to sit in a fairly large church. You'd have to sit on one of the rooms, one of the conference rooms where they had the closed circuit. But he was a fantastic speaker, a wonderful speaker.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> And given that, that you had this great preacher all those years, and your mom was a Scots ŽmigrŽ, I learned. Did you get your reformed roots from her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would say maybe. I mean, she was religious, and my father was religious. I was actually Presbyterian, which is interesting. I actually, my first church was First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, which is in Queens, because I didn't join Marble Collegiate until much later.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And that wasn't Presbyterian, but it was just a church that I liked, and I liked him.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> It was reformed, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I was actually Presbyterian, and then I came into Manhattan, and I joined Marble Collegiate.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> So what was your mother like?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she was from Scotland, and she came over at 19, met my father. They were married for, I guess, about 65 years. They had a great marriage. She was a terrific woman.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She was a very beautiful woman, they tell me, as a young man. They said she was like a real beauty, of great beauty, and my father was a builder in Brooklyn, in Queens, And he was build houses, and they met, and she never went back to Scotland. Now she would go back to Scotland every year. She loved Scotland.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But she never officially went back, because she married my father, and they had five children.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> But she was the religious one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it was a terrific marriage, actually.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> What I'm trying to get at, if she's the religious one, do you think today the Gospels have any role in shaping public policy? You said you're doing very well with the Evangelicals.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the Evangelicals, they're sort of interesting. I mean, I am a religious person, I would say not formally like some might be, you know, like some would talk about it. But I am, you know, somebody that believes, and I am, it's very interesting, because I noticed that the polls came out. The one in New Hampshire, Public Policy Polling, where it said 35%, and it sort of said it leads across with Tea Party, with Evangelicals, with moderates, with just about everything.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They even said with Democrats, I mean, just lead straight across the board. And I think a lot of people were surprised. They thought it would be very conservative, and which I lead big in the very conservative. But I lead straight across.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And one of the things that made me very happy was that I actually lead, and you've seen this even in Iowa where I lead with Evangelicals. And I was so happy to see that, because they think that's the real me, but I don't think people see that as me.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Do you think they expect you to, but do you think the Gospels have some way of informing your public policy choices? Or is that just a different category?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. I think that maybe so, you know, down deep, maybe they do. I think what's happening in the country where it just seems that you know, the word Christmas is being taken out. I see these stores like Macy's and so many others.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're afraid to use the word Christmas now. Maybe they can't use it, legally. What's going on is outrageous, and I would try and, not only try, I will do things about it. You're going to have to go through court systems.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's the problem. I mean, you have to go through actually courts now to use names that you should be able to use automatically. But you know, the whole thing is changing, Hugh, so much toward religion and what you can say and what you can't say, and what you can put up in a beautiful public area, where for years you'd have the manger, and you'd have, you know, Mary and Jesus, and now you're not allowed to do it.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Well, now in Denver.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I think it's terrible. I think it's terrible.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> I'm on the campus of a Colorado Christian college today. In Denver, where we're close to, their city councils have said Chick-Fil-A, maybe they can't build at the Denver International Airport because their founders are Evangelical and have traditional marriage views. It's blatantly unconstitutional.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Wow. Wow.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Have you heard that story, yet?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I haven't heard it, but it doesn't surprise me. It's horrible. What's going on is horrible. I mean, you can't do, you can't do anything having to do with really deep-seated, incredible beliefs that really, to a large extent, made our country great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, these, the beliefs in the Bible had a lot to do with our country. And I mean, a week doesn't go by where there's not some negative ruling on something having to do with Christianity. It's getting, I think it's outrageous, and I'll tell you what.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, let me get a couple of...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll be fighting on the other side much stronger than anybody else that you have up there fighting, because I think it's really outrageous.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Let me talk about two big issues, tough ones. I always ask you tough but fair questions. China has gotten very erratic. Their markets are strange behavior.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Do you think that South Korea and Japan ought to consider going nuclear to match their erratic neighbor?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they have a very erratic neighbor, and you know, the whole concept of us protecting Japan was so they didn't arm again, because we had a little problem with them, as you remember. And that wasn't a good situation. But you know, there's got to be a point where we cannot protect everybody. You know, we're protecting everybody.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I talked about it last night in my speech from Iowa. It was such an amazing group of people. And you know, we're protecting Germany, we're protecting Japan. We're protecting South Korea.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hugh, I just bought 4,000 television sets on a big project I built, and 4,000, and they all come, every bidder is from South Korea. They're making a fortune, and yet we have 28,000 soldiers at the border. And...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Well, should they go, should they build their own nuclear weapons in South Korea?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know. You know, it's a question. The problem is you're going to have, all of a sudden, you're going to have everybody having nuclear weapons, and that's a scary prospect, also. But in the meantime, you have North Korea, that obviously has them.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now I don't know if they know how to use them, yet.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because every time you see a rocket go up, it comes crashing to the ground. But you know, that's the easy part. I mean, in theory, that's the easy part. So it's a pretty frightening prospect.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do say this. At some point, we can't be the policemen of the world. We have to rebuild our own country. We have to rebuild our bridges and our highways and our roads and schools and our airports.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And how much longer can we be doing this? You know...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> I'm trying to, though. Scott...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you noticed with South Korea, North Korea started rearing its head a couple of days ago, and we all of a sudden, we're engaged and we're getting ready. We don't get anything for this, Hugh. You know, at what point, at what point, and they're wealthy. The reason I tell about the 4,000 televisions, they make a fortune in trade against us.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You understand that.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Well, that's, you know, earlier this week, Scott Walker said the President should cancel the state visit from President Xi. And do you agree with that suggestion, by the way?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think you should cancel it. I think you should negotiate better deals. Our trade pacts with China are horrible, and you know, if you want to do, I have a friend who's a big trader and a big manufacturer. He can't get his goods into China.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And when he does get them in, they charge him a big tax. Well, people don't know those stories. You know, if you sell trucks in China, they charge you taxes to get them in. People don't understand it's a one-way street.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Okay, you wouldn't cancel it. Last question, because you know, you're...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would not. Yeah, I would not, but I'd negotiate it and I'd say listen, it's over.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Will you negotiate on my behalf with Hope, because I need a negotiator with Hope, because she keeps me to 15 minutes with you, and you know, I could use like two hours.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You can have as long as you...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Here's my tough question. In tough times, republics turn to tough men. It's happened throughout history Ð Caesar, Napoleon, the last century had a lot of republics fail, and I don't have to invoke Godwin's Law and go that far, but are you tickling that temptation in democracies that they go for tough guys in tough times, and it's called the authoritarian temptation? Is that's what's playing for Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think we've had very weak people. I think we have very weak people even running. I look at some of the people that are running, and I think they're not strong people. And they're good people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm not saying they're not good people, but I think it is time to have tough, smart people. If you look at China, if you look at some of these countries that are just eating our lunch, they have tough, smart people. It's time that we have tough, smart people, because we're not going to be able to go much longer the way we're going right now. We owe $18 trillion.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And by the way, that $18 trillion's going to be about $21 trillion very quickly. You know, it builds, it's going to build, right now, from this point, very, very rapidly. We're not doing well. That, I can tell you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Well then, when people say Trump will an authoritarian, once he gets power, he won't give it back, what's the response going to be?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, no, I just want to make the country great again. I'm not looking to do this. I have a wonderful life. People say why are you even doing it.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yes, you do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love my life. I love what I've done. I've built a great company. But I want to make this country great again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I owe a lot to this country, and I want to make it great again. And we can do it. And honestly, it cannot continue to go like this, otherwise, there'll be a point at which you can't bring it back, Hugh.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> But you'll play by the rules if you win?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> 100%. 100%. I always play by the rules.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> The Constitution, I mean, by the Constitution, you wouldn't...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, Obama doesn't play. He goes out...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Exactly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...and dodged, he signs his executive orders all over the place, because he doesn't want to meet with people and try and convince them to do what the right thing to do is. No, he's not playing by the rules. No, I do play by the rules. I will play by the rules, too.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Donald Trump, it is always a pleasure. Come back. You tell Hope, you know, I'm not perfect, but I'm the best when it comes to this stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You did a good job. I didn't even know you had the 15. You could have had three 15's if you wanted, Hugh.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Oh, my gosh, I'm a terrible negotiator for myself. I'll keep going if you want, but I promised Hope, so I'm letting you go.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hugh, you'll do better the next time then, and thanks a lot, Hugh. I appreciate it.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Come back early and often.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very good. Thank you very much. Bye.
<Cal Thomas> <Positive> My grandparents used to play a parlor game. It went like this: Tell me who you are without telling me your name or what you do. We have seen your tough exterior, but who are you at your core and what is your basic philosophy and worldview?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am a person who grew up with two wonderful parents and a wonderful family and a person who has done well in life. I went to great schools. Wharton School, a lot of great places. Education is very important. I think I understand education. I think I can straighten out our mess in education. And I'm a person who has, to a certain extent, redefined where I should be. I started off in Brooklyn and Queens and I wasn't supposed to come to Manhattan. My father didn't want to go to Manhattan for me, and I came to Manhattan and I have done a great job in Manhattan. And then I wrote a best-seller and I wrote numerous best-sellers. I wrote 'The Art of the Deal' and numerous other books. Some were number one best-sellers. I guess 'The Art of the Deal' is the best-selling business book of all time. I had a TV show called 'The Apprentice' and it's one of the most successful reality shows in the history of television. And now I'm doing something else.
<Cal Thomas> <Positive> President Obama has said America is not exceptional. I know you hold another view. A lot of people would like to know why you love America, besides the opportunity it has given you to be successful and make money. What is it about this country that, as president, you would seek to preserve, protect and defend, in the words of the oath of office?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> President Obama has been an unbelievable divider of this country, whether it's rich and poor; white and black. One thing I had hoped Obama would be is a good cheerleader for the country. He's really brought the opposite in spirit to the country. He's been a very negative force. I think you see this when you see the tremendous division in the country, when you see Baltimore, when you see Ferguson and St. Louis. As far as the country is concerned, we have tremendous potential, but we're not using it. I get the biggest rallies by far, much bigger than Bernie (Sanders), much bigger than anybody else. And the people are phenomenal. You know my theme is 'Make America Great Again' and I think it can be greater than ever before. But if we have four years of Hillary (Clinton), I don't know if we can ever come back.
<Cal Thomas> <Negative> Your critics say some of the language you use is divisive. How do you get beyond that? Will there be a pivot for you from the primaries to the general election campaign, because, even though Trump University (the subject of lawsuits claiming fraud and deception) is important to you and the (Latino) judge in the (two class-action lawsuits) … you say has been unfair, these are not things that resonate with most Americans who are concerned about jobs, the economy and threats against us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I agree. It's starting very soon because Tuesday … (was) the last day (for primaries). I will have received more votes for a Republican than anyone in the history of the primaries by millions. More than Ronald Reagan, who was a terrific guy, more than Dwight D. Eisenhower, more than everybody. … That's a great honor. Honestly, that puts a lot of weight on your shoulders because you're representing so many great people who want to see so much. And they're hungry for … I hate to use the word change because Obama used to use that word … but they're hungry for real change; they're hungry for making things right. And what I will do is put America first. People don't like to use that term of America first, but we're going to make America great again by putting America first. With our trade deals we are always second. You can pick any country and they're eating our lunch and making us look bad and so we're going to change that, Cal. We have to make our country rich again before we can make it great again. We're a poorer country. You've seen how we're stealing airplane parts for our fighter jets. We're going to do something that will make you very proud.
<Cal Thomas> <Positive> There are a lot of people who supported one of your opponents during the primaries. Some say they will never vote for you. Others say they are persuadable. How do you plan to persuade the persuadables who are concerned about your temperament?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've had great success in everything I've done. When you have the most votes of anybody that tells you where the party is. I think the party got lost to a certain extent. For instance, we talk about trade. I believe in free trade, but I really believe in making great deals for the United States.
<Cal Thomas> <Neutral> You seemed to indicate a moment ago in response to another question that you are going to do a pivot after the primaries. What would that look like?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's going to be a pivot of spirit for the country, a period of smart deals for the country, a stronger military. Our military has been so badly depleted. Who would think the United States is raiding plane graveyards to pick up parts and equipment? That means they're being held together by a shoestring. Other countries have brand-new stuff they have bought from us. It's insane. We're going to have strong borders. People are going to come into the country, but they're going to come legally. We're going to keep our jobs and not let them go to Mexico.
<Cal Thomas> <Negative> So there will be less talk about Mexicans and other things and more about issues?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, the reason I bring up the (Trump University) lawsuit, because it is a lawsuit I am going to win. … I have thousands of students who loved the school and I've been treated very unfairly in that lawsuit. I don't care if a judge is Mexican or what. What I care about is to be treated fairly. And the only reason I spent time on it is when they ask me a question, instead of saying I have no comment and then winning the case two years from now, I'd rather bring up parts of the case. For instance, you possibly didn't know I have many thousands of letters saying the course was great. And people have actually been successful after they took the course. It's worth my while to explain this because people then say, 'Wow, I never knew that.'
<Cal Thomas> <Negative> Let's talk entitlements. The biggest drivers of debt are Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. At one point you said you wanted to reform Social Security then seemed to change your mind and said you want to leave it alone. When George W. Bush and (House Speaker) Paul Ryan tried to do it they got demagogued by Democrats. Are you in favor of reforming these entitlement programs?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What I want to do with entitlements is to stop the fraud, waste and abuse. I want to make the programs very strong. I want to bring wealth back to our country so we can afford them. We're losing all our jobs. Look at Indiana. One of the reasons I won Indiana is because Carrier just announced they are leaving for Mexico. We're losing our companies; we're losing jobs; they devalue us out of business — China and these other countries. We should be a rich country again, and if we do that, we can leave Social Security. Now, there's tremendous waste, fraud and abuse beyond what anyone would understand, and while this is not the reason I do it, the Democrats are going to leave it the way it is.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Manufacturing is down 55 percent. Factories that were thriving 25 years ago are now all empty. We're going to bring jobs back to this country. I think that is one of the reasons I'm going to do well with the African-Americans and Hispanics.
<Cal Thomas> <Negative> One of the things that most affects African-Americans is education. So many children are trapped in failing public schools and liberal politicians won't let them escape. Do you favor school choice?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am totally in favor of choice. It's necessary and it's competitive.
<Cal Thomas> <Negative> You have spoken about doing away with the Department of Education. Reagan tried that and failed because Congress wouldn't let him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I like the concept of local education. I want to get rid of Common Core. I think Common Core is a disaster. That doesn't mean there can't be a little tentacle left of the Department of Education, like 5 percent, just in terms of local coordination, perhaps. Look where we stand in the world on education. We're at the bottom of the list. So it's obviously not working.
<Cal Thomas> <Positive> There are two views of the Constitution. There are those who believe in a living Constitution that should align the document to the spirit of the age and opinion polls and there are others like the late Justice Antonin Scalia who believed it was settled law and should be a guide for how the country is run. Which side are you on?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm on Scalia's side 100 percent. His death was a tremendous loss.
<Cal Thomas> <Negative> Hillary Clinton said last Thursday you can't be trusted with the nuclear codes and that your thin skin might touch off a war, if you felt a foreign leader insulted you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's the one who raised her hand for the war in Iraq and I'm the one who has been fighting it. I've been against it from the beginning, because I said it was going to destabilize the Middle East, which it has, and on top of everything, Iran is taking over Iraq. Lots of bad things are happening. I'm the one who didn't want to go into Iraq. (Clinton) is the one who has a terrible temperament. Number one, she's weak. Number two, she has a hair trigger and it's just the opposite with me. I have a strong temperament, but our country needs a strong temperament. You have people chopping off heads of Christians and others. Not since medieval times has anyone seen anything like this. I couldn't have built the great companies I've built if I didn't have a strong temperament. And she's got a weak temperament. She's a weak person. I think she would make a horrible president.
<Cal Thomas> <Positive> The Rev. Billy Graham once told me that he kept people around him who would say, 'You're not as great as people think you are.' They helped keep him centered. Do you have people like that, and would you in the White House? Who would tell you what they think, even if it goes against what you think?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do have that, including members of my family. I believe in that.
<Cal Thomas> <Neutral> Talk to me about power. You have power over your employees, but the presidency is something quite different. How would you handle that kind of power?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> While there are differences, there are similarities in terms of cost-cutting and many other things, but you also have to be talking about heart. You need heart. You can't do the same things in government that you do in a company. Every decision in government is so important, especially when it comes to the military where thousands of people can lose their lives. I would need to display great restraint, but we've got to have toughness. Other people have to understand where we are coming from, including our allies. Our allies have taken advantage of us.
<Cal Thomas> <Neutral> As president, what would be your first executive orders?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> My first would be to get rid of a lot of the executive orders, especially on the border where President Obama wants people to pour through like we're Swiss cheese. I would countermand those orders. Our country must have borders. Second, I would immediately start working on the military. We have to build up our depleted military. And I would start working on repealing and replacing Obamacare.
<Cal Thomas> <Negative> In Michelle Obama's commencement address at the City College of New York, there was a veiled criticism of you and your supporters. She said, 'They seem to believe diversity is a threat to be contained rather than a resource to be tapped. They tell us to be afraid of those who are different and suspicious of those with whom we disagree. They act as if name-calling is an acceptable substitute for debate, as if anger and intolerance should be our default state, rather than the optimism and openness that have always been the engine of our progress.'
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think I have more optimism than they do and I think I have a better vision for the country than they do and I think it's a nasty statement. In actuality, it doesn't pertain to me.
<Cal Thomas> <Negative> Every president has called upon God at some point. Lincoln spoke of not being able to hold the office of the presidency without spending time on his knees. You have confessed that you are a Christian …
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I have also won much evangelical support.
<Cal Thomas> <Positive> Yes, I know that. You have said you never felt the need to ask for God's forgiveness, and yet repentance for one's sins is a precondition to salvation. I ask you the question Jesus asked of Peter: Who do you say He is?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will be asking for forgiveness, but hopefully I won't have to be asking for much forgiveness. As you know, I am Presbyterian and Protestant. I've had great relationships and developed even greater relationships with ministers. We have tremendous support from the clergy. I think I will be doing very well during the election with evangelicals and with Christians. In the Middle East — and this is prior to the migration — you had almost no chance of coming into the United States. Christians from Syria, of which there were many, many of their heads … chopped off. If you were a Muslim from Syria, it was one of the easiest places to come in (to the U.S.). I thought that was deplorable. I'm going to treat my religion, which is Christian, with great respect and care.
<Cal Thomas> <Neutral> Who do you say Jesus is?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Jesus to me is somebody I can think about for security and confidence. Somebody I can revere in terms of bravery and in terms of courage and, because I consider the Christian religion so important, somebody I can totally rely on in my own mind.
