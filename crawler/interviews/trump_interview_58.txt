<Ann Curry> <Positive> Today we wrap up our Father's Day series with a look at Donald Trump. The real estate mogul followed in his father's footsteps, and now years later, the billionaire businessman is passing on the lessons he's learned to his son, the Donald Jr. Matt has their story.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Real estate mogul Donald Trump is the second generation of developers in his family. His father Fred Trump became a success building affordable housing and passed his love of the business along to Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I had a wonderful father. He was a builder in Brooklyn and Queens. And -- and he was just a great guy, and he was my best friend, and I learned a lot from him.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Trump not only learned the bricks and mortar of his father's business, but also how to succeed. And from an early age, he set his sights high.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> So your way of stepping out from you father's footsteps or getting out from his coattail...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, yeah, to do taller and bigger and better and all of that.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> He's considered the largest developer in New York, with his empire also expanding into six other states, ranging from condos to casinos. His estimated worth, $2 billion.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You won $6400. That's not very nice.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> And the lessons Trump learned from his father are now being passed to the next generation. The oldest of his four children, Donald Trump, Jr., has decided to follow in his father's footsteps.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> It would be nice to bring a couple of real big deals to the table just to have done it and really earn your stripes and get out from that under that cloud that everything's spoon-fed to you for your whole life.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Donald Jr., or Don as he likes to be called, graduated with a business degree in 2000 from his father's alma mater, the prestigious Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he did well, which was important. And important even to me, because at least I have an intelligent person here. I'm not, you know, dealing with a total dummy. And so it was, you know, that reaffirmed that my son has a good brain, which is not so bad.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> When you started to hear about Don's interest in the business, what were your thoughts?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I wasn't sure if he was going to be going into the business. I wasn't sure if he liked the business. He was a person and still is a person that loves the outdoors. He could go and live in a tent in Colorado, and be extremely happy.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> And they kind of thought I'd go off and be a ski bum or a fly fishing guide somewhere.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Your dad was driven. I mean, le -- you know, let's ma -- let's face it here, Donald Trump was off taking care of business a lot.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> Yeah.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> So how close a relationship did you two have?
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Negative> It might not have been a conventional father-son relationship, but we spent a lot of time going to sports games, etc. A lot of time was spent on construction sites walking around.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Tell me about those -- those walkarounds at construction sites.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Negative> For me it was at times tedious because you're six years old walking around, and he's very, very detail-oriented, so that light bulb is missing, this, you know, pick up those nails, clean it up.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Negative> Would you rather we claim the north corner with this, or would you rather bring in the south corner?
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Now 25, Donald Trump Jr. is reaching for the sky with his first major development: converting the historic 32-story Hotel Del Monaco on the exclusive corner of 59th Street and Park Avenue in New York, into the Trump Park Avenue luxury condominiums. Don, do you -- you look out at this space here and -- and one day do you hope to be able to stand here and say, 'That's mine, that's mine, that's mine'?
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> Yeah.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> That's the...
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> It'd be nice.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> ...dream?
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> That would be nice. It'd certainly be nice.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> You must have, Donald, hopes and dreams for Don. You know, when -- when you -- you talked about when your dad was so successful that you knew that the only way you would get out from under his coattail would be strike out on your own. So what are your dreams, and what are your thoughts for Don?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, I've taken a lot of risks to get here, and I don't think that Donald or my other children should take those risks. You have fathers, and I've seen it over the years, where they're jealous of their sons' success, and those people are idiots as far as I'm concerned.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Most people know a lot about your dad, OK, and you can go with whatever reputation you want, Don. But he is someone who's known to be in the spotlight...
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> Yes.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> ...a lot. From what I've heard about you, that's not your style at all.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Negative> No, not so much. I think I spent most of my life actually trying to avoid that.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Would you avoid saying to someone, 'I'm Donald Trump, Jr.' if you could possibly avoid it?
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> I always do. I pretty much introduce myself with my first name. It's just Don.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> I'm Don. And you called a restaurant one night...
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> Yeah.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> ...I think, and made a reservation.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> Yeah. I called a certain restaurant, which will remain unnamed, and left just Don for the reservation. They're -- they're, 'Well, we need a full name,' etc., so I gave them the full name. A couple minutes later got a call back from the manager saying there is no Donald Trump Jr. I proceeded to tell them, I guess, that they were mistaken, and they never went for it.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> You never went...
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Negative> Nope.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> ...to the restaurant, I'm sure.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Negative> I never went back.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> A lot of people would be extremely proud to say I'm Donald Trump, Jr.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> I'm definitely proud of it. There's no question about it. And yet I'd rather take -- have people take me for what I am and not with some sort of preconceived notions of what I am supposed to be or may be.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Let me give you some adjectives that describe your dad, and you tell me if you share these same traits. Competitive.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> Definitely.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Very competitive?
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Neutral> I'd say so.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Driven.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> Yes.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> What do you bang heads about most often?
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> Well, again, the fixtures, what happens to be maybe popular that day or what happens to be more Park Avenue than what works in Trump Tower.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Last descriptive term to describe your dad: ladies' man.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> I think he likes to think so.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's it.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Yeah. There's the interview, over.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Negative> Now I'm in trouble.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Negative> I just got fired, Matt, just so you know.
<Ann Curry> <Negative> And up next, one member of the Kennedy family on her fight to stop the spread of AIDS. But first these messages.
