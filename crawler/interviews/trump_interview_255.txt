<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So were you at Trump International Golf Links? Were you there? Did you go there?
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> I did.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh good. Did you see Sarah Malone?
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> You know what, I did not see her but we had a long phone conversation after I got back. We talked for about an hour on the phone.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. You know, it's a tremendous place. Did you get a tour of the place at least? I hope?
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> I did. Of course, of course.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good, because that's important, that you see the quality. You know, a lot of people are saying that it's the single greatest golf course ever built. They're also saying that it's the best modern — I am sure you have some magazine articles and things.
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> Of course.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So one of the very important things: We say modern, modern being from 1960. It's a great place. It's going to be great. But you know, the big play there, the big play will be building — someday, I'm not looking to do it now, especially, I'm not looking to do it — but you know we have a very big play to build, you know, thousands of houses, houses on the site. Because, it's, you know, it's a massive site, on the North Sea, and I'll be building — let me put it this way: Maybe I won't do it but maybe my children will do it. But we're zoned. It's a great place. It's the oil capital. I don't know if you noticed at the airport, more helicopters are there than at any airport in the world because they go out to the oil rigs, and it's the oil capital of Europe. And it's a great, you know, it's a great place, it's a whole great thing. But it's also a future very, very big development play, if I want to do that.
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> So it seems like this project has been perhaps more personal to you than other projects, especially during the recession.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, this one — well, my mother was born in Scotland and, you know, golf is a very big game, it's a great game, all of the people you write about love golf — it's crazy. But I wanted to build something great in Europe, ideally in Scotland, and then it turned out I got Turnberry, which is where they had the British Open for years, you know, which is one of the great — I don't know if you got to visit that. And I also have Doonbeg, which is in Ireland, which I bought during the Ireland depression, you know when things were very low and now it has become — it's 500 acres on the Atlantic Ocean. So I actually have three —
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> And originally you were only going to have
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes? What?
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> Originally you were only going to have one in Europe, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I really was. What happened, a couple of things: I did this and everyone said you'd never get it zoned. And it's zoned for two golf courses, if I want to do the second one, but two golf courses, and it's zoned for thousands of houses. You know, units and houses, the houses. But I'm not in a rush to build the houses because, to be honest with you, I have plenty of houses. Plenty of other sites. But this was a special site. This is consider the largest dunes anywhere in the world. It was very tough zoning because it was a site of scientific interest, it's called SSI. And everybody when I bought it — I bought it for the right price, I bought it for a very low price because you couldn't do anything with it. And the owner, who is a very good guy, felt you couldn't do — nobody thought you could do anything with it. In theory, you weren't even supposed to walk on the dunes, let alone build a golf course through the dunes, and what happened is I took a chance, I bought it and — no options, no nothing, just bought it for cash, no mortgage, no debt, no nothing — I don't have debt on any of them, I don't have debt on very much, period. But what happened is I bought it, and I applied for the course. I landed, I applied for the course, I hired Dr. Martin Hawtree, who is the preeminent — he does St. Andrews. I went to the Royal and Ancient — you know, that's the governing body in Europe — and I went to the Royal and Ancient, spoke to Peter Dawson, who is the head of Royal and Ancient, and I said: Who would be the best architect to use. And they said: Well, the greatest in the world for links golf — and he knew the site because he was born in Aberdeen — is Dr. Martin Hawtree. And I met him, we liked him, we came to a — you know, we walked the site a number of times. We built a course that turned out to be an incredible course. Now, in between seeing and building it, we went through a tremendous amount of legal and everything else because to break the site of scientific interest was a very hard thing to do, it has never been done before.
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> Well, and one of the reasons that they did it is because they felt like the economic benefits to the area outweighed the environmental protections but —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right, well, what they did, what they did — you're right — what they did is, and I've wanted to do this as an artistic thing, and you saw what I mean about the land. There's no piece of land like this in the world, no matter where you go in the world. And the largest dunes in the world, it's in Scotland, it's on the North Sea — you know, every hole has a view of the North Sea, as you see. And, you know, when you look at the 18th hole and the 14th hole, I don't know if you remember the 14th? So anyways, so what happened is, I built it, and then they had this idea to build windmills, and I said: I don't want windmills. I don't want to have windmills. And they said: Well, we want to have them. And what happened is, you know, we've been in litigation for years, and now, in all fairness, the windmills no longer work. They don't work with 35 dollar oil. They didn't work at 100 dollar oil, you know, they're very expensive, and they're not going to work. And the company that was doing them is pretty much out of business, so they'll never get built. But I've been in court with them for years — not a big deal, but I've been in court with them for years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I accomplished my goal, and my golf course is built. It's doing really well. It's, you know, people travel from all over the world to get there. And at some point I'll build thousands of units of housing, meaning my company will. You know, I'm not going to do it. After —
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> Well, and —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Jenna, after what I am doing now, it's like [chuckles] I don't think I'll be doing that.
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> When do you think —
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, go ahead.
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> When do you think that's going to happen because originally the plan was two golf courses, 450 hotel rooms, at least 1,000 homes and six or seven thousand jobs. And the project hasn't hit those yet.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I stopped it. I mean, the project is beautiful. It's like — the road, I built the roadway in, which was a very big thing. I built the course, which is sort of like the anchor tenant, if you think of it, you know. If you think of it, it's like the anchor tenant. I built it, and it's a world-championship course, it has been reviewed as one of the best in the world. So you have the roadway. You have everything done. I built the clubhouse, that's totally complete, you saw that, and now I have all of the sites ready for housing whenever I want to build them. But, you know, I'm not going to build them now because, well — and then I held it up because of the wind, you know, because of the windmills, because I didn't want them. I held it up because of the windmills because I didn't want to be staring at windmills, and now I won't be staring at windmills, and at some point, we'll go forward, and we'll do the rest of the job. But I'm in no rush, frankly, to do it. I did want to do, I did want to do this great golf course because there's no piece of land like it in the world and —
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> But don't you owe it to the Scottish people to fulfill this promise of 6,000 jobs and of pumping all of that money —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'll be doing that. Well, you have to understand. First of all, a couple of things happened. They came in, and they wanted to put the windmills up — you understand that — and I want a commitment that they're not going to build the windmills. And I've said that: I want a commitment that they're not going to build the windmills. Because I don't want to build and then find out that they're building the windmills. Now, they never told me that, and, you know, I've delayed them for many years, and they don't make economic sense any more anyway. They're not going to get built, but I wanted a commitment that they're not going to build the windmills. And that was the reason that I didn't finish it out. Then, of course, you had the oil reduction, you had the oil price go down, so that had an impact on the area, so I wouldn't want to be building units with the lower oil prices. And at some point it goes up, but, you know it's not — so I'm zoned for thousands of units. I can start whenever I want, and I'll start it when I want. But what I wanted to do there is I wanted to build the world's greatest golf course, which I built.
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> Right, but —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, did you get the reviews and everything? You probably saw Golf Week rated it at number one on the list. It's rated number one, number three in the world, number two in the world, number one. I mean, it's a phenomenal place.
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> And I wanted to follow up: You had mentioned that there's no debt on this but I had seen in some of your filings with the Scottish government that the development seems to be losing money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's only because it's under development now — in other words, I'm doing roads, I'm doing pipes, I'm all sorts of things. View the golf course like an anchor tenant, and the golf course does very well. It's doing great, actually. People are coming from all over the world to play it. But it's really under development, you know, the whole thing is under development. In fact, at some point we're going to build a ballroom. Hold it, Jenna, one second.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hey Jenna, can I call you back? That's Reince. You know Reince, right?
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> I sure do. I sure do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So let me call you back. So it's been a tremendous, it's been a tremendous development. And, you know, at some time my kids will or the company maybe will build the houses or whatever. But that's it. Why don't I call you back later, or I'll call you tomorrow and finish it up. Is that okay?
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> Yeah, that would be great. I would appreciate that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, honey. Thanks so much.
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> Thanks so much. Bye.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay, bye.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Interview Resumes May 13, 2016] Okay, let's go, let's talk. What do you want to talk about, Aberdeen?
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> Yeah, a little bit more about that. One question that I had was when was the last time that you visited Aberdeen?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I visited a lot but now since the presidential, I haven't. As you know, Turnberry — I'm thinking about, you know, it's under construction now but it's opening in June, and I was wondering if I should go over and cut the ribbon. Give me advice. I was wondering: Should I go over and cut the ribbon? You know, we've rebuilt the big building, it's a big hotel project and its got the great courses of the world, also, it's got a course that was a four-time Open Championship. You know, formally the British Open.
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> Correct.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the question is: Should I go there in June. What do you think? Would you go there if you were me and under my circumstance? Or no? You know this stuff better than I do.
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> Oh, I'm not going to advise you. But I had heard that the Open is not going to be held at Turnberry. That the Open board decided…
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, no. No, no, that's false. Who told you that? That's absolutely false.
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> Okay. Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Where did you hear that?
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> It has been reported that board members have said that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it doesn't matter what — absolutely not. The Royal and Ancient, we worked very closely together to rebuild Turnberry, the championship course and it's totally — yup, it will be there. It's totally, it's one of the rotas — you know, it's in the rotas, the system.
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, you're talking — By the way, don't write that because it's totally false.
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In fact, we worked with the Royal and Ancient on, you know, we lengthened and modernized Turnberry and, you know, moved some holes out into the ocean, that was all done under the auspices of the Royal and Ancient — they're the ones that have the Open championship.
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> Okay, got it. So —
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I'm glad you brought that up.
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There was one report, which was a totally false report about that — no, that was wrong. Okay?
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> Okay. And when it comes to the Aberdeen golf course and development, the basic accusation that I hear from some Scottish leaders and people in Scotland is that they feel like you and your team never took the time to fully research the project or understand their laws and that you kind of bullied your way into getting things done and that now that we're a few years out —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By the way, when did I speak to you last? Tell me. When was it?
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> It was Wednesday, Wednesday night for a few minutes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That was Wednesday. Okay. All right, good. So go ahead because, you know, one thing happened that I just wanted to know. We spoke when? Wednesday?
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> Yes, on Wednesday.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay, so go ahead. I what? I bullied my way?
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> Yeah, and that they feel like they made some changes that they wouldn't normally have done but they did so on the promise that this project was going to be finished, and they feel like you've let them down, that you have not —
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I will tell you what I have done, Jenna: I've built one of the great golf courses anywhere in the world, I think you see that, right? I don't know if you do or not, but I hope you do because that's part of the reason I'm talking to you. You saw the ratings that we've gotten, right? I think, have you?
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> Yes, yes I have.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People have given you and some people consider it the No. 1 modern, you know, new course in the world — new being defined, as I told you, from 1960. That's called 'new' in the world of golf.
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> Right, right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But what I've done there is incredible. I built one of the great golf courses of the world, it's bringing tremendous tourism. Many other clubs are doing much better because of it. If you look at Royal Aberdeen and if you call the people at Royal Aberdeen. And if you call the people at Cruden Bay, which is another club that's fairly nearby. They say their business is way, way up because of what I built and it's been great. Now, because of the wind mills, I said I'm not going to — I told you this — but because of the windmills, I said I'm not going to proceed until such time as the windmills aren't going to be built. The windmills will never be built because the economics are even worse now than they were before, and they're old fashioned, and they're not working, and you know etc. And you know I've been in court for five years with them, and the wind mills will never get built because, you know, once the price of oil went down — by the way, the windmills didn't work at a hundred, at a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel, the windmills didn't work. At 100 dollars a barrel they didn't work but now it's down to 30 dollars a barrel. And they really don't work. You understand: A lot of it has to do with the price of oil.
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So the windmills won't get built and, you know, frankly, I can start that job — oh by the way, just so you know, I built the maintenance facilities, I built the roadway in and the roadway is like a highway — you drove down the road, didn't you?
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> Yeah, I sure did. Yup.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, so you se the road, it's like a highway. I built the road going down to the ocean. I built the clubhouse, I built the course. The rest of it is residential and we've already started the hotel because the hotel is part of the castle. I rebuilt, you know, I totally rebuilt the castle. Did you go in the castle?
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> I did, I did.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> McLeod House. And now what we're doing is we're going to be doing an expansion of McLeod House, in other words the concept has changed, much for the better. You know, as you own land, you get to know the land better and what works better. So the concept of what we're doing is now that we're expanding — in fact, we're in for approvals, but we're expanding McLeod House. We're doing nicely there and we're expanding it, as opposed to building something away from it. And I don't know if you saw — did you see plan for the expansion?
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> Yes, I did. Yup.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. And the ballroom and everything? Right?
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> Yup.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay.
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> Building out on either side.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And in addition to that, we'll build thousands of houses. So, and we'll continue to expand the hotel. You know, we're expanding — we can expand it very nicely. The project has been, it's an amazing project, and it's, you know, the big money in the project is to build the houses, I'll build the houses for the people that want to buy houses and apartments. But, you know, I just haven't until recently, I haven't wanted to do that because of the windmills. Now, the windmills won't get built. So at some point we'll do that. But, in the meantime, I'm running for president, Jenna. You know?
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, in all fairness, right now it's not exactly top of my mind because I'm running for president. But what I've done is made the land incredible. I mean, when you looked at the land originally, you know, it was a vast piece of land of 1,400 acres on the North Sea. Now it's a piece of land that's fully sculpted, it's beautiful, it's ready, and I can go any time I want. I just choose not to build now and one of the primary reasons is because I'm running for president.
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> Okay, got it. Along those lines…
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I've done, Jenna, a fantastic — I've built one of the great golf courses in the world. Now, the clubhouse is finished. You saw the clubhouse, I guess? Right?
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> Yes, I did.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Clubhouse is finished. The course is finished. The maintenance facility is finished. And McLeod House, which was a castle, built in the year 1401 was totally rebuilt and made magnificent and doing very well.
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> And then another question I have is that I've noticed at a lot of your rallies — on t-shirts, on buttons, in things that people are shouting — a lot of your supporters are calling Hillary Clinton a bitch.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're what? They're calling her what?
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> A bitch.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A bitch? No, I haven't heard that.
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> Yeah, I mean, there are t-shirts at the rallies and the back of the t-shirt says: "Trump that bitch." There's a popular button —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, that I have not seen. No, I don't like that. I have not seen it, though, Jenna. How often do you go? Do you go to a lot of my speeches?
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> Almost every single one, and I see it more and more.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's getting better and better?
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> Is that an appropriate word for your fans to be using?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have not heard that. I don't like that. But I have not heard that. I would not be happy if I heard it. No, I have not heard it. Did you see that the crowds are getting bigger and bigger?
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> Where are you going next? How come we haven't had a rally?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why doesn't the press tell the, why doesn't the press — for instance, I have the biggest crowds. You saw Washington, you saw all of these places.
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> Of course.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why does the press not show the crowds?
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> We do. I tweet out a photo of the crowd at every single rally.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Actually, you do. You've had a couple of the best photos — you're a good photographer, come to think of it. But I'm talking about generally speaking, like when I talk to people that watch the speech on television, they don't see the magnitude of what I'm doing. Because they don't show the crowds. You know what I mean?
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> Sure, sure. One other thing that has been in the news a lot this week is that it seems like on some issues, you tend to take what feels like more than one position. And I understand that you're open to negotiating, you're open to eventually doing whatever's going to be right at that time, but I think a lot of your supporters look at your different comments and they kind of pick and choose what they want to believe. Is that going to become a problem when you need to govern? And pick one stance?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I don't think so, I don't think so, I mean I feel that I'm very consistent but you must have flexibility. You can't just go — if you have a position, that doesn't mean that there is not a better alternative, and you can't have — I've dealt with people over the years that are totally inflexible and they're never successful. You know, a lot of times things are subject to flexibility and change, and it doesn't mean — and you know, I'm very upfront with people and I will tell people, but I think i've been extremely, I think I've been steadfast in my beliefs, actually. But with all of that being said, sometimes there is flexibility. Sometimes you want to negotiate. Sometimes, you know, etc etc. But, you know, and as you know the crowds are becoming more and more enthusiastic and bigger and bigger.
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> Right, right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So, I don't know, it's been a — so you've been there for many of the rallies, right, Jenna?
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> You know, I actually counted how many press passes I have, and I have 64 press passes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How many?
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> 64.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, wow. Wow. Well, I hope you don't get bored then, hearing me, because I try to change them up as much as you can. But when you think about it, you know, there are six or seven or eight main subjects, right? So, you know, it's — and certain things I like talking about a certain way, because it makes the point, and many of these people, most of these people haven't heard it before, you know. But you know what I mean, because you followed other politicians and many of them will make the exact same speech every single time. I don't do that.
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> Hey, someone told me a story. Someone told me that you were at Mitt Romney's election night party when he lost and that you —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When he lost?
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> Yeah, when he lost.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, that's true.
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> And that you seemed very upset. Do you remember what was going through your mind that night?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was very upset or I was?
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> You were, that you were.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, no, I was upset, because he should have won. I thought that he should have won that election — I mean, I know that he should have won that election. Had he asked me to go to Florida, you saw that I beat Rubio in a landslide, right? Had he asked me to go to Florida, like he should have, he would have won Florida. And you know, it was bad. They made a lot of errors, they made a lot of errors.
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> Do you remember talking to people at that party and what some of the things you were saying that night?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I was just like everybody else. I was watching it. I heard — I mean, it was too bad but I didn't run, it wasn't me that was running. Had they used me in a few of the states that he lost, he would have won those states. But they didn't do that. They used me in the primaries in five states — every single state that he used me, I won. I made speeches and I did robocalls. Every single state he won. In the general, they didn't use me — which was fine with me, I'm busy, you know, I'm always busy. But they didn't use my services and they should have and I would have won. I tell ya: I would have won Florida and that would have won him the election if he won Florida. But I would have done great there, I would have done great in Pennsylvania, you know, places he lost, we could have won. But they chose not to use my services — which was fine with me because I'm very busy, you know. But I was invited to the party and I felt that it was too bad. This was a great opportunity to win. [Trump transitions to talking about the general election and Hillary Clinton]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's going to be interesting, right? You saw the polls come out where I am leading now in many cases, right? We've — it's come a long way from June 16, right?
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> Yeah. What's the challenge for you? Is there something that you need to do to make sure that you beat her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think, I think that consistency in the message is very important: Make America Great Again. Bring our jobs back. Make good trade deals. Build up our military.
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> Do you think you haven't been consistent?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very important, Jenna, is the borders. Very, very important. You know the story, I just got endorsed by the border patrol, which they've never done before. 16,500 people, they've never done it before but they believe in me — So I think that's a message that has been very good for me and she'll be terrible on the message. Look at what she did with the miners in West Virginia, she said she's going to put them out of work. Not exactly the right message in West Virginia or anywhere else, frankly. So, treat me fairly, okay? Aberdeen is an incredible diamond, it's a jewel, it's like owning one of the great paintings of the world, but much better. And Turnberry will open in about two months and I think it's going to be a tremendous success and I did it in conjunction with the Royal and Ancient… But Turnberry is going to be incredible. it opens in two months. And it will be great. I have Eric Trump running it. Okay, you take care of yourself. Treat me fairly. Have a good time.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> And joining us now is the Republican front-runner, Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, thanks for joining us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> So, big endorsement for you from New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. During the campaign, he had some tough words for you. Do you think he was just playing politics back then? How did you get him on board?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it is politics. I mean, people say things, and then, all of a sudden, reality sets in.  And he's great. He's a great guy. He's the one endorsement I really wanted. I wanted it badly. We have some great endorsements, but Christie is one that I really wanted to get. And I have many others coming, frankly, but, you know, endorsements have never meant that much to me, but that is an endorsement that was good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I love our endorsements. We have Sarah Palin. We have, as you know, Jerry Falwell Jr. And you see I'm leading with the evangelicals in just about every state and nationwide. And Jerry's helped so much. And, you know, we have -- as an example, we have Joe on the border in Arizona, Sheriff Joe. And Joe Arpaio, there's nobody better for borders than Sheriff Joe.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, that was a big endorsement too. So, we have some great endorsements, and a lot of them are coming.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> I know you're big on Twitter.  The hashtag -- #neverTrump hashtag exploded on Twitter this weekend. These are Republicans saying they will never vote for you. Marco Rubio himself even used that hashtag. What do you think of that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he can do whatever he wants. You know, I signed a pledge. And the pledge is a two-way street.  And if it's not that way, you're going to have a big problem. They're going to have a big problem with me. We have tremendous amounts of people. We have -- as you know, you know, I'm going to Alabama today.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to have 25,000 people and probably more than that.  We had to go to a football stadium because no building held it. And we're going to have an amazing crowd. And yesterday in Tennessee, I had 15,000 people in a hangar. In Arkansas, you probably saw that one in the morning. In Arkansas, we had about 15,000 people in a hangar.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, you know, we have a lot of people. I'm representing people. I'm not representing myself. I'm representing a lot of anger out there, and there's -- we're not angry people, but we're angry at the way this country's being run. And a lot of them are angry -- angry at the way the Republican Party is being run, Jake.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> Yes, I want to ask you about...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the Republican Party is not being run properly.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> I want to ask you about that, because Republicans in Washington, D.C., are starting to tell Republican senators that they don't have to go to the convention if you're the nominee, that they should think about running against you if you're the nominee.  That, combined with Marco Rubio doing the #neverTrump hashtag, do you think Republicans are violating the pledge?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Totally. Totally.  I mean, if they want to play that game, I can play it much better than they can. And I have a lot more people than they do -- and, you know, totally. If they're doing that, that's a total violation of the pledge, yes.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> Yesterday, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz released summaries of their tax returns. You have yet to do so. Rubio and Cruz have been saying that you're trying to hide something, Cruz yesterday also going on this little tirade, saying that maybe the returns show that you're not as rich as you say you are or that you gave money to Planned Parenthood or you pay very low tax rates.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> Can you deny that those charges are true, and when will we see your taxes?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, number one, I fully disclosed my financials. And I put them in actually right on time. And nobody else did, by the way, but I put them in on time.  And it's almost 100 pages of financials. And it shows over $10 billion. If you figure it out, it's over $10 billion in net worth. And it's an amazing company with great cash flow, very little debt, all of that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You can't tell anything from tax returns, because you take deductions, massive deductions and lots of other things. And you can't tell very much from a tax return. You really can't tell anything as to that.  As far as gifts, I give a lot of money. I could probably release a lot of the gifts that I have given over the years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I probably will do that some time next week. We will just make a listing of the various monies that I have paid for two charities. And I think that's a good idea, actually.  But I can't release tax returns when there's an audit. Now, it's very unfair. I have been treated very unfairly by the IRS, because I have been audited almost every year for 10 or 12 years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I have friends that are very rich people. They never get audited.  And so I think I have been really singled out. I don't know why I'm singled out, maybe because I'm a -- very conservative, maybe because I'm Tea Party. I feel Tea Party. I have always been sort of that feeling of Tea Party. I have always had great Tea Party support.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know what it is, but I have been singled out.  And so many of my friends, they don't even know what I'm talking about. When I say, "Do you get audited?" they don't know what I'm talking about. And I'm audited every year. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, until the audit is completed, obviously, I'm not giving my papers.  And you had people on your show and on CNN with -- tax experts said, no, it would be crazy to give papers before the audit is completed.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> I don't know if you saw Cruz's charges, but can you deny the charges he made about you not having the worth that you have or you have given a lot of money to groups that support abortion?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Jake, I just -- I just told you. And let Cruz go -- let Cruz go to the FEC, where I made a financial disclosure, unlike him, where he did not disclose that he borrowed money from Goldman Sachs, a million dollars between Citibank and Goldman Sachs.  He didn't disclose it, illegally didn't disclose it on his financial disclosure forms.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, Cruz shouldn't be the one talking, because he didn't disclose his loans. And he made big loans from big institutions, Goldman Sachs and Citi, and he never, ever mentioned them in his financial disclosure form, because he wants to talk like Robin Hood, you know, like he's Robin Hood, and he's going to help the people with the banks.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, in the meantime, he's borrowing money at very, very low interest rates, rates that nobody can get. And I think it's disgraceful. And then he tells me.  So, just -- just to finish, I have fully disclosed my net worth. And all you have to do is go and check my financial statements, because I fully disclosed my financial statements, and that was a big deal, and they're very good.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, obviously, you would have heard about it if they weren't, because they have been gone over by everybody.  As far as the tax returns, I obviously cannot give tax returns that are under audit. And every expert that you have had on your show said you shouldn't do it. You should wait until the audit is over.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> I want to ask you about the Anti-Defamation League, which this week called on you to publicly condemn unequivocally the racism of former KKK grand wizard David Duke, who recently said that voting against you at this point would be treason to your heritage.  Will you unequivocally condemn David Duke and say that you don't want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, just so you understand, I don't know anything about David Duke. OK? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don't know.  I don't know, did he endorse me or what's going on, because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And so you're asking me a question that I'm supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing about.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> But I guess the question from the Anti-Defamation League is, even if you don't know about their endorsement, there are these groups and individuals endorsing you. Would you just say unequivocally you condemn them and you don't want their support?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I have to look at the group. I mean, I don't know what group you're talking about.  You wouldn't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about. I would have to look. If you would send me a list of the groups, I will do research on them. And, certainly, I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> The Ku Klux Klan?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you may have groups in there that are totally fine, and it would be very unfair. So, give me a list of the groups, and I will let you know.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> OK. I mean, I'm just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here, but...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know any -- honestly, I don't know David Duke. I don't believe I have ever met him. I'm pretty sure I didn't meet him. And I just don't know anything about him.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> All right.  In terms of a potential running mate, sir, you said a few days ago that you would look for a political insider to help you get legislation through.  Are you specifically looking for someone with government experience in general, such as a Governor Chris Christie, or someone who has spent years on Capitol Hill such as Governor John Kasich?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have a great business ability. I have always had a great business ability. And I built a great company.  And I don't need that, really, I don't believe, for what I'm doing. I would want somebody that can -- you know, that does have a little bit of an insider track, so we can get things through Congress.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He can work -- he or she can work with me on getting, you know, papers filed, papers approved, so we don't have to use executive orders, like President Obama is always using his executive orders because he can't get -- he just can't get anything approved. He can't get anything through.  So, I would like the idea -- I mean, just conceptually -- it doesn't mean I'm going to do that, but, conceptually, I like the idea of a political person to go along with my abilities.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, I'm a very political person also, which people are just about starting to find out. But I would rather have, I think, somebody that's political that can help. But the most important position -- now, look, for vice president, you have got to pick somebody who's going to be a great president, because, if something should happen -- hopefully not -- but if something should happen, the single most important quality would be a person that can be a great president.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> All right, Donald J. Trump, thank you so much. Good luck on Tuesday, sir. We will see you on the campaign trail.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you very much, Jake.
