<Brooke Lennington> <Negative> [Voiceover] It started with a handshake.
<Brooke Lennington> <Positive> Welcome to Topeka, President Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nice to see you. Fantastic.
<Brooke Lennington> <Positive> You as well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Fantastic.
<Brooke Lennington> <Neutral> Brooke Lennington, KSNT News.
<Brooke Lennington> <Negative> [Inaudible] of course, a Kavanaugh-related question. What was your reaction when you found out?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I was so happy. He's so talented. He's a great scholar. Number one at Yale, number one at Yale Law School, and a terrific person. And what they put him through, the Democrats, it was horrible. And one of the reasons I chose him is that he was as good as you could ever find, from the family life, from every standpoint there was just -- and then they try to give this false narrative that was so terrible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, we're really happy. Nobody would have thought it would have been so difficult in his case. But the bottom line is we won, and he's going to be one of our great justices.
<Brooke Lennington> <Negative> [Inaudible] So can you tell me, why did you choose to come to Topeka, and what is it about these two political races in particular that kind of interest you to -- to decide side to come here?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Kris Kobach been with me from the beginning. He's been a fan of ours, and he's a big border person as you know, and he's very strong on law and order, protection, safety for the families, and for the communities. It's a very great thing, He'll be a great governor. And Steve Watkins has been great. He's going to be a fantastic Congressman.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hope -- I hope he goes out and wins. The person he's running against, I hear, is not too good. And he is going to be fantastic, and he'll back us. It's make America great again. So I'm here for Steve Watkins, and I'm here for Kris Kobach, and I think that we're going to have some great success.
<Brooke Lennington> <Negative> But you're not here for the barbecue. You're not sticking around for the barbecue?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd like to be for the barbecue. I know your barbecues. I've been -- I actually was here once for a barbecue, and it was pretty good. You know, it's a great state. I have so many friends in this state. It's a great state. And the crowd is phenomenal, I understand.
<Brooke Lennington> <Neutral> And as you know we have a lot of farmers out here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Brooke Lennington> <Negative> And I know...
<Brooke Lennington> <Neutral> [Voiceover] My next question was about the recently drafted USMCA trade deal, and how it would impact farmers in the Midwest.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, so we made a tremendous deal, as you know, and I don't know if other people are happy, in terms of Canada, Mexico, but I can tell you our people are really happy, and our farmers are really happy. We opened up the Canadian markets, opened up to Mexican markets, and, you know, the alternative was to put a lot of tariffs on the things that they had coming in, and we made a deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Our farmers are thrilled, as you know, it's gotten phenomenal reviews, and I love the farmers because they stuck with me. You know, you can't do it too fast. If you go too fast, it's like cooking a pie. You go too fast, it's not going to work out so well. And I said, just stay with me. We opened up the Canadian market, opened up the Mexican market.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're now working on China, and our farmers are going to do great, because our farmers have not done well over the last 15 years. You know, if you look at even soybeans, from five years before the election, they were cut in half. And now, as you know, people are starting to buy again, and it's going to be great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But another one that's coming along will come is going to be China. And then we're working with the EU, who basically have a barrier. We can't even sell into the EU. It's so unfair. They made $151 billion last year. So we're opening it all up for our farmers. Our farmers are going to be big beneficiaries, and they're really happy with the USMCA, which is the old NAFTA.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I refuse to use the name, because with such a bad deal for our country.
<Brooke Lennington> <Positive> And it sounds a lot like YMCA. So it's fitting. You can do the dance with it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It works. I heard the way you said it. [Laughs]
<Brooke Lennington> <Negative> Now, one thing. I do want to get to the viewer questions, because I know it means a lot to them. So Sloane Lewis wanted to know, what is one thing Americans can do to bridge this political divide?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, there's a lot of things that are very opposite. Usually some bad things happen, and everybody gets together. But I don't want to get it together that way. If you look at health insurance, we want great inexpensive health insurance. They want a single payer that's going to put the country out of business.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're going to have to double their taxes, triple their taxes, to pay. So, there are a lot of things. But I think what's happening -- people are loving our strong military, and all of it's made in the United States, the planes the jets, the rockets, everything. But we need it. You know in these times. They are loving our low taxes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And that means the other side is loving them. They're loving the less regulation. I think it's coming together. I think, you have politicians in Washington that exacerbate problems, and that causes problems. But we just had a tremendous victory, as you know, with Judge Kavanaugh. He's now a Justice of the Supreme Court.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that just took place a little while ago. In fact, in theory I shouldn't be in Kansas right now. I'm supposed to be back in Washington. But I said, there's no way I'm canceling. The tens of thousands of people, I guess, they have 11,000 people in the room. And there's a lot of people outside. So I think, if I would have said, by the way I'm going to cancel, Kansas wouldn't have liked me too much ,and that's not -- never going to happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Never going to happen. But I think -- I think we're going to get together. I think that as they see -- look, the economy is the best it's ever been in the history of our country. Unemployment numbers are the best they've ever been. If you look -- African-American, Asian, Hispanic, the numbers are the best they've ever been in the history of the United States, history of our country. And I think that's bringing people together.
<Brooke Lennington> <Positive> All right. Now this one, it was one of my favorites. Brett Mallon wanted to know what is the American dream, and to what extent is it achievable for all Americans?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think the American dream is really a great economy, where people can either start a business, small business, it becomes big, or get themselves a great job that they really love going to. That seems to be -- and have a great family, always. Always, number one. To me, always number one.
<Brooke Lennington> <Positive> Alright, and you're not sticking around for the barbecue, just to be clear?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll -- maybe. Maybe, if I'm invited by the right people, maybe.
<Brooke Lennington> <Negative> [Voiceover] And then it ended with a handshake.
<Brooke Lennington> <Positive> Alright, yeah, thanks, I appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great honor. Thank you very much.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Hello? Evelyn, Pick Up
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hello, Bob.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> President Trump, how are you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How are you? How are you doing? Okay?
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Real well. I'm turning on my tape recorder, with your permission.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, that's okay. That's okay. I don't mind that at all.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> I'm sorry we missed the opportunity to talk for the book.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I just spoke with Kellyanne and she asked me if I got a call. I never got a call. I never got a message. Who did you ask about speaking to me?
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Well, about six people.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They don't tell me.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> A senator. I talked to Kellyanne about it two and a half months ago.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> She came for lunch.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's too bad. Of course, you and I had a conversation a couple of years ago, and so that I think got you there a little bit. And we had a conversation many years ago, if you remember, in Trump Tower.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Yeah, I do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That has to be 20 years ago. And you were thinking about doing a book about me then, which is interesting. Who knew it would've been on this subject? Right? That was not in the cards at that time.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> That's right. Well, I'm sorry, I...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I still remember that.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> I spent a lot of time on this, talked to lots of people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right. Good.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> And as you know and are living, we are at a pivot point in history.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> And I would've liked to have done that, and I maximized my effort, and somehow it didn't get to you, or...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's really too bad, because nobody told me about it, and I would've loved to have spoken to you. You know I'm very open to you. I think you've always been fair. We'll see what happens. But all I can say is the country is doing very well. We're doing better economically just about than at any time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're doing better on unemployment maybe than ever. You know, I mean, if you look at the unemployment numbers, you've heard me say it. And we're doing better on unemployment than just about ever. We're having a lot of -- a lot of companies are moving back into our country, which would've been unheard of two years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If the other administration or representatives of it had kept going, had kept -- you know, if the other group had won, I will tell you, that you would have, I think you'd have a GDP of less than zero. I think we would've been going in the wrong direction. Because regulations are such a big part of what we've done, Bob.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Well, I understand that point of view. And as you know, it's also a difficult time where the political system and you and my business is being tested.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Yeah.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> I take it very seriously. I've done books on eight presidents, going back from Nixon to Obama.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> And I learned something about reporting, frankly, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> I've got to go talk to people and see them outside of the White House and outside of their offices, and gained a lot of insight and documentation. And it's -- you know, it's a tough look at the world and your administration and you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Well, I assume that means it's going to be a negative book. But you know, I'm some -- I'm sort of 50 percent used to that. [Laughter] That's all right. Some are good and some are bad. Sounds like this is going to be a bad one.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> It was a chance missed, and I don't know how things work over there in terms of...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very well. We...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> ...getting to you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, if you would call Madeleine [Westerhout] in my office ...Did you speak to Madeleine?
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> No, I didn't. But I...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Madeleine is the key. She's the secret. Because she's the person...
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Well, I talked to Raj about it. I talked to... I talked to Kellyanne.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, a lot of them are afraid to come and talk, or -- you know, they are busy. I'm busy. But I don't mind talking to you. I would've spoken to you. I spoke to you 20 years and I spoke to you a year and a half or two years ago.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> A couple of years ago, I understand.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I certainly don't mind talking to you, and I wish I could've spoken to you. But nobody called my office. I mean, you went through, I guess, different people...
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Well, Mr. President, how can I spend all this time talking to people and -- like Kellyanne and Raj and Republican senators?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Who were the senators? No, they never called me about it.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Senator Graham said he had talked to you about talking to me. Now, is that not true?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Senator Graham actually mentioned it quickly in one meeting.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Yes. Well, see. And then nothing happened.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That is true. That is true. Well, that -- no, but that is true. Mentioned it quickly, not like, you know, and I would certainly have thought that maybe you would've called the office. But that's okay. I'll speak to Kellyanne.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am a little surprised that she wouldn't have told me. In fact, she just walked in. [Off Microphone] I'm talking to Bob Woodward. He said that he told you.
<Kellyanne Conway> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> About speaking to me. But you never told me. Why didn't you tell me?
<Kellyanne Conway> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would've been very happy to speak to him. All right, so what are you going to do?
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Well...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I have another bad book coming out. Big deal.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> ...it goes on, and I... What you can count on is that I've been very careful. And Evelyn, are you on?
<Evelyn Duffy> <Positive> Yes.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Evelyn Duffy, who's my assistant, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hello, Evelyn.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> She transcribed all the tapes because, with permission, I taped people for hundreds of hours.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> And I think there's nothing in this book that doesn't come from a firsthand source. Is that correct, Evelyn?
<Evelyn Duffy> <Neutral> I believe that's --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But are you naming names? Or do you just say sources?
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Yeah, well, it names real incidents, so...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but do you name sources? I mean, are you naming the people, or just say, people have said?
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> I say, at 2:00 on this day, the following happened, and everyone who's there, including yourself, is quoted. And I'm sorry I didn't get to ask you about these...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, you do know I'm doing a great job for the country. You do know that NATO now is going to pay billions and billions of dollars more, as an example, than anybody thought possible, that other presidents were unable to get more? And it was heading downward
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You do know all of the things I've done and things that I'm doing? I'm in the process of making some of the greatest trade deals ever to be made. You do understand that stuff? I mean, I hope.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Certainly, I understand and I would've loved to go through a discussion with you about NATO, because this goes back to early in your administration and your concern about it, and the agreement that the countries have that they would increase their defense contribution, what is it, by the year 2024? And you know... So anyway, we are...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know last year, if you see the secretary, Stoltenberg, he said I believe $44 billion just last year, and that was from last year's meeting. And this year it's much more money they've agreed to put up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it's a tremendous amount of money. No other president has done it. It was heading down in the opposite direction. So I don't know if you're going to report it that way; probably not. But that's too bad, but that's all right, but you know, one of those things.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Everything is going to be factual. And it is not a good thing for my business, if I may say this to you, Mr. President, to the presidency, or to the country, to not have real, full exchanges on these. And I broke my spear on it trying to get to you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, other than Lindsey, who did quickly mention it, nobody mentioned it.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> You say Kellyanne's there, ask her.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody told me about it. Well, let me ask her. Why don't you speak to Kellyanne. Ask her. She never told me about it. [Conway picks up phone]
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Kellyanne?
<Kellyanne Conway> <Positive> Bob, how are you? Hi.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Hi. Remember two and a half months ago you came over and I laid out, I wanted to talk to the president? And you said you would get back to me?
<Kellyanne Conway> <Negative> I do. And I put in the request. But you know, they -- it was rejected. I can only take it so far. I guess I can bring it right to the president next time.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Yeah.
<Kellyanne Conway> <Negative> But I try to follow all the protocols, or else I'm accused of being somebody who doesn't follow protocol.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> President Trump, I just want you to know I made every effort.
<Kellyanne Conway> <Positive> But you had talked to Hope, right, who said no?
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Listen, I talked to anyone I could. [Laughs]
<Kellyanne Conway> <Negative> You talked to a number of people and they all said no?
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> I talked to Raj.
<Kellyanne Conway> <Neutral> Raj.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> He was going to work it out.
<Kellyanne Conway> <Positive> Hope. [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Off Microphone, inaudible]
<Kellyanne Conway> <Negative> I said you tried talking to everybody? What about when you interviewed, like, other people? They all said yes? That they'd try?
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Yeah, well, about six or seven people. I tried. And I couldn't have -- you and I spent a whole lunch on it, Kellyanne. And I said, I want to cover the substantive issues in foreign policy and domestic policy. And you said you would get back to me. Nothing.
<Kellyanne Conway> <Positive> Yeah. So, I did. I presented it to the people here who make those decisions, but...
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Who are the people?
<Kellyanne Conway> <Positive> But anyway, I'll give you back to the president. And I'm glad to hear that you tried through seven or eight different people. That's good. You should tell him all the names. [Laughs] Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you never called for me. It would've been nice, Bob, if you called for me, in my office. I mean, I have a secretary. I have two, three secretaries. If you would've called directly -- a lot of people are afraid ...Raj, I hardly have ...I don't speak to Raj.
<Bob Woodward> <Neutral> Kellyanne is a...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do, I do, and Kellyanne went to somebody, but she didn't come to me.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Well, does she have access to you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And she should've come to me. She does have access to me. Absolutely. She has direct access, but she didn't come to me. And you know what? That's okay. I'll just end up with another bad book. What can I tell you?
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> It's surprising to me that these people -- did Raj have access to you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not really, but he would've been able to do it. But I have an office. You have the office number. I have an office that's directly into my office.
<Kellyanne Conway> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It doesn't matter. Let me tell you what matters: The economy is the best it's been in many, many decades. And it's going to get a lot better. And the country is doing very well. That's what's important.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> Yes, sir. I thought I would...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're doing a good job.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> ...never kind of say, let's not talk about this because the book is done to a president...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I know.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> ...and, but that's the position we're in. And it's one I tried to avoid. You need to know I made maximum effort.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right. It's too bad.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> Yes, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm just hearing about it. And I heard -- I did hear from Lindsey, but I'm just hearing about it. So we're going to have a very inaccurate book, and that's too bad. But I don't blame you entirely.
<Bob Woodward> <Negative> No, it's [Inaudible] -- it's going to be accurate, I promise.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, okay. Well, accurate is that nobody's ever done a better job than I'm doing as president. That I can tell you. So that's ...And that's the way a lot of people feel that know what's going on, and you'll see that over the years. But a lot of people feel that, Bob.
<Bob Woodward> <Positive> I believe in our country, and because you're our president, I wish you good luck.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. Thank you very much, Bob. I appreciate it. Bye.
<The Economist> <Negative> The Economist: Could we start with the economy?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sure.
<The Economist> <Negative> What is Trumponomics and how does it differ from standard Republican economics?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well it's an interesting question. I don't think it's ever been asked quite that way. But it really has to do with self-respect as a nation. It has to do with trade deals that have to be fair, and somewhat reciprocal, if not fully reciprocal. And I think that's a word that you're going to see a lot of, because we need reciprocality in terms of our trade deals. We have nations where... they'll get as much as 100% of a tax or a tariff for a certain product and for the same product we get nothing, OK? It's very unfair. And the very interesting thing about that is that, if I said I'm going to put a tax on of 10%, the free-traders, somewhat foolishly, they'll say "Oh, he's not a free-trader", which I am, I'm absolutely a free-trader. I'm for open trade, free trade, but I also want smart trade and fair trade. But they'll say, "He's not a free-trader," at 10%. But if I say we're putting a reciprocal tax on, it may be 62% or it may be 47%, I mean massive numbers, and nobody can complain about it. It's really sort of an amazing thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So that's the story. It very much has to do with trade. We have so many bad trade deals. To a point where I'm not sure that we have any good trade deals. I don't know who the people are that would put us into a NAFTA, which was so one-sided. Both from the Canada standpoint and from the Mexico standpoint. So one-sided. Wilbur [Ross, the secretary of commerce] will tell you that, you know, like, at the court in Canada, we always lose. Well, the judges are three Canadians and two Americans. We always lose. But we're not going to lose any more. And so it's very, very unfair.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now at the same time I have a very good relationship with Justin [Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister] and a very good relationship with the president of Mexico. And I was going to terminate NAFTA last week, I was all set, meaning the six-month termination. I was going to send them a letter, then after six months, it's gone. But the word got out, they called and they said, we would really love to... they called separately but it was an amazing thing. They called separately ten minutes apart. I just put down the phone with the president of Mexico when the prime minister of Canada called. And they both asked almost identical questions. "We would like to know if it would be possible to negotiate as opposed to a termination." And I said, "Yes, it is. Absolutely." So, so we did that and we'll start.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have a problem because we have a ridiculous provision in NAFTA that we have, you know, to go on the fast track. Fast track is the slowest track I've ever seen. To go on the fast track you have to give notice. Well we gave notice 70 days ago. It's called a cooling-off period, OK? But that's not the way life works because when they call and they want to make a deal, I don't want to have to wait a hundred days. So I put the papers in almost 70 days ago, to get the approval for fast track in Congress. And they still haven't given me approval. And the reason they haven't is because our trade negotiator, who, as you know, the provision goes with your negotiator. It doesn't go from the time you put it in, it goes with your negotiator. So he just got approved. He'll be in sometime, I guess next week?
<Steve Mnuchin> <Positive> Yep, yep.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the clock starts ticking. But here you have two people calling saying, "Can we negotiate?" I say yes and I have to wait for a hundred days. I don't know what a hundred days is going to be like. What's it going to be like? So NAFTA's a horrible one-sided deal that's cost us millions and millions of jobs and cost us tens of billions of dollars.
<The Economist> <Positive> It sounds like you're imagining a pretty big renegotiation of NAFTA. What would a fair NAFTA look like?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Big isn't a good enough word. Massive.
<The Economist> <Neutral> Huge?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's got to be. It's got to be.
<The Economist> <Neutral> What would it look like? What would a fair NAFTA look like?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's gotta be. Otherwise we're terminating NAFTA.
<The Economist> <Neutral> What would a fair NAFTA look like?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was all set to terminate, you know? And this wasn't like... this wasn't a game I was playing. I'm not playing... you know, I wasn't playing chess or poker or anything else. This was, I was, I'd never even thought about... it's always the best when you really feel this way. But I was... I had no thought of anything else, and these two guys will tell you, I had no thought of anything else but termination. But because of my relationship with both of them, I said, I would like to give that a try too, that's fine. I mean, out of respect for them. It would've been very disrespectful to Mexico and Canada had I said, "I will not."
<The Economist> <Negative> But Mr. President, what has to change for you not to withdraw?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to be able to make fair deals. Right now the United States has a 70Ñalmost a $70 billion trade deficit with Mexico. And it has about a $15 billion dollar trade deficit with Canada. The timber coming in from Canada, they've been negotiating for 35 years. And it's been... it's been terrible for the United States. You know, it's just, it's just been terrible. They've never been able to make it.
<The Economist> <Negative> Does that $70 billion deficit have to come to zero to be fair?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not necessarily. And certainly it can come over a, you know, fairly extended period of time, because I'm not looking to shock the system. But it has to become at least fair. And no, it doesn't have to immediately go to zero. But at some point would like to get it at zero, where sometimes we can be up and sometimes they can be up.
<The Economist> <Positive> You've talked about reciprocal taxes. Do you imagine that with lots of countries on lots of products or is that a negotiating tool?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think it can be conceivably with lots of countries. The thing that's bad about the hundred days is, I said the other day, I said, "When do we start this negotiation?" They said, "Sir, it hasn't kicked in yet" because it goes with [Robert] Lighthizer, who's our, you know, our representative, who I think is going to do a very good job. I said, "You must be kidding." So it's a real deficit. Now that's a NAFTA thing. Because everything in NAFTA is bad. That's bad, everything's bad. But in the case of South Korea we have a deal that was made by Hillary Clinton, it's a horrible deal. And that is the five-year anniversary and it's up for renegotiation and we've informed them that we'll negotiate. And again, we want a fair deal. We don't want a one-sided deal our way but we want fair deals. And if we can have fair deals our country is going to do very well.
<The Economist> <Positive> Some people think this is a negotiating tacticÑthat you say very dramatic things but actually you would settle for some very small changes. Is that right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's not, really not a negotiation. It's really not. No, will I settle for less than I go in with? Yes, I mean who wouldn't? Nobody, you know, I always use the word flexibility, I have flexibility. [Off the Record] [Our] relationship with China is long. Of course by China standards, it's very short [Laughter], you know when I'm with [Xi Jinping], because he's great, when I'm with him, he's a great guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was telling me, you know they go back 8,000 years, we have 1776 is like modern history. They consider 1776 like yesterday and they, you know, go back a long time. They talk about the different wars, it was very interesting. We got along great. So I told them, I said, "We have a problem and we're going to solve that problem." But he wants to help us solve that problem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now then you never know what's going to happen. But they said to me that on the currency manipulation, "Donald Trump has failed to call China a currency manipulator." Now I have to understand something. I'm dealing with a man, I think I like him a lot. I think he likes me a lot. We were supposed to meet for ten minutes and they go to 40-person meetings, OK, in Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach. And the ten minutes turned out to be three hours, alone, the two of us. The next day it was supposed to be ten minutes and then we go to our 40-person meeting. That, too, he was, no... because you guys were waiting for a long time. That ten minute meeting turned out to be three hours. Dinner turned out to be three hours. I mean, he's a great guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, with that in mind, he's representing China and he wants what's best for China. But so far, you know, he's been, he's been very good. But, so they talk about why haven't you called him a currency manipulator? Now think of this. I say, "Jinping. Please help us, let's make a deal. Help us with North Korea, and by the way we're announcing tomorrow that you're a currency manipulator, OK?" They never say that, you know the fake media, they never put them together, they always say, he didn't call him a currency [manipulator], number one. Number two, they're actually not a currency [manipulator]. You know, since I've been talking about currency manipulation with respect to them and other countries, they stopped.
<Steven Mnuchin> <Neutral> Right, as soon as the president got elected they went the other way.
<The Economist> <Neutral> One last question on trade. Do you think you've permanently changed the Republican Party's position on trade?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. Because there'll always be someone that comes along with another idea but it's not a better idea. We have the better idea. But yeah, I think that a lot of the, like for instance today, health care. Very big thing. Very big. And it wasn't two bites of the apple. It was one bite. Somebody set a time limit and that was mistake, I said never set a time limit but somebody set a time limit. So when they didn't meet that time limit they said, "We didn't get it there", well, they shouldn't have set a time limit.
<The Economist> <Negative> On another element of Trumponomics, immigration...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<The Economist> <Negative> Do you want to curb legal immigration?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh sure, you know, I want to stop illegal immigration.
<The Economist> <Negative> And what about legal immigration? Do you want to cut the number of immigrants?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh legal, no, no, no. I want people to come into the country legally. No, legally? No. I want people to come in legally. But I want people to come in on merit. I want to go to a merit-based system. Actually two countries that have very strong systems are Australia and Canada. And I like those systems very much, they're very strong, they're very good, I like them very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to a much more merit-based system. But I absolutely want talented people coming in, I want people that are going to love our country coming in, I want people that are going to contribute to our country coming in. We want a provision at the right time, we want people that are coming in and will commit to not getting... not receiving any form of subsidy to live in our country for at least a five-year period.
<The Economist> <Negative> But the numbers of those people could be as high as the numbers that are coming in legally now? You're not looking to reduce the numbers?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh yeah, no, no, no, no, we want people coming in legally. No, very strongly. Now they're going to be much more strongly vetted as you see. You know, we've broken the all-time record [of detentions at the border] by many times, 73, we're up to 73, it's going to go up to almost 80% at the border, we've... you know, really stopped it. We also want farm workers to be able to come in. You know, we're going to have work visas for the farm workers. If you look, you know we have a lot of people coming through the border, they're great people and they work on the farms and then they go back home. We like those people a lot and we want them to continue to come in.
<The Economist> <Negative> Another part of your overall plan, the tax reform plan. Is it OK if that tax plan increases the deficit? Ronald Reagan's tax reform didn't.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it actually did. But, but it's called priming the pump. You know, if you don't do that, you're never going to bring your taxes down. Now, if we get the health-care [bill through Congress], this is why, you know a lot of people said, "Why isn't he going with taxes first, that's his wheelhouse?" Well, hey look, I convinced many people over the last two weeks, believe me, many Congressmen, to go with it. And they're great people, but one of the great things about getting health care is that we will be saving, I mean anywhere from $400 billion to $900 billion.
<Steve Mnuchin> <Positive> Correct.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That all goes into tax reduction. Tremendous savings.
<The Economist> <Negative> But beyond that it's OK if the tax plan increases the deficit?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is OK, because it won't increase it for long. You may have two years where you'll... you understand the expression "prime the pump"?
<The Economist> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to prime the pump.
<The Economist> <Negative> It's very Keynesian.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're the highest-taxed nation in the world. Have you heard that expression before, for this particular type of an event?
<The Economist> <Negative> Priming the pump?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, have you heard it?
<The Economist> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Have you heard that expression used before? Because I haven't heard it. I mean, I just... I came up with it a couple of days ago and I thought it was good. It's what you have to do.
<The Economist> <Neutral> It's...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, what you have to do is you have to put something in before you can get something out.
<Steve Mnuchin> <Negative> And as we talked about, economic growth under the Trump administration could increase revenues as much as $2 trillion over the ten-year period of time. So priming the pump in the short term leads to growth.
<The Economist> <Negative> So you would have a bigger deficit, a stimulus, to prime the pump that would lead to faster growth?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I happen to think that 3% is low. But you can't do it if your companies are leaving the country because taxes are too high. Now, I'm going to do something there too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If our companies leave the country, number one they're leaving for numerous reasons but one of the big reasons is the taxes are so high. When they leaveÑgo back to trade for a second, when they leave the country, go to a certain country wherever it may be, and they fire all their workers in the United States and on the assumption they build cars or air conditioners or whatever they're building, and they open a plant someplace else and then they send the air conditioner or the car into our country with no tax, that's not going to happen anymore. They're going to have a very large tax to pay, in the vicinity of 35%.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now when you do that, number one they're not leaving the country anyway. So we're not leaving. I don't know if you saw what's happening. Ford has announced massive expansions in the United States. General Motors cancelled a big plant in Mexico and a big plant in Europe. They're all cancelling plans because I told them, I said... I get along with them great. But I said, "Look, we don't mind if you leave the country. You can build all you want out of country, I hope you enjoy your plant.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But when you build your car, you're going to have a 35% tax when you bring it back in. And if your numbers work, we wish you well. But that's what you're going to have. You're going to have a 35% tax."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I mean, I have, it has, I haven't been given massive credit for it yet, but I have been given some because I just see polls out in Michigan and different places, that really are affected by this, have been unbelievable, you know, much bigger than election day. But that's not a tax increase, that's no tax. In other words, all you have to do is don't leave and you won't have a... but we're bringing our taxes down so low that you won't even need the barrier because the taxes are so low, that people are going to stay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The other thing, just in case we... I believe it could be anywhere from $4 trillion to $5 trillion outside, you know don't forget we've been talking about $2.5 trillion for four years now. I've been using $2.5 trillion rn, the same number we've all been using for years. Well, you know, it grows. I think it... I wouldn't be surprised if it was $5 trillion but, you know, we're close. We're letting that money come back in. And that has two barriers which you have to watch. It's got a barrier of the tax, which we will take care of. We're going to make it 10%. Now it's 35%...
<The Economist> <Negative> Sorry, 10%? The repatriation taxes?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The repatriation. Inversion. The corporate inversions, which is a disaster, with the companies leaving. But they want to bring back their money. Number one, the tax is too high but the other thing that's too high is the bureaucracy.
<Steve Mnuchin> <Positive> Correct.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have a friend who said even if you wanted to bring it back in you can't because you have to go through so many papers, so many documents, so many...
<Steve Mnuchin> <Positive> We're going to make it simple
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have to do... Steve, they told me you've got to sign books and books of stuff, you pay millions of dollars in legal fees and they almost don't allow you to bring it back in.
<The Economist> <Neutral> Can I ask you a question about the politics of tax?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It should be like one page.
<The Economist> <Neutral> The politics of this? Do you need to get Democratic support to get this tax plan passed?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Um. Little bit.
<The Economist> <Positive> And to get Democratic support, they prefer...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Depending. It depends on which plan, you know, which concept we've got to... but it could be. But I think the Democrats are going to like it. We may align it with infrastructure, which they like. They like it as much as the Republicans like it. We need infrastructure in our country. This country has wasted $6 trillion in the Middle East. Wasted. Like taking it and throwing it right out that window. Right in to the Rose Garden. See that beautiful Rose Garden? Look at those very nicely dressed people. It's religious liberty out there.
<The Economist> <Positive> Mr. President, can I just try you on a deal-making question? If you do need Democratic support for your tax plan, your ideal tax plan, and the price of that the Democrats say is for you to release your tax returns, would you do that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. That's a very interesting question. I doubt it. I doubt it. Because they're not going to... nobody cares about my tax return except for the reporters. Oh, at some point I'll release them. Maybe I'll release them after I'm finished because I'm very proud of them actually. I did a good job.
<Hope Hicks> <Neutral> Once the audit is over.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I might release them after I'm out of office.
<Steve Mnuchin> <Positive> Just so you know, I've already started meeting with Democratic senators and, you know, the support has been pretty interesting. I mean, I think a lot of the Democratic senators actually believe we're on to the right tax plan to bring back business to America, and that's what they're all about, they want to grow jobs in their states, just like the president does.
<Hope Hicks> <Neutral> And our plan has things like child-care tax credits which have never been presented before...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By the way, so as you know I'm under routine audit, so they're not going to be done. But you know, at a certain point, that's something I will consider. But I would never consider it as part of a deal.
<The Economist> <Positive> Right, got that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would never do it. That would be... I think that would be unfair to the deal. It would be disrespectful of the importance of this deal. Because the only people that find that important are the reporters.
<The Economist> <Positive> Well, the Democrats say it's important.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, don't forget I got elected without it. Somebody said, "Oh but you have to do it," I said, "Look where I am." I was, you know, I was out front, I was asked that question, every debate, I said, you know, I'm under routine audit.
<Steve Mnuchin> <Negative> And the president's financial disclosure has been longer than any...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Plus my financial disclosure is 104 pages.
<Hope Hicks> <Neutral> I think when people say that that makes it about the president and the politics versus the people, which is what we're focused on.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<The Economist> <Negative> Can I ask you about the focus of the tax cut because you've spoken about a massive tax cut for ordinary workers...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right, this would be the biggest tax cut in the history of the country.
<The Economist> <Negative> But the biggest winners from this tax cut, right now, look as though they will be the very wealthiest Americans.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't believe that. Because they're losing all of their deductions, I can tell you.
<The Economist> <Negative> But something like eliminating the estate tax.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I get more deductions, I mean I can tell you this, I get more deductions, they have deductions for birds flying across America, they have deductions for everything. There are more deductions... now you're going to get an interest deduction, and a charitable deduction. But we're not going to have all this nonsense that they have right now that complicates things and makes it... you know when we put out that one page, I said, we should really put out a, you know, a big thing, and then I looked at the one page, honestly it's pretty well covered. Hard to believe.
<The Economist> <Negative> Will you keep interest deduction in the corporate tax? Will corporate interest payments...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do you want to answer?
<Steve Mnuchin> <Neutral> We're contemplating it. We're contemplating it.
<The Economist> <Negative> Contemplating getting rid of it?
<Steve Mnuchin> <Positive> No, we're contemplating keeping it. That's our preference. But we'll look at everything.
<The Economist> <Positive> So what would your preference be Mr. President? You know about that very well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I would say probably... I think we're contemplating is the word. And it hasn't been determined yet, but we're contemplating.
<The Economist> <Neutral> Contemplating...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're contemplating various... I have to say, we're contemplating various things, but one of the things that's very important is simplicity. We want to keep it as simple as possible. Because even if you do, it's complicated. I mean even if you keep it simple with taxes it gets complicated.
<The Economist> <Negative> And are you contemplating things outside of corporate income tax? For example a VAT, which many countries have?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, a lot of people consider the border tax a form of VAT.
<The Economist> <Neutral> Are you still...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Part of the problem with NAFTA is that Mexico's a VAT. So Mexico is paying almost... we pay 17%. So we are now down 17%, going into Mexico when we trade. So that's like, you have a football team and every time they play a game, they're down, you know, 25 points. How can you possibly do good?
<The Economist> <Neutral> But would you consider...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You could actually make the case, that the 17 is doubled. You can make that case. You know, it's 17 and it's really 17 and it's a double.
<Steve Mnuchin> <Positive> Right.
<The Economist> <Negative> Would you consider a VAT for the United States?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well the concept of VAT I really like. But let me give you the bad news. I don't think it can be sold in this country because we're used to an income tax, we're used to a... people are used to this tax, whether they like it or don't like, they're used to this tax. I fully understand because I have a lot of property in the UK. And it's, sort of, not a bad tax. And every time I pay it, they end up sending it back to me. In fact, my accountant is always saying...
<The Economist> <Positive> That's a good tax.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's really not so bad. Like, I own Turnberry in Scotland. And every time I pay they say, "Yes sir, you pay it now but you get it back next year." I said, "What kind of tax is this, I like this tax." But the VAT is... I like it, I like it a lot, in a lot of ways. I don't mean because of, you know, getting it back, you don't get all of it back, but you get a lot of it back. But I like a VAT. I don't think it can be sold in this country, I think it's too much of a shock to this system. I can tell you if we had a VAT it would make dealing with Mexico very much easier. Because it could neutralise. And I really mean that. Part of the problem with NAFTA, the day they signed it, it was a defective deal. Because Mexico has almost a 17% VAT tax and it's very much of a hidden tax, people don't see it. So, but these guys, instead of renegotiating the following week... many years ago, how old is that? 35?
<Steve Mnuchin> <Negative> 35 years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But instead of negotiating, we suffered with this for, you know, for decades.
<The Economist> <Negative> But as you said Mr. President, a border-adjustment tax has some similarities to that. Are you still considering a border-adjustment tax?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We are dealing with Congress... because it's not really what I'm considering. I mean look, on health care, I think we have a great bill and there's still a little bit further to go because we're also dealing with the Senate, but the Senate I believe really wants to get something done because Obamacare is dead, just so we understand. Obamacare is absolutely dead. The insurance companies are leaving. Yesterday Aetna just announced they're pulling out. You have states that aren't going to have any insurance companies. You know when people say, "Oh, Obamacare is so wonderful," there is no Obamacare, it's dead. Plus we're subsidising it and we don't have to subsidise it. You know if I ever stop wanting to pay the subsidies, which I will.
<The Economist> <Negative> You'd pull the plug on that? If this bill doesn't go through you'd stop those subsidies?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, this bill only gives them one month. They don't realize that, that's another thing. Good point. This bill gives them one month, it gave, you know the subsidy...
<The Economist> <Neutral> The continuation of the subsidy?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The subsidy to the insurance companies, yes. Anytime I want because actually...
<The Economist> <Negative> But my question is if the bill doesn't pass...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In actuality Congress has to approve it. Congress...
<The Economist> <Negative> If the bill doesn't pass would you cut the subsidies?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If the bill doesn't pass, I'd be in a different position. Because, if the bill didn't pass the Republicans would have let me down. And then I'd have to decide what I want to do because I want people to have health care. Our health care is much better than Obamacare. It's going to be much less expensive. We're going to have competition, we're getting rid of the state lines, etc etc.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The premiums are going to be low, the deductibles are going to be low. If it didn't pass... it's a great question, I don't want to think about that but the answer is... I would do something to make sure the people have health care, as bad as Obamacare is.
<The Economist> <Negative> One of the things that was so different about your campaign message compared to other Republicans was, you said things like "I want everyone to be covered."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're not going to let people die on the streets.
<The Economist> <Negative> But some people will look at this bill and say, hang on, a lot of people are going to lose their coverage.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK. So we have a pool for people that are having difficulty. We have got a pool. It's a high-risk pool. And this pool we just funded yesterday, we're putting in $8 billion, into the pool. So depending on what states do... because I would like to see states taking over health care, I think they could do a better job than the federal government. Now in some cases that'll be great, like in Florida that works fantastically with Rick Scott, and a couple of others. And in some states it isn't, where they're not equipped to do it. But ultimately, you know I use the expression, "If you have a bad knee, I would rather have the federal government focus on North Korea than fixing your knee."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The state governments are in much better position to, you know, help people. In terms of, you know, just the size, the mere size of it. But we're putting in $8 billion and you're going to have absolute coverage. You're going to have absolute guaranteed coverage. You're going to have it if you're a person going in... don't forget, this was not supposed to be the way insurance works. Insurance is, you're 20 years old, you just graduated from college, and you start paying $15 a month for the rest of your life and by the time you're 70, and you really need it, you're still paying the same amount and that's really insurance.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I believe it's very important to have this. Because one thing Obamacare did, is it gave that and it was a concept that people hadn't heard of. And now I don't want to end it. I don't want to end it for somebody that... first of all I don't want to end it for the people that already have it. And I don't want to end it for somebody that hasn't been buying insurance for all of his life where he has a guarantee that for all of his life he's been buying the insurance and he can buy it inexpensively when he turns 65 or 70 years old. So we put in a tremendous amount and we're... you know, for the pre-existing conditions. We are going to have a great pool for pre-existing conditions.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, that will even get better as it's going along, it's going to get better. But in a way you could say, that's not really insurance, but it's there. And I want to make it as... I want to make it actually better than what they have in Obama[care]. Now, Obama[care] has something that's very, very bad. Where you have to pay a penalty. And people don't realise, how many people are forced to pay a penalty and they don't get any benefit out of it. We don't have that. We're going to have much lower premiums and we're going to have much lower deductibles.
<The Economist> <Negative> But when you used to say the hard right of the Republicans can't be trusted to look after people...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They came through.
<The Economist> <Negative> They came through? So do you still have to keep them in line.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll be honest with you... Did anybody ever hear of a guy named Mike Pence? Vice-president of the United States?
<Mike Pence> <Negative> [Enters room] Morning all.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Central casting.
<Mike Pence> <Negative> Please sit, sit, sit.
<Hope Hicks> <Neutral> We got about two more minutes. So just one more question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I know exactly the speeches you're talking about. I said, "I'm not going to allow people to die on the streets", and I said it over and over and I meant it more than anything and I probably mean it more now than even when I made the speech. We're talking about the high-risk pools, Mike, and we just added $8 billion to the high-risk pools.
<Mike Pence> <Neutral> Yes, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People are going to have... they're going to have great insurance. Now, we have one more step to go. You know we have to go through the Senate and we're refining it even further. But I will tell you, Mike, I just spoke to a few of the senators and they have some great ideas also and they want to get it there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, the problem with Obamacare? He rushed it through, he wanted... although, when I say rushed it through, at the end. They were giving up everything, they were taking out everything. It wasn't a pure form of what they wanted anyway. They did the Nebraska trade where basically it was, you know, the whole thing was given away.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, Obamacare was a disaster. Under Obamacare, you get your doctor; that was a lie. You get your plan; that was a lie. With us, you get your doctor. You get your plan. With us you'll get hundreds and hundreds of plans. You know, one of the insurance companies, one of the big ones came to see me yesterday. They're so anxious to start going crazy and you know it's going to be like life insurance. People that buy life insurance they're inundated with carriers. All different plans.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's what this is going to be like. And I said to them, "What do you think the good plans are going to look like?" He said, "Mr. President, we're going to have so many plans. We're going to have the low version, the high version", he used the word Cadillac. I won't tell you what car he used for the low version because I don't want you to write it because they happen to be friends of mine, you know, the head people. [
<The Economist> <Neutral> Mr. President, in business you keep score of your profits. How do you keep score in Trumponomics and in politics?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I think the score is going to be the end of the game. To me the score is going to have to be at the end of the game. I was saying, Mike, that we're going to prime the pump with the taxes because we're going to take in perhaps a little bit less, but we're going to have a lot more business, we're going to have companies coming back into the country.
<The Economist> <Negative> I know a lot of companies that want to come back in but they're not going to come back in because of taxes. And we have a lot of companies that will come back into the country. They were forced out of the country because the taxes were too high. Many, many. You look at what's going on in certain countries. In fact I own a lot of property in certain countries where they were forced out.
<The Economist> <Positive> You look at Ireland. I own great property in Ireland that I bought during their downturn. And I give the Irish a lot, a lot of credit. They never raised their taxes. You know you would have thought when they were going through that really... they would've double and tripled their taxes. They never raised it a penny. And they got through it and they are thriving now. Ireland's done an amazing job. A lot of companies have moved to Ireland and they like it.
<The Economist> <Negative> But we're going to be getting a lot of companies moving back and we're going to get very few companies leaving the United States because we went from the highest tax rate of... not only major, you know they always say major countries, just about the highest tax rate period. And then when you add all the other things. And then when you add the regulations to the tax... I've had people tell me, because I've cut massive regulations and we've just started, believe me. But we've cut regulations massively.
<The Economist> <Negative> I've had people tell me that the cutting of those regulations is more important to them than bringing it down from 35% to 15%. And if you would have told me that, if I had a guess one before I knew the answer, I would've said, nobody would've taken the regulations. 90% of the people would rather have the regulations cut. So when you talk about the tax cut, the regulation cut, Dodd-Frank, you'll be doing a story on that fairly soon because we're doing a very massive overhaul on Dodd-Frank. We're doing things that are going to keep people real happy.
<The Economist> <Positive> And then ultimately, when I leave office, on the assumption [Mike Pence] doesn't follow me, but he will. But when I leave office what happens is slowly they'll nip away at it, nip away, nip away and then in 40, 50 years somebody else will come along and bring it back. But we're bringing back entrepreneurship. We're bringing back enthusiasm. And if you look at the people that read your magazine, that are in this country, the enthusiasm levels, and you know this because you see it, are the highest they've even been. The enthusiasm levels for manufacturers went up 27 points in two months. If it goes up a quarter of point it's like a massive... it went up 27% in two months, up to 93%, they've never been even close. The enthusiasm for business is the highest it's ever been.
<Hope Hicks> <Negative> And we'll have you guys back to talk about it. Sorry.
<The Economist> <Positive> Thank you so much, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hope you had enough time.
<The Economist> <Neutral> You've been very kind.
<Chris Jansing> <Neutral> Let's go in and see if we can get him to answer a question for two. How are you feeling this morning?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We feel great. I mean, the turnout has been fantastic. I think we're going to have a great day. We had a phenomenal poll come out last night, actually a pollster that called South Carolina. You know, I wasn't supposed to win South Carolina. We won in really a landslide, Chris, and we feel really good about this.
<Chris Jansing> <Negative> I want to give you a chance to answer these reports that there's a lot of infighting in your campaign, that it's in a state somewhat of disarray.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I haven't heard those reports. I mean, we have a great campaign, I'm No. 1 by a lot. Millions more votes than Cruz or anybody else. I have millions of more votes, as you know. I have almost 300 more delegates. I have not heard anything about infighting. I don't know where you hear it.
<Chris Jansing> <Positive> Do you feel -- well, it's being reported and there are people within your campaign who are suggesting...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm the only -- no, I'm the only -- I doubt that.
<Chris Jansing> <Positive> You feel confident that your campaign is all working together.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. [Crosstalk]
<Chris Jansing> <Negative> None of the people who have been brought in...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me ask you, are we No. 1?
<Chris Jansing> <Negative> You are No. 1. But will you...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Do we have millions nor votes than anybody else? Will we win today, I can't tell you, but we're going to have a great turnout and I think we're going to do very well.
<Chris Jansing> <Negative> As you know, it's not uncommon when things seem to not be doing as well as they might have been -- and I know you disagree with some of the assessments, but people have said not your greatest week last week for sure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I've had worse weeks on the campaign. I mean, I've had so many weeks that -- I think a couple that were worse. And in one case I went up in the polls. So, you know, couldn't have been so disastrous.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we actually have a very, very good campaign going. I'm No. 1 by a lot. And, you know, the thing that nobody talks about are the votes. I'm millions of votes more than anybody else. You know, we talk about delegates, which I'm by far and away No. 1, but the votes are even more impressive, because I have -- if you take a look, is it close to 3 million votes more than the second place person.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we're doing really well. I had not heard anything about the inner fightings of the campaign, but we have a successful campaign going and I think we're going to keep it going.
<Chris Jansing> <Positive> And let me ask you about going on from here. How important is Wisconsin, and if Ted Cruz is able to win here, does it substantially make it harder for you to go into Cleveland and assure a win?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Ted Cruz can't win. There's no way he can get the delegates and everybody has said that, all of your friends and everybody that I've watched, has said that it's impossible -- almost impossible for Ted Cruz to win. So he would have to get it at the convention, which I think would be highly unlikely.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So he can't win. We can win fairly easily. If we won Wisconsin, that would be a big help.
<Chris Jansing> <Negative> And what has it meant in Wisconsin, do you think, that you had the radio talk show host, you've had the governor, you've had so many people who are in the, quote/unquote, establishment"
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the governor has to say that because, as you know, I took him out. He was running for president and I was the one that took him out and I took him out rapidly and I didn't ever even ask for his endorsement or support. But I have the support of many people, Chris Christie, Ben Carson, people that ran and really ran much more successfully than he did.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have the support of many, many people. We just got the support of the 16,500 border patrol agents, which really is responsible for the border, the southern border. And, I mean, we have tremendous support from so many different levels, Senator Jeff Sessions, who Cruz was trying to get on his camp, because he's one of the most respected senators. He endorsed Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we have tremendous support but I can understand why Governor Walker wouldn't want to support me because I was the one that took him out of the presidential race and it was done pretty -- it was pretty tough. I mean, it was a pretty tough situation. He was expected to win and he ended up leaving, one of the earliest to leave. So I understand that; that's why I never even bothered to ask for his support.
<Chris Jansing> <Positive> One of the toughest mountains for you seems to be with women now. In some areas you have 70, 77 percent negatives with women. Can you turn that around and what do you think is behind I,t besides obviously there were people that are concerned about your questions on abortion, very concerned about the fact that you continue to support Corey Lewandowski.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A lot -- well, if you look at the tape, what did Corey Lewandowski do? So am I supposed to be loyal to a person? Or because somebody filed something -- because if you look at the complaint, I mean, people have -- we don't have to get into it now, but people have looked at that tape and they're trying to say what did he do wrong? So I have to be loyal to people, just like I'll be loyal to the people of this country. But when you analyze it, it's called give me a break.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> As far as women are concerned, nobody respects women more than I do, not even close. Nobody respects women more than I do. And I get very -- [Crosstalk]
<Chris Jansing> <Negative> So why aren't they getting that message?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you what, because I get a very unfair press. I get very, very unfair press having to do with women and many other things. I mean...
<Unidentified Female> <Positive> [Inaudible] support Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right. Phyllis does.
<Unidentified Female> <Positive> I told that to Charlie Sykes last week, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, and Charlie Sykes, I mean, this guy is third rate. He's a third rate talent and he frankly -- and the governor, you know the story with the governor. But the women -- I think that I'm going to do very well with women. We just had a big meeting, many women at the meeting, and they like me best because they say you're best with the military, you're best with the borders, you're best with security. And I said I'm going to be best for women's health issues, much better than hillary, much better than anybody else. So I think we're going to do fantastically well with women.
<Chris Jansing> <Negative> If you don't win here, Donald -- Mr. Trump, will it be because you misread or your campaign misread the Wisconsin electorate? Do you think that perhaps you might have come in here, knowing that you beat him, and not been so tough on the governor, not been so tough on a radio talk show host who frankly is very popular here and very well respected?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The state is not doing particularly well; it's average compared to other states surrounding. The governor has a good press. The governor's a nice man. I mean, he gave me a plaque because I supported him a year ago. You know, a year ago I was like establishment, right? I supported him; I gave him a lot of money because I liked him because he was a fighter. But the truth is his results are not very good. They're very average, even less than average in many cases. They're losing jobs; they're going to other countries. And I let people know and I let people know, too, when I was running against him as president and I talked about what's going wrong. And it was something I didn't want to do, but he had to leave the race, because when I brought out the facts he was unable to answer what I said.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That being said, I've done great in Wisconsin. I mean, the people have -- you've seen, I've had rallies that have been fantastic. Yesterday we had over 8,000 people trying to get into a airplane hangar and it was in the middle, like, I mean, it was in an area that everyone said you couldn't get anybody. And they had thousands and thousands of people from all over Wisconsin coming.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we're going to do well. A poll came out last night and it was interesting because it was the same pollster that polled South Carolina that I ended up winning in a landslide. This was the poll that was the most accurate in South Carolina and I believe also in New Hampshire, which I also won. So it's going to be interesting to see. But I think it's going to be a great day in Wisconsin and I think we're going to do very well. I don't know, but I just -- based on the enthusiasm -- how do you think we're going to do in Wisconsin?
<Audience> <Positive> Great! Great job!
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we're going to do very well. I hope so.
<Chris Jansing> <Neutral> And finally no changes anticipated in your campaign staff? You have full confidence in everyone within it and you see no signs of any kind of unrest or infighting within your campaign?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's just the media again. I get the most unfair media. Nobody ever even called me. This is the first time I've been asked this question. Nobody has ever called me about this. We're No. 1 in every category -- No. 1 in delegates, No. 1 in votes by millions. I don't mean by like two votes, by millions and millions of votes. And I'm very happy.
<Chris Jansing> <Neutral> And you don't feel ill served, for example, to go on to a very popular talk radio show and you said you didn't know they had been leading an anti-Trump show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, because if you listen to that -- I don't mind that. I mean, you go into the enemy camp sometimes, but you have to take on the enemy. He's not a very smart guy, not a very bright guy, and if you listen to the entire show, you would've said Donald Trump totally won that debate. I was on the show for 15 minutes and everybody that listened to that show said you convinced me. I've had many people call me that were going to vote against me. They listened to that show. By the end of the show, and they wrote me -- I have two or three letters -- they wrote and tweeted and all of these, and they said by the end of that show, you have totally convinced me. I'm voting for Trump. So sometimes you go into unfriendly territory. That's part of the game.
<Chris Jansing> <Neutral> And that's what you consider Wisconsin to be?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, you said about a radio talk show host...
<Chris Jansing> <Neutral> You were just talking about the radio host.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> See, that's what I mean about the dishonest media.
<Chris Jansing> <Neutral> I'm asking you a question, allowing you to answer it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me. Excuse me, excuse me. You're asking me about a show host. I said he was unfriendly territory. Then you say is that, what, Wisconsin?
<Chris Jansing> <Negative> Well, you also talked about [Inaudible]. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's so dishonest. It's so dis -- No, no, look, that's called -- you know what's that's called? Dishonest media. That's called dishonest reporting.
<Chris Jansing> <Positive> Well, let me ask you finally, going into New York...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I'm going to do great.
<Chris Jansing> <Neutral> '-- and Pennsylvania...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me.
<Chris Jansing> <Neutral> '-- what's the strategy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Excuse me. I think I'm going to do great in Wisconsin. The polls are showing me doing really, really well in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut. I mean, it looks like we're going to have tremendous victories there. But right now, I'm interested right here. We'll see how we do tonight. And I think the results will surprise you.
<Chris Jansing> <Positive> Donald Trump, thank you so much for your time, sir.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> And John Heilemann, [Inaudible] chair to Donald Trump.
<John Heilemann> <Neutral> See you.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Welcome.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sit down, Joe.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Have a seat right here.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Oh, yeah.
<John Heilemann> <Positive> I yield my chair.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Very good to see you. [Applause]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Miccing him up.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> So, obviously, we were telling people about the event last night -- 4 to 5,000 people in a snow storm. And I'm just wondering how you're feeling this morning -- Iowa, obviously, all the polls had you ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A little bit.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> All the polls have you ahead here.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I thought I won Iowa.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yeah, you -- little -- well, you actually hit your vote total that you expected to get. Cruz just go more people out. How do you feel this morning?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How did -- how did he do that? How did he get those extra votes?
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Yeah. How are you feeling this morning?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I feel good, I feel good. We had a great night and it was an amazing event in a snow storm, in a blizzard. So, I feel very good.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> I saw a New York Times article that talked about a townhall meeting you had, I think in Merrimack. And the reporter was saying that it actually -- you were -- you were very at ease in that smaller group. And actually questioned why you didn't do that more in New Hampshire?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the problem is, we call the events -- and I like to do those events -- and then, you know, 2,000 people show up. So, they're not working. And then we have thousands of people outside, and we have to tell them, I'm sorry, you have to go home. We only have room for 40. And I like those events, every -- I did a couple of them, and I love them.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But so many people come that it's sort of not right. Mark understands that, because he has seen it.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> So, we're hearing a lot about potential upheaval tonight, with outsiders perhaps taking New Hampshire -- you and Bernie Sanders. We hear about upheaval in the Clinton campaign, maybe them changing strategy, needing to do that. And even potential that by March, Michael Bloomberg might jump into the race. What do you make of all that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he's a friend of mine, I hope he jumps in, because I love the competition. I would love to see Michael in the race, actually. I think he should do it. Actually, I think I'll call him later and say, Do it. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I think he's good. He's different.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Was he a good mayor?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was a good mayor, he had a rough last four years, I will tell you that. A really rough four -- I think he would have been much better if he didn't take to third term. You know, he fought like hell to take -- he was term limited.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> I agree with that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And spent a lot of money on doing a lot things.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Changing it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He got a third term. And then, there was a snow storm, it was a disaster. And I think he would have been a lot better if he didn't take the third.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> So, you're talking about him spending a lot of money. You haven't spent a lot of money. One of the critiques I hear about your campaign is that you have got to improve your ground game, moving forward. Are you going to invest a lot of your money, since you're not taking other people...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> ... into building ground games in South Carolina...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Across the deep south, and some of the other key states?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sure. Well, I'm $45 million under budget. By this time, I thought I'd spend X -- what have I spent, $12 million or $15 million, and most of it is paying myself back for my airplane. I haven't had to do a lot of advertising. And you know, I go -- I don't know if I'm a believer in polls or not, but I go by the polls and I do a lot of television and you can't do that much television, and then on top of it, you have an ad and then more television and an ad. People would say I can't watch this guy anymore. So I'm way -- I mean, I'm at least $45 million under where I thought I'd be at this point.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> So you think you might invest that in your ground game moving forward?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I might. I mean, we're going to see. I've invested a lot of money. Actually, one of the reasons I've done commercials and they are actually positive commercials, is because I feel guilty.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I feel guilty that I didn't do any commercials and we made a commercial, it was a good commercial and put it on, but -- and I also don't want to take a chance, you know? I don't want to be like a wise guy and think I don't have to do. So we put on a commercial, it's a good commercial. Yes, we're going to -- you know, we have a big -- a big, big group of people in South Carolina tomorrow, tremendous amounts of people showing up. So we -- look, it's about make America great again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very simple thing. We have a -- just make America great again. You saw it last night, a lot of people saw it last night and that's what we're going to do. [Applause]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Willie Geist.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know who he is. I don't know, but I like him.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> He -- yes, he has a sign he wants to give you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Does he? Oh, wow.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Donald, in public at least, you're not the most reflective or sentimental person I know. But if you think about...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But in private?
<Willie Geist> <Positive> Perhaps in private you are. But if you think about yourself a year ago before you made the decision to get into the race, you were thinking about your businesses and perhaps a new season of The Apprentice. Could you have ever in you wildest dreams imagined you sitting here on this day, primary day in New Hampshire, as the favorite to win this state?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I -- I'll tell you. First of all, I know this state very well because I've been here long before politics. I have many friends that live here and I'm up here and it's an incredible state. And I know the pluses and minuses.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, the minus is that they have a tremendous heroin drug problem and I'm going to stop it. I'm going to build a wall. I'm going to stop -- and I'm going to stop it so fast, even beyond the wall, long before the wall goes up. I'm going to stop it, and they really need that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know, it's the first question I get. When you think of New Hampshire you don't think of that, but it's the first question I get all the time, the heroin, the drug problem. OK. I would say, hey look, you know, I like to win and I've won over my life.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, that's what I do, I win. I -- I --- I didn't go in it to lose, but if you would have told me that like a national poll just came up you probably saw it, I think it was an NBC poll where I'm like 15 points up nationally and we are up quite a bit here. But the people have to go out and vote, you know? You see rallies like that where you have 4,000 or 5,000 people in a blizzard, and then you still have to tell them -- that's why I told them last night, no matter how you're feeling, you have to go out and vote.
<Willie Geist> <Positive> But have you been surprised along the way at how well you've done? I mean, when you stood at the top of that escalator on June 16th, did you think you'd be the here as the favorite to New Hampshire?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm happy about it. And I've given up a lot. And you know, it takes guts to run for...
<Willie Geist> <Neutral> But are you surprised?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> He's not.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, not that surprised. [Laughter]
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> We finally get him to tell the truth. You know, they -- you know, you can tell he's not a southern politician because that's a false modesty. I'll tell you what...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> I can't believe how much you all love me.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> No, I'm not surprised. No.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, Willie, I had to give up The Apprentice because Steve Burke came up to see me and they wanted to renew for two seasons of The Apprentice. That's a hard thing to give up, you give up prime time television, you give up a lot of deals. I don't do deals anymore, this is all I'm doing. I mean, I'm lucky my children are very good and they're running the company and they're going to do great. But you give up a lot. I mean, when you give up a prime time television show -- you know, it sounds very trivial, it's a lot to give up.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> It is. Andrea Mitchell?
<Andrea Mitchell> <Negative> Let me ask you about Mike Bloomberg, because you say he was a good mayor, at least for the first two terms, you're a friend. But he says if he gets in, and he's now talking seriously about it, it's because he's disappointed in the conversation in both parties. Clearly, he would hurt the Democrats more than the Republicans. He's pro, you know, gun control, he's in favor of abortion rights, on all the social issues. So he would really cut into...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> He would be coming in to stop you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, he's...
<Andrea Mitchell> <Negative> But he would -- he would really...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... got very different views from me.
<Andrea Mitchell> <Neutral> He could end up electing...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He and I have very different views.
<Andrea Mitchell> <Neutral> ... you if you were the nominee.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I did him a big favor. He had a horrible project that was a total mess. It was under construction for 25 years at least and he couldn't get it built. No matter what they did, they couldn't get it built. I took it over and got it built in less than a year. And I said I'm going to get [Inaudible] his is last term. I said I'm going to get it open for you before you leave and I got it open in October and he left in January.
<Willie Geist> <Neutral> What was the project?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The big project called Ferry Point in the Bronx. It was a disaster. Probably under construction for 30 years and I got it done. I really got -- I...
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> So let me ask you, how did you...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I did him a big favor.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> I always ask leadership questions, this is a good leadership question to ask. How did you get it done?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because I know how to build, I know how to get it done. I mean, that's what I do. The thing I do best is build. When you have an infrastructure of a country like ours that is absolutely decaying and rotting and falling apart and we -- by the way, we're spending $5 trillion in the Middle East instead of doing what we're supposed to be doing. We have to knock the hell out of ISIS and all, but we have to get back to rebuilding our country because you look at our airports, our roadways, our tunnels, our bridges -- 67 percent of them are in trouble.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Have we wasted too much money over the past decade fighting wars? Has that been one of the biggest...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'll tell you what, I don't mind fighting, but you have got to win and number one, we don't win wars, we just fight, we just fight. It's like a big -- like you're vomiting, just fight, fight, fight. [Laughter] We don't win anything. I mean, if you're going to fight, you win and you get back to rebuilding the country. We don't win. It's really a terrible thing. I mean, our country used to win all the time. We don't win at all anymore.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> Given that you're poised to win this primary, given your standing in the national polls, given the trouble Hillary Clinton is having, are you the favorite to be the next president of the United States right now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I just don't know, Mark, I can't answer that question. I'm just -- you know, I go day by day, and I work hard, and I'm doing a lot of stops, even today I'm doing five or six stops. I think we're doing well. I mean, I see the response. You saw the response last night. I mean, that's typical. I see the response, and we get by far the biggest crowds, far bigger than Bernie, Bernie doesn't get anywhere near where we get. Now, I will say this -- he gets the second biggest crowds, he gets bigger than any other Republican. But I see the response and the response has been amazing.
<Andrea Mitchell> <Neutral> What do you make of it?
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> You talk about -- you talk about trade and obviously immigration. What other issues that you're talking about do you think are resonating with voters? Is your tax plan, for instance, [Inaudible]?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think health care is very big, I think tax plan. Interestingly, the tax plan is a massive plan that is going to cut taxes for everybody, but people don't care as much about that as some things. What they really care about is safety, and they really care about the border, they talk about the border, they love the border, they love the wall. I mean, last night, I said who is going to pay for the wall? The whole crowd goes crazy -- Mexico But no, they love the security.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what's different? When I first announced, it was trade with China and others that are ripping you us off like you wouldn't believe, and that we can do easily. But it was trade and it was, you know, the border. After Paris, Paris had a big impact, then it became, really, security for the country. An amazing difference, I switched.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the polls actually switched, the polls had me No. 1 by far on that issue, because I think of my stance on the border. But really now, I think it's security more than anything else.
<Andrea Mitchell> <Neutral> What do you make of the fact that some people, some voters say, they can't decide between Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. What is the common thread here?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I can understand it in a certain way. We have one thing strongly in common, the difference is he can't do anything about it, I can. Trade. He knows we're being ripped off by every country we do business with, because we have people that are very, very stupid or very, very political that are negotiating our trade deals. In many cases, they're political hacks. He knows that and I know that. The difference is I will take our trade deals and make them incredible for us. He can't do anything about it, because it's not his thing. He will never be able to do that.
<Andrea Mitchell> <Negative> And let me ask you about something that did happen last night, because people have criticized the tone of this campaign. What was going through your mind when that woman shouted a word out and you went with it and sort of...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I didn't -- we were all just having fun. It was a great moment, I got a standing ovation, the place went wild. Somebody said mixed cheers. Let me tell you, the place went wild.
<Andrea Mitchell> <Negative> No, I saw that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Standing ovation. You know, you're talking about close to 5,000 people. standing ovation, went totally wild. And all I was doing is repeating, because people couldn't hear it, so I was doing everybody a favor.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> OK, so before we go, because you seem...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Does that make sense? [Applause]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> You think on your feet so well.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The world of politically correct.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Oh, good Lord. I'm scared to do this, actually.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> So, we've been doing with all the candidates word association before we go. This is making me very nervous.
<Andrea Mitchell> <Neutral> Are you sure you want to do that after last night?
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Yes, yes, you do.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right. One word, Donald, OK?
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Or a phrase [Inaudible].
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> But -- but -- you have got to go. OK, Jeb Bush.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Loser. [Laughter]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> OK.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> What a coincidence.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> It's so funny you should say that. Marco Rubio.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All right. Confused.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Ted Cruz.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was going to say nasty. He's not really nasty, I mean, he has been very nice, he only goes on and off. I'll say nasty.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Nasty, OK.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Stick with it.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Hillary Clinton.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> She went to your wedding.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah. She did. She did. She did. In a certain way, evil. In a certain way, evil.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Whoa. Bill Clinton.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Intelligent.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Hey, I mean, just stop there. I'm good, I'm good.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> OK.
<Willie Geist> <Neutral> I'm interested in all the words that he edited out.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> I know. [Laughter]
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> No. There was a lot of editing. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I never like that stuff, because...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Oh, yes. One more. Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Brilliant. [Laughter]
<Willie Geist> <Positive> That one was easy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, Putin said, Trump is brilliant I said, I'm not going to disavow that statement. Why would I ever disavow that statement?" No
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right. Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A lot nicer than people think.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> I don't know if Hillary Clinton would agree with that in morning. But Donald Trump, thank you so much for being with us.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> I know some people who do. Donald Trump, thank you. Andrea Mitchell, thank you as well. [Break] So we've been doing with all the candidates, word association before we go. This is making me very nervous.
<Question> <Neutral> Are you sure you want to do that after last night?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Do I want to do this?
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Yes. Yes, you do.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> OK. Word one, Donald. OK. [Crosstalk] OK. Jeb Bush?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Loser.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> OK. [Laughter]
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> What a coincidence?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> So, funny, you should say that. Marco Rubio.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Confused.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Ted Cruz. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was going to say nasty, he's not really nasty. I mean, he has been very nice. He goes on and off. I'll say nasty.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Nasty. OK.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Next question.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Hillary Clinton.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> She went to your wedding.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She did. She did. She did. In a certain way evil. In a certain way evil.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Whoa. Bill Clinton.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Intelligent.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> I mean, we should just stop there. I'm good. I'm good.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Right now, Donald Trump is here, and there is blood on the floor. Donald Trump is headlining a brutal verbal boxing match, and Governor Mitt Romney is betting on the Donald. Trump is at the center of a new fight in the presidential race. Here is Donald Trump.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> [Begin Video Clip] Donald, nice to talk to you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hello, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I have a lot of things I want to talk to you about, including one that's apparently electrifying everybody, but I'll get to that one in a second. But first I want to talk about tonight's event with Governor Mitt Romney. It's in Vegas, this fund-raiser. Why Vegas? Any particular reason?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think it really represents something. If you remember, when Obama came out very, very negative to Nevada and to Las Vegas, and it was a terrible thing and it really had a huge impact and a negative impact, Don't go to Las Vegas, and it was a disaster. And I don't know why in particular this location was chosen.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It wasn't chosen by me, but it does represent lots of jobs, a big industry, the tourism industry, and I think it's probably a very appropriate place. We have a very, very successful evening, and it's really something I think that's going to be very special.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, I note that Vegas has been particularly hurt by the downturn in the job market. Or in fact, Las Vegas last in March had a 12.4 percent unemployment rate, which is above the national average, and there's no secret that Vegas has -- that Nevada in particular has been hit hard. So I wondered if that was the particular theme, but apparently not.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it was very badly hit when the president came out and said, you know, Don't go there. And I will tell you that had a very, very negative impact on Las Vegas and Nevada. And you know, it was a pretty shameful thing, I think. And he's been trying to recover, but he has never really recovered from that.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, is there any money to be had in Vegas for a fund- raiser if everybody's hurting? I guess there's some big high rollers. But tell me, I mean, how much money do you expect to get tonight?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, we're going to raise a lot of money tonight, millions. And I think it's going to be a terrific evening. I think it's also going to be really very helpful to a person who's a very, very fine person, a very good person, a -- is going to be a wonderful candidate and a fantastic president.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Why do you like him so? You say he's a fantastic person. I mean, there are a lot of nice people in this country, but you know, that's not a reason to vote for somebody. You know...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, that's true. By the way, that is absolutely true. But I've just gotten to like him over a period of time. I like what he stands for. I like his values. I like what he represents. I like very much the fact that he understands what China is doing to this country, understands what OPEC is doing to this country.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They are really, really hurting us badly. And I think that, you know, more than anybody else, Mitt Romney understands that.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, he understands that. He doesn't agree with you about everything. He made that very plain in a sound bite, where he said that he doesn't agree with everybody who supports him and he doesn't expect everyone who supports him to agree with him. So let me turn to the sort of the electrifying issue, and that's this whole issue about birther.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You and I have disagreed about this in the past, and I assume that Governor Romney has, as well. What has brought this back up on the radar screen? This has been pretty silent for a while.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it wasn't brought up by me. It was brought up by somebody releasing a statement from the 1990s by Barack Obama, when he was not even thinking in terms of the presidency, and strongly stated that he was born in Kenya and that he was raised in Indonesia. So after that came out by Breitbart and some others who did actually a pretty good job on it, I must tell you -- but when that came out, everybody started calling me and I gave my 2 cents.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, I've always felt that there were a lot of holes in this whole situation. But he made that statement himself. And the publisher wrote it, and he wrote it down, and he -- it was -- it was going to be part of a brochure to sell a book. That's a pretty strong statement. And that was made by somebody that wasn't running for president and probably had no intention of ever running for president.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So I think it probably a very honest statement.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, well, as I've noted, you and I disagree about it. And recently, there was a fuss about whether or not President Obama would be on the ballot I think in Arizona, and there was another sort of round that preceded this business about the brochure. And Hawaii apparently convinced Arizona, if Arizona had any doubt about it, at least the representative, that he was born in the United States.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Does that -- are you still not satisfied? I mean, what is it that you want to be satisfied?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, look, it's not up to me. It has nothing to do with me. But the fact is, if he wasn't, he's not allowed to run for president. He's not allowed to be the president. So this is not up to me. This was something that came out last week. People called me about it. I gave my 2 cents. There's a lot of questions as to the authenticity of the birth certificate.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So you can believe it or you don't have to believe it, but certainly, there are many, many questions. You have had people on your show. You've heard people. There are many, many questions as to that. And we'll just have to see where all the chips fall. I can tell you that this is not an issue, despite what he says, that President Obama likes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This is hitting very close to home. This is not something that he enjoys. With all of that being said, I think it's much more important at this point to talk about what's going on with OPEC, what's going on with China, what's going on with virtually every country in the world that is just ripping the United States and making it to a point where we can in many cases not properly function.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have $16 trillion in debt soon to be, and we have to do something about it. And I would much prefer -- and you know this because I've told you this many times. I would much prefer discussing that than discussing anything else. And that's also my expertise.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But see, I think, though, that the campaign, that the President Obama campaign actually enjoys that this issue gets up and gets pinned to you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I totally disagree with you. I think they hate the subject.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, I'll tell you why.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I disagree.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I'll tell you why. Because they released a statement -- - Stephanie Cutter, who is the deputy campaign manager, just released a very strong statement referring to you as talking about disgraceful conspiracy theories, demonstrating your lack of moral leadership, calling you a charlatan and pinning that to Governor Romney as though -- as though -- because you said it that it's pinned on Governor Romney because you hold the fundraiser.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I totally disagree. I think they hate it. I think they don't like it at all. And what they're doing is saying, We love it. And frankly, I think they hate the subject, and I -- you know, I actually sort of semi know for a fact that they hate the subjection. This is not a subject that they want brought -- now, in politics...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, wait a second. But wait a minute...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... as you know, you're talking about...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... sin...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> If they want -- if you think the more important job is OPEC and jobs and China, every single time we get sort of this distraction, where we get into this sort of name-calling on both sides -- and I saw the -- I saw the fuss with Wolf Blitzer that you had on CNN -- every time we get into that, we're not talking about OPEC.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> We're not talking about jobs. We're not talking about China. We're doing all this name-calling.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But that's because you and Wolf, whose ratings are just a tiny fraction of yours, you'll be happy to know -- but that's because you and everybody want to bring this up. I don't bring it up. You didn't call me -- and you asked me if I'd do the show, I didn't ask you, and I said yes, I would do the show. And frankly, if you would have not brought up the birth certificate or the place of birth, I wouldn't be discussing it with you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Every time I speak to you or every time I speak to whoever, they bring it up. I would much prefer talking about jobs because I'm really good at that. I'd much prefer talking about the economy. I'd much prefer talking about other nations and what they're doing to us and how they're hurting us and how we can solve that problem.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But in all fairness, Greta, you brought it up, I didn't bring it up.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Indeed, I brought it up. Indeed, I witnessed the sort of the -- the showdown at the OK Corral you had with Wolf Blitzer. But it has also become part of the campaign. If you've got the deputy campaign manager issuing a statement, where -- where -- where now the Obama campaign is saying that Governor Romney lacks moral leadership in a statement -- they're now using this whole birther controversy, which is electrifying to many people -- they're now using that as a way to suggest that Governor Romney is somehow -- is -- lacks any moral leadership.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By the way, electrifying both ways because I will tell you, you have many, many, many people out there, millions and millions of people, who totally agree with it. I mean, you know, so you're not talking about electrifying one way, you're talking about both ways. Now...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I'm talking about both ways. [Crosstalk]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I'm talking about both ways.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes. It is both ways. The Obama people constantly refer to Senator McCain, who came out and strongly, you know, did certain things. Well, unfortunately, that worked out very well for Obama, not very well for Senator McCain, unfortunately. And that's the way it is. And they said, Well, why don't you do what Senator McCain did?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, maybe people shouldn't do what Senator McCain did. But again, you asked me about this. I didn't ask you. And frankly, I would much prefer talking about what to do about lots of different places throughout the world that are taking advantage of the United States because we are not doing well as a country.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> There is no question I brought it up. I don't dispute that. And you and I, of course, we disagree on this whole birther thing. But it's not exactly like, you know, you don't bring it up. I've got a tweet from today where you say, "Barack Obama is practically begging Mitt Romney to disavow this place of birth movement.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> He is afraid of it, and for good reason. He keeps using Senator John McCain as an example. However, Senator John McCain lost the election. Don't let it happen again." So you yourself bring it up on your Twitter account. So it's not like all of a sudden I've imagined this and pulled it out of the air.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But that was in response to other reporters, Greta. I mean, other reporters are asking the same question, so I have a large number of Twitter. You know, my Twitter is very large.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> It's millions. It's very large.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's millions. And frankly, people ask me to discuss certain things. But in this case, the reporters bring it up all the time, so I was responding to reporters on Twitter.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. OK. Well, and I was just sort of responding to the controversy because it is -- it has somehow morphed from an issue of -- morphed into a campaign strategy, a campaign strategy...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I actually think it's a very good issue for Mitt Romney. I actually do. Now, I may be different. And again, I'm not a politician. I'm somebody that's done very well in business. I understand what life is all about. I actually think it's a great issue for Mitt Romney, but he might not think that way.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And we certainly can disagree on that. We don't even talk about that issue, by the way. We talk about jobs. We talk about lots of other things. One of the reasons I support him, I think he's a fine person who also understands China, understands OPEC, and understands what it's going to take to bring this country back.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's really what we talk about. We don't talk about this particular issue. I don't like to use the word "birther" because I think it's very condescending to a very important issue. But you know, I think it's a very condescending term to a really very important issue. But we don't talk about that.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, well, what has happened -- I mean, it sort of -- the campaign in many ways -- we've got a lot of name-calling going back and forth. We've got George Will referring you to as a "bloviating ignoramus." We've got...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, but I know George Will and George Will is probably the most overrated political analyst there is. I mean, George Will is somebody that I have zero respect for. I don't think he's very smart. And you know, if you listen to George Will -- this all started with him six months ago, when he said the Republicans aren't going to win the election.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I took offense to that and I disagree with that. And if you look at the polls, you can understand why I would do that because the polls are doing very well and they're looking very well. So you know, George Will is not very high on my list, and he understands that.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, well, you've also called -- you tweeted about him today and saying he may be the dumbest political commentator of all time. But you know, it used to be...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There are a few others.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, but...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But he's right up there.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Actually, can I ask some -- why did you pull Rosie back into this? You pulled Rosie back into this at one point. She wasn't even part of this.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, because she referred -- she referred to me again. I only bring people -- when they go at me, I go at them. Rosie did something with me, so I did it again. Rosie likes to bring me up. You know, she hasn't got her show. It failed due to very poor ratings. She's off the air. She's sort of in never-never-land.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And she continuously talks about me. So rather than just turning a cheek, which perhaps I should do, I on occasion will refer to her.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, she seems sort of almost -- this one's sort of gratuitously -- I mean, I didn't even -- I don't... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, no, this was in reference... . I only refer -- when they say something about me, I say something about them. This was in reference to what she said. This was not brought up by me.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, let's go back to...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By the way, Rosie did start that whole thing, so -- and I...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> This one? This one?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She truly wishes -- just so you understand, she truly wishes she hadn't.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You know, I got so many notes in front of me, people going back and forth, calling each other names, whether it's getting -- you getting a charlatan. They're trying to pin it on Romney. This is the Obama campaign, George Will calling you a "bloviating ignoramus." Then you've got -- you're calling someone a loser.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> It's sort of hard to keep track. It almost feels like we're -- you know, we've really gotten off the sort of the -- off the issues about...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, again, Greta, you continuously talk about this. You know, I really...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I brought it up.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I thought we were going to be talking about the economy and jobs and other countries...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> We did.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... and what they're doing to us.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> We did.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And you just sort of like this subject and -- well, we did -- we talked about that for about what, 20 seconds, and we talked about the rest for the entire show. But whatever is good for your show is good for me because I happen to think your show is terrific.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, let me go back to the whole issue of jobs and the economy. You know, is -- you know, is -- do you see any sort of trending in the right direction? Is there anything that, like, gives you sort of a sense, like, OK, this is good?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, I don't think we're doing well as a country. I don't think we're creating jobs. I think the numbers are false numbers. I think the numbers are very bad because if somebody's looking for a job and they give up, we take them off the unemployment roll. We take them off the numbers so you're not really looking at real numbers when they get it down to 8.2 and 8.3. It's not -- those are not the real numbers.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And it's almost like they're just creating lists for the sake of creating lists. So, you know, I feel very strongly that, unfortunately, the country is not doing well. We're losing jobs to other countries through lots of different things. If you're running a credit card company, it's very possible that India is referring your New York credit card person to -- that you're talking to somebody from India.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, we outsource our jobs instead of having them -- why, we can't have them in this country? So if you look what's going -- if you look at what's going on with respect to our country, we are certainly not doing very well. And when you hear 8.2 and 8.3 percent, well, that's not very good. The number is far worse than that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The number could be as high as 18 or 19 percent, Greta, and that's a horrible number.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, if -- if your candidate, Governor Mitt Romney, is elected in November, sworn in in January, I'm curious to what extent, looking -- stepping back and looking at the economy, and how much it's like an aircraft carrier, that it takes so much to sort of turn and -- you know, and get some progress -- I mean, how soon, if your candidate is sworn in in January, will we see the economy show a significant rebound?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Because I assume you think he will do that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do think so. I think that he'd do a lot of very, very powerful things with respect to China. We have all the cards. People don't know that. I think that he'd do a lot of very powerful things with respect to other countries, and also OPEC. And I think he'd open up energy very quickly. Look at the jobs that can be created.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have -- we didn't realize this two, three, four years ago. We have energy right under our feet. We can't get it. I think he'd open up jobs very, very rapidly with respect to energy, get fuel prices down, get oil down, and that will be a tremendous boon for the economy. So I think a lot of things can happen quickly.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think this is a country with tremendous potential, unbelievable potential, but we're not using it. Regulation, so many different things that are happening are so bad for this country, not to mention high taxes. So you know, I really believe that it can happen quickly. The potential of this country is enormous, if we'd let it go.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Indeed, let it go. And maybe even if we can sort of bury some of these unusual disagreements. By the way, do you like a good fight? I'm curious how you endure all this.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I've always liked a good fight. I think it's a fight that's a very important fight. You know, some people don't think so, but I think it's an important fight because, you know, essentially, you're right down to the basics. The answer is if you're not born here, you can't be president. So it's not like, Oh, gee, let's not discuss it. But a lot of people -- and I think you know this as well as I do, millions and millions of people happen to agree with me, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, I know that a lot do. But I'm just curious -- let me get back to this... What would it take to convince you otherwise? I know that you're -- are you convinced he wasn't born here or are you suspicious?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think that it's more likely that he wasn't born here. But I would also say that if you look at his college records, they may have some good information on his college records that would say place of birth, and it would be very interesting to see what happened. I think that that was a real killer last week when it was announced that when it was released that in the 1990s, he said he was born in Kenya.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, he said it. His grandmother said it. His mother didn't spend time in the hospital. It's hard to have babies when you don't spend time in the hospital. So you know, there are a lot of things, Greta, that are very suspicious and you know, it's a big issue, a big issue. Took him a long time to release the so-called birth certificate.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Didn't do it for McCain. Didn't do it for Hillary Clinton. Did do it for Donald Trump. Did do it. You know, I'm very proud of that, and you know that, and I got a lot of credit for that and probably some scorn, but I got a lot of credit for that.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Hypothetically, is there anything that he could produce that would convince you that he was born in Hawaii? Is there some sort of singular document or piece of evidence or any other information you could think that could defeat your suspicion or even your thoughts he was born elsewhere?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sure. Good, solid proof would be wonderful.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Like what, though?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And so far -- so far, they haven't been able to do that. You know, good, solid proof. And let's get back to jobs. Go ahead, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Good, solid proof.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I'll take that cue is that that's the end. Thank you, Donald. And talk to you soon. [End Video Clip]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you very much.
