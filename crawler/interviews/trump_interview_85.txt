<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Mr. President, word broke late today, early this evening that there might be some tentative deal struck to avert a government shutdown. What can you tell us?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I can tell you that a lot of things have changed and we'll see what happens. I can't go into the exact deal. I just heard it very quickly coming over to see you. It was between the -- the deal and you and I had to choose you because I had no choice. Right? And I'm very happy I did. But, yes, they're talking and we'll see what happens.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> There's an opposing rally kind of going on at the same time as this rally tonight. Beto O'Rourke, young kind of up and comer they say in the Democrat party. He and others say the wall is really about hate and racism to -- to that you say what?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well to that I say, number one very few people showed up to his rally and this place is packed with thousands and thousands outside and I guess he challenged us to an event. So maybe this means he's going to have to drop out of the race because this was not a good situation for him. I don't know why he did it and it has nothing to do with anything other than safety for the Americans, safety for our people, safety for our country and a wall is a very good thing not a bad thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a moral thing to put it in the opposite terms and we have tremendous support. We're building it right now. We don't even say build the wall anymore. We say finish the wall because we've built a lot and we're renovating a tremendous amount of old stuff that was really in bad shape but it had good structure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we're saying finish the wall. No, walls are very important. If you don't have it, all the technology Laura, all of the drones that they have flying around so nicely up in the air, they don't mean a thing.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> What about all those border sheriffs? The ones at -- at the border, mayors, they always say, oh no, we don't need a wall. We're safe. They were challenging some of your statistics on El Paso and Juarez had had a terrible year last year for murders, another one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well first of all, Juarez is like the murders are tremendous and here they're very few. They are not correct. They know they're not correct.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> They say their crime is low. Low -- low before the wall.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Their crime was -- was very high and then the wall got built and, you know, really you should talk about the sheriffs that agree with me which are like 98 percent of the sheriffs in the country maybe all of them.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Detention beds, they threw that out. Oh, we're going to reduce the number of detention beds. What -- what was that all about?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well when you do that and the Democrats came up with that because that means that you don't detain people that are very dangerous. That means you have to put them out into our society because our laws are so bad. And if you look at what happened and what's been passed over the years in Congress, it's a shame.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a disgrace. That means we can't just put them back into Mexico or where they came. We have to put them back into our society. In some cases they're stone cold criminals. We can't do that.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Another good piece of economic news came out today, personal confidence in the economy. I think it's at a 16 year high.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> With that -- why are so many millennials gravitating and some holes towards socialism over capitalism? And what can you do to reinvigorate their understanding of the free market?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I think they're, number one, they're young. They're idealistic if you call it idealistic. I think that capitalism is more of an ideal. But if you look at the poll numbers, you look at the kind of numbers that we have it's been great. I hit my all time high today, 52 percent and that's with only bad strories because the press only gives me bad stories.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You treat me fairly.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Were you surprise when some Democrats didn't stand up when you asked that question at the State of the Union about socialism? Are we -- we're never going to be a socialist country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Not everybody stood up.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because that's where they're coming from. When I see some of the responses, when I see some of the statements made by Congressmen and women I -- I say am -- are we living in the United States of America. Look, we have a country that's doing the best it's ever done. We are just lapping the world, you compare, you know, it used to be like we were a second sister to China.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now China's looking up to us. We are doing so well and other countries are not doing well and that makes it tougher for us in a certain way because we do business with other countries. But we're setting records in so many ways including record unemployment meaning in a positive way. Meaning --
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> But they always say, well Obama started that and then they'll say this income inequality. That's the new buzz word. You're going to hear that a lot in 2020. Income inequality, let all the young freshman Congressman and some of the -- some of the candidates in 2020 are really gravitating toward that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I would have stayed with what President Obama did, you look at his last month. You look at what happened the first months coming into my term they were very low, the numbers, the GDP and everything else. If I would have stayed with those numbers Laura, we would have had an economy that would have been going way in reverse right now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We opened it up. We got rid of regulations that were unnecessary. We did the biggest tax cuts we've ever done in our country. We opened up the oil. We opened -- you know we're the largest oil exporter now. We're the largest oil and gas in the world right now. Nobody thought that was possible this quickly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, we opened up our country. We're letting people work again. We have more people working today, almost 160 million people, we have more people working today than have ever worked in the United States. It's great.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> And you know, we didn't have some people stand for that at the State of the Union. You said record low unemployment and --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well --
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> What does that tell you about -- are they -- I got lots of texts. They're trying to paralyze our economy with investigations, all these oversights. You're getting hammered, I know --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> -- with requests for documents and so forth which is part of the oversight.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What's happening to me --
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> What's going on there?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. What's happened to me should never be allowed to happen to another president. With investigations on things that never took place, like Russia. You know, the Russia collusion, delusion we call it. I call it a hoax and in fact it was very nice Richard Burr came out after almost two years of investigation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They found absolutely no collusion between Trump and the Russia which I could have told a lot of people and which I have been saying to a lot of people. This has never happened to -- it's -- the Democrats know it's a hoax. This is a political game. So now the Russia thing is dead and now they say, well we're going to look at every company that Donald Trump was ever -- they don't have any information on anything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to look at every company that Donald Trump was ever involved in. I did great. I made a lot of money. Now they want to go back and investigate every company. We want to go -- and we have, I think 79 different letters from different committees --
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> How are you going to respond to these letters?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well for the most part they've conflicted. I got one from --
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> Meaning?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- I got one from Pocahontas today where it said that Donald Trump, we want to investigate some company that -- it's so disgraceful. I said, just write her back and say she's got a conflict of interest. OK? And she should focus more on her heritage and not being ashamed of what she is. She should really focus on herself.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we've gotten letters Laura from so many committees.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't know we had so many committees. I think it's up to 79 letters. This is based on no information of any wrongdoing because I'm a very straight person.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> African-Americans --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we went through this whole Russian hoax, nobody's ever done what I did where I was hit with this. Now, think of this. Hit with it and we probably had the greatest first two years of any president in our history in terms of what we've accomplished with employment, with GDP, with everything. And companies are moving back into our country which is one of the great steps.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> African-American's in this country, what would you say to the young African-American today in Virginia who's seeing the turmoil in that state? And just in -- in -- and what's the kind of understand what the race issue is like pummeling us on all sides?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. Terrible situation. I think that the Republicans are going to do very well in Virginia. I think a lot of things are happening in Virginia. I didn't campaign in Virginia because I was said -- I was told that a Republican can't --
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Not much. A few stops.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Virtually not but, yeah I started looking at numbers I said why aren't I there? But -- but I didn't, you know, they -- they sort of assumed that's a Democrat state and as you know I did very well there without having gone. I think Virginia's ready to flip over to something. I tell you African-Americans are coming to the Republican party like nobody can believe.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A lot of things are happening, a lot of very positive things.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> Does Northam resign?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I watched his news conference, it was pretty sad. It was a sad -- look, let them figure out what to do. But I -- I felt actually -- I felt sorry for his wife and his wife saved him from doing, as you know, Michael Jackson. He was going to try and imitate Michael Jackson with the moonwalk. Nobody can imitate Michael with the moonwalk and this would not have been a pretty -- you add that little couple of seconds of footage onto what he did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it was -- it was a pretty bad situation.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Thank you very much for being here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> We have Donald Trump on the phone here. I just want to let everybody know, we ask every other candidate, You want to call in and you want to come on this show
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump joins us now.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Donald, congratulations.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Yes, congratulations, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> A big, big night for you last night. You outperformed, I think what most people thought you were going to do. And so, the question we've had for the past hour and half is:
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> [Note: Video Begins Here] Are you at a stage in your campaign where you are ready to move and start making peace with the Republican Party, start making peace with Megyn Kelly, start making peace with people that -- that you have been in battle with for the past six months or so?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, yeah, I think the party -- not Megyn Kelly, I'm not interested in that. But I think with the party, yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I've been called by many, many people that are on the are with you, saying, you know, Donald Trump, we have to get somebody else. And yet, they're calling me at the top level. I don't know what establishment means. I guess I was a member of the establishment nine months ago, Joe, eight months ago.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you know, whatever the establishment is, who can define establishment? I don't there is -- I don't think there is such a thing.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> But do you -- you do understand you need to make the turn, though, right? It's time to make peace with the party.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, no, I'm fine -- I'm fine with a turn. At the same time, we don't want to lose the edge, because we still do have two more people left, and you know, I think we're doing very well. We had a very big evening yesterday -- actually including the islands, as you know. We won -- we picked up nine -- nine with the islands.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have -- I guess we're five -- we picked up five yesterday, five wins yesterday, and that's pretty good. So, we were very happy with yesterday. That turned out to be great.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Hey, Donald, good morning. It's Willie.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi, Willie.
<Willie Geist> <Positive> Congratulations on last night. I was struck watching you, though, come up on stage as you walked out at Mar-a-Lago. You just cleaned up in four out of the five states.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> And the first thing you started talking about was that you had been slighted by somebody -- a pundit, I don't know what network you were talking about, talking about the poll numbers, and they had misstated how well you were doing.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Why do you get caught up in all of that stuff? Why are -- why are you worried about what we say, why are you worried about what Fox says?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, that was -- Willie, that wasn't said in anger. That was just...
<Willie Geist> <Negative> No, not...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... a little bit of a mathematics lesson.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> I understand. But there you were standing, you should be basking in your victory, and you're worried about the minutiae of cable punditry. Why do you care?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look, you're the only ones bringing it up. The fact is that it was not done out of anger, it was done just to talk about -- let's talk about mathematics, I was always very good at mathematics.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When they say, he has not hit 50, well, actually I have, but I haven't -- when you have four people and six people in a race, it's almost impossible to hit 50, very hard to hit 50. And I just wanted to explain that to people, because they never say that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And when you look at the numbers, the numbers are, you know, amazing. When I'm at 45 percent and I have four people in a race, that's a lot. You know, that is really pretty amazing. And then you have some of those people at 10 and 15.
<Willie Geist> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And when they leave, I'll get it.
<Willie Geist> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's the other thing. They'll say, I'm at 45 and the rest are at 55.
<Willie Geist> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If the other people leave, they would get 55.
<Willie Geist> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, no, because when the other people leave, I'm going to get a lot of their votes. People never say that.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> No, I -- Donald, I get -- I get the math, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, it wasn't done in anger, it was just done as a little education.
<Willie Geist> <Positive> I get the math, Donald, and you're right about the math. I just wonder why you'd take that precious time at a moment like that to pick out some pundit on some network that you saw.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> When you've had a big night.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah. I don't call it precious time. I mean, I just -- I mean, you have to say something. What else? I'll talk about the weather?
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> No, talk about your big victory.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> About the [Inaudible] of the country.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Your big victory and the future of the country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it was a good victory, I talked about that also. I mean, we had a -- we had a really wonderful night, we had a really tremendous success. The Florida numbers were far greater than anybody though possible.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> It's incredible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, you were against a very popular person in Florida, the state of Florida, and to have that kind of a victory where you win by just about 20 points is -- was pretty amazing.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Nothing...
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> So, what do you have to say about Marco Rubio? He has left the race.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Would he be a guy that you would consider as a vice president if you were in that position?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Now can you answer that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's just too early, you know, I just want to get it done. I'm a closer, I like closing deals first. I don't like to talk about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And -- and you know, but I've liked him until about three weeks ago, when he started getting nasty. I mean, wow, he really got nasty.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then, the problem is, I get nastier than him, and then I win, and then, you know, my numbers get hurt a little bit because you're so -- you're so tough that people don't necessarily like it. But you do what you have to do. You know, we have to win.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But he -- you know, I was very surprised when he started doing his Don Rickles routine on me, and it didn't work for him. It just didn't work.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Mark Halperin.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And he knows that, he admitted that it didn't work.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Yeah. He does.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it was a big mistake.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Halperin.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> Mr. Trump, congratulations on your victories last night.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. And thank you for your nice words, yesterday. That was very nice.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> It has been reported that you talked to Senator McConnell. Am I right that you have talked to some other leading Republicans in the last few days?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> Including some Senate -- senators or Senate candidates?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> Who did you talk to and what were those discussions about?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I can't tell you, but I talked to people that you have on your show all the time talking about, Donald Trump, we have to stop him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I don't mean, I called them. They called me. You...
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> What kind -- why can't you tell us who it is?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You have people -- you have people on this show all the time that are talking about stopping Donald Trump, who are calling me to work out a deal where they want to become involved.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because they see things here -- and they say this -- they see things here that they have never, ever seen in the Republican Party.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, the big story is the number of people going out to vote in the primaries. Nobody's ever seen it before. We're up 72 percent or something and after yesterday -- because the numbers in Florida were through the roof. They had lines that were five blocks long. A woman who worked in one of the polling booths said, You know
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it's been an amazing -- it's been an amazing thing. No. People want to come together and they are calling me [Inaudible]...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> So...
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Do you think you can bring those people together?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so. Well, I watch your show and I watch other shows and I read things, I read a lot and I see people making statements and then I have them on the phone calling me wanting to get together and we have very good conversations...
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Welcome to politics.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... and then I'll see them, you know, continuing, but they -- no, they want to come together, Joe.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> OK.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> So Donald, you have been pretty confident that you can do this from the get go. I think people now are realizing you are on a path to the nomination. Who are you talking to consistently? Since we have some dire foreign policy issues percolating around the world right now, who are consulting with consistently so that you're ready on day one?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. In fact, in my book in 2000, I talked about Osama bin Laden and I do remember somebody putting the book in front of Joe and Joe saying no way he talked about it, no way he wrote about Osama bin Laden before the World Trade Center came down. And they said no, he really did. And I remember Joe looking at it and saying, I don't believe it
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I know what I'm doing and I listen to a lot of people. I talk to a lot of people, and at the appropriate time, I'll tell you who the people are. But I speak to a lot of people...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> How would you...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> but my primary consultant is myself and I have -- you know, I have a good instinct for this stuff.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> How would you describe Trump's foreign policy? Like earlier in the show, someone said neo-isolationist. How would you describe it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't say that at all. I was -- you know, they like to say that. Speaking with my very good friend Howard Stern, you know, long before the start of the war, I sort of said, Well
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The fact is I was opposed to the war in Iraq. It was a horrible mistakes. At the same time, now that you have ISIS, we have to take ISIS out. I mean, they're -- they're cutting heads. They're -- they're drowning people in cages and they're looking to do serious damage. I mean, if they ever had -- you know, the problem you have today is weaponry. If we had -- you know, if this was 50 years ago or 100 years ago when you fought by -- by gun and by sword, I would have never -- I would have been out of there so fast, but the problem is you can't allow somebody to get the big weaponry...
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So -- so does that mean a ground -- does that mean a ground war, ground troops?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll tell you what it means. It means we have to take ISIS out and I would consult with very good people. I would consult with the best people and I would determine...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> You'll let us know who at some point?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... but we may -- we may need that. I would much prefer getting some of the -- some of the other nations of our world involved and let them do something for a change. I see where Russia backed out yesterday, which was interesting.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, it's a very expensive process. People don't realize. It is a very, very expensive process and I can just imagine Putin with oil prices low and every time he drops a bomb, it costs a million dollars or something and he's saying, wow, because, you know, that happened to them once before in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is the thing that broke up the Soviet Union. The cost of Afghanistan was enormous. So I can just see Putin saying this is more expensive than I thought and he gets out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, at some point we have to get back to rebuilding our country. Not rebuilding, to start to build it because our country is crumbling. [Video Ends]
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right. Donald Trump, we're being told, Donald, that you have another hit. We will let you go. Thank you so much for being with us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Congratulations.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Congratulations on a big night last night.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
