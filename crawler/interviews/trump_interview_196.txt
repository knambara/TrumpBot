<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> One of the big things you talked about during the primaries. We had interviews about this and you talked about the debates, 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country. They've got to go. The good ones can come back in, you said, a door in the wall, the good ones can come back in. It's going to be done humanely, you said.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> There will be a deportation force. That's no longer -- it seems there's been contradictory statements lately, but that seemed like they're no longer your policy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't even know --
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Is that your policy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let me just tell you what my policy is, and I'm not going to go into all of it because we're doing a speech on immigration which I think will explain it in even greater detail. But we're going to build a great wall. The wall will be paid for by Mexico. People are not going to be able to tunnel because we're going to have tunnel technology.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to have all sorts of things, there's going to be a real wall. Drugs will stop flowing into our nation and poisoning our youth and everybody else. We're going to have all sorts of E-verify and everything you can think of in terms of immigration. People will not come into our country illegally.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to fix that. We are going to make it like it's never been before. I don't know if you know, but the border patrol agent, 16,500 border patrol agents endorsed Donald Trump. They've never done that for a president before because they're great people that want to do their job. They don't want to stand there and watch people pour through our borders.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Eleven million who are here?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me explain. We're going to build a wall. We're going to build a real wall, a wall that absolutely works and they do absolutely work if it's done properly. Right now, it's a joke. You have walls that are this high. That's number one. We are going stop illegal immigration pouring into our country. My first day in office, I am going to notify law enforcement authorities that all of the bad dudes, and we have a lot of them, that are here illegally, that are the heads of gangs and drug cartels and all sorts of people --
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> People -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Probably millions of them, but certainly hundreds of thousands. Big numbers. They're out. They're out. Excuse me, the police know who they are. I've spoken to many police. The police know who they are. They deal with them all of the time. They're nothing, but problems.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> You talked --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We are going to end sanctuary cities. We are going to run a country like it's supposed to be run. We're going to have borders, very strong borders. And after that, we're going to see what happens, but we are going to find people and we're getting immediately, and I mean, first hour of my -- the first document I will sign will say get the bad ones out of this country, bring them back where they came --
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> You know, I've got to follow up. You said on Hannity, you used the word softening and last night on Hannity, you talked about --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't think it's a softening. I think it's --
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But 11 million people are no longer being deported.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, I've had people say it's a hardening, actually.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But 11 million who have not committed a crime.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. We're then going --
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> There's going to be a path to legalization, is that right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know it's a process. You can't take 11 at one time and just say, boom, you're gone. We have to find where these people are. Most people don't even -- nobody even knows if it's 11. It could be 30 or and it could be five. Nobody knows what the number is. I'll tell you what we know, let me explain --
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But if somebody hasn't committed a crime, will they be deported?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me tell you what, we know the bad ones. We know where they are, who they are, we know the drug cartel people. We know the gangs and the heads of the gangs and the gang members. Those people are gone.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> But that's a huge number.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's not --
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But that's Jeb Bush's policy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know anything about Jeb Bush. He wasn't building a wall. Jeb Bush wasn't building a wall. Jeb Bush wasn't making strong borders, and I'm not knocking Jeb Bush, but I was with him for a long time.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Right, but he was mocked for saying that, look, you can't deport 11 million people and it now seems like, I know you're not really focusing --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> First, I want to see what's going to happen. We are going to deport many people, many, many people.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> The vast majority of those 11 million are not criminals.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we don't know. We're going to find out who they are. We have crime all over this country.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> If they haven't committed a crime, will there be a path to legalization?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. There is no pass -- there is no path to legalization, unless people leave the country --
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> You talked about paying back taxes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, when they come back in, if they come back in, then they can start paying taxes.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> So, they still have to leave the country?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There is no path to legalization, unless they leave the country and come back.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> So that means of the 11 million who are here, even if they haven't committed a crime.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you don't know -- you keep saying 11 million. You don't know what the number is. You know, millions of people --
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> However many, that's the estimate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- and using the existing laws of our country, and using the existing laws, millions of people are deported every year.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know that, right? People don't talk about that. It's Obama. They don't talk about that.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A lot of people being deported. We're going to do that vigorously, we're going to go with the laws that are existing, but we're going to have a very strong border and we're not going to have people pouring back in. And when these people, the drug lords and all of these guys that are thrown out, they're not coming back into the country.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> So, if you haven't committed a crime and you've been here for 15 years and you have a family here and you have a job here, will you be deported?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to see what happens once we strengthen the border. We're going to have a strong border, as strong as any border there is anywhere in the world. We're going to have a real wall and tremendous protection, both technological protection and everything else, and then we're going to see what happens.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But there is a very good chance the answer could be yes, we'll see what happens and before we do anything, I want to get rid of the bad ones, there are a lot of them. I want to get rid of all of the bad ones and that will be the single first order I sign. We are going to stop. Right now, I'm in New Hampshire, you saw the crowd, you saw the enthusiasm.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I won the primary in New Hampshire. The people of New Hampshire asked me one favor, "Please, Mr. Trump, stop the drugs from coming across the southern border." You have heroin that's pouring across the southern border and destroying the youth and other people in New Hampshire and every other state. We're going to stop all drug trafficking.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's not going to happen anymore. We're going to stop it. We're going to have a strong border. We're going to have a tremendous wall. We're going to have a wall that Mexico pays for, which will be very easy because they are making a fortune with us, the wall is peanuts compared to the money that they make.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We are going to have a border again. We are not going to allow drugs to come into this country and poison our youth, and then we're going to see what happens. But there's no legalization. There's no amnesty. And if someone wants to go the legalization route, what they'll do is they'll go leave the country, hopefully come back in, and then we can talk.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And one other thing, there are millions of people right now online trying to come into our country. It's very unfair to them, some of the rules, regulations and policies that I've seen. These are millions of people that want to come into our country legally and it would be very unfair to them.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> You called last night Hillary Clinton a bigot. Previously you called her policies bigoted, you directly called her a bigoted.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, she is a bigot, because when you look at what's happening to the inner cities and you look at what's happening to African-Americans and Hispanics in this country where she talks all of the time, she talking look at the vets where she said the vet are being treated essentially just fine and that it's over exaggerated what's happening to the vets, not so long ago.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> How is she bigoted, bigoted is ... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because she's selling them down the tubes. Because she's not doing anything for those communities. She talks a good game.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> So, you think she has hatred or dislike of black people?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Her policies are bigoted because she knows they're not going to work.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But you're saying she is personally bigoted?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh she is, of course, she is. They're her policies, she's comes up with the policies and others that believe like she does also, but she came out with policies over the years. This is over the years, a long time. She's totally bigoted, there's no question about it.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> It does imply that she doesn't -- she has antipathy, she has hated toward or in this case ... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think she has been extremely, extremely bad for African- Americans, I think she's been extremely bad for Hispanics. You look at what happens to her policies and the policies of President Obama and others. Look at the poverty. Look at the rise in poverty. Look at the rise in violence.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But hatred is at the core of that or dislike of African- Americans?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Or maybe she's lazy. I don't know what it is. All I can tell you is I've been hearing the same stuff from her and others for years and the inner cities today are worse than they ever have been.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Have you always thought she was bigoted though, I mean you were support her in that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Honestly I never thought of it, I never thought. As a business person I never thought of it. I got along with all politicians. But she got a long ...
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> She has a history of working ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Anderson as you know, working, but not doing the job, and I'm now bringing it out for the first time. She hasn't done the job.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> So the overwhelming number of African-Americans who support her, what did they ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, take a look at what's happened over the last two weeks since I've been talking about the subject. Take a look at what's happened, take a look at your most recent polls. I mean the ones over the last 3 or 4 ...
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Do you think it would make a difference, you can get a higher number among African-Americans?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I think we're going to do well with the African-Americans, because they're going to give me a chance, because frankly look what she's done, what to give a chance, I mean she's been a disaster. The inner cities are worse than they've ever been. You have 40 percent rates of poverty. You have black youth that can't get jobs, 58 percent can't get jobs, education is a disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They've been talking about this since I was 5 years old and understood what was going on. They have been talking about this for years. Hillary Clinton talks about it all of the time. She has done a horrible job, and then you add all of the scandal and the lies and the deception to the e-mails, she should be in jail.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> What ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hillary Clinton should be in jail. You know it. The FBI director knows it, everybody else knows it, she should be in jail. What she did with erasing 33,000 e-mails, she shouldn't be out even talking about inner cities or running for president.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> One of the things you've been saying recently in talking to African-Americans addressing them in large rallies is saying what have you got to lose? What the hell have you got to lose?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely. That's the way I look at it.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> The way you've been categorizing though we've been, you know, interviewing a lot of African-American voters, some of them are insulted by some of the language you've been using.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think they are. I think if they actually heard me they wouldn't be insulted at all.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> What you're saying ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I actually take them ...
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> ... you get shot in your street, you don't have jobs, you don't have schools.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Excuse -- well that's the fact. They're shot on their streets. Look at Chicago.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But for the vast majority of African-Americans that's not -- I mean vast majority do not live in poverty.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> 40 percent are living in poverty, we just say ...
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> 46 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... that's a pretty big -- well I have 40. I have a different stat than you do.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> The Conservative Foundation has 26 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have 40 percent, whether it's 26 or 40. Look, you can look at it any way and I know you want to protect her as much as you possible can.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> No, I'm not ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But let me just tell you, Anderson. She has done a horrible job, her policies don't work, it's a disaster for African-Americans and you see what's happening because many of them who watch my speeches are saying, you know, he's right. They've been doing this for 50, 60, 70 years and I say what do you have to lose.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Some of you ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'll tell you something, not only what do you have to lose, I will fix it.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Some of the African-American supporters that we talked said they would like you to go into an African-American church or direct can talking to ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm going to do that very soon. In fact, I'm going to Detroit and I'll be going to some other places. I've been invited to many. I'll be doing that very soon.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> So you -- that's definitely something you are going to do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh I'm going to do it, yeah sure, I look forward to. In fact, I think I'm doing it over the next two weeks, I'm a doing a couple of visits.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> How much improvement do you think you can make with the African-American vote?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can only tell you, I can only tell you I can fix the inner cities, but she can't ...
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Let me talk ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... is she isn't -- not only can't she, she doesn't have a chance.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> I want to start by what Hillary Clinton is now coming at you with. I talked to her last night. She called into my show. She said you are bringing hate mainstream by embracing the so-called Alt-Right Movement, that you're peddling bigotry, prejudice and paranoia.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, first of all, we are bringing love. You see these rooms. They are packed with people that have been just left behind. I call it the Forgotten Men and Women. They have been left behind Anderson by people like her who are third rate politicians who talk and they don't produce. You look at our inner cities, our inner cities are a disaster and the African-American people are realizing that the Democrats who have run these inner cities for 75 and 100 years, they just left them.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Are you embracing the Alt-Right movement? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody even knows what it is. And she didn't know what it was. This is a term that was just given that frankly, there's no Alt- Right or Alt-Left. All I'm embracing is common sense.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> But Steve Bannon said Breitbart is sort of the voice of the Alt-Right Movement.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know what Steve said. All I can tell you, I can only speak for myself. You see the crowds we have, you see the enthusiasm, I know these are great people. These are people that have not been heard for many years and now they have been heard. First time in many, many decades. In fact, some people say the first time, period.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think we are going to do very well. You see what's going on with the polls over the last three or four days. I think we are going to do very well. But ...
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> I want to read.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... she is somebody that's all talk, no action. Look at the lies, look at the deception, look at what's happened with her e-mails, look at the erasing of 33,000 e-mails. She should be ashamed of herself. She should get back to work for the people. She doesn't do that.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> I want to read you one more thing she said today in her speech. She said, this is what I want to make clear today, a man with a long history of racial discrimination who traffics in dark conspiracy theories drawn from the pages of supermarket tabloids and the far reaches of the internet should never run our government or command our military.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's an incorrect statement. First of all, we were sued many, many years ago when I was very young by the government, sued many, many companies. You know that. It wasn't me. They sued many companies.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> The company was sued for not allowing black people ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know what, they found nothing. They found absolutely nothing.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> You settled.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They bring up the case. I settled, with no awards, no nothing.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Assume people in your company use the word C ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't even know. Honestly, what a superintendent does in a building, that I can't tell you. But I can just tell you that they settled the case and that was the end of it. It was many years ago. And I guess they found we did nothing wrong because we didn't have to do anything. We didn't have any payments to make, we didn't have to pay $20 million in fines.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We didn't have any ...
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> You didn't pay any money in order to settle?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is a long time ago but I don't believe so, no.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Mr. Trump, you lost a couple of pounds. Sit down I can't hear you. He's TV thin, he's TV thin.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> He's TV thin.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He's TV thin.
<Artie Lange> <Positive> Yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Now let me ask you something, does he always wear a pink tie?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You always wear a pink tie number one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You do not?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, very seldom.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You look good
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Really if it's an important occasion like this [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What did you do? You lost some weight, be honest.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would say maybe five founds, nothing spectacular.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> This was the gain weight after the wedding.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So much television does that you --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, yeah. You look good or there's something, you look good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You look good too even if you have a cold I guess.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Don't worry I won't go near you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no I don't care.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, no.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I heard you this morning saying you had a cold.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I have a cold, I tried, thought you were late. I thought you were not gonna show up when you heard I had a cold.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, well.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You were just as nuts as I am.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't dress. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah yeah, I know.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He's wearing a mask. You just can't see it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> See, if you're strong you won't get it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm around people with colds all the time. If you have a strong immune system, it won't ... I ... I got caught. I got caught at a low point. I didn't get enough sleep. And that's what happened. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay, but what about the whole shaking hands thing? I mean I have a guy come up to me the other day sneezing all over the place he greets me, he's saying, 'Donald Hello.' You know it's terrible it's just terrible.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's how I got this. My father was sick and he touched me.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And the first time he ever tried to touch you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> My kids made him touch me. [Inaudible] They said why don't you put your arm around your son? That's when I got it. That's what happened.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, it's usually hand to hand. I mean if you just touch your clothing I don't think you should be sick.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know, it's good to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's nice to see you, [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know I like seeing you 'cause you're honest.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You come in here. You talk about everything I see all over the place trash and Dan Rather...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Brutally honest
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And I like that. You know I admire that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Dan was not too great.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You hated him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He did something [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no... He did something to you. He had me on '60 Minutes' and he did nothing but be nice to me and he was great. And then all of a sudden, at the end, I go on and he starts to do numbers like, 'you're a vicious, horrible human being, why...' [Inaudible] It was just a question. Is this the same guy that was just so nice to me? He's terrible and you know I never understood, he got such bad ratings.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's true.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> How did the guy who was number three for years stay on the air?So he's got something. I think he has something on the officials over at CBS.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Did you ever walk up to him face to face after he did this number on you and say, 'You are a scumbag.'?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Many times.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You did?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah many times. I didn't see him at George Steinbrenner box.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'd give him the finger about two feet away.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Do things that [Inaudible[actually people that were with me couldn't even believe what was happening.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You would be sitting there in the box...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> ... The guest of Mr. Steinbrenner.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And Dan Rather would be aghast. And he would flip him the bird that is stand there and hold it up to him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely correct.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow. And what would he do?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He would do nothing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Nothing?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And he'd call and say, 'Donald, let's get together. Let's have lunch and we really ought to get together.'
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah and I'd say, 'No, thank you.' And, he would do everything possible to be nice but it didn't matter because when the game was on, he wasn't nice.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. When you need him...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He unfair.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> When -- Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, I don't care about -- you know -- guys. But he was unfair.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He was unfair to you because he was acting one way off-camera and then acted another way on-camera.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Exactly.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well that's how I feel about Katie Couric.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, it's the same thing that happened to you. When she gives you a hard time?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, I ... I very rarely do these interviews because who needs them? I got my own radio show. I don't need to be interviewed.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I interview myself all day. I'm sick of hearing myself. To be honest with you. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So I, I walked in. It was... My movie was coming out and I agreed to do everything. And I bet today's show wanted an exclusive. I gave it to them, I walked in Katie Couric says, 'I got to tell you something... I love you.' I said, 'Thank you.' She goes, 'I saw your movie. It was fantastic. I loved this movie.' I said, 'Thank you.' And the camera goes on and she starts in with me, 'You're disgusting, obscenity, and decency, FCC' I said, 'Let's talk about the movie. Didn't you just tell me off-camera that you loved the movie? 'I never said that. I never said that,' she said. I said, 'Get out of here.' [Inaudible] 'Get out.'
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Leave your studio.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Leave your own studio. I couldn't believe it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Wow.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And look at at your wedding. She snuck in a camera. You said, 'No cameras.' And she snuck -- Did you have her thrown out?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she did... No, I didn't have her thrown out. I heard about it a little bit later. But, she was fun. You know, it does happen. Actually, I remember that with you. It was pretty violent, right?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Violent. Terrible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was pretty vicious. Well the same thing happened to me and Dan Rather, I mean it was the exact same thing, 'Donald, there's nobody like you. You're my favorite entrepreneur, you're the greatest guy in the country...' Then the camera goes on, and all of a sudden it's like, trash time, so --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I like that you gave him the finger. I like that you walked up to him face to face, and told him off and that was it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now how is the marriage going? I'm wondering if it's still hot or are you really...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hot.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Very hot.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She looks good. I got to tell you, I keep checking the newspaper, every picture, to make sure she doesn't hit the wall.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You're going to be there that day, huh? You're gonna check. You're gonna make sure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will. You know she has great beauty but she's a great beauty inside which is almost as important. [Inaudible] Not really, not probably. [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, but in a way she might go completely
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Probably not.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> Almost as important...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Be honest with me, I want you to... 'Cause you've always been honest.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I want you to be hypothetical
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Melania is in a horrible car accident, and I don't wish this on her. You know that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I've, I've spent time with her. She' a lovely woman.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Luckily she survives.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She survives.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, she likes you too.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. She survives.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. Fairly.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Her body -- Nope. Her body is fine except for the fact that her left arm is paralyzed now.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It's useless.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It hangs there like a slab of meat.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> On her face now, because of the hundred stitches she received to her face. Most of her face was intact except on the left side. Her eye. There was a big red blotch, and it oozes... [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh, dear.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right, true.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Quite constantly. The doctors can't do anything for it. So aside from the gimpy arm --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> The left eye oozes, and the fact that her foot was mangled... [Inaudible] She's perfect.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How did the breast look? [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> The breasts are OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK. Well that's important.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And would you be able to stay in a relationship with her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Totally. No question in my mind.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I, I don't believe it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, how good is that answer? I mean, it's... [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That is if...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. I would have...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You are as shallow as I am.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no I have... I am shallow generally speaking. No, I have a great relationship. If something negative happened to Melania, I would be there for her 100%.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You would?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will stay with her. Yes. 100%.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And, you are known for being around beautiful women, you are known, that's part of your image in a sense.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know if I believe that's true.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Do you believe him?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's, it's. No it's true. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I don't believe you for a minute. I know he's already calculating what it's going to cost him...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> How to get out of there!
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> In terms of public relations and everything else.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You're gonna take care of her all right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're going to take a hard hit on that one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No I would, I would stay with her 100%
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You would.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have no doubt in my mind.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But you have great timing, you'll know when to leave. I know you.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Just before the accident, he'll know when the accident has been happening.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You will know when the accident's been happening. [Inaudible]
<Artie Lange> <Positive> Well, this people will be installing the walls! [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Believe me, the minute she gets a gray hair, he's going to get, 'You're fired!' [Inaudible] Trust me. Listen, there's nothing wrong with that. You have an image, you're used to beautiful women. And it is Melania's job in the sense to stay beautiful.
<Artie Lange> <Positive> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she is beautiful, but... And she will always remain beautiful. Of course, car accidents do, do wonders. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's no question about that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> The love making is still incredible?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Extraordinary.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely extraordinary.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And nothing has slowed down since the wedding?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. The same.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And your wedding night? Did you have sex on wedding night?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Then you were invited to the wedding, you know that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I didn't make it. I'm sorry.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're the only one who didn't make it. I'm sorry.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I owe you a present though.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You were only the major celeb that didn't make it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And the reason I didn't make it and I forget why. Why didn't I make it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I forget what was happening there something... You can't...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I, my daughter...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, something was going on with you then.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, I was then with my daughter, but but...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I was a little happy that you didn't make it because the last wedding, you killed me. [Inaudible] He stands on television, every television cameras on how I had 500 celebrities there. They chose Howard and he had a line that will never be forgotten, that there wasn't a white eye in the house. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well not only that, I made the prediction that the marriage would not last.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you were wrong and. And, you said it wouldn't last three months and it actually lasted a little bit longer than that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's true. [Inaudible] That's true. I think it lasted six months.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Three years.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But you know this one is going to last?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh yeah, this is a real deal.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> This is the last one?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No no. This. Yes. This is the real deal. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I can't wait to take this when it's over.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no this is.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> The problem with you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is great.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> The problem with you is you don't know yourself.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, you might be right about that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm telling you. I know you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You might be right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Someone is going to come along.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Why did you get married? I still can't understand it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well you know that's a long story but I met somebody who was great Robin, and I mean you go -- the hunt --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Did she pressure you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The hunt is a great thing. We all love the hunt.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But why did you get married?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She didn't pressure me at all because I felt it was the right thing to do, Number one and I think...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...she's special. If I didn't think she was special, I wouldn't have gotten married...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But you don't need to be married.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because this were just another really wonderful woman, I wouldn't have done it. This is beyond that. So I want a great relationship...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And you can have more kids?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so, yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Believe it. Yeah, sure. I would.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you need that headache for?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> 'Cause I like kids. I mean, I won't do anything to take care of them. She'll think I'll supply the funds and she will take care of the kids, right? [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But -- And then what's happened is, you know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not like I'm going to be walking the kids down Central Park.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> What, are you feeling like you have an empty nest or something?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well Marla used to say I can't believe you're not walking Tiffany down the street you know in the carriage, right?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm gonna be walking down Fifth Avenue with the baby in a carriage. It just didn't work. Melania is very very self -- I mean, she'd be an amazing mother.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. And she's self-contained, she doesn't need you involved.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She would take care -- great care of the child without my having to do very much.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But aren't you like me in a sense you're the child that needs the caring? You need Melania focused on you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that's true. And she may forget about me if that happens. And that would be a sad situation, she may...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Because I think that's what happened with Marla. She's busy with this kid and she's not...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Focused on your needs and you admit you need that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But you know when I married Marla, I owed 9.2 billion to the banks right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. You were in there
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I wasn't totally focused and -- I had, I think... And she was wonderful. Marla was wonderful. But you know not necessarily for me but she was wonderful. But I owed so much to the banks that I wasn't necessarily thinking. And, I married Marla and again she gave me a beautiful daughter and --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I had a great daughter so I'm very happy about it. And Marla is a wonderful woman but you know I was thinking about a lot of other things.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> How are you going to have a daughter or son with Melania and not be there at all? You got it. She's gonna put pressure on you to be a father and take the kids for a goddamn walk once in a while.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Then go to school and --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Gets to school play.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It's not your scene.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It, you know...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Let me ask you something...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And Melania...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's not really my scene. I have to tell you it's not my thing. But, she'll be... She'll be very good about it. I think I'll have to go to a minimum of school plays...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> .. If any. But let me ask you something...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Does the kid have to live with you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, do you --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Probably.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Probably.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> ...are you going to have it set up a separate household?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would think, yeah...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Set up a separate apartment.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would think, somehow I would think the child has to at least live there, yes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And how are you going to feel, you... You want to take off for the weekend to Palm Beach.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There it goes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now all of a sudden Melania goes,
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's so self-sufficient.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> How was that impression by the way?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That, I won't hear... That was good.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That was my impression.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I was listening.
<Artie Lange> <Positive> That was a perfect Melania.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was listening, I didn't want to comment...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> 'Oh my God, the suitcase...' [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But I wanted to ask what he did with these younger children because he wasn't 'the Donald' when they were born?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He was busy making a career.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But, but were you there more often?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Actually I've always been a very good father. If you ask my children who's been the best, I think a lot of them would choose me. But I've always been a really good father and I've liked being a father but I don't do too much work.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> All right. What about when Melania gets stretched out? Big belly, fat ass from carrying a baby...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sagging all over the place.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Sagging all over the place.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You'll so love her totally.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, you won't.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It's a -- you're not that way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no I totally love it. There's no doubt in my mind.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. Now...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It's not just her physical being.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And besides that she's listening right now.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Martha Stewart is getting an apprentice-type show, right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That is correct.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now you're up for it. So that leads me to believe that you are being paid...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I own, I own it with Mark Burnett. Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh you do?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But are you two fighting?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I own the Apprentice. Who, Martha Stewart?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I love the idea that she's doing a show. I own it with Mark Burnett. So Martha Stewart is doing the show and Mark Burnett and myself in it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Will she be successful?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so yeah, I hope so...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're banking on it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I certainly hope so. I mean I don't know if she can have the kind of success we've had with 'The Apprentice' but she's going to do her version of 'The Apprentice.' And I don't think she'll use the term 'You're fired,' and things like...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know I've done. But I think it will be successful. Robin, what do you think? You're going to watch it right?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Ah, no. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why not?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I, I mean I'm sure I might watch it. I can't say for sure that I'd watch it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She's spanks me about watching it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She started it, she really helped you out on that one.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You need, you need more success. Why do I...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She doesn't really want you to be successful.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I hope it's gonna be successful. Well, who knows, who knows about television?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you realize there are people out there who root that you don't have a success?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh absolutely. With Martha Stewart.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Because they're, they're jealous of your success.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I mean that absolutely is true.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You should leave something for the rest of us.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Robin and I are among them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don't forget Howard, when I did 'The Apprentice,'
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nobody thought it was going to be a success. You know, they only signed me for one series.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They said, 'Hey.' And then it went to the number one show on television as you remember.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's true.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And they came to my office and they dropped to their knees, NBC please...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Literally to their knees.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Literally to their knees, 'Sign, sign.' So they signed me up for two more now...they just... The ratings continue to be tremendous, so they just signed me up for two more.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you going to watch Robin's new TV show?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He will.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I will.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh my, thank you. You know then I'll give you the Stewart intro
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's our deal. She's gonna watch Martha and I'm gonna watch... [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Have you met with Martha Stewart since she's been a member of the show?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I spoke to her. She's you know she's getting her life back. And that was a tough deal.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's a bad deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know she is very brave, Howard. How many people have you known that have gotten in that kind of trouble and they're reduced to rubble?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And she handled it and she was a brave person. Beyond woman, I mean she was a brave person.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And she came back from it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She came back. I think she's going to be bigger than ever. So you know I hope so, and I hope the show is going to be a big success.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Now what about this? You're, you're now promoting once again, the Miss USA pageant tonight at 9 o'clock.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Which is a bad thing to own when you're married. I agree with it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah I mean you could --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's a tough one. I own Miss Universe too.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> The years that you had Miss Universe...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And of course Miss USA...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Miss USA, yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Was there a time that you would actually have sex with some of the contestants?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I never comment on things like that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So you did?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't comment on it -- [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you mean you don't comment? You comment on everything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I, that's true. [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, Donald.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Come clean. How many...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's terrible.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How many contestants...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I never comment on things like that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How many contestants did you ball?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, you know the stuff that I never comment you know from other people, I don't comment on my personal life right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Sure you do.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do actually.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Absolutely.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> Give us the first letter, the first letter of the country you had sex with. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I mean, could you...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How many letters are they?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Give me a hypothetical in your words, you're Donald Trump, you own the pageant, you're there, you're meeting the girls and one is more beautiful than the next.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've owned the pageant for a long time. You know the Miss Universe pageant is amazing because you have ninety seven countries and every... I mean no matter what you looking for, you have them in...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But what is 'you have them in'?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you like them a little bit dark, a little bit light, tall, short.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I like them a little dark.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like them, although there aren't too many short ones unfortunately. But if you like 'em any of the most beautiful women in the world, Miss USA the same thing. And, it's by the way it's on tonight at 9 o'clock...
<Artie Lange> <Positive> But that's a great thing to buy!
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the women are beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But they should do...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, that's one of the great assets I have. You know people consider, 'What do you like better? That or Trump Tower?' I say, 'Oh I like the Miss USA concept.'
<Artie Lange> <Positive> But that's a great thing to buy! Think about that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But explain to me, I'm not letting you off the hook on that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So when you were single...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You own this pageant, you go over, you look, you're meeting the girls, is that, one of them comes up to you and says, 'Mr. Trump, you're very sexy man...'
<Donald Trump> <Positive> 'You're a beautiful man, you have fantastic hair.'
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, 'you are a powerful man' [Inaudible] Right? Right? You are a powerful man
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I want to sleep with you. Now, you're not the type that would say no.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I, I don't want to hurt their feelings.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right. No. But what I mean...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You see a beautiful woman, you want to, you want to have that. You're the guy who likes to have everything, right?.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, couldn't that be construed however as --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Conflict?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I don't, I don't see it as conflict
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It could be a conflict of interest. But you know it's the kind of thing you worry about later.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, I see. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You tend to think about the conflict a little bit later on.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> The question is how can that not be construed?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, I mean some of these foreign girls you know,
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ha ha ha.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you could also say, 'It's the owner of the pageant it's your obligation to do that.'
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So, so you have done that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll tell you the funniest is that I'll go backstage before a show.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And everyone is getting dressed and ready, and everything else and then there are no men or anywhere, and I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant and therefore I'm inspecting it. You know, I'm inspecting it.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know I'm inspecting it, I wanna make sure that everything is
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You're like a doctor, you need to be there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, the dress... 'Is everyone okay? Is everybody okay and you see this incredible looking women. And so I sort of get away with things like that, but...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Tell me first time, tell me the first time you had sex with one of the contestants and what that was like. Take us through the whole experience... Please share with us, share with my audience who never gets to have sex with Miss USA.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Is everybody going to be watching tonight? [Inaudible]
<Artie Lange> <Positive> Oh, we'll make sure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, just say it as, he gets to sleep with the winner. So, that's one of the prizes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Have you ever sat with the winner?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The winner, you know the sad part. The winner isn't always the most beautiful.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Is that right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The winner is not always the most beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oftentimes you'll have women in the back and girls, women in the back that are so beautiful and you can't believe what happened. How did they not make the final?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Yeah, what's wrong with those judges?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know the judges picked somebody that shouldn't be there and you have these incredible people that are standing in the background watching somebody else being crowned. So often times the winner is not the most beautiful. Now in the Miss Universe contest, I don't know if you've seen the winner, or I think you had her on your show...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Jennifer.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And Jennifer is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Good looking...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's beautiful she's incredible. She's a nice girl... Miss USA Shandi, she's done a great job. She's been a great...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Alright, explain something.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm trying to get out of this.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I know, I know. You're talking as fast as you can.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How am I doing?... I'm just going on my own way.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm just going to talk about when you had sex with me. But we'll get back to that. The thing with beauty pageants, some of them like Miss America, have gone downhill because the chicks had too uptight.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Yeah, Miss America has even lost its... Network.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> How can you ensure my audience right now? How can you tell them, explain to them why they should watch tonight? What insurances do we have that the chicks will be almost naked, and what will they be doing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, well I'll tell you what.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, when I bought Miss USA, Miss Universe it was a sick puppy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I bought her for a sick puppy prize, okay?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then I made sure that the women were really beautiful because they were getting a little bit not as beautiful and it's a sad thing to say,
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Some of your people will get very well, that your audience probably would understand this better than most.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Your point is that they were starting to take women who were educated over women who were hot? And they eliminated them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They had a person who was extremely proud that a number of the women had become doctors.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right, who cares?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that was an insult to them.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That was not what you were looking for.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Not. This is a beauty pageant.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I actually went on 'The Today Show' with Katie Couric a while ago six years ago and we had a woman running the pageant who was really into the whole thing of education and everything, and I said, 'Look, if you're looking for a rocket scientist, don't turn in tonight...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, if you're looking for a really beautiful woman, you should watch.'
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The head of the Miss Universe contest blew up, she went crazy 'How dare you say that? That was a terrible thing to say.' You know in other words, Howie, the women are really, really beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. That's my point. It's a beauty pageant.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a beauty pageant.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I'd rather have a retarded hot woman than a slob who's a doctor.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What happened is [Laughter] I had that expression, because when I took it over, it wasn't getting good ratings. And as you know last year, we won the ratings night the entire evening Miss USA won Miss Universe...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Because the chicks were hot...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, and Miss Universe is one of the highest rated shows anywhere in the world because it's the podcast all over the world so it's really become a hot thing. I've made it hot. I'm very proud of that. And people said, 'How did you do that?' And I jokingly said the heels got higher and the bathing suits got smaller.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Either bikinis...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> That's absolutely true!
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then they said I was joking, And then I realized, 'Why am I defending myself because that happened?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are they thongs? [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They are almost thong-like.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know NBC, if it were up to me they'd get smaller. But NBC has certain standards so they're sort of thong-like.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And what do you have the girls doing besides walking around in their bathing suit?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, all they do is walk back and forth. We put lots of bathing suit on...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know as you know Miss America which used to be the standard. Miss America was the standard. Now Miss USA is at a much higher standard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How old are the girls?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I'm, Well I'm trying to buy Miss America.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How old are the girls?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Anywhere from 18 to 23, 24.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Perfect. No, no older than 24 I hope.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah and Howard, I don't know if you remember this, one of the most beautiful winners we ever had was from Russia.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oxana...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You're right, yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, I remember her.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> She came in here.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah I remember.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oxana Fedorova, and she...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You did her right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, she left this office [Inaudible] No I didn't. That was Oxana, no. Hi Oxana, how have you been?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You didn't do here, I had the feeling you were doing her.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But she left, she left, she was totally beautiful...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She wanted you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She was never the same after she left this interview.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Really? [Inaudible]
<Artie Lange> <Positive> That's true.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Oh stop it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. Remember she had her interpreter.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you were asking her unbelievable questions. [Inaudible] Do you remember the one question you started out?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What was it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to tell you because I'm going to get in trouble. But if, if I will quote you...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You said, 'Have you ever slept with a black man?'
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. And, and but I...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That was your first question...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But I wanted to hear the guy interpret it and say it to her and watch her friends.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right, the interpreters have to...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The interpreters did not have to...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> ...interpret that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... But Oksana wasn't thrilled with the question.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You remember this?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh yeah yeah yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And this interview, I don't know if you know, went all over Russia...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was scandal all over Russia. And everybody told me, 'Don't do it don't put on Howard' and I said, 'No I want to do it he's a friend of mine.' And it gets great ratings and he's all these other things, 'he's a great friend of mine.' It was a disaster, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I actually looked at her about two months into it. She was very bad, she was not doing her job, she wouldn't go anywhere, she was spoiled rotten
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And you got rid of her, I remember.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's first time in the history, 65 years the first time in history that a Miss Universe, God she wouldn't do anything.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What do you mean you're trying to buy Miss America? How much does that cost?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I'm trying to buy it. I'm trying to buy for nothing. You know...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm trying to buy it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What are you willing to pay? Be honest.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, as little as possible.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What do you have to pay for something who has nothing?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well it has nothing, it's losing audience and it lost network
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Maybe I'll buy it, call it 'Howard Stern's Miss America.'
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That would probably do very well. It's basically the same theory as I have.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But seriously how much money will it cost you to buy Miss America?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well it's not the money that it cost me to but some money it'll cost me to fix it. It needs a lot of help.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I see
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know they lost their television contract...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ...so I'd have to get them on television, which I think I could do because of my ratings with NBC I have a lot of power in it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How do you call?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know two years ago, it's like, 'Forget about it, Trump's going' Now it's like, 'Donald what would you like us to do, you want to broadcast it? We'll let you broadcast.'
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Who owns Miss America?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's owned by a big foundation and that's really the problem. It's a foundation that sort of, you know, gives a lot of money to women
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ...wanting to go to college, wanting to be educated.
<Artie Lange> <Negative> Oh, that's stupid.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Again, it's an education thing...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it's not like just a money losing deal, it's like one of these foundation things, so it's a little bit complicated. Yeah But maybe we'll do, but they, you know they lost their television.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, what do you, what do you think of the idea that some people have floated of making it more like a reality show?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't think it's could.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> So they can have it go more than one night.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think it's good.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> No?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I think it's good if we do it later on.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh I see. [Inaudible
<Donald Trump> <Positive> First I'd like to buy it. No, I don't think it's a good idea.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So, so you are going to buy Miss America then you'll own three of these beauty pageants...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll have a monopoly on beauty pageants.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow look at you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It doesn't do me any good though because I'm married. Happily married.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah but you are making some deal with this thing right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, it makes great, yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Would you pay for this Miss USA?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I paid. They wanted 28 million.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that includes Miss Universe. And I paid 10 million.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And it made $10 million last year.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So you, you bought Miss Universe and Miss USA...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> ...from the same guy...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well from Madison Square Garden corporation.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay. You bought it from them you paid 10 million,
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Ten million, and it was owned by Paramount which was a division.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And you've already turned it into a big profits.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, it's been great because you know, countries, foreign countries pay a fortune.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In fact it's going to Thailand for it, which is interesting... I signed a deal with Thailand where they paid a lot of money to have the Miss Universe contest in Thailand.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I signed a deal one week before the tsunami hit.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So then, I said to myself, 'That's terrible I have to give them back their money.' They paid a lot like six or seven million dollars to have it over there. I said, 'Oh that's terrible I have to get back their money.' They don't want their money back. They wanted more importantly now and that's on in a few weeks. More importantly they want the Miss Universe country because they want to show that they're back. And I thought that was terrific.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I think they are right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Why don't you call it Miss Tsunami [Inaudible] and then that'll make a big contest out of that? I like that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well you know it was sort of like I said one of two things is going to happen. Right. [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But they really wanted it. They want to show that they're back in business and that's good.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow, well look at you man. And you know what. It's almost fair to say that you are now a television mogul.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is. It is strange.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You had no holdings in television. I got The Apprentice. You've got the Martha Stewart thing going.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well 14 months ago, I knew absolutely nothing about ratings although I understood ratings from Miss USA. I've heard that for six years or seven years.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You had that Dan Rather was number three, that you know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well everybody know that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. That was that was obvious.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think everybody knew that, but Dan.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. So is it fair to say now you are really going into the world of television in a big way?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no real estates is what I do and that's what I like I'm...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're not going to buy any more properties in television?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No I'm building nine buildings right now, I'm the biggest developer in New York. That's what I like doing the best, real estate.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Nine buildings.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I'm building a big one in Chicago.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And I also understand in Chicago you decided not to go up...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> ...and challenge the record for the tallest building.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a building that's 92 stories tall that's going up right now in Chicago. We sell 700 million dollars worth of apartments before we even started.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Look at you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And what happened is it's an unbelievable... I could have for a very small amount of money made it the tallest building in the world.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> But you didn't want it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I said 'No thanks.'
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You have to let somebody else do that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know what, after September 11th, things changed.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Nobody wants to be.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you would have told me that I for a very small amount of minutes like raising the antenna, right?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Uh, ah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know not that much money, right? I could have had the world's tallest building.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Nobody wants it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> No?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Not now.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Then how do you need that for?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want to, I want to keep the profile the way it is it's perfect.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Tell me if, Tell me if this is true -- Shaquille O'Neal bought you and Melania a $325,000 Phantom Rolls Royce a wedding present.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well he gave as a wedding present and he was at my wedding and he's a great guy Shaquille. You know I happen to love... Jerry Buzz... I think Jerry Buss is a great guy. But losing Shaq was not a good move.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean Shaq is Shaq.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, it's obvious now.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did he buy you this car? [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll say on live radio off the record. Yes. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you make of that? I mean did you...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he likes me. You know...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hold on, hold on, hold on.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let me...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> If somebody give it to you, to Shaq to give to you, he didn't pay it for it...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know. Let me just...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you mean you don't know?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Shaq is making 35 million dollars a year.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If he buys a Rolls Royce that's like somebody going out and buying a piece of candy. You understand that right okay?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right, right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Shaq's a friend of mine. He came to my wedding. He had. We had everybody at the wedding, everybody but you. The only one missing, the only major celebrity missing was you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Everybody was there. Les Moonves. Jeff Zucker, the biggest people Katie Couric was there.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Everybody was there, everybody was fascinated by Shaq. Shaq is Shaq.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.

<Howard Stern> <Negative> What is the worst gift you received?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's a phenomenon.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> The worst gift.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The worst gift is nothing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Somebody showed up.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Who did, who gave you nothing? [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know. You know it's interesting with weddings. A lot of times I'll tell Melania don't buy him a gift.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And she'll say, 'that's terrible why? Why?' Because then I you know like I don't even know who gave me what, you understand that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's like you, you're so busy, look at you, look at your desk and all these tapes you probably mostly of nude women... [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you saying? You know who gave you, would you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No no no. A lot of times Howard if it's your birthday and, and you get 500 presents you're not going to remember two weeks later who gave you what, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Was Pat O'Brien at your wedding?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He was.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Ahhhh.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you know he was such a freak?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well Pat had a problem but he didn't have a problem on my wedding. I didn't know that he had such a problem.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Have you heard the tapes?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> Did you know he was in the bathroom of your wedding calling Melania? [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You've heard the tapes of Pat O'Brien.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've heard the tapes on your show.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yes. Now, isn't that a dumb move putting back? Would you ever in your single years... You're a coxwain. [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You were around... [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In my single years, I think it would have been all right and the matter with you is it does...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, no. But even still.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> But you're not going to leave a message like that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You don't leave a message like that on this show.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what fascinates me. That was really stupid.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Dumb.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But he also had a problem that was stupid that was pure stupid.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But what really fascinates me [Inaudible]is email. I have friends... First of all, half of my friends are under indictment right now because they send e-mails to each other about how they are screwing people. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But it's unbelievable...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why do people...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> E-mail is unbelievable, it, they'll talk on the phone they can't even say hello. They don't want to say hello or goodbye.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And yet they'll write you a message [Inaudible] that they are having you know, sex with 15 different married women. [Inaudible] It's unbelievable.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Would you do, would you... [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> E-mail, E-mail is unbelievable...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Would you do another Apprentice with Pat O'Brien? Because I would watch that [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, somebody has to rehabilitate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's a great idea. Actually I have to tell you just one thing about 'The Apprentice.' This group is fine but I chose for the first time because I've been so busy it's hard. You know we have over a million people apply to go on 'The Apprentice'
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And Mark Burnett and the staff, they choose the people and on it's been great. But I wanted to choose my staff, my group for the next one which is the fourth one which will come out in the fall. Uh, uh. Okay? I'll start shooting in a couple of weeks. And I went and they chose from over a million people they took it down to 2000 and I went to Los Angeles. Right? And I picked the 18 people. Howard, you'll be watching every night... [inaudible] Some of the most beautiful people...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Nice.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, they were all saying, 'Oh Donald don't use that woman. She's too beautiful.'
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Do you have at least one crazy black person? [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hope not.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You have to.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Coz we've had some problem I mean between Omarosa...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I mean, from Omarosa...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, every reality show has that crazy bad person.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you know he's saying they've had some trouble. It's Omarosa the crazy black woman who causing up the trouble. [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Actually I think we have, I think we have some great black women
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Don't you have to have... When you and Burnett sit down, you have to have a Black. You have to have Black people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think that's correct. Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What about Asians and Hispanic? Why are they always forgotten?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay look, let me just tell you this. Okay. Number 4 is gonna be so unbelievable. The cast is unbelievable. We have a stripper who wants to make good.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.

<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... Your entire audience just decided
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah you got to see how the stripper does.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's so beautiful you won't believe it. We have a beauty queen that they didn't want but a beauty queen who is so beautiful, Howard, that you wouldn't believe it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And a lot of people didn't want her 'cause she's not believable she's that beautiful. And we have just great people. So I think I think I'm really looking forward to that...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Aren't you...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> More than any other...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Aren't you...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm looking forward to the fourth season.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Aren't you, Aren't you secretly happy, This is what I've heard that Mark Burnett Show the contender, failed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No I'm not happy about that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I heard you were happy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No you didn't hear I'm happy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I heard that you were behind that because you want to be the most valuable person in sale.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's that's always true. You know that's always true.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Are you glad to secretly see Mark Burnett had a failure $2 million an episode?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Of the contender.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I would like -- I love Mark and I want him to have only success.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Is he crying over it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I think he's hey look he's happy with the Apprentice and he's happy with Survivor. Those two shows -- [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What he said to you about the failure of Contender? What did he say to you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't talk to him about it. No
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Did he say to you, "I think I lost it.""?"
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I don't talk to him about it. Now, he's very proud of it artistically.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I think it's a great show.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It is.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know I mean I watched it last night. I thought it was terrific. I mean he's very proud of it artistically.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Has he lost it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Lost what?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No he has not.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You know what's funny to me a couple of weeks ago I was at the car show and Richard Branson who tried to...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Who failed.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah. Run the show against The Donald.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He failed didn't he? Against you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's got beaten so bad, he's like, you know, he walks down the street, he puts his head down he's ashamed to --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You will love this Donald, you know what he was doing in the car show? He was dressed as an astronaut talking to people [Inaudible] and the press and I said, "Who is that guy walking around in an astronaut suit"
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Look how happy Donald is
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love this.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> And it was Richard Branson. Donald's right he has no idea what he was doing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He has no television persona and he doesn't know it the one that failed was Mark Cuban once when he came out with the show and you know it's amazing Mark Cuban what an apartment at one of my buildings, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So he's obviously had to be a Trump fan somewhere along the line. Then all of a sudden -- and he was very nice and all of a sudden like two weeks before the show, "I don't like Donald Trump. I don't like his business practices. I don't like his way [Inaudible]"" You know all of this stuff. And then he failed the same thing with Branson. ""Donald Trump is great."" Unbelievable. A week before the show he starts trashing me. So it's like they failed badly. I'm happy about it. By the way one thing I want to ask your opinion."
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> On the Apprentice there was a concept, okay? tThrown out by some person nine blacks H
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go ahead
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Against nine whites.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> This I like.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it would be nine blacks against nine whites all highly educated, very smart, strong, beautiful people, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Do you like it?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Do you like it, Robin?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Well I think you're going to have a riot.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. I like it. I like it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It would be the highest rated show on television.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh, yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Let me ask you a couple of questions, if I may. I'm pretty good with this stuff. Very dark blacks or light skinned blacks?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Assortment.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Assortment of blacks
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Against whites.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And whites.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> How many blondes? [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Probably not. I'd say not.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who's thinking of doing this?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This was a thought that was given to us
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And we're thrown out in a meeting.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Have that person arrested.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And somehow would -- I don't think
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Wouldn't that set off a racial --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think NBC is thrilled with the idea that I --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Wouldn't it set off a racial war in this country?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think. See, actually, I don't think it would. I think that it would be handled very beautifully by me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because as you know I'm very diplomatic.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes you are. You're very sensitive.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm a sensitive person right. And I also think that you probably have 35 million people a night watching.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I got to tell you something. At some level it's wrong, but I like it. I would watch. I would watch that.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> I give it to the black team
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I have to watch.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You have to. Because you don't know when the riot's turns.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I would give it to the blacks.
<Artie Lange> <Positive> The black's are gonna win because that extra bone they have nine extra bones.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> This is not a race, Artie.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know the truth there's something wrong with it. But I don't know maybe you think about it. I wish I could think about it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Was the guy fired immediately. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I think he was promoted actually.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> I got me an idea.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right. So look you have done it again. You are happily married. So let's let's let's take an assessment right now of your life.
