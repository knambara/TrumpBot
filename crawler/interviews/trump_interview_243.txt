<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donald Trump just came here.
<Artie Lange> <Positive> You're kidding.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Whats he on a tight sched?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Hes like our Bob Hope, he just runs in?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, he was scheduled.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh, okay.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He just wants to get right on.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Oh.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Busy guy.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> He is The Donald.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Mostly he is used to getting his way and why not?
<Artie Lange> <Negative> I just did stand up at his Taj Mahal the other day [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You did stand up at the Taj Mahal?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> With Bubba, yeah, that's where Bubba was.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Hey, there, how are you?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Hey, Mr. Trump, look at you looking good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am looking good.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I think you dropped a few.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> Hey, Donald how are you doing?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right, just watch youre put on those headphones or else we won't hear you. Here, hold on. Now we are good.
<Donald Stern> <Negative> You messed up my hair.
<Artie Lange> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Your hair looks good. Artie just worked your place. Artie just did stand-up.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> That's right, I was at the Taj. It was --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, you know what, I heard it was very successful.
<Artie Lange> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very good.
<Artie Lange> <Negative> Another [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Even Mr. Florentine was that one of Trump's properties.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Robin's boyfriend.
<Artie Lange> <Negative> Yeah, it was Nick Di Paolo. That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very good.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> How are you doing in this economy? Are your assets down or are they up?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm all over the world, Howard, we're doing 73 jobs all over the world and other parts of the world.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> When you say jobs you mean buildings?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Buildings, like in Dubai and the Middle East and in China and lots of other places.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Who's gonna go to Dubai? I keep hearing about this Dubai.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Everybody's going to Dubai.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I tell you we are selling like hotcakes.
<Artie Lange> <Positive> Howard, I'm telling you I was just in Afghanistan, to stand up for the troops, everyone talks about Dubai, like, you have got to go to Dubai.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's amazing.
<Artie Lange> <Positive> It's the nicest place in the world.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It's amazing. I'm doing --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do you get laid in Dubai?
<Artie Lange> <Positive> Oh, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, like actually truthfully, for maybe all of the wrong reasons you have some of the most beautiful women in the world there.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Oh, because of slavery or something?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because they just go there.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They go there?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Yeah, whats the wrong reason?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They follow the money, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They do, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They are all looking for guys like you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Its all rich dudes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're all rich guys and a lot of women looking for a rich guys.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And the other nice thing, it's Jew-free over there.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I tell you what, its an amazing place. It really is.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are Jews allowed in Dubai?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> That's why its an amazing place. [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Its like an exclusive country club.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you know then you have like in this country and we have become a sad situation because of our president, the worst president in the history of the country, I mean,
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who are you backing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I like the fact that McCain very strongly wants to keep taxes low, I mean with this economy you can't be raising taxes.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Can I tell you something? You bringing up a good point. I've been thinking about this. Here's what I don't like about Obama. He is saying -- You know I'm disgusted with government, I pay 50%, 50% of the money I earn.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You're going up.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> If he gets in, you're going way up.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> This is what's bugging me. I think, God forbid, if you ran your business like the United States government you would be bankrupt. We are so in debt. Trillions of dollars. And the only reason is because, government does not know how to spend money. You see, they spend money on anything. It's not their money and politicians
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And they just keep taking more
<Howard Stern> <Negative> They keep taking more and there is more deficit. And now a guy is going to get in office and tell me I'm not paying enough? Excuse me, I'm working half a year for the United States government and you're telling me I'm not paying enough?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a problem.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It's a problem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know the amazing thing? I watch all the business stuff I like the business stuff I read. Nobody ever talks about OPEC. They say the speculators are driving up oil. Speculators, speculators are nothing. You're a speculator, we're all speculators. Nothing. OPEC they have these guys sitting around a table. They raise the price of oil. And because we have a stupid president they get away with it, I mean, we have a president that goes to Saudi Arabia and wraps his arms around these people and says, you know, we love you, we love you, we love you. The next day they announce they're not going to anything for us.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> They're raping us, they're raping us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So you know look we need a new leader we've got to get this guy out of there fast.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> By the way --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, I have to say I heard Donald on another show I think it was Greta Van Susteren and he said exactly that he said, You know, the president just went over to Saudi Arabia the price of gasoline keeps going up and he's holding hands with the guy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What would you say to the Saudi Arabians if you were President Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, we'd have fun, so let me just tell you those oil prices would drop like a rock.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Tell me about that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know that you have ships all over the world that are loaded up with oil. They don't know what to do with there's so much. And yet the price keeps going up.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a monopoly. Howard, if you have a store and I have a store on Fifth Avenue and we get together to set prices they put us in jail
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now you have these people like, 12 people, 14 people, they sit around the table they say, Let's raise it, we have a stupid president heading the United States, he's not going to do anything, let's raise it. Howard, there are so many things you could do. Number one you've got to let them know. Hey, places like Saudi Arabia wouldn't be there if it weren't for us
<Howard Stern> <Negative> If we didn't protect them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We protect them.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know it's -- it's really -- it's really a very sad situation
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Why does the government approve ExxonMobil mergers in three seconds and they can't figure out how to approve a satellite merger?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know I often talk about that. ExxonMobil, these two monsters, the two biggest, they get together they merge it's okay but you guys can't merge.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What is going on?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And your stock ain't doing so well.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right. Because they're raping these companies and they try to bankrupt us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We've got this great guy Mel wants to do a good job. You know, I mean, you're doing a good job. You got to merge OK merge.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's it.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And yet ExxonMobil merges in 15 seconds so you figure it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> The Chicago Tribune wrote a great editorial yesterday about this is ridiculous that Exxon and Sirius can't merge
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It's finally getting some attention?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well, it's upsetting people I mean, the government is corrupt.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Jim Cramer is a great guy he was on The Apprentice and he's just a great guy and I don't know if you've ever heard his [Inaudible]. But he goes crazy every night
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He's great
<Donald Trump> <Negative> About why they're not allowing this merger so
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It's upsetting.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He said it's ridiculous.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It's upsetting to me not only because obviously I would -- I would do well if the companies merged but it's upsetting to me that government would hold companies up for ransom and to make it so political and the lobbyists have their way.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> And that some companies are favored over other companies.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right. They're trying to get money, you are trying to make business. They're trying to do it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's not my business, Howard. And personally, I don't care, as long as you continue to be on the air. It doesn't make any difference to me whether they merge, although I would like to see Mel do well, so I like it. So I couldn't care less if they merge or not but I will imagine --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So you are telling me there's lots of oil out there and that
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And ships won't come in, huh?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It won't come in.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Lots of oil lots of lots of ships loaded up with oil and they don't know what to do with it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So if you were President Trump, I will go back to that now, how would you pressure the Saudis, would you say, Listen we're going to let other countries invade you and we're not going to protect you anymore?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know the part of the problem with this country is a question like that you have to reveal your hand. You don't talk about when you go into a business that you don't talk about, This is what I do. I had an idiot come into my office the other day he says to me, Mr. Trump I'm a great negotiator. I really negotiate well. I read all your books. I'm making a deal with this guy, right? He said, I'm really a great negotiator. I can really negotiate too. Now I've never met a good negotiator that tells you he's a good negotiator. You don't talk about it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You'd rather go in and say --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let's go in and you do your thing. You don't talk about it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So you're saying elections are backwards in other words people shouldn't reveal what they're going to do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They shouldn't be revealing what they're going to do. I mean I see things the other day where the Pentagon we found out is thinking about attacking Iran and we're going to fly planes here and there then we're going to land them here. We're going to fly and we're going to bomb them at 4:30 in the afternoon. But we may make it at 4:45. This is crazy. What do you think the late great Douglas MacArthur would have done if he heard about something?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He would have vomited
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay. You know look we have a country that's not the same as it used to be Howard it's not respected
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Have we gone downhill?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Totally downhill. It's not respected. Our leadership isn't respected and frankly, our country is just a different country than it was 10 years ago. Absolutely. You go to Europe you look at the euro it's strong you look at our dollar it's weak it's just really. I mean, as an example, yesterday I closed on a house $100 million.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> $100 million? What house is worth --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In Palm Beach.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No kidding.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A very nice Russian gentleman bought a house for a $100 million. Now wouldn't it be nice if an American would give me $100 million instead of a Russian?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You can't get that anymore, it's all foreigners, isn't it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's the foreigners because the dollar is weak.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By the way, I don't mind a weak dollar because I keep trying [Inaudible]. In a certain way that's so bad but you know there's something nice about a weak dollar.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Wait a second, you're telling me in Palm Beach --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In certain ways, it's not so bad for me. Doesn't sound very good but you know there's something good about a weak dollar.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're telling me, you just sold a house in Palm Beach for $100 million.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A man, it's a very sad story, about two years ago a man went bankrupt and he had a house in Palm Beach and a house in Palm Beach was a very good house. And I bought it in bankruptcy, I bought it out of a bankruptcy auction.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What did you pay for it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Forty-one million dollars.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> OK
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I fixed it up, you know meaning I painted it.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right, I was going to say how much did that cost? About $250.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> About $3. No I painted it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, wait. You did more than that, what did you put? About two million in?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I put in a couple of dollars.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I sold it to a gentleman who's going to, I think rip it down probably and build a bigger house, you know.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Frankly, I don't know what he's going to do.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It's on the ocean?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's right in the ocean. I should have come to you. You have plenty of money.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Not that kind of money. Wow, You spent about 25 million though on renovations on this thing, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I didn't.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Not that much?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now I would say it's a little --
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> He wouldn't fix it that much [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You're off by about $24, 500.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So that was a very good deal for you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, that was a good deal. I mean it was a good deal but it's you know it's not my big deal but it's it's like pretty sad when you think of it that most of the people that were negotiating I mean it's a great piece of property
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But most of the people negotiating were foreign
<Howard Stern> <Negative> They never mind all that, Melania is still tight? I mean, how she look?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's looking good.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I saw an interview that my fiance did with her
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right, true.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And she looks sexier than ever.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She thinks your fiance is great.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> After the baby --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Do you think you're going to invite Melania and Trump to the wedding?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Absolutely. I said it last night. I said I'm going to invite Trump and Melania
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Are they on the list?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They are on the list.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> They don't have to do [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everybody wants me no matter where it is how they all want Trump, Trump is hot.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, listen --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So they all want Trump. So, I'm just curious as to whether or not he's inviting me to the wedding.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm gonna invite you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now the big question is whether or not I'll go.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You don't have to go. In fact, believe me it's too much pressure.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You must go, come on.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the invite would be nice 'coz this way I could say at least I've been invited, and if I don't go you're not gonna mind.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And as a favor to you, the invite will say, Donald trump plus current wife. In case anything goes wrong. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know I do a lot of times, I'll invite guys like, you know, from -- I would say, well I'm -- he's going to be in Europe closing a big deal. So I have something -- so I invite him knowing he can't come because I don't want him to come. So, I always invite people that I know won't come because it's like having them, you get all the credit for it, but you don't have to suffer through their company.
<Artie Lange> <Negative> You know what, Donald, can you get Howard back to the joke he made about you on your wedding.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, he killed me.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I was right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You were wrong. Years[Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Your ex-wife, Marla Maples, were just National Inquirer, they said, her body is one of the tightest bodies around.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's a great looking girl.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She still looks good.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> She was a gymnast or something, wasn't she?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She is a beautiful girl. But during the wedding and Howard sat right next to O.J. Simpson and in fact, he put me right on the cover, you know me and O.J. At the back cover of his book, which it did very nicely.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But at the wedding I was with Marla, and Marla is, was a really nice girl, you know, but yeah, I made a mistake. But she was great. [Inaudible] But here's Howard's statement that you to be one of the people I have everybody in New York is the biggest craziest thing that happened all year. They have to interview Howard.
<Artie Lange> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I go back and Marla wants to make love and I want to watch television to see what kind of coverage we're getting.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's why you're successful.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I knew the marriage was in trouble that first night. When you do that that's not a good sign. You agree with that, Robin?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I agree. You should have been for the sex.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, she's in bed saying, Darling, I love you. And I'm trying to find out you know who's on. So the only guy they have, with all these people, big celebrities everybody was there. You would say
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean even O.J. When he was hot.
<Artie Lange> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Of course you could say he's hotter
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In a bad way
<Howard Stern> <Negative> The hottest. In fact I have to.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay, before I talk about O.J. Because I do have to tell you about O.J. And The Apprentice.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm going to ask you about that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> NBC went totally crazy when I went to put O.J. In The Apprentice switch.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Let me ask you something. Do you still talk to O.J.?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Howard said that, There wasn't a wet eye in the house. [Inaudible] and then he said, now Marla's watching this and you know she's a very romantic person because, There wasn't a wet eye in the house. I thought that was her. I cracked up then and it was true. Yeah. That's the sad part, nobody was crying at my wedding.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No one cared. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was like, you know, the talking, this is great, what a great --
<Artie Lange> <Positive> That was a good time.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And then he had another comment. Do you remember your other comment?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. I said the marriage would last six months.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Six months and you were wrong and you were wrong, it lasted four years.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It did
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You were wrong.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I was wrong
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But what are you gonna say about his wedding?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, you know Melania knows people very well. And she thinks you're marrying a spectacular woman. You know she really likes Beth, you know that. And I would probably, Howard might not invite me, but I think Beth wants Melania to be there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She does, that's true.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But they have a good relationship and Melania thinks that Beth -- that this is going to be a very good marriage.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Really?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So you have to say this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What do I know? I would say it probably won't work because they don't work.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay, you know, they don't work, it's not because of Howard's or hers. It's because if you look statistically most marriages don't work.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm hoping mine does.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I had a friend
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Yours is working though.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Listen to this. I had a friend always said, Donald, Donald, my wife is great. I got it right. He's not that successful, he goes, You got the big success, but boy, look at my marriage is great. Meantime, I find out the other day his wife is having an affair. Now what do I do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Wow!
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Ooh!
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do I tell him?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Artie Lange> <Positive> Oh, Absolutely.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> The man's living that dream.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> If my wife was having an affair
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You'd want to know.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And you found out about it. You didn't tell me. I'd be mad at you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm I think I'm probably going to tell him, I think I probably already have because he listens so your show, so he probably knows who I'm talking about.
<Artie Lange> <Negative> Wow, Howard, I got to [Inaudible
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not happy about this.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What if my wife is having an affair with Donald Trump. Then if it's you, don't tell me
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She'd never go back to you if that happened.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I know. You're an excellent lover. Don't brag on my show.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not allowed to do that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Talk about this for a second with The Apprentice. You said that you were going to you know try and get O.J.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> [Inaudible] celebrity version, yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You were friends with O.J.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, you sat next to him.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So how did you come in contact with O.J.?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was friendly with O.J. And I played golf with O.J. And you know when I heard the story about O.J. Because I've seen O.J. Like working out and running and when I heard the story that he wasn't physically capable of beating this very nice young weightlifter.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And a woman.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because he was 55 years old. O.J. Could be 100 years old and destroy any you know virtually -- I mean O.J. Was a physically strong guy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You didn't see any evidence.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And when he was in a rage -- when he was in rage -- I mean this guy knew he was in serious trouble when he was in rage. You forget it. You looked at his eyes and you say, hey, he used to carry for a linebacker you know O.J. Had very skinny legs.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it was almost like a medical miracle. They say, How come he can carry four linebackers from Pennsylvania on his back nine yards?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Almost impossible.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He's like an ant, he was really you know eight times stronger than his weight
<Artie Lange> <Negative> Deacon Jones couldn't tackle him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No you couldn't, you couldn't bring him down.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So you know, then they say, Oh, he was a little bit older. I mean, you know, he wasn't --
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> He had arthritic knees he couldn't get over the fence.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Remember if the glove doesn't fit, right? [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So you were friendly with O.J.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was friendly and I wanted to -- but I must tell you I really abandoned O.J.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Of course.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was extremely disloyal.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When I realized he killed his wife [Inaudible] I decided that I'll take a pass.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right. [Inaudible] Why did you put him -- Why would you put him on The Apprentice?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, in your business there's a thing called ratings
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's right. Big, big, big.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know you can come up with a cure for cancer.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I found out a lot about your business because hey I'm the biggest star, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. You are.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am now the biggest star.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> There's no bigger star than you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've got the biggest -- You know Melania says you are the biggest star. You are bigger than Tom Cruise, you are bigger than anybody. That's why I like her, okay? Somebody else would say, You're nothing. So I know that if you come up with a cure for cancer.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And if you put it on and if it doesn't get ratings they will not broadcast it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> They could care less about -- They care less. The guy who invented the cure for polio we don't even know his name anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it doesn't matter.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's right. [Inaudible]
<Artie Lange> <Positive> Jonas Salk
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Couple of us remember but not too many. But anyway, so you come up with a cure for a disease. Now good. Okay. Now, I know this, if I put O.J. On
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You have the biggest season ever.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thirty five million people.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So did O.J. Call you and say --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to go into it but O.J. Would have done it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah! Don't leave me hanging like that. What do you mean you don't want to go into this?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't go into the details.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Did you talk to O.J.?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I refuse to say.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oooh!
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you speak to O.J.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hadn't spoken to him in years. I don't like people that kill their wives, okay? Does that make sense?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You know what I like that about you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Does that make me a disloyal person?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Makes you honorable.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I like women.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> A lot of people thought you like guys who killed their wives.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't even like guys that beat up women, you know you got a lot of those guys around, okay?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Have you beaten up a woman in a relationship?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I'm a lover not a fighter.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You never killed any of your ex-wives?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no. I'm a lover not a fighter.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I mean, yeah, he could've.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great lover, poor fighter.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> People would've understood it if you want to kill an ex-wife.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. I've had women that wanted to be, Robin. I've had women that wanted to be beat-up.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Really? Smacked around
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've had women that said and I would, you know what I say? I'm sorry darling but that's not my thing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> If you could --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Smacking is not my thing.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> If you could would you put Osama bin Laden on the Apprentice? I'm being serious right now.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Now that's bigger ratings than O.J.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I can get Osama -- Be honest.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> We all want to know where he is.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Would you have him on The Apprentice? Osama bin Laden.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I think it would be one way of getting him out of hiding.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So you would?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He'd never get [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Negative> The man who blew up the World Trade Center. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You put him on and then the guys come along and finally capture him. By the way. How is it that we can't capture six foot six Arab?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Who's walking in the woods of probably Saudi Arabia, in my opinion. I happen to think he's in Saudi Arabia. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You said it earlier in this interview you said, We are so hated around the world right now that this guy is actually beloved and his people won't give him up.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let me ask you this, do you think the late great Douglas MacArthur, the great general,
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He had the whole deal going, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] He was a genius. You know in the history of West Point, think of this, he was the greatest student, to this day in the history of West Point,
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Is that true?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He had the highest marks ever in the history of West Point. And that's why he never liked you know Eisenhower because Eisenhower was you know he never felt he was an equal. Would you think that the great Douglas MacArthur would have allowed Osama bin Laden to be free this long?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, I don't. I believe --
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You know, Donald, he wouldn't have allowed a lot of things, wouldn't have allowed turning away from Afghanistan to deal with Iraq and the whole thing. It would have been a totally different thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He would have gone into Saudi Arabia and gotten the families of the terrorists. He would have done a lot of different things.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Were you -- were you for the invasion of Iraq originally?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You were not? You were always against it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I tell you what, you have to remember one thing, the answer is no, but I have to qualify it. We were lied to by the president. We were told that this is where it all started
<Artie Lange> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We were told that this guy had nuclear weapons, he didn't have an M-1 rifle.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He didn't have anything.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He had nothing.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> He had a shovel apparently because he dug himself a hole and [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But Robin, he had nothing.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Would you put President Bush in The Apprentice?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, so I could fire him quickly.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Would you put Hitler on The Apprentice?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don't ask me these questions. [Inaudible] Let's go back to O.J.'s [Inaudible]. Let's go back to O.J. it's less controversial.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> He's almost hitting Hitler on The Apprentice, he's talking to Heather Mills, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I have actually, Heather Mills wants to be on very badly.
<Artie Lange> <Negative> She's almost Hitler now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Heather Mills wants to be on. She's go a tremendous dislike for her husband her husband, her ex-husband
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Paul McCartney
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Even though he handed her 60 million bucks. You know I was watching Larry King and he was on and she was on they were holding hands and then she took off her leg and showed her leg and I -- Excuse me, he's a Beatle [Inaudible
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Did McCartney get off easy in his -- because --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. He should have had a pre-nuptial agreement.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Of course, but he didn't.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He could've given one. He could've given a million. She would have been extremely happy with 1 million.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A lot of money a mean you give somebody a million dollars you get divorced here's a million bucks.[Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Why don't you get Peter Cook on the Apprentice the guy with Christie Brinkley
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not a bad idea.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Not bad, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Maybe I'll get Christie Brinkley on.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'd rather have Peter Cook.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd rather have both.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Get them both on. [Inaudible] How would O.J. Do, let's say O.J. Had agreed to be on The Apprentice do you think you could have given him a shot to win?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, I think he could win. I think he'd kill most of the people on the show.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You think he'd kill the other contestants. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know a friend of mine he's a friend of mine a great guy, I won't tell you his name, but he's a big guy. He had O.J. On the board on a board of a charity.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he, you know, when this happened recently as I said Did you ever said you know O.J. Was a nice guy but every once in a while like if he got into an argument or a disagreement with somebody in the board the rage was unbelievable the board was sitting there they were petrified. [Inaudible]
<Artie Lange> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is a board of stiffs. This is a board of rich stiffs, and O.J. Would get angry and everybody would just shake they didn't know -- And that was before he killed the wife. So you know they had no idea.
<Artie Lange> <Negative> The black guy's angry.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Must have been unbelievable. So Heather Mills could be one of the potential
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Could be.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> next season people like --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know Joan Rivers announced, your friend, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She announces she's on. We have -- let me just tell you when we did Celebrity -- Apprentice became a tremendous success. And then last season we did Celebrity Apprentice, which frankly I like more, because you don't have to build up the characters, you know the characters have been there for 25 years, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we did Celebrity Apprentice, it became a tremendous success a ratings. It only matters if it's a ratings you know. I mean when I say Success meaning it's good ratings. You have shows that are unsuccessful in the ratings.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I had the guy on who won it.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Pierce
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Pierce. He's a good guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Pierce is great, yeah good guy. And I heard he was very nice. Calls me Mr. Trump like he is a great guy and -- H Good guy. And by the way it took a lot of heat because people didn't think he was a great guy. When I say he's a great guy he's a very smart guy. He deserved to win.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. You were honest about it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But think of it. He deserved to win he's got his own show. Trace Adkins, nobody ever heard of him, he was a country singer. Country singer Trace Adkins, right? By last year he told me he couldn't get into the Country Music Awards this year he hosted them. Right. So we got to number one record.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do you think he should give me 20% of everything?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Huh?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. I mean, yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. How about you, you build people up then make a fortune then they forget you', right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Artie Lange> <Positive> I'm doing it right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So everybody wants to be on The Apprentice, so now the problem we have over 100 and you know it's amazing how many celebrities or Howard. You know you think of celebrities like that like for like there's like thousands of them.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And you have had sex with most of them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, only the good looking ones.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Have you had sex with Madonna?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Never?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. Wouldn't be --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Is that a lie?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That would be a great notch on your belt.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't disagree. I'm not knocking Madonna but that wouldn't be for me. There would be zero attraction.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You do not feel attracted to Madonna.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would not -- I would not do good with her.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Because why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because I wouldn't be attracted to her.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You don't think you could get it up for her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think I'd have a hard time.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now I don't find her attractive.
<Artie Lange> <Positive> Not anymore, I agree.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, she's just not for me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Has she offered herself to you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Never?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I really don't know Madonna, actually. But I mean that wouldn't be my thing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do women come up to you and offer themselves to you? they say listen, I want you
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> What is the most outrageous offer you ever got?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They do, in levels of beauty that you wouldn't believe.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they're really, I mean, some incredible beautiful women that walk up and they'll flip their top and they'll flip the panties.[Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Have you ever had sex with a fat woman in your life.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I had sex with women that got fat. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> We that we understand that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Many times.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> He's never had. You know I got a feeling he's not.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Have you ever reduced yourself to a night where you had sex with a fat woman?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, actually I'm attracted to women that are a little chunky
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> A little chunky. I'm talking about -- Have you ever --

<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sure.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you a new man?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Are you happily -- [Inaudible]

<Donald Trump> <Positive> Can you imagine if I live answer that question, like, no -- Can you believe it? Front page of every frickin newspaper. I find it very content. Officially I am extremely content.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> If I could get Michael Vick on the Apprentice show, would you want it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like that idea.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You like that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know Michael Vick got a bad deal and you know what if you go to the south, and I go to the south, because I have deals and, they have dog things these dog things are all over the place. But then they put him in jail for the rest of his life. I mean the middle of his career
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> But they're not legal
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, they're not legal but you know they have them all over the place. The dog what a fighting.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But he's an NFL star
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Dog fighting, cock fighting, everything.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> NFL star, he doesn't need to be involved. It was a very stupid thing for him to do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was stupid and for him to be involved in all that. I'm not a big fan of pit bulls. I've known too many people who were badly hurt by pitt. I know a girl who is beautiful who is taking care of a dog who was a pit bull. The dog ripped her apart. So I'm not a big fan you know these people come out, oh the poor dog the poor dog. These are trained killers these dogs.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I'm not, you know, when I had two pit bulls fighting they fight themselves than us.
<Artie Lange> <Negative> You know what, Donald, you obviously got a hit show and I don't want [Inaudible] give some advice. You have Michael Vick on and the task he has is he has to open a kennel or a pet shop and you have Hitler on, he has to open a diamond store on 47th Street. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Have you ever been with a woman that looked really hot with her clothes on and get her naked and then you're totally disgusted like you just couldn't deal?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's happened to you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, yes.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So there are women who can disguise. What happens when they take the clothes off? What do you see? Saggy tits, [Inaudible] pancake tits?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. But I think that this woman was extraordinarily bad breast jobs.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. What do you mean?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, everything looks very beautiful but you know they had the wrong doctor and things like that. So actually it's not so much. Isn't it unbelievable, women are -- one woman beautiful had big beautiful real boobs, really beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And she wants them reduced.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You get a breast reduction, Robin.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I got a breast reduction, Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That should be against the law. You agree?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> To me, I think to me I think anybody is insane if a woman is, okay I hate to say this Robin,
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No doctor should be allowed. They should go after these abortion doctor. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I don't know if you're happy with who but I have never seen a good breast reduction.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Well she got the wrong doctors because I've seen that too, and the scarring is a nightmare.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I saw a woman --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Do you have any scarring, Robin?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> They're -- they're hidden.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hidden scars.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Really? Well then you have a good doctor because I saw woman who was totally beautiful
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She was angry that so many men were calling her. How dare they call me. It's terrible. They're all looking at my breast. So she had a major breast reduction. The good news nobody calls her anymore. And the bad news, nobody even looks. And not only that was a terrible job. I mean she has scars up and down. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I happen to think, so many doctors, you know I'm not a big fan of doctors. I've seen so many doctors destroy people.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Tell me etiquette though. Here you are you're Donald Trump you're famous beautiful woman comes up to you want to make love you take her back to your room she's now nude and you see these defects. At that point do you go ahead and bang her any way to be a gentleman or do you find a way out of it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You're talking pre-marriage?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Pre-marriage of course. Absolutely. I'm actually talking post-marriage but I know you can't so go ahead. What do you do?
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> How about dooring, Howard?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I thought she was a really nice person. I would do everything I can to, you know, because I wouldn't want to insult her. I really would.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You would try your best?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But I'm not good for medical, you know, in other words like if you like cut your finger and there's blood pouring out,
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You're gone. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I tell you what ha -- I was at Mar-a-Lago and we had this incredible ball the Red Cross ball right in Florida in Palm Beach Florida and we had the Marines, and the Marines were there and it was terrible because you know all these rich people they're only there they're not there they're there to support the Marines. But they're really there to get their picture in the Palm Beach Post, you know the Palm Beach post, you know all the shining shit. So you have all these really rich people and a man about 80 years old, very wealthy man, a lot of people didn't like him, he fell off the stage.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the Marines were given the worst table the whole place, you know they gave the worst table in the whole place to the Marines and we're celebrating the Marines is like 10 Marines and everybody else has the good table. They don't even know what the Marines are. They never heard of the Marines couldn't tell us how much they are giving $100, 000 a table but they don't even know where the money is going. They couldn't care less. So what happens is this guy falls off right on his face hits his head. And I thought he died. And you know what I did. I said. Oh, my god that's disgusting and I turned away. I couldn't, you know, he was right in front of me. I turned away. I didn't want to touch him. [Inaudible] The Marines, this is a great thing
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Can somebody clean that up?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now the Marines, he's bleeding all over the place. I felt terribly you know beautiful marble floor didn't look so good. It changed color became very red. And you have this poor guy 80 years old laying on the floor unconscious and all of the rich people are turning white. Oh, my God this is terrible, this is disgusting and you know they're turning away. Nobody wants to help the guy his wife is screaming She's sitting right next to him she's screaming. What happens is these 10 Marines from the back of the room they were so far back you know it's a huge ballroom. Mar-a-Lago, you've been there.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I've seen it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So in the back of the room they come running forward. They grab them. They put the blood all over the place that's all over their uniforms. They're taken at this swipe. They ran them out they created a stretcher they call it a human stretcher but then runs out like five guys at each side. They ran him out. I never saw it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You would never do that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say like, clean up it's disgusting.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You wouldn't shake hands with me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That guy forgot to call the next day. I forgot to call to say if he was okay. It's just not my thing. So you know when --
<Artie Lange> <Negative> You're afraid you'll get the disease through the phone.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not even disease I just don't like looking at blood.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I know, I know it's terrible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Like you know, when these people call me that when I know it's terrible like you know when these people call me like a beautiful girl. I see a beautiful girl. She says, Oh Mr. Trump I want to be a nurse. I said, A nurse? You want to clean up and you want to be a nurse? I respect nurses but you want to be a nurse. Oh, I love it. Mr. Trump. You know it's just menus that's why they have menus in restaurants they're all different.

<Donald Trump> <Positive> Somebody said to me how did you make it so successful? I said, Number one, I got the best looking girls in the world. Number two they wear six-inch heels. And number three they were the tiniest suits you're allowed on television.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Whereas Miss America, they had a protest they shouldn't wear high heels. So they wear flats. Have you ever see a girls legs in flats [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Horrible. Horrible
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, [Inaudible] it's no good. And then they had to wear a big fat bathing suit. So we got very -- Okay, so the girls on the show, I don't -- Did you see it at all?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I only have clips.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The best-looking group of women that I've ever seen on a beauty pageant.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So they were the hottest girls you'd see.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the girl who won was Miss Venezuela.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.

<Howard Stern> <Positive> Are you mad your wife even has gotten so good with English. I mean, you like a girl --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she does speak I mean, she is very smart. My wife is really smart. I mean she can look at a car or a computer. She can do any -- She can fix the thing before she opens a computer with no instructions, turns it on fixes it, starts it. I said, Don't you have to read the book? She says, No no. Look all you do -- [Inaudible] She's very smart.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And that's good.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I'll tell you what, this -- the girl that one from Venezuela.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Maybe at the top. The girl who came in second from Colombia speaks not a word of English, Robin, but many men would leave their wives even though they can't speak Spanish.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> They could never make a same status [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Who is the hottest celebrity right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, let me just say that though Jennifer Hawkins, Jennifer Hawkins was Miss Universe three years ago.

<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I understand life that life is fragile and it's just what it is you've got to do.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Not afraid of death?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. And I have a good time with my life. You know, I mean, I have a good time. I could lock myself into a nice building. Pick my least conspicuous building. Okay. I'll take my least conspicuous go to my worst location least conspicuous you know. Right. I just lock myself in and take a nice apartment.

<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah. That's true.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Mel Karmazin. Lives in one of the great -- I won't tell you which one because he'll be inundated by his many fans but --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Groupies.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Mel not only does he live in a Trump building but he lived in the Trump building before he moved up. He stepped up in class, he went from one good one to one great one.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That is very true.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Everyone lives in my buildings so, you know.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But I didn't know Fred Norris had a Trump Building.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's an honor to have Fred.
<Fred Norris> <Positive> Great place to live.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Did you ever try to evict Fred?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know he's very very current.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You know who doesn't live in the Trump building? Benji.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> Benji.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Fred Norris> <Neutral> That's true. He lives in the alley beside Trump.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right now listen, Donald Trump isn't here for his health.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> All right. What's he here for?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And by the way Ralph wants to agree with Donald Trump real quick that Miss Venezuela is the hottest chick. Go ahead. You can verify.
<Ralph Cirella> <Negative> Oh, my god. I fuckin watched the show the other night. The hottest chicks you ever seen. Me and JD were watching. And we are both picked three chicks. I think Miss Kosovo, Miss Russia and Venezuela and I won. That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you are right and Miss -- Miss Colombia was un --
<Ralph Cirella> <Negative> How hot was Kosovo?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Kosovo was beyond belief. Actually a couple of our male judges have never returned to the country.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Ralph told me the way he watches the -- the Miss Universe contest. They pick three girls pick a horse yet you pick a horse and you pick one. And you bet on. And he won with Miss Venezuela.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Actually it's become a big betting deal. You know, this is what I need. Okay. But it's become now a big deal. That's good. But the Miss Universe contest now has become a monster. And you know you saw the other day and they just did the ratings thing and it won the evening and the ratings. It does great. It's I got a good look of anger now. I bought a property for peanuts. I made it hot. Is that good?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You did well. This is your whole thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK now let's talk about affliction.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You can now explain what affliction is and why you got involved.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well MMA, mixed martial arts, and I always like it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I love it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I do more boxing than anybody probably. I have Mike Tyson was fought for me, I think 16 times more than anybody else.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Big money maker.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Mike Tyson was a great money maker.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Boxing is so hot though.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Boxing has become cold. But any time you announce a Mike Tyson fight sold out in three seconds, okay? And boxing today is not the same thing. It's fine.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> There's no superstar.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I think. All of a sudden you have some hot guy come up, it will be fun. Boxing will always be fun. But the hot thing now is MMA. And we have a company we formed a company with a very, very substantial group of guys. And it's also with Affliction, which is a clothing company, which is a phenomenal company which is hot as a pistol.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And this is mixed martial arts?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is mixed -- And we have a fight on Saturday night and it's going to be on Pay-per view, Saturday night at the Honda Center, which is sold out, which is --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why is this such a big fight? Who is fighting?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have Feidor, the Russian, who's never been defeated. He is -- They say the toughest guy in the world.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What's his thing? Karate, Jujitsu?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everything. His thing is inflicting death on people. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He's insane.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> How big a guy is he?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's abnormally strong.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> How tall.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's not that big either. Weighs about 225 pounds. He's fighting a guy who's a great champion who weighs a hundred pounds more and he's like six inches seven inches taller.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And not giving the other guy a great chance they give him a chance but not a great chance. And I said how could this guy who I met because I'm six foot three and I'm probably taller than Feidor. Which in theory would mean I should be able to take him out.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Have you ever fought? Have you ever been in a street fight?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I'm not into a street fight I've been. I used to fight a lot in high school.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> We probably think you grew up you know fairly wealthy this kind of.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I actually used to fight a lot. I mean, I almost got thrown out of school a couple of times for fighting.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You got your ass kicked, or you kicked some ass?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was good. I was good. But I really said, in fact I looked at this guy, and there was a group of beautiful women standing there you know there always are, there have a lot of beautiful women. For some reason, it's like 10 people trying to tempt me. But you know a thing like that isn't a possibility.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No. You're very much in love.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's because I'm in love. So there's this beautiful woman and I'm looking -- Wait, and I look at the way I'm looking at this Russian Feidor, with a face like you don't want to touch, with ears like I've never seen before,
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Like an animal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Muscles on his -- his shoulders like I've never I've never seen muscles. His neck is like, I think it's 28 inches. I said to the girls let me ask you a question, If I worked out for a little while do you think I could take this guy? They go, Yes Mr. Trump.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> There it is, money speaks. Going back for one second. Do you really think you're capable of loving another human being? I mean seriously.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Really loving?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Really loving?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure absolutely sure. Oh, absolutely. Are you talking about children also?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> No. Forget children. I know you're not capable of that. Do you really love? When you say you're in love, what does that mean to you? What does it mean to you? What does it mean to love your wife?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have a very deep love for my wife, I do.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What does that mean?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It means -- it means a friendship. It means respect. It means you like you really like somebody. You like being around somebody. It means you're like protecting that person.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> If she died tomorrow, God forbid.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd never go out with another one.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You know you would.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No I wouldn't. I might not.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Might! [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what I hate. When I see a woman and a man married, and a woman is married to a rich guy, right? And then the guy kicks the bucket. He's gone and she's dating the following week.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Drives you crazy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And now she's living in a mansion you know the beautiful mansion in Palm Beach and the whole thing.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Do you worry that Melania would do that? You suddenly had a heart attack or something.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I always say as I go into one of my many houses I say, You know if any guy ever lives in this house I'm going to be looking up at you. I'm going to be cursing you.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> If Melania got fat, I'm talking about 60 pounds heavier. Do you think you could really love her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, sure. No problem.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> A lot of your ego know a lot of
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No problem, look at Robin. Look how skinny Robin, how much weight did you lose?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> A lot of your ego
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You look great.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> A lot of your ego is, you want to be seen in public with a beautiful woman.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You think he's that shallow?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Of course he's just like me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't need to be with a beautiful woman.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I mean, stop.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Well, we've never seen you with a
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So if Beth gained 100 pounds you wouldn't be with her? You'd drop her?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What? 100 pounds? Oh, my god. I'm telling you. Melania gains 70 pounds and has facial hair now. You're not staying with her.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd be I'd be extremely loyal.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You'd be turned off.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Physical doesn't mean anything to me. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> There's an idea for a show I want to show you. Put you on Pay-per view, Celebrity multi-millionaire
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Billionaire.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Billionaire. Bowling. You versus Warren Buffett.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That sounds good.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Sounds good.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How about golf?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Bowling is good. If you were in a bowling alley with Warren Buffett I'd watch that. [Inaudible] We got a good deal on a bowling alley. Let's review. We've got the big Affliction
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Coming up Saturday
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That sounds like a success. I love to watch guys beat the hell out of each other and this is what we're talking about. We're talking about guys really
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we have the best fighters, we have the best fighters in the world and not only Feidor, but we have a whole list of fights that are phenomenal fights and everybody in that world really knows, and they know all the fighters.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And you don't have any moral issue like where you are, Maybe I should tell you guys you're okay with it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've been doing it all my life.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You like it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I've been doing it all my life. I love fights. I mean I -- I love boxing too, but boxing somehow has lost an edge. And you know I don't know something's wrong, sometimes you'll see a match which is so mismatched and then the other guy wins, the one or lost wins and you get tired of it. I've watched too many fights.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Cause it's the real deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, this way it's sort of like you just somebody dies. I've never seen anything like that and it's terrible. You know it's not like oh how would the judges voting. Okay, it's like you know somebody just succumbs. Right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Irish John Go ahead quick for Mr. Trump, quickly. Hi, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi.
<Irish John> <Negative> With Howard's interview with Piers Morgan. He spoke of how distractingly hot your daughter was if you had known that during the competition would you have fired him on the spot?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Piers Morgan said, he at times he could not concentrate during the Apprentice because your daughter is so frickin hot. She is hot.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean look, she is, she's a beautiful person she's got every guy calling. I have like a gatekeeper.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> She's single again, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She was -- she is but she's actually now she's with a young man who's a great guy. And I don't know what's going to happen. I'm not sure what's going to happen but she has actually got a boyfriend who's a great guy.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Does this still drive you crazy when some guys tagging your daughter? I mean I you know I mean have --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Tagging, It's something I can't even think about.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You don't even think about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can't imagine.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You do background checks on these guys?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Tell the truth.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Not in this case I mean she's got a very nice guy. So we'll see how much.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Rich guy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Use her in all the ads she looks stunning.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> She looks beautiful.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She has really become a big star. You know even really before the Apprentice she was doing well. But then I put on the Apprentice and she became amazing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Do you love her more than your son because she is more famous?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I have all great children. I have five children.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Not the little ones. The two older sons.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. They're great. I have Eric and Don.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Rank the kids in terms of your favoritism.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All the same in the world. Like you two and they're all very different. I mean, they're very different but you know
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You don't love any of them. I put let's say your daughter and your two sons on a boat. You have to throw two of the kids overboard. Who do you save? You've got to say, listen, you might as well save one of them.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Everyone of them is gonna die if you don't save one.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Who do you throw overboard?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nah, that's not even a question I want to answer.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I thought you'd say your daughter. Your daughter is more famous.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She is very famous.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Won't you save your daughter?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's on the cover of every magazine. She's doing great.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It be more worthwhile to save her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I just couldn't answer a question like that I mean that's a question you can't even answer. They're all great kids.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> How do you feel being a grandfather.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not good.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He's not -- You're not gonna let them call you grandpa.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No I don't. And I don't consider myself a grandfather. I don't even want to hear the term.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Can they call you Donald? What does the kid call you? Seriously.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> My boy?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're not grandpa. [Inaudible] Your grandson.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, it's a granddaughter. Doesn't call me anything. I don't get to see her very much.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> The kid doesn't have his number.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I expect to see the child over the next few months. I'll let you know.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Would you be willing to do a show where I put you in a boat with your children and we sink it? And you have to save one of them alive?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'll pass on that. Let me pass on that show.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Seriously I have a friend who became a grandfather he does not see himself in that role it doesn't want to be called Grandpa.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> True.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He has a nickname for himself. You know he did call. Wouldn't it be wise for your grandchild to call you Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Or D or something where it isn't grandpa.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Anything but Grandpa.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So, what are you gonna do? What's the name?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know. I'll train the kid properly.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Why not an apprentice with all of your children. And we get to pick the favorite child. What do you think? Come on let's get crazy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Actually Don has done very well in The Apprentice also.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My son Don has done very well. But you know it's a little tougher I think for a guy as opposed to a woman.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> How about all your ex-wives in The Apprentice? Who would win?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> He was at Ivana's wedding. You two are sort of friendly right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She was very nice. she got married at Mar-a-Lago and
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I met her new husband.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Nice guy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Seems like a nice guy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He came to me they came to me and they said would it be possible for us to use Mar-a-lago? I said, would you pay me $2 million of my money. And they said, Oh, how about a million? I said, [Inaudible] They got married at Mar-a-Lago it was a very nice wedding and
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Do you feel he loves her? The new husband
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I haven't asked him.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you think is going on there?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. I mean he must love her.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He's a much younger guy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Much younger.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He doesn't have the assets she has. Do you feel he married her for her money?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think he married her because he's desperately in love. Ever hear the song desperately and hopelessly in love? I hear that sound from years ago I remember right away and hopelessly in love. That's that's pretty sad when you're desperate and hopeless. Well I think he's desperately and hopelessly in love.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I am very excited about Affliction brand because I love this mixed martial arts. I do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good.

<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not dislike. I disrespect and I think he's doing a terrible job.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right and you're ready to fire him to use the words of The Apprentice.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's hopefully going to be fired by his own accord pretty soon. You know it's amazing. He lied to this country about really important things like the most important things. Got us into a war that we shouldn't be and we should be. I'm the worst hawk of all. I am -- I am not like a dove. I am the way. But we went to the wrong place Okay. We did go to the red line in Afghanistan. You know Saddam Hussein like them are not like him. He used to kill the terrorists. [Inaudible] A breeding ground for terrorists.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He's more afraid of the terrorists than we are.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He used to kill terror -- If they came into the country he would kill.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's right. So he was in a way. He's the only one who could even run the country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it's you know it's a very very sad situation.
<Artie Lange> <Negative> The thing about Hussein was he was more like a mafia don he wasn't a religious freak, you know, that's more American we could deal with it
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I tell you what, like this guy, date this guy. When that guy a character with a cell phone took the picture of him before he got hung. There aren't a lot of people that would handle it the way he did. That's why he's cursing at everybody saying you know this and that he's not out there begging saying, Oh, please don't do this please. He's out there as, you know, say what you want. He was one tough cookie.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And he went down in a manly way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The best thing that ever happened to him? That cell phone because it showed he has guts.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> And you know how I came up with a nickname that Donald's granddaughter could call him. An acronym Reeva
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Which is?
<Artie Lange> <Negative> Reason I'm very affluent. [Inaudible]

I used to make speeches and I have thousands and thousands of people show up to speak and for years I'd say don't buy don't buy don't buy now's the time now I say bye bye bye. This is the time to buy. [Inaudible] But you can't get financing because the banks are all busted. You know, the banks are all out of business. They're going down the tube. I say, Yeah but the financing is already there the banks already put up the money it's a foreclosed building it's a mess. You take back the paper

<Donald Trump> <Positive> Would you ever be one of those guys at some point say look I'm old enough. I'm going to give away five billion of my money and I'll be fine with two.
<Artie Lange> <Positive> Warren Buffett right.

<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Are you leaving the kids set?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I have great kids and they do a good job for me and they work in the business they're really doing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Do you want to be the richest guy in the world?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. Because you know I just want to do what I'm doing. I don't do it for money I do it because I really love doing it and I'm making money because I do it well. I mean if do a building [Inaudible]I
<Howard Stern> <Negative> If I do it and you find out he's worth $10 billion, do you go, Man, I'm not successful.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No. Because first of all he's a great friend of mine. He's a member of the Mar-a-Lago club, which I like. He's a member of all my club. And he's a great guy. No. I don't I don't feel that way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wish I was worth more than him.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You know there's always Bill Gates there's always somebody else out there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There is always somebody.
<Artie Lange> <Negative> That's a lot of billions to get.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Recently somebody said Bill Gates is now number two. There's always somebody, he can't let that get you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You know you don't care about it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. Doesn't matter
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I just want to know what kind of servants you have like, do you get up in them like you wake up -- Oh, shut up. Do you have a butler who wakes you up and serves you breakfast, lays out your clothes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Melania.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who bathes you, who dresses you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I get up very early I read the papers in the morning.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Three papers?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I read I think The Post does a very good job every time.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> The Times
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Times, The Wall Street Journal. I see the news. I get a lot of paper.[Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> When you get up you have to pee immediately, right? Like the rest of us, I assume, unless you're so wealthy --
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> But who's waking you up? Is the butler getting up [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I get up myself. I really don't have anybody. I have like an alarm clock I get up at 4:30.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You have a urinal that you're peeing too or do you have a toilet?
<Artie Lange> <Negative> Urinal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Toilet.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You have a toilet. Do you seat down on the toilet when you pee or do you stand up?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't even think about it. I would say mostly in the standing position.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Has Melania ever waken you up with a blowjob.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh!
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Cause you're a billionaire. If you're not getting that --
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Nobody should.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So she doesn't, does she?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She wouldn't do a thing like that.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> Let me introduce you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She wouldn't wake you up with oral
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She wouldn't. By the way. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Don't get off the segway. Has Melania waken you up with her mouth on your penis?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do you remember when I said one of the most beautiful women in the world Miss Russia. About four or five years ago.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why are you changing the subject?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That ruined her that destroyed her. You know she quit Miss Universe after doing a show.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Stop.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She became Miss Universe and she started asking her questions like this, she quit. But actually I fired her. I said, Oxana, you're fired.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She became impossible after this show.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Would that annoy you if a woman woke you up that way. Like in other words when you were laying on your back and I felt that you would like that. Is that a fantasy of yours?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No but it's something that wouldn't particularly bother me.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So she should wake you up that way.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who says she doesn't?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're saying no.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean you know we we have a very very good time together.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I bet your billionaire buddies are jealous when she's parading around a bathing suit and there was some old hag.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, some of them don't like me for that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's right they get jealous. All right.
<Artie Lange> <Negative> Let me suggest something Mr. Trump, the next time you can put $50 in cash together when you're in Vegas you can get something called the hooker alarm clock.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Oh, my God.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Artie loves that. They'll blew you away and finally I have another suggestion. How long before we see. And I think this has a great ring to it. But Trumpire State building.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've run out of names I have towers and castles and everything. I've run out of them. So that's a very fine name.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I like that you can have that Artie's giving you.

<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I really haven't.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I mean you calm down about that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was never crazy about it, but you know she attacked me and I attacked her back and became this crazy.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> You launched some missiles, man.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Like I said I tried it. I go on The Today Show and Meredith is very nice. Yes. And her friends I'm talking about The Apprentice going on you know the Apprentice is going on in an hour right after the Super Bowl. So she starts off, Donald what about Rosie O'Donnell? I say, What about it? since you guys but do you hate her. And did you call her fat. I said, No. I called her, Degenerate. I didn't use the word fat because it's politically incorrect but I did call her a total degenerate and I did call her a pig. I shouldn't have called her that. She asked me third question about Rosie. Then she said, Can I ask you a question. Why do you always talk about Rosie. Cause you asked me the question. [Inaudible]
<Artie Lange> <Positive> I think you ask me right now a lot about his lovely daughter and I must say that, and this is no bullshit. I think she really is one of the most uniquely beautiful women that I was just on a plane. And I had a magazine and she's got a fascinating look. Now. You know I think
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He's asking for your permission. This is very gentleman.
<Artie Lange> <Negative> I roasted you from here. I think we're friends.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He doesn't even know your name.
<Artie Lange> <Positive> I make a good living. I do. I'm alright.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I would say he fits in beautifully.
<Artie Lange> <Negative> Day I drop a few pounds and maybe I lose the Jersey accent and I was up [Inaudible]. He would never allow you to have sex with her daughter. Tell him.

<Artie Lange> <Negative> Would she date a guy. [Inaudible] He's being sarcastic. She's very beautiful. She is beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Let's hope you do hook up with her. Because that would be great for the show.
