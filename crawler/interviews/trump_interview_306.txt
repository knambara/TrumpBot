<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> Donald Trump joins us now by phone. Thank you for joining us, Mr. Trump. I want to pick up where Cecilia just left off. It seems like Fox News might be taunting you a little bit saying -- suggesting you are showing fear about being questioned by Megyn Kelly in that debate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I have no fear. I don't think she is a good professional, I don't think she is professional at all. She is very biased against me. I have done debates now, George, including one with her. I've won every one of them, according to every online pole, if you look at...
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> So, you will be there Thursday?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me?
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> You will be there Thursday?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm making a decision. I think she's not a professional. I don't think she is a very talented person. I don't think she is a good reporter. I think they can do a lot better than that. I love doing the debates. You know, I just do think they should get competent reporters. They shouldn't use somebody like her. She's...
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> So, we should assume you will be there Thursday night?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's not very good at what she does. I will tell you that.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> We should assume you will be there Thursday night?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you can probably make that assumption, but I'm thinking about it.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> You talked about our latest poll. Sixty four percent of Republicans now expect you to be the nominee. Which part of the job of president give you the most pause?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's a very daunting task, and we are in deep trouble.  The country is a mess.  You look at the Iran deal, which is so sad, and now they are taking that money and spending it with everybody else, including terrorists, by the way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You saw that with Secretary Kerry, the other day.  Which was frankly disgusting when he said he expects that to be given to terror.  What's he making a deal for, if they are going to give it to terror? But you look at so many different aspects, our economy, look at the stock market today, look at it for the last weeks.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The worst opening in its history we have gone down so much. We're in a bubble. And, you know, frankly if there's going to be bubble popping, I hope they pop before I become president, because I don't want to inherit all this stuff. I'd rather have it be the day before, rather than the day after. I will tell you that.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> Ted Cruz is coming at you hard in Iowa, launching a new ad today, in Iowa. Here's a part of it. [Begin Video]
<Announcer> <Negative> Would President Trump ban partial-birth abortion?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am pro-choice in every respect.
<Announcer> <Positive> And what does Trump think about Iowa?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How stupid are the people of Iowa?
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> [End Video] He's backing that up on the stump saying a candidate who for 60 years has supported partial-birth abortion, we should not be surprised if, as president, he does not defend the right to life.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> George, I am pro-life, 100 percent. He knows it. Everybody knows it. And as far as the Iowa, I was talking about -- they were backing somebody and I didn't say just Iowa. I said, The people of Iowa It's just like his last ad, which he had to take down, because he said I ripped down a woman's house, which I didn't, because of eminent domain.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Eminent domain -- you wouldn't have roads, you wouldn't have highways, you wouldn't have hospitals without eminent domain. By the way, you wouldn't have the Keystone Pipeline if that ever gets built. So, I mean, you know, he really does lie. He's so nervous...
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> But -- but wait a second, what...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, I saw him -- hey, George, I saw him the other day. He's so nervous. He's such a mess. His polls have gone down, like I have never seen polls gotten down. People realize he probably can't even run for president, he was born in Canada. And now all of these constitutional...
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> But let me -- let me just stop you there, though.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... where is it coming out...
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> Where is the -- where is the lie in that ad? You used to be strongly pro-choice, now you say you are strongly pro-life. What I am trying to pin down is...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no I am...
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> What cause the conversion?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am saying, I am pro-life.  And he is not making it that way.  Yesterday, he said that I ripped down a woman's house for an economic development job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I never ripped down the house.  I never -- I decided I wouldn't do that.  I mean, he's just saying lie after lie.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's so -- it's not becoming. And he's got a problem. He's got a very much bigger problem. There's a lot of people think he can't run for president. He was born in Canada. There are many, many constitutional scholars, including Laurence Tribe, including many others -- I mean, I am not even talking about Laurence Tribe of Harvard anymore. We have so many others that come out and say flatly he's unable to run. Illinois has a problem. They might not be able to certify him because of it. So, he's got to get that straightened out. Otherwise, he can't even run for office.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> You have got a lot of top Republicans nervous, including Haley Barbour in this morning in New York Times saying, The establishment should rally behind anyone not name Cruz or Trump How do you respond?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, he's an old-time politicians.  He's been up in my office looking for money for many times.  And he is an old-time politician who is loosing his grip.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And frankly, I haven't heard the name Haley Barbour mentioned in a year and half.  And I guess people don't like to get out.  The fact is, that whether they like it or not, I am in first place by a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Cruz is in second place. And a lot of that is because people are fed up with the old-time politicians like Haley, that haven't done anything. And you look, we have Barack Obama for the last eights years. Because of people like Haley Barbour that don't know what they are doing, frankly. They are only good for themselves. They are not good for the people.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> Mr. Trump, thanks for your time this morning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> But we're going to begin with the Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump, who joins me live from Palm Beach, Florida.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning. Thank you. Thank you very much.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> [Begin Video] Let me start with this idea of whether it is a three-way race.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I have a big advantage, but it's certainly a three-person race and, uh, you have a couple of other people that are very talented there, too. So we have a -- we have a five-man race and I think that it's going to be, you know, it's going to be not easy. I have a big advantage, but a long way from being won.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Well, that's very humble of you this morning.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, on the -- on the mandate, if you look at the mandate, we had a situation where we were Anderson Cooper, who's terrific, by the way, and did a terrific job, but we were talking over each other.  Look, I want -- we're going to -- we're going to repeal and -- and replace ObamaCare.  ObamaCare is a total and complete disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's going to be gone.  We're going to come up with a great health care plan, whether it's health care savings accounts, we have a lot of different things.  We're going to get rid of the lines between states.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to have great competitive bidding. But I say all the time, you can call it anything you want, people are not going to die in the middle of the street.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People are not going to die on the sidewalk if I'm president, OK?
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Well, let me get something definitive from you...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> When I say that...
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- on this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- Chuck, I say that...
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me. I say that to packed houses with thousands and thousands of people...
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- Republicans, mostly, and I get standing ovations. I'm not going to let that happen. If I'm president, we're not going to have people dying on the streets. So you can call it whatever you want.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> No, I understand that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't call it a mandate.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Well, let me ask you this...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I just say it's common sense.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> -- do you think that it should be a law that anybody who can afford health insurance has to have it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I -- I think, no. I think it's going to be up to them, OK? I want it to be up to them. But I -- the -- I'm really talking about people that can't afford it. We're not going to let people die in some -- in squalor because we are Republicans, OK? That's part of the problem with the Republicans, where somehow they got fed into this horrible position. We're going to take care of people. But, no, people don't have to have it.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> A...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to have to get plans. They're going to be a lot less expensive than ObamaCare. They're going to be private and there are going to be lots of different options. We're going to have...
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- a lot of different options. Right now, you have no options. You know why? Because the insurance company controlled Obama because they gave him a lot of money. That's why you have lines around the states...
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Let's play...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- so that you can't get competitive bidding.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Now let's move to Planned Parenthood.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right. I do.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> -- you'd defund it. Now, the government will say Democrats...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right, I would.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> -- Democrats will say the money they give to Planned Parenthood does not go to abortions, that the money they give to Planned Parenthood only goes to other women's health issues, including mammograms and things like that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, if -- if it didn't have to do with abortions.  Look, I understand and I have many, many friends who are women who understand Planned Parenthood better than you or I will ever understand it.  And they do some very good work, cervical cancer, lots of women's issues, women's health issues are taken care of.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know one of the candidates -- I won't mention names -- who said we're not going to spend that kind of money on women's health issues.  I am.  Planned Parenthood does a lot of good job -- a really good job in a lot of different areas.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But not on abortion. So I'm not going to fund it if it's doing the abortion. I am not going to fund it. Now, they say it's 3 percent and it's 4 percent. Some people say it's 60 percent. I don't believe it's 60 percent, by the way, but I think it's probably a much lower number. But Planned Parenthood does some very good work. But I would defund as soon as they're doing abortions.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> All right, let me move to the issue of Iraq. Obviously, a couple of clips came out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right. Sure. [Begin Video] We have an idea who the enemy is and a lot of times the politicians don't want to tell you that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Are you for invading Iraq?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, I guess so. You know, I wish it was -- I wish the first time it was done correctly.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> [End Video] Now, clearly, you didn't sound like an enthusiastic -- enthusiastic supporter of the war and -- but I am curious to the second part of that quote...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wasn't.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- the first time it was -- I wish the first time it was done correctly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, what I mean by that is it almost shouldn't have been done and, you know, I really don't even know what I mean, because that was a long time ago and who knows what was in my head? I think that it wasn't done correctly.  In retrospect, it shouldn't have been done at all.  It was sort of, you know, it was just done.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was just -- we dropped bombs.  Now, if you look back, actually, that was probably the correct way of doing it, not going in and not upsetting, giving them a lesson or not.  I mean I think Senior actually did a pretty good job of what he was doing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He went in, he taught them a lesson. What happened is he was taunted, because Saddam Hussein was saying we drove back the Americans, the ugly Americans were driven back, the power of Iraq, the power. Well, we didn't -- weren't driven back, he just decided not -- General Schwarzkopf and others said maybe let's not go in, I'm not sure, although I think Schwarzkopf actually maybe wanted to go in. I think he made -- maybe did the right thing. I can say this, if you look at my conversation with Howard, who was a friend of mine. He's actually a very good person...
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- a good guy, different from what you see on the radio, OK. I won't say it. But if you look at my conversation, I was a very -- that was probably the first time -- don't forget, I was in business. I was a businessman.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was a real estate man and a businessman. That was the first time I think that question was ever even asked of me. That was long before the war took place. That was, you know, many, many months before the war took place.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you could see by my answer, I wasn't exactly thrilled...
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- Joe Scarborough just released...
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- Joe Scarborough just released something yesterday more on point, much nearer, and he put out a Tweet saying that, you know, this...
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- Trump is right, look what he just said. So you have to take a look at that. But regardless, the war in Iraq was a disaster. It was probably the worst thing -- if you look at the Middle East now, it all started because of that horrible decision to go into Iraq. And you know what we end up with? Nothing. We spent $2 trillion, we have thousands and thousands of lives killed and just thousands, carnage, and we have wounded warriors, who I love, all over the place, right. And we have nothing. And Iran is now taking over Iraq. They've been trying to for many, many decades ---
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- and now they're finally taking over Iraq. As we sit here, they're taking over Iraq.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Well, let me...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We get nothing.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> -- let me give you one more issue where you sort of went counter to what is perceived as Republican orthodoxy...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. Fine.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> -- and that is on the issue of Israel and the Palestinians. You said Wednesday you want to be -- to be neutral in that dispute.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, they want me -- look, no, I'm very pro-Israel.  In fact, I was the head of the Israeli Day Parade a number of years ago.  I did a commercial for Netanyahu when he was getting elected.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He asked me to do a commercial for him.  I did a commercial for him.  I am.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I don't want to be -- look, the hardest thing to do is that in terms of deals, if you're a deal person, right, the ultimate deal is that deal -- Israel, Palestine, you're -- it -- are -- if you're going to make it, that probably is the hardest deal there is to make.  People are born for -- with hatred.  They're taught hatred and I have to say, it's mostly on the one side, not on the other side.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But they're taught hatred.  I say this.  If I'm going to be president, I'd rather be in a position, because I will try the best I can -- and I'm a very good dealmaker, believe me -- to try and solve that puzzle.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're not going to solve it if you're going to be on one side or another.  Everyone understands that.  If I'm going to solve the problem, I want to go in with a clean slate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Otherwise, you're never going to get the cooperation...
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- of the other side. So that's all I'm saying.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Donald Trump, I'm going to leave it there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> We'll be watching on Tuesday. [End Video]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You've got it.
