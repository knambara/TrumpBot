<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Well, joining me on the phone right now is Donald Trump. Mr. Trump -- welcome back to Meet the Press. Donald Trump
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [On the Phone] Good morning. And I have to tell you, his ad is wrong because I never knocked down that house. I wanted to get the house to build a major building that would have employed tremendous numbers of people but when the woman didn't want to sell ultimately I just said forget about it. So he's got me bulldozing down a house, I never bulldozed it down. It's false advertising.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Well, alright, I think the accusation was that was what you wanted to do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, the accusation was that I did it and I didn't' do it. So I didn't. But you know, the word eminent domain. If you didn't have eminent domain, you would haven't highways, you wouldn't have the Keystone Pipeline because they need it desperately if it's ever going to get built. You wouldn't have roads. You wouldn't have schools, hospitals. I mean, I don't love eminent domain but you need eminent domain or you don't have a country.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Look, this race between you and Ted Cruz, he wants to make it about who's the real conservative. Here's what he said yesterday when it comes to you and conservatism. I want to get you to react to it. Here he is. [Begin Video]
<Ted Cruz> <Neutral> Perhaps one of the reasons that the Washington establishment is rushing so quickly behind Donald Trump is that Donald has been an active supporter. He gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation. He's actively supported Hillary Clinton as a political candidate. He supported Chuck Schumer, he supported Andrew Cuomo, he supported Rahm Emanuel so they know he will cut a deal.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> [End Video] I know you've embraced the idea of cutting a deal but some conservatives fear you're not a real conservative, that 60 years you weren't a conservative, you've only been one the last eight or nine.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well that's not right -- number one. And most conservatives love me or I wouldn't be having the poll numbers -- Fox just came out, they just released their numbers are through the roof. I wouldn't be having the poll numbers that I have that. I am a conservative but I get along with people. Ted cannot get along with people at all. I mean the biggest problem he has, he's a nasty guy and nobody likes him. Not one Republican senator -- he works with them everyday -- not one Republican senator endorsed Ted Cruz. I mean when you think of it, that's actually impossible to even believe. Not one.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Mr. Trump, why -- I'm just curious. You've been laying into Cruz over the last ten days on this issue. For six months you talked about how much you liked Ted Cruz. Were you pulling the wool over our eyes on that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, He was very nice to me and I kept saying when is it going to happen, Ted? When is it going to happen? I was waiting because I want to counterpunch.  I don't want to be the first one.  And then during the debate which everyone said I won he got very nasty and he started hitting me and I hit him back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I was saying he was following along.  Anything I said was OK to him.  Anything I said and he was really -- look I had some people that have been terrific on the stand.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I like some of the candidates very much on a personal basis. But Ted was very -- and then I said and during that period of time I said come on, Ted, when is it going to happen? Because I understand Ted. Ted is a nasty guy who is not a very well-liked person.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> It sounded like -- you said the other you wouldn't vote for him if he's the nominee. Is that true?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I talked about the fact that I'm not sure that I can vote for him because as you know, he has a very major issue. In fact, Illinois now is looking at it very seriously. I don't even know if he's going to be OK to run in Illinois, in the state of Illinois. He was born in Canada, he was born on Canadian soil, he was a citizen of Canada --
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Can you sign a pledge?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Chuck, Chuck --
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Can you sign a pledge that you will support the Republican nominee?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will.  I just don't want -- that was relating to Canada, by the way when I said that.  The question was that and it's relating to Canada.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The question is whether or not he can run.  And I tell you something, from the standpoint of voters in Iowa and New Hampshire and all these places that have to vote, how can you vote for a candidate -- how can you do it when you don't even know if that candidate is able to run.  Lawrence Tribe from Harvard said it's totally unsettled law.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A number of top constitutional lawyers have come out recently over the last few days and said he's not allowed to run, he was born in Canada, he can't run. So there's a real question and I said he should get a declaratory judgment. He has to do something because how can you have a campaign when it's very possible you are not allowed to run.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Let me ask you about National Review"
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, first of all, that's not an insulting quote. It really isn't. I was going to hit him really hard.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> I know -- you were about to, weren't.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It wasn't really an insulting quote.  The National Review" is a failing magazine and you get that.  They did it because they'll get nice publicity.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am a conservative.  What I say to people is this.  Ronald Reagan He became a great president also and I've evolved and a lot of people have evolved.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A lot of people changed positions on things over the years. And by the way, Ted Cruz has changed his position. He was a very, very -- he was very weak on illegal immigration. He was very, very weak on illegal immigration. And now all of a sudden because of my stance he got strong but Ted Cruz was absolutely weak on immigration and now all of a sudden he got stronger. So, you know, let's see what happens. But I use the term Ronald Reagan, I use the name Ronald Reagan and that's pretty good to me.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> You know, just about -- well, about 15, 20 minutes ago Mitt Romney put out a tweet saying four years ago today he put out his tax returns and he believes that every 2016 candidate should release their returns before the first contest.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're working on that now. I have very big returns, as you know, and I have everything all approved and very beautiful and we'll be working on that over the next period of time, Chuck -- absolutely.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> What's the period of time? Before the voting begins?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. I mean this is not like a normal tax return, this is a big tax return. And I will say this and I'm very proud to say it, I think the country is run horribly. I hate what they do with our money and unlike everybody else, I try and pay as little tax as possible because I hate what they do with my tax money. I hate the way they spend our money, the way they give it to Iraq, the way they give it to Iran, the way they give it to -- everything. They give it to everybody.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> But you'll release it. You are going to release it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hate the way our politicians spend our money. I hate the way they give it away to everybody but us. We have to rebuild our country.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> But you will release it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I say it and a reporter said that's the most refreshing answer I've ever heard on taxes. Because everyone tries to build it up, like Mitt Romney, he built it up, tries to build up how much he pays. It doesn't work that way. We're working on it right now and at the appropriate time you'll be very satisfied.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> And finally I have to ask you about Bloomberg. What do you make of the idea that if you're the nominee, if Sanders is the nominee, that's what would inspire Mr. Bloomberg to go third party.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Michael has been a friend of mine over the years. I don't know if we're friends anymore frankly. But Michael has been a friend of mind. I would love to have Michael Bloomberg run. I would love that competition. I think I'd do very well against it. I would love to see Michael Bloomberg run.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> All right, you embrace its. Mr. Trump, I'll leave it there. Stay safe on the trail. We'll see you next week in Iowa.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right -- thank you very much.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You got it.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Good evening. I'm Barbara Walters. And tonight, the Donald Trump you have rarely, maybe never, seen before. Not blustering on the campaign trail, but intimate at home, a family portrait, with his wife, Melania, in her first sit-down interview since he announced his candidacy. Plus, his children and even his grandchildren. So here is the inside look at the man who is hoping to hear you're hired, instead of his signature, you're fired.
<Reporter> <Neutral> Donald. To your right. To your right.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> For years, Donald Trump's life was the style was the stuff that tabloid dreams are made of. Donald Trump What a great honor it must be for you to honor me tonight. Barbara Walters The brash billionaire was a real estate mogul, married to three glamorous women, a bestselling author who made cameo appearances in movies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Clip from Home Alone 2] Down the hall and to the left.
<Will Smith> <Neutral> Go in another 50 grand and I'll cut the grass for you every Saturday.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Clip from Commercial] Hey yourself.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Most recently, he reinvented himself as the host of a reality show "The Apprentice."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Clip from The Apprentice] You're fired. Barbara Walters Not the typical resume of a man who aspires to be president.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> What made you start running? Did you have a dream? Did you get up and say, you know what, president?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The time I really thought about it was last time when Mitt Romney ran. And he ran and I decided not to do it. And I had a lot of obligations. I was, signed a contract with "The Apprentice," and I had a lot of buildings under construction.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was doing a lot of things. It was sort of difficult to do it then. Now I'm in perfect, you know, it's perfect. Although I gave up two seasons of "The Apprentice," you know.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> NBC signed me...
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Aw.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know, but it still, you know what, it's a lot of money and it's two years of primetime television.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And other things. But this time, I said I'm going to do it myself.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> But Donald Trump is a candidate unlike any other.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> 'Cause our leaders are stupid. Stupid. Stupid people. Bing, bing, bong and dat.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> With his lack of propriety...
<Stephen Colbert> <Neutral> [Clip] Donald Trump.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Trump has made the theater of politics popular.
<Jimmy Fallon> <Negative> [Clip] The only one qualified to interview me is me.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> But some say it's also less than presidential.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Clip from Saturday Night Live] You used to call me on the cell phone.
<Matthew Dowd> <Negative> [Clip] We are in that moment today where there seems to be no distinguishing between reality TV, celebrity and political or hard news. He is the most reality TV star of a candidate that has ever existed at the most reality TV time in America.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> I first met Donald Trump in 1987. Michael Jackson was at the top of the charts.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Hair was big. Greed was good.
<Martin Sheen> <Negative> [Clip] Greed works.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> And then, 41-year-old Donald Trump was flying high.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> When you look at that wonderful skyline, do you say I own that, that, that and that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I look at that skyline, Barbara, and I really say it's the greatest in the world, and I'm very proud to be a part of it.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> In the Big Apple, the Trump card was an ace.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Anything else you want to buy as you look out there? Any good properties that we can see?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'd really like to buy everything if that were possible.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> I bet you would. What about Central Park?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, I think that should be preserved and left and Donald Trump should not be allowed to touch Central Park.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> A lot of people are very relieved.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> But Trump was already dreaming about his next conquest, a future far more grand than just prince of the city.
<News Anchor> <Negative> [Clip] New York developer, Donald Trump, charging American foreign policy lacks backbone. Is he running for something?
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> It was the beginning of a long flirtation with the greatest "get" of all.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're going to see whether or not I'm going to run.
<Reporter> <Neutral> [Clip] Are you running for president?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have never been so serious as I am now.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Finally, after almost 30 years, the man who might be president sailed down an escalator for his surreal moment of destiny.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am officially running for president of the United States.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> His speech was one of the most jaw-dropping presidential bids in history.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we're going to make our country great again. The US has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems. We have losers. They're laughing at us.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> His thoughts about immigration, provocative to say the least.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border and I will have Mexico pay for that wall.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> How do you plan to do this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. Ready?
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Yep.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> First of all, we have to build a wall. We have to create a border. We have to have a wall. We're going to have a wall.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's going to be a real wall, not a little wall that they drive trucks with, drugs over the top of it, okay? You see the pictures...
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Yup.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...in the newspapers where they have ramps right over the little wall. And it's not going to be hard to build. It's going to be done, hey, who's better at building than me? I know exactly what to do.
<Amy Robach> <Negative> [Clip] New fallout for Donald Trump.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Unlike any ordinary candidate, Trump didn't back off. He doubled down and set off a firestorm.
<Reporter> <Neutral> [Clip] Well, call it another Trump dump. Macy's is now cutting ties with Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> When you send these people out, what do you do with the women and children?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They're going to go with them. Everybody. You have to send...
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Send the whole...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, sure.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> You send the whole family?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's got to be a family unit. It's going to be done humanely.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> You speak your mind, heaven knows. You have sometimes offended women, Latinos, veterans. How can you unify the country when you make these divisive statements?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Women respect me. They like me and they know I'm going to take care of them. I'm going to protect them. The people that are here legally, Hispanics, like me because they don't want people coming in and taking their jobs.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Do you speak any Spanish?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. This is an English-speaking country, remember? They want to.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> From the beginning...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What the hell are we getting involved for? Come on.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> His inflammatory comments have drawn criticism from every quarter.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let's go, baby.
<Jon Stewart> <Positive> [Clip] Trump's running for president, like...
<Bill Maher> <Negative> [Clip] This is your worst nightmare.
<Wendy Williams> <Negative> [Clip] Could he actually win?
<Actress> <Negative> [Clip] No freaking way.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Trump is the shock jock of the political campaign, but it's paying off big in the polls. He's now at the top of the pack for the Republican nomination.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> After you announced your run for the presidency, there was a cover story in the "Daily News" that showed you as a clown. You've been called crass, bigoted, obnoxious. Any of this bother you or does it all...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. Nobody calls me a clown now. I can tell you that. And you're right, at the beginning, they were doing everything they could and they, you know, everybody was trying to belittle, because that's what they do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, they've gained great respect because I've gone from going into a race that everybody said I wasn't going to enter, and I went bing, bing, up, up, up. And now, I'm leading by a lot, so. I've spent less money and I'm in number one position. Other people have spent $30, $40 million and they're dying.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> I used some words to describe you disparagingly. What words would you use to describe Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I mean, I'll give you the positive. I've always had great imagination. I've had great success with money, but what they say is, is he a nice person? And I think, actually, I am a nice person, but I think the thing that will surprise people, I'll be a unifier. I think I'll bring people together.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that includes blacks and whites and everything. I think people will come together.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> But the man who calls himself a "unifier" has had a divisive history on the campaign trail.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> One second.
<Jeb Bush> <Negative> [Clip] No.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't want to...
<Jeb Bush> <Negative> [Clip] This simple fact is, Donald, you cannot take...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> More energy tonight. I like that. I never attacked him on his look, and believe me there's plenty of subject matter right there.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> You have said that one of the most important aspects in your personality is winning. Why winning? What about the, it's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like winning better. Look, we have to win.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Our country has to win. Our country's been losing for so long, it can't go on like this. It's not, we're not going to have a country left. I kid when I say, you're going to win so much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If I win the election, you're going to win so much at trade, militarily, every way. You're going to win so much you're going to get sick and tired of winning. We lose, every single way you can lose, we lose.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> And when Paris was attacked in a violent wave of terrorism, candidate Trump blasted back.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If they had guns, it would've been a much, much different situation.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> If you were president, what would you do to protect Americans from such an attack? Would you bomb Syria?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would bomb wherever they are. Right now, we're being so politically correct, nice and gentle, nice and gentle. We've got a cancer there, and the cancer is ISIS. Life means nothing to them.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> France has declared a war on ISIS. Should we declare war?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think so. Why not? Because right now they're getting people who have this great respect for ISIS, because ISIS is getting away with murder. They're knocking out airplanes, they're knocking out night clubs in Paris. You can't let that happen.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> You have said that you could reason with anyone, from Putin to the Chinese leaders. If you had an opportunity to speak with the leader of ISIS, what would you say?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You got to take them out, Barbara, and you got to take them out swiftly and strongly. As far as ISIS is concerned, that's a different thing. These people are crazy, okay. These people are crazy.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> You call President Obama, I'm quoting, "insane" for allowing Syrian refugees into this country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have no idea, Barbara, who they are.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> If you were in the White House right now, what would you being saying?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, I would be saying, let's go, folks. And I would be getting other countries...
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Let's go folks.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look. I am the most militaristic person. I will make our military so strong and so powerful, nobody's going to mess with us.
<Announcer> <Positive> Coming up, a glimpse at a campaign trail like no other.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Does anybody want to take a ride?
<Announcer> <Positive> And in rare interviews, Donald Trump's very own first lady, Melania.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Is yours a marriage of equals?
<Announcer> <Neutral> His children, and even his grandchildren. Next, on "Meet The Trumps."
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Donald Trump has always set the gold standard, literally, for life at the top. His $100 million, tri-level penthouse is inspired by Versailles, with a palatial living room, imported crystal chandeliers, hand-painted ceilings trimmed in gold leaf. It has sweeping views of New York City from every side.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> You have said that success is a kind of drug and it's too powerful for most people to handle. How do you handle success?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, a lot of people can't handle success. I've seen it. A lot of people can't win. They don't know how to win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You see it in sports, where they're right on the threshold of win and then they can't get it over the line. It's an amazing thing. Winning is tough. I always said winning is somewhat maybe innate, maybe it's just something you have.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, you have the winning gene. But I've seen it. I've seen great talent, both in business and lots of other things. They should be able to do it and they can't get the ball over the line.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> You are a winner?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think so. I mean...
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Yeah, I'm looking around. Yeah, there's a lot of...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ...I think so.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> There's a lot of gold here. Yeah, it makes sense.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I've done pretty well.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> He shares this palace in the sky with his beautiful and graceful wife, Melania.
<Melania Trump> <Positive> Hello.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look who we have.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> She has been mostly absent from the campaign trail until tonight. Mrs. Trump, it's a pleasure to see you and we don't see you that often. You are not on the campaign trail.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> How do you feel about campaigning?
<Melania Trump> <Positive> Well, it's my choice not to be there. I support my husband 100%, but we have a 9-year-old son together, Barron, and I'm raising him. And this is the age he needs a parent at home.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Were you involved in the decision of your husband to become president?
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> We discuss a lot, yes. And I encourage him and I...
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> You did? You encouraged him?
<Melania Trump> <Positive> I encouraged him because I know what he will do and what he can do for America. He loves the American people and he wants to help them.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Melania and her husband met at a party in 1998 where she caught the eye of the flirtatious Donald Trump.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> He came up to you, you rebuffed him. Yeah? What was your first impression of Donald Trump?
<Melania Trump> <Positive> Well, he was very charming and we had the great sparkle. He came with a date. So he asked me for the number and I said, I will not give you my number. So if you give me your numbers, I will call you.
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> And he was known as kind of a lady's man. And, but we had, we met a week later.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> And then it was okay?
<Melania Trump> <Positive> Yes, we had the great chemistry the first time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We've had great chemistry ever since.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Before she was Melania Trump, she was Melania Knauss, born 45 years ago in a small industrial town in Slovenia when it was still part of Yugoslavia. Melania, a natural beauty, was also a bookworm. She went to university and was studying architecture when she was discovered by a major fashion photographer when she was just 17. Soon after, she left school and Slovenia for New York City.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Who would imagine that the quiet girl from Slovenia would end up the wife of a mega-billionaire? Their relationship made international news. Not just because it was a May-December romance, he is 24 years older, but because of Donald's previous two high profile marriages and even higher profile divorces.
<Johnny Carson> <Positive> [Clip] Are you following the Trump thing? You can't miss it.
<Reporter> <Negative> [Clip] Latest dispatch from the front in the battle of Trump versus Trump...
<Maury Povich> <Negative> [Clip] The front page fiasco of lovers, lawyers and large settlements.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> The first, a 13-year marriage to the stunning Czech model, Ivanka Zelnickova, and the second, to actress Marla Maples.
<Reporter> <Neutral> [Clip] At last, they are Mr. and Mrs. Trump.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> [Clip] I give it four months.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Actually, it lasted just under four years. But today, it seems the third time is indeed the charm. It's been ten years since Donald and Melania said "I do" in a lavish affair at Trump's Mar-A-Lago estate in Florida. One year later, they welcomed a son, Barron, who is now 9.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> This is your third marriage. What's different this time?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I understand life. I've gone through tremendous amounts of everything, deals and building companies, and taking care of people.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> How does that help marriage?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it hurts marriage because you're working all the time. What I did is, I worked so hard that I think it was a very, very hard thing for somebody to compete with.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Your husband has been married twice before. Did you have any concerns that it might not work out?
<Melania Trump> <Positive> No, I didn't have any concerns. We have a great chemistry. And to be with a man as my husband is, you need to know who you are. You need to have a very independent life as well and supporting him.
<Melania Trump> <Positive> You need to be very smart and quick and be there for him when he needs you.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Is yours a marriage of equals?
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> I would say yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say no. No, I think she's far greater than the 50%. No, we have a very, pretty much equal relationship. Wouldn't you say?
<Reporter> <Negative> [Clip] Melania, how did he do? How did he do?
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> But if the Trumps win the White House, Melania will have two noteworthy distinctions. The first foreign-born first lady since John Quincy Adams' wife, Louisa and the first first-lady to have posed in a picture like this.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> I don't know how to put this, but your image, looking the way you do, is that a liability for your husband?
<Melania Trump> <Negative> I don't think so. I don't think so. I think people will always judge. Maybe they will say, oh, the past that you have, the way you were modeling.
<Melania Trump> <Positive> That's part of the job that I was doing. I was a very successful model and I did some photo shoots. Yes, they were a little, little risky, but nothing more than you see every year in "Sports Illustrated."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She was actually in "Sports Illustrated," which I just saw that picture the other day. It was beautiful. But I will say this, if I'm lucky enough to win, the public will be so lucky to have Melania as the first lady. She will be so beautiful and elegant, and good from the heart.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She will be a fabulous first lady.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> First ladies are expected to have a cause. If you have a cause, what would it be?
<Melania Trump> <Negative> I'm very involved in charities now. Many, many charities involving children, involving many different diseases. And I will, you know, if the time comes, I will choose what is dearest to my heart and work on that hundred percent.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Do you give your husband any advice on the debates?
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> We discuss. I tell him my opinions.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Give me an example of a piece of advice that you've given your husband that he has taken.
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> I will keep it private.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she's told me, and I can tell you she's told me a couple of times during the debate, she was very happy with my performances, if you'd want to call them a performance. But she said, you could tone it down a little bit on occasion, which I understand.
<Moderator> <Neutral> [Clip] In the center of the stage tonight, businessman, Donald Trump.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> And speaking of tone, I wondered if Melania had ever taken her husband to task on his tone towards women on the campaign trail.
<David Muir> <Negative> [Clip] Did he make a derogatory comment attacking Carly Fiorina?
<Jonathan Karl> <Negative> [Clip] Insulting the way she looks.
<Joy Behar> <Negative> [Clip] You said look at that face. Would anyone vote for that face?
<Carly Fiorina> <Neutral> [Clip] I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> You know, your husband has come under fire here and there for making disparaging remarks about women. Does this bother you?
<Melania Trump> <Negative> It doesn't bother me. He treats everybody the same. He talked about men as well, not about women only. Maybe they just go into something a little more details when he say something about women.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> While Melania laments the amount of time campaigning costs their marriage, the couple insists, that at heart, they're homebodies.
<Melania Trump> <Positive> When he comes home, we spend time together, two of us, or two of us and Barron. Just be at home because that's a really quality time together.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> And why not? When, for now, "home" is this lavish penthouse apartment, not Pennsylvania Avenue.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> For many, the White House is a step up. I am looking around this room. The White House might be a step down.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The White House is the White House. It's just a spectacular place. And, you know, it's something that represents something very special.
<Announcer> <Neutral> Next, the brand, the Boeing, the billions.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm really rich.
<Announcer> <Neutral> But is all that bankable at the ballot box?
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> What's the downside of being a part of the 1% of the richest people in America, especially when you're trying to reach the middle class?
<Announcer> <Neutral> When we return.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Donald Trump allowed us rare behind the scenes access to his life on the campaign trail. For Trump, membership in the billionaires' club does have its privileges. He travels on what is known as Trump Force One, a Boeing 757 that seats dozens of passengers. It has bedrooms, a theater system and gold-plated fixtures in the bathroom and on the seatbelts.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Monogrammed on the headrests is the Trump family crest. For Donald Trump, this is the only way to fly.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They've never had anybody that owned a Boeing 757 before. It's a little bit of an unusual thing.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Donald Trump, unlike most of the candidates, is rich enough to bankroll his own campaign.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm really rich.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> He flaunts his wealth, candidly.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> $8,737,540.00
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> You might think all his billions would alienate working class voters, but Trump says it's really a plus.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We don't want your help. I'm the only one that's self-funding. I'm not selling myself to special interests.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> But he does use his $7 million helicopter as a political sideshow.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Does anybody want to take a ride?
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> It made quite a splash at the Iowa State Fair.
<Martha Raddatz> <Negative> [Clip] What amazes you most?
<Child> <Neutral> His golf courses, his resorts, him himself.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> In a way, Donald Trump was born ready. The fourth of Fred and Mary Trump's five children, he grew up in the construction business. His father, a real estate tycoon, built middle and low income housing. He always knew how to get what he wanted.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> His brother Robert was no match for his schemes, as he told me in our first interview.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Robert had a set of blocks and I had a set of blocks and I asked Robert if I could have his blocks and I built a beautiful tall block building. And then, I said I like it so much that I glued it together and then Robert couldn't have his blocks. So I don't know, somehow that story is a story that a lot of people have asked me about. I don't know.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> What do you think it says?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it says that just, even at a young age, I wasn't so much different than I am now.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> That relentless desire to win made his name a modern synonym for success. If flaunting it was the game, Trump was the name. In the '80s, his fiery mix of hubris and vision caused him to win and lose fortunes.
<Reporter> <Negative> [Clip] You're going to fight it to the bitter end?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I always fight to the bitter end, don't I?
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> But today, the Trump kingdom is an empire, from international hotels, to golf courses, even a winery. The name Trump is such a brand for success that it has been licensed on an astonishing range of products.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a great-tasting vodka.
<Unidentified Female> <Positive> [Clip] Trump model management.
<Jimmy Kimmel> <Negative> [Clip] What does this guy not have his name on?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The reason my real estate is successful is they know if I put the name Trump on it, it's going to be the best.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> What's the downside of being part of the 1% of the richest people in America, especially when you're trying to reach the middle class?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there's a certain loneliness that you have, but that's made up when you have a great family. I have a great family, fantastic family, have a wonderful wife. But the funny thing is, I'm a rich guy, but I have this great relationship with the working people of this country, and that's true.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> What vein do you think you have touched?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The vein of people are tired of being lead by leaders, if you call them leaders, that are virtually incompetent.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Trump says he's a man of the people. Others say he's the P.T. Barnum of politics. Whatever the answer, he has been playing to crowds of thousands.
<Unidentified Male> <Positive> [Clip] Donald Trump speaks the truth.
<Unidentified Male> <Neutral> [Clip] He's not a politician, he's not paid off.
<Unidentified Female> <Negative> [Clip] Well, he's so damn good-looking, what do you think?
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> His theme song is his message and it has definitely hit a nerve. On this night, Trump owns the crowd.
<Matthew Dowd> <Positive> [Clip] The number one value people are, interestingly are looking for is authenticity. Is it real? Is it really real? He comes across at times as a bully, but people will take a bully who's strong over somebody else they think is nice who's weak.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have people who are just so pathetic.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Without question...
<Jeb Bush> <Negative> [Clip] We said no.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Wrong.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> The bluntness of his shock and awe campaign...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sit down.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> ...keeps pushing buttons and boundaries in every way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's going to be change, but real change, not Obama change. You remember?
<Announcer> <Neutral> [Clip]The next president, Donald J. Trump.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Trump is still the wild card in this election, a power broker whether he wins or loses.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> If you lose the nomination, what next for Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, you can lose the nomination, you can lose the election. What's next? I go back to what I was doing. I built a great company. Make America great again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think this is just a greater calling.
<Crowd> <Positive> Trump. Trump. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, this is the ultimate calling. President Trump. Thank you, everybody.
<Announcer> <Neutral> When we come back, the Trump children, all grown up, and unplugged.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> You have said, Ivanka, of your father, that he bred you to compete with each other.
<Announcer> <Neutral> The kids on Trump guilt and who's their father's favorite? Next.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> For every kid, there comes a point where your parents stop being cool. The things they say...
<Jimmy Fallon> <Negative> [Clip from The Tonight Show] It's going to be you.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> The things they do.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [SNL Clip] Call me on your cell phone.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> But the Trump children swear they are the exception.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Do any of you make fun of your father's hair?
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> Well, I like not to, because you never know what happens genetically.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> It is funny, because it's the only hair we've ever known, but people seem fascinated.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> This week, I sat down with Donald Trump's four oldest children. Donald Jr., 37, Ivanka, 34, Eric, 31 and Tiffany, 22. Not surprisingly, they all think their father would make the perfect president.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> What makes your father tick?
<Eric Trump> <Positive> Work. Honestly, work and family. He's the last man you'll ever see that'll take three weeks and go to Aspen or three weeks and go somewhere. I mean, he loves, he loves work.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> I need a quick show of hands. Which one of you is most like your father?
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> Well, but in fairness, I think we're all like him in very different ways.
<Eric Trump> <Positive> You know, it's actually very scary. We can go to Thanksgiving, right, and we can all...
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Neutral> Yeah, we'll sit there and pick at...
<Eric Trump> <Negative> Answer the same question using the exact same words in the same sequence.
<Ivanka Trump> <Negative> Trumpisms.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> I relish those holiday meals, because we can really sort of let loose. I mean, it is, it is a show, I mean, in and of itself. I mean, it's funny and we have a good time making fun of each other and just having a blast.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> I first met Don, Jr., Ivanka and Eric, his children by his first wife Ivana in 2004. The subject was nepotism.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Do you ever try to hide your name?
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Negative> I'd be lying if I said I didn't, especially when I was younger. There were times when you just, you didn't want to have to deal with everyone making those assumptions, however ignorant they may be, that, I'd go, say, introduce myself as just Don, or sometimes I'd avoid the last name at all costs.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Today, all three wear their last name as a badge of honor, working as executive vice presidents at the family business. Tiffany, Trump's daughter by his second wife, Marla Maples, is a senior at her father's alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, with plans to go to law school.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Tiffany, people are meeting you today, many people, for the first time.
<Tiffany Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> To grow up with the name Tiffany Trump, that's not easy.
<Tiffany Trump> <Positive> I think that it's all I know. I'm so happy to be Tiffany Trump. I'm so happy to be, you know, in the family I'm in, with my siblings and my father and my mother.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Your father has said that he was not, I'm using his words, very present when you were growing up.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> I would challenge him on that because he was very available to us and accessible to us.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Negative> Regardless of what he was doing, regardless of who he was meeting with, if we called, he took the phone. I mean, from when we were 6 years old, I'd call. He'd be negotiating with a CEO of a major bank or whatever it may be and he would make them wait. He'd take the call from us.
<Tiffany Trump> <Negative> Our times together were learning, you know, playing in his office. He would always sneak me down to get a candy bar, you know, in the lobby.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> He found a way that was true to him to connect with us that maybe is a little less traditional. You know, his work is his passion and he found a way to share it with us.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> They say their father also taught them to respect the value of a dollar.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> He was the first to tell us how privileged we are. And with that privilege how much responsibility we had to, to really sort of earn what we were so lucky to have been afforded since birth.
<Eric Trump> <Negative> Well, that's the right word, earn. I mean, he made us work. We were on construction sites and we were working. And at the end of the day, you were tired and you earned minimum wage.
<Eric Trump> <Positive> And you'd take that money that you had and you'd go out and spend it on something good.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Negative> To say we weren't spoiled would be laughable. But we were spoiled with great education, great experiences. But we weren't the kids showing up to college with, you know, a Ferrari. We always had to sort of earn whatever it is that we wanted.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Negative> And that, I think, prevented us from doing a lot of the other things that you've seen as, you know, downfalls, perhaps, in other children who have similar circumstances.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> And, it seems the Donald Trump work ethic is in their DNA.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You better do a good job or you're fired.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Negative> We refer to it as "The Trump Guilt." When we wake up on Saturday and we're not working.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> You have said, Ivanka, of your father, that he bred you to compete with each other. What do you compete over?
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> I think we all have a very competitive spirit and I think that can be harnessed in one of two ways. To our detriment, meaning that we're competitive in spite of ourselves, or for the positive, which means we push each other.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Who is his favorite?
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Neutral> I'm going with Ivanka. I'm going with Ivanka.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Ivanka is, perhaps, the most well known of the quartet. The former model turned fashion mogul has taken a page out of her father's business playbook, putting her name on everything from shoes, to handbags, fragrance. She says she is proud to be following in her father's footsteps.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> Today, I have the honor of introducing a man who needs no introduction.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> How was it decided that you would be the one who would introduce your father as a presidential candidate?
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> That's an excellent question. And I don't know, actually, how it was decided, but I was honored to do it. And I feel like I was standing there sort of representing our family.
<Eric Trump> <Positive> And she did an amazing job, by the way.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> She's a great messenger. She's got such great poise, I think. And also the way Ivanka delivered the message was perfect and I don't think any of us could have done it better.
<Eric Trump> <Positive> And she absolutely has beauty over the two of us.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Negative> Yes, there's definitely an element, that, you know, we ain't got that.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> They say they all are their father's biggest cheerleaders, supporting him at the debates and on social media.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Has your father ever said anything on the campaign trail that made you cringe?
<Eric Trump> <Neutral> Truthfully, no.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> No? No? No?
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Negative> He's not a big believer in PC culture where every statement you make you have to vet very carefully through thousands of people, but if people really break down what he's trying to say, there's no malice in there. He's just cutting through the nonsense and getting to the point and not wasting time. That's what he does.
<Tiffany Trump> <Positive> He's true to himself. And he speaks in a way that the average person can understand. I think that's refreshing for everyone.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Well, you have been saying the most wonderful things about your father. He should be very pleased and proud. If there is one thing you could change about your father, what would it be?
<Eric Trump> <Neutral> Listen, I don't think any of us would be sitting here glowing the way we are if we'd want to change aspects of his personality or who he is.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Something. Give me something that's...
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> I want him to eat healthier. There you go.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> I'd agree with that. I agree with that 100 percent.
<Tiffany Trump> <Neutral> Less McDonald's.
<Ivanka Trump> <Negative> Sometimes I'll tell him, like, oh, you have to, you know, slow down. But it's the only speed he knows and I kind of love that about him.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> I'm not gonna get one thing?
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Negative> I love the occasional, you know, Saturday morning where I don't get the call at 5:00, like, why aren't you in the office? Come on, come on, you had to do that?
<Tiffany Trump> <Neutral> Sleep a little bit more?
<Eric Trump> <Positive> He's a great man.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> He's an amazing guy and I wouldn't change a thing about him. I mean, he really is a unique individual. There's no one else like him.
<Announcer> <Positive> Still ahead, the littlest Trumps. And Barbara, asking the really up close and personal questions.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> What do you dislike most about your appearance? On what occasions do you lie? Not tell the truth?
<Announcer> <Negative> But what's the question he won't answer? Next.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> At the end of our interview, we turned from talking about Trump's candidacy to talking about the man. Who is he? What makes him tick? I asked him some questions often seen in "Vanity Fair" magazine.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> My fantasy when I was very young was to be a nightclub singer.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Wow.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Didn't happen. What was your fantasy when you were very young?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> To be a baseball player. I was a great baseball player.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> What position?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> First base. Catcher, first base. But, in those days you got paid $2, right?
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> And that's not for Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, no. But my other fantasy, as I got older, was to do movies. I wanted to be a movie maker and I decided not to. I decided to go into the real estate business, but I wanted to make movies.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Make them, not be in them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, not be, no, make them. I wanted to make them.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> What do you dislike most about your appearance?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like my appearance. I mean, people would say my hair. My hair's not bad. You know it's my hair.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Last time you started pulling my hair with your great show last time.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Is this part of your image or is it covering a bald spot?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a funny thing. I've always, like, combed it this way. It's probably maybe a little more...
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> You've always combed it down?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I really don't. It's really combed back. If you really look, it's combed sort of back, come on, Barbara. Get over here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now you're going to mess it up for this interview.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> No, here, I'll fix. There.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now after that, everyone knows it's real.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Okay, I'll go on. What is your greatest fear?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't want to reveal fears because if I reveal fears, I'm giving up something. This is where I say, I hate when I see generals being interviewed because they're telling things that the enemy, I don't like revealing weaknesses. And, you know, we all have certain fears and everybody has fears, but I don't like revealing my fears.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Okay. What's the trait you most deplore in yourself?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's one I like best and it's the one that it's a little bit tough for people. I never, ever quit. I never give up. And in one way, that can be a little aggravating to people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And in another way, I think it's a good trait.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> What do you dream about most frequently?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have good dreams. Just having a good life. Good family, good life. So important.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, Barbara, I see people that are very wealthy, friends of mine that are immensely wealthy people, the wealthiest people in the world, a lot of them aren't happy. They don't have a good family life. They don't have a good marriage. They don't have good kids or their kids are on drugs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the happiest people I see are people that have a good family life.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> On what occasions do you lie?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do I?
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Lie, not tell the truth.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think I will oftentimes, and I don't call it a lie, I call it a fib. If somebody's not looking good, I never would say that. I'll say, you're looking good or are you feeling good, how you doing?" And somebody could say that's a lie or it's a fib, but they don't look good, but, you know, I do it. I don't want to hurt people's feelings.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Believe it or not, I have a lot of feelings toward that. I don't want to hurt people's feelings.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Is there anything that you want that you don't have?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think the one thing that I want right now is the presidency. I will do a great job and I'll make a lot of people happy. It will be very positive thing. I don't need it for myself or my ego.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just think I'd do a great job. Thank you.
<Announcer> <Positive> You've met the children. Now, meet the grandchildren. Donald Trump kissing babies? Next.
<Annoncer> <Neutral> Once again, Barbara Walters with "Meet The Trumps."
<Child> <Positive> Hello, grandpa.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> It's a very different side of Donald Trump, the soft one, breaking from the daily grind to greet his seven grandchildren.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look at this, huh? What a troop.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> What is your father like as a grandfather?
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> He's been great. He's at a different stage in his life. He's able to relax a little bit more and be a grandfather.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Everyone having a good time?
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> I can see my kids running up to him and giving him a hug. They just respect him a lot.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Seems even the littlest Trumps are already learning from grandpa.
<Ivanka Trump> <Negative> A few months ago, we're walking down the street and my daughter sees a large pothole in the middle of a New York City street, and she looks at me and she goes, "Mom, grandpa would not like that." So it's very cute. And she's 4. So she's observed him.
<Eric Trump> <Positive> Definitely genetics.
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Those grandchildren, ranging in age from 17 months to 8 years old, have an unlikely uncle in 9-year-old Barron.
<Barron Trump> <Negative> Why is your head on a baseball over there?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What'd you want?
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> While we were there, Barron made a cameo appearance at his father's office.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> He's very close in age to my two oldest kids. They're like best friends.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> How old is Barron now?
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> Barron's 9 now. He's very close to my 8-year-old and my almost 7-year-old. And they have a great relationship. So it's almost, we joke, you have to really respect your uncle even though there's a one-year difference.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> So, that drives my kids crazy, but they play almost as though they're, you know, cousins or brothers and sisters when we are together as a family. So, it's a great way to really tie all of it together.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Say good-bye, everybody. Come on.
<Child> <Positive> Bye. Bye, grandpa. I love you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Bye, everybody. Bye.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Donald Trump is saying good-bye, everybody, and now we're saying it, too. We thank you so much for watching. I'm Barbara Walters. For all of us here at "20/20" and ABC News, good night, and have a wonderful weekend.
