<Christine Sperow> <Positive> Mr. President thank you for being here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. It's great honor.
<Christine Sperow> <Positive> [We have a special election] on Tuesday -- Dan Bishop versus Dan McCready. How important is it for you to pick up that seat?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's very important. We need Dan -- well you know, our Dan right -- which is Dan Bishop He's been fantastic. He's been a friend of mine, he's been somebody that I know well for a long period of time H.e's an outstanding person and he wants strong borders. He wants to protect your Second Amendment, which, as you know, is under siege in so many different ways.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And Dan Bishop, I think, should win tomorrow. He's got tremendous support. You see, not only do we have a full arena, but we have thousands of people standing outside. So, I think Dan's going to be in good shape. He's strong on crime, loves the military, loves the vets. He's going to help us in Washington.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> McCready --  I mean, the problem is, you take a look at what he wants, he wants open borders and he loves sanctuary cities. You can't have that.
<Christine Sperow> <Positive> Yeah. We were with the Vice President today, and he said that. He said a vote for Dan McCready would be a vote for sanctuary cities?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Which is not good. I mean it's not good, and certainly the people of North Carolina don't want that.
<Christine Sperow> <Negative> All right, let's talk about -- we had a big hurricane here last week in the state in North Carolina. I know you wanted an opportunity to go visit some of that area. What support can the folks who were impacted get from the government and rely on?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're actually meeting with a number of people, and we did before, as you know, because of, actually, hailstorms and everything else, they weren't allowing anybody to go in. But, they got hit hard. North Carolina got hit pretty hard, and we're taking care of it. We just spoke to your Governor. We're taking care of it very, very powerfully.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're doing all sorts of emergency declarations, and most of them have been done already, and a lot of work's been done. The Coast Guard has been incredible. FEMA's been incredible. And a lot of work -- it was very important to me, North Carolina. You actually got hit the hardest of anybody, if you think about it. I mean, we're not including the Bahamas, who really got -- and the government of the Bahamas, as you know, called me, and we're helping them out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They really got some beating. There's no question about it.
<Christine Sperow> <Positive> Yeah, absolutely. Let's talk about the Republican primary for 2020.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Christine Sperow> <Neutral> It was just announced the former governor of South Carolina Mark Sanford plans to run against you in the Republican primary. Your reaction to that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't think there's much reaction. I just got a 94 percent approval rating in the Republican Party, and that's the highest in history -- higher than Ronald Reagan who had an 87. So, I don't -- can't imagine with his past -- and you know a tweet that I gave actually knocked him out of the last race, he lost his last race.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I tweeted for his opponent, and his opponent won, and I actually did that on Election Day. So, it was sort of a crazy thing, but now I understand he's going to do something, and I guess there's a couple of other folks too that don't have the greatest record possible.
<Christine Sperow> <Negative> Well, Mark Sanford is trying to say the debt right now should be a reason why people should be concerned to re-elect you as President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we had to rebuild our military. Our military has been totally rebuilt, almost completely rebuilt, with new planes, which -- a lot of equipment made right here in North Carolina, and we have no choice but to rebuild our military. And we can start working on that very soon in terms of debt, because I understand that very well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think I understand it -- really, I've done very well with debt over the years, and I will tell you if we don't rebuild our military, we don't have much of a country, especially with the threats that we have, all the different threats that we have outside our country, beyond our country, internationally.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we have rebuilt our military, we've taken care of our vets. We've got choice approved. Our -- if you look at not only the vets, I mean, just the V.A. You haven't heard complaints about the V.A. for the last two years. The V.A.'s really running, for the first time, really smoothly, and we've done a good job, and we can cut costs very quickly at the right time.
<Christine Sperow> <Positive> All right, let's talk about the RNC. It's going to be in Charlotte next year.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right.
<Christine Sperow> <Negative> Lots going on. The mayor has said, welcome everybody from the RNC with open arms, but they don't want all the rhetoric that we sometimes hear.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's true. The mayor's been excellent, actually and we -- many cities wanted us to go there, as you know, it's a convention. It brings a lot of business, a lot of money, a lot of economic development, frankly, and the mayor has been terrific, and we think we're going to have hopefully a very great convention, and go on to victory in 2020.
<Christine Sperow> <Neutral> You're going to be the keynote at the National HBCU Conference Tuesday?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's what -- that's what I've heard.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What do you plan to tell other folks with historically black colleges and university?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know I've been very supportive of the historically black colleges -- more so than the previous administration. We've given tremendous amounts of -- hundreds of millions of dollars, and others haven't. I've been very, very supportive. So I look forward to being here.
<Christine Sperow> <Positive> Thank you for your time, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Great job.
<Christine Sperow> <Positive> Good to see you.
<Jonathan Karl> <Positive> Mr. President, we're six days away from the midterms. If the Democrats win –- I remember you surprised a lot of people by striking a deal with Pelosi and Schumer a year ago on the budget.
<Jonathan Karl> <Negative> Can you work with them if the Democrats win the House?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we certainly try. I'm looking to unify. I always like to unify. We will certainly try. They've had a very hard time, because they haven't been winning, and we'll see what happens in five days from now. It'll be very exciting, and it's going to be a very close race. They don't talk about the blue wave anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's going to be a very close race. I think in the Senate, we're looking very good. We feel very good about the Senate. And frankly, I think we feel pretty good about the House. But it's a lot of people. You know, it's so many races it's hard -- it's hard for me to get to every one of them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> With the Senate, we've gotten to just about everyone I needed to get to. And I think we're going to do very well.
<Jonathan Karl> <Negative> And if they get into the investigations and they get into your business dealings and your tax returns -–
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've been an open book for so long, Jon. You know that better than anybody. I mean, I'm an open book. And frankly, so many people have looked at me for so many years, and I guess it's probably one of the reasons I won. But I think they're going to want to get along too. [Video Ends]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If they –- look on the assumption they win the House, maybe they win both, and maybe they lose both -– who knows, it's going to be close.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Although I'm starting to see the Senate is not looking that close. It's going to be very interesting. I think they're going to want to do things. I think they're going to get legislation passed. We need things on the border, we need things on immigration -– they know that too. If you look at education, you look at health care, they're going to want to get things done.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I have a feeling it would be different than a lot of people would believe. But maybe not.
<Jonathan Karl> <Positive> Okay, you're talking about 10,000, maybe 15,000, active-duty U.S. military to the border –-
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Jonathan Karl> <Negative> -- more than we have fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. More than we have fighting ISIS in Syria. You're really going to do that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's very important. It's very important. We have to have a wall of people –- very highly trained people, terrific, dedicated patriots. That's what they are. You have caravans coming up that look a lot larger than it's reported actually. I'm pretty good at estimating crowd size. And I'll tell you they look a lot bigger than people would think.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we'll find out. They had a very rough one just formed in El Salvador if you can believe it. And it was very nasty, you saw what took place. And you look at what's coming up through Honduras through Mexico. And Mexico is helping us. But these are rough people in those crowds. And Mexico suffered a lot of damage in the last skirmish.
<Jonathan Karl> <Negative> But what we see is a lot of deeply impoverished people fleeing violence, many of them women and children. You're going to send 15,000 active-duty U.S. military to –-
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Actually it's mostly men. Actually mostly young men. And a lot of rough people, lot of rough people, Jon. You look –- and it's been well reported –- it's a lot of young people, lot of young men. They are pushing the women right up to the front –- not good –- and the kids right up to the front. But if you take a look at the caravans –- and now there's more than one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's two or three forming. And you take a look at it and they're strong young men. And you look at the skirmish they had with the Mexican police and army and it was a nasty skirmish.
<Jonathan Karl> <Negative> But they're 900 miles away. The active duty military –- you know the law. You're the president –- they can't arrest people crossing the border –-
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well it depends, it depends.
<Jonathan Karl> <Negative> No, they're not allowed to --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> National emergency covers a lot of territory. They can't invade our country. You look at that it almost looks like an invasion. It's almost does look like an invasion –-
<Jonathan Karl> <Negative> You think those caravans are an invasion?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do think so. When you look at some of them, when you look at some of the people within the caravan, I think it could be considered an invasion of our country. We can't have it. We can't have it from a cost standpoint, Jon.
<Jonathan Karl> <Negative> These are some of the poorest people in the world coming up here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are some dangerous people. These are some rough people. [Video Cut, this sentence not in video]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean you look at MS-13, they come from that area. This is a very rough group of people coming up. Not in all places but this is a very rough group of people. Look what they did to the Mexican army at the border. Look at the skirmish they just had.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was a very bad thing for the Mexican army; that was not easy. We'll see what happens and hopefully there won't be a confrontation.
<Jonathan Karl> <Positive> One of the central issues is health care.
<Jonathan Karl> <Negative> You've been saying Democrats want to take away preexisting conditions. I mean, it's your administration that's supporting a lawsuit that would allow health insurance companies –-
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but I want to replace preexisting conditions and I've always been there. What the Democrats are going to do is destroy our entire health care and you're not going to have any health care. [Video Break]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You would destroy the country. You are not going to have health care. The Democrats are going to literally –- you'll have to pay three times the taxes and they'll destroy health care as we know it in this country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You won't have preexisting conditions. You wont have anything.
<Jonathan Karl> <Negative> You don't really think Democrats want to do away with the requirement to cover preexisting conditions?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think they're going to have a choice because it's going to be so bad. So expensive and the health care is going to be terrible. I don't think they're going to have a choice. It's going to be a very bad situation.
<Jonathan Karl> <Positive> And finally I remember well –- you remember well in the campaign, you made a promise.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I try. I mean, I do try. I think you try too. You say things about me that aren't necessarily correct. I do try, and I always want to tell the truth. When I can, I tell the truth. I mean, sometimes it turns out to be where something happens that's different or there's a change, but I always like to be truthful.
<Jonathan Karl> <Negative> So what happened on the birthright citizenship where you said that we're the only country on the globe –-
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I was told that. But I will say this, we're the country people want to come to. And what they were referring to when they gave me that information is that we're the country they want to come to. People want to come to the United States. And I sort of jokingly say it's my fault, because I have really made this country strong economically.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People want to come into the U.S. now because we're doing well economically, Jon, as good as well as we've ever done as a country. And people are flowing up and I get it. And I want them to come in, but I want them to come in legally and based on merit. We have a lot of companies that are coming in. Companies from Japan, car companies going to Michigan, going all over.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Foxconn going to Wisconsin. We need workers. At 3.7 percent unemployment, which is a 50-year low, is that we need workers, Jon. And I want people to come in. I really do. I want people from the caravans to come in but they have to come in legally and through merit. We need workers.
<Jonathan Karl> <Neutral> You took a shot at Paul Ryan --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I didn't think he should be saying what he said. And he called me right after that. We're fine. I didn't think he should be saying –- I think he's wrong, OK? I think he's wrong. You know who's going to iron that out pretty quickly? The Supreme Court of the United States.
<Jonathan Karl> <Negative> Prediction for Tuesday?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Video Starts] We're going to do great in the Senate, as you can probably see and say, and you say –- but we're doing pretty well in the Senate. And I think we're doing pretty well in the House. You know what I'll say? It's going to be an interesting evening.
<The New York Times> <Positive> Following is a transcript of President-elect Donald J. Trump's interview on Tuesday with reporters, editors and opinion columnists from The New York Times. The transcription was prepared by Liam Stack, Jonah Engel Bromwich, Karen Workman and Tim Herrera of The Times. More on the Trump transition here.
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Positive> ARTHUR SULZBERGER Jr., publisher of The New York Times: Thank you very much for joining us. And I want to reaffirm this is on the record.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> DONALD J. TRUMP, President-elect of the United States: O.K.
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Positive> All right, so we're clear. We had a very nice meeting in the Churchill Room. You're a Churchill fan, I hear?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am, I am.
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Positive> There's a photo of the great man behind you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There was a big thing about the bust that was removed out of the Oval Office.
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Neutral> I heard you're thinking of putting it back.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am, indeed. I am.
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Positive> Wonderful. So we've got a good collection here from our newsroom and editorial and our columnists. I just want to say we had a good, quiet, but useful and well-meaning conversation in there. So I appreciate that very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I appreciate it, too.
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Positive> I thought maybe I'd start this off by asking if you have anything you would like to start this off with before we move to the easiest questions you're going to get this administration. [laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> O.K. Well, I just appreciate the meeting and I have great respect for The New York Times. Tremendous respect. It's very special. Always has been very special. I think I've been treated very rough. It's well out there that I've been treated extremely unfairly in a sense, in a true sense. I wouldn't only complain about The Times. I would say The Times was about the roughest of all. You could make the case The Washington Post was bad, but every once in a while I'd actually get a good article. Not often, Dean, but every once in awhile.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, I have great respect for The Times, and I'd like to turn it around. I think it would make the job I am doing much easier. We're working very hard. We have great people coming in. I think you'll be very impressed with the names. We'll be announcing some very shortly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Everybody wanted to do this. People are giving up tremendous careers in order to be subject to you folks and subject to a lot of other folks. But they're giving up a lot. I mean some are giving up tremendous businesses in order to sit for four or maybe eight or whatever the period of time is. But I think we're going to see some tremendous talent, tremendous talent coming in. We have many people for every job. I mean no matter what the job is, we have many incredible people. I think, Reince, you can sort of just confirm that. The quality of the people is very good.
<Reince Priebus> <Neutral> REINCE PRIEBUS, Mr. Trump's choice for chief of staff: [inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're trying very hard to get the best people. Not necessarily people that will be the most politically correct people, because that hasn't been working. So we have really experts in the field. Some are known and some are not known, but they're known within their field as being the best. That's very important to me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I've been given a great honor. It's been very tough. It's been 18 months of brutality in a true sense, but we won it. We won it pretty big. The final numbers are coming out. Or I guess they're coming out. Michigan's just being confirmed. But the numbers are coming out far beyond what anybody's wildest expectation was. I don't know if it was us, I mean, we were seeing the kind of crowds and kind of, everything, the kind of enthusiasm we were getting from the people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> As you probably know, I did many, many speeches that last four-week period. I was just telling Arthur that I went around and did speeches in the pretty much 11 different places, that were, the massive crowds we were getting. If we had a stadium that held — and most of you, many of you were there — that held 20,000 people, we'd have 15,000 people outside that couldn't get in.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we came up with a good system — we put up the big screens outside with a very good loudspeaker system and very few people left. I would do, during the last month, two or three a day. That's a lot. Because that's not easy when you have big crowds. Those speeches, that's not an easy way of life, doing three a day. Then I said the last two days, I want to do six and seven. And I'm not sure anybody has ever done that. But we did six and we did seven and the last one ended at 1 o'clock in the morning in Michigan.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we had 31,000 people, 17,000 or 18,000 inside and the rest outside. This massive place in Grand Rapids, I guess. And it was an incredible thing. And I left saying: 'How do we lose Michigan? I don't think we can lose Michigan.'
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the reason I did that, it was set up only a little while before — because we heard that day that Hillary was hearing that they're going to lose Michigan, which hasn't been lost in 38 years. Or something. But 38 years. And they didn't want to lose Michigan. So they went out along with President Obama and Michelle, Bill and Hillary, they went to Michigan late that, sort of late afternoon and I said, 'Let's go to Michigan.'
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It wasn't on the schedule. So I finished up in New Hampshire and at 10 o'clock I went to Michigan. We got there at 12 o'clock. We started speaking around 12:45, actually, and we had 31,000 people and I said, really, I mean, there are things happening. But we saw it everywhere.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we felt very good. we had great numbers. And we thought we're going to win. We thought we were going to win Florida. We thought we were going to win North Carolina. We did easily, pretty easily. We thought strongly we were going to win Pennsylvania. The problem is nobody had won it and it was known, as you know, the great state that always got away. Every Republican thought they were going to win Pennsylvania for 38 years and they just couldn't win it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I thought we were going to win it. And we won it, we won it, you know, relatively easily, we won it by a number of points. Florida we won by 180,000 — was that the number, 180?
<Reince Priebus> <Neutral> [inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> More than 180,000 voted, and votes are still coming in from the military, which we are getting about 85 percent of.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we won that by a lot of votes and, you know, we had a great victory. We had a great victory. I think it would have been easier because I see every once in awhile somebody says, 'Well, the popular vote.' Well, the popular vote would have been a lot easier, but it's a whole different campaign. I would have been in California, I would have been in Texas, Florida and New York, and we wouldn't have gone anywhere else. Which is, I mean I'd rather do the popular vote from the standpoint — I'd think we'd do actually as well or better — it's a whole different campaign. It's like, if you're a golfer, it's like match play versus stroke play. It's a whole different game.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think the popular vote would have been easier in a true sense because you'd go to a few places. I think that's the genius of the Electoral College. I was never a fan of the Electoral College until now.
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Neutral> Until now. [laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Until now. I guess now I like it for two reasons. What it does do is it gets you out to see states that you'll never see otherwise. It's very interesting. Like Maine. I went to Maine four times. I went to Maine 2 for one, because everybody was saying you can get to 269 but there is no path to 270. We learned that was false because we ended up with what, three-something.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've got to get, we've got to get Michigan in.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But there is no path to 270, you have to get the one in Maine, so we kept going back to Maine and we did get the one in Maine. We kept going to Maine 2, and we went to a lot of states that you wouldn't spend a lot of time in and it does get you — we actually went to about 22 states, whereas if you're going for popular vote, you'd probably go to four, or three, it could be three. You wouldn't leave New York. You'd stay in New York and you'd stay in California. So there's a certain genius about it. And I like it either way. But it's sort of interesting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> TBut we had an amazing period of time. I got to know the country, we have a great country, we're a great, great people, and the enthusiasm was really incredible. The Los Angeles Times had a poll which was interesting because I was always up in that poll. They had something that is, I guess, a modern-day technique in polling, it was called enthusiasm. They added an enthusiasm factor and my people had great enthusiasm, and Hillary's people didn't have enthusiasm. And in the end she didn't get the African-American vote and we ended up close to 15 points, as you know. We started off at one, we ended up with almost 15. And more importantly, a lot of people didn't show up, because the African-American community liked me. They liked what I was saying.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> TSo they didn't necessarily vote for me, but they didn't show up, which was a big problem that she had. I ended up doing very well with women, which was — which I never understood why I was doing poorly, because we'd go to the rallies and we'd have so many women holding up signs, "Women for Trump." But I kept reading polls saying that I'm not doing well with women. I think whoever is doing it here would say that we did very well with women, especially certain women.
<Dean Baquet> <Positive> DEAN BAQUET, executive editor of The New York Times: As you describe it, you did do something really remarkable. You energized a lot of people in the country who really wanted change in Washington. But along with that — and this is going to create a tricky thing for you — you also energized presumably a smaller number of people who were evidenced at the alt-right convention in Washington this weekend. Who have a very …
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I just saw that today.
<Dean Baquet> <Positive> So, I'd love to hear you talk about how you're going to manage that group of people who actually may not be the larger group but who have an expectation for you and are angry about the country and its — along racial lines. My first question is, do you feel like you said things that energized them in particular, and how are you going to manage that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think so, Dean. First of all, I don't want to energize the group. I'm not looking to energize them. I don't want to energize the group, and I disavow the group. They, again, I don't know if it's reporting or whatever. I don't know where they were four years ago, and where they were for Romney and McCain and all of the other people that ran, so I just don't know, I had nothing to compare it to.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it's not a group I want to energize, and if they are energized I want to look into it and find out why.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What we do want to do is we want to bring the country together, because the country is very, very divided, and that's one thing I did see, big league. It's very, very divided, and I'm going to work very hard to bring the country together.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, I'm somebody that really has gotten along with people over the years. It was interesting, my wife, I went to a big event about two years ago. Just after I started thinking about politics.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we're walking in and some people were cheering and some people were booing, and she said, you know, 'People have never booed for you.'
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've never had a person boo me, and all of a sudden people are booing me. She said, that's never happened before. And, it's politics. You know, all of a sudden they think I'm going to be running for office, and I'm a Republican, let's say. So it's something that I had never experienced before and I said, 'Those people are booing,' and she said, 'Yup.' They'd never booed before. But now they boo. You know, it was a group and another group was going the opposite.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I want to bring the country together. It's very important to me. We're in a very divided country. In many ways divided.
<Dean Baquet> <Positive> So I'm going to do that thing that executive editors get to do which is to invite reporters to jump in and ask questions.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> MAGGIE HABERMAN, political reporter: I'll start, thank you, Dean. Mr. President, I'd like to thank you for being here. This morning, Kellyanne Conway talked about not prosecuting Hillary Clinton. We were hoping you could talk about exactly what that means — does that mean just the emails, or the emails and the foundation, and how you came to that decision.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, there was a report that somebody said that I'm not enthused about it. Look, I want to move forward, I don't want to move back. And I don't want to hurt the Clintons. I really don't.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She went through a lot. And suffered greatly in many different ways. And I am not looking to hurt them at all. The campaign was vicious. They say it was the most vicious primary and the most vicious campaign. I guess, added together, it was definitely the most vicious; probably, I assume you sold a lot of newspapers. [laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would imagine. I would imagine. I'm just telling you, Maggie, I'm not looking to hurt them. I think they've been through a lot. They've gone through a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm really looking … I think we have to get the focus of the country into looking forward.
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Positive> If I could interject, we had a good conversation there, you and I, and it was off the record, but there was nothing secret, just wanted to make sure. The idea of looking forward was one of the themes that you were saying. That we need to now get past the election, right?
<Matthew Purdy> <Neutral> MATTHEW PURDY, deputy managing editor: So you're definitively taking that off the table? The investigation?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but the question was asked.
<Matthew Purdy> <Neutral> About the emails and the foundation?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no, but it's just not something that I feel very strongly about. I feel very strongly about health care. I feel very strongly about an immigration bill that I think even the people in this room can be happy. You know, you've been talking about immigration bills for 50 years and nothing's ever happened.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I feel very strongly about an immigration bill that's fair and just and a lot of other things. There are a lot of things I feel strongly about. I'm not looking to look back and go through this. This was a very painful period. This was a very painful election with all of the email things and all of the foundation things and all of the everything that they went through and the whole country went through. This was a very painful period of time. I read recently where it was, it was, they're saying, they used to say it was Lincoln against whoever and none of us were there to see it. And there aren't a lot of recordings of that, right? [laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But the fact is that there were some pretty vicious elections; they say this was, this was the most.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They say it was definitely the most vicious primary. And I think it's very important to look forward.
<Carolyn Ryan> <Positive> CAROLYN RYAN, senior editor for politics: Do you think it would disappoint your supporters who seemed very animated by the idea of accountability in the Clintons? What would you say to them?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think they will be disappointed. I think I will explain it, that we have to, in many ways save our country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because our country's really in bad, big trouble. We have a lot of trouble. A lot of problems. And one of the big problems, I talk about, divisiveness. I think that a lot of people will appreciate … I'm not doing it for that reason. I'm doing it because it's time to go in a different direction. There was a lot of pain, and I think that the people that supported me with such enthusiasm, where they will show up at 1 in the morning to hear a speech.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was actually Election Day, they showed up at, so that was essentially Election Day. Yeah, I think they'd understand very completely.
<Thomas L. Friedman> <Positive> THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, opinion columnist: Mr. President-elect, can I ask a question? One of the issues that you actually were very careful not to speak about during the campaign, and haven't spoken about yet, is one very near and dear to my heart, the whole issue of climate change, the Paris agreement, how you'll approach it. You own some of the most beautiful links golf courses in the world … [laughter, cross talk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [laughing] I read your article. Some will be even better because actually like Doral is a little bit off … so it'll be perfect. [inaudible] He doesn't say that. He just says that the ones that are near the water will be gone, but Doral will be in great shape. [laughter]
<Thomas L. Friedman> <Positive> But it's really important to me, and I think to a lot of our readers, to know where you're going to go with this. I don't think anyone objects to, you know, doing all forms of energy. But are you going to take America out of the world's lead of confronting climate change?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm looking at it very closely, Tom. I'll tell you what. I have an open mind to it. We're going to look very carefully. It's one issue that's interesting because there are few things where there's more division than climate change. You don't tend to hear this, but there are people on the other side of that issue who are, think, don't even …
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Neutral> We do hear it.
<Thomas L. Friedman> <Neutral> I was on 'Squawk Box' with Joe Kernen this morning, so I got an earful of it. [laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Joe is one of them. But a lot of smart people disagree with you. I have a very open mind. And I'm going to study a lot of the things that happened on it and we're going to look at it very carefully. But I have an open mind.
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Positive> Well, since we're living on an island, sir, I want to thank you for having an open mind. We saw what these storms are now doing, right? We've seen it personally. Straight up.
<Thomas L. Friedman> <Neutral> But you have an open mind on this?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do have an open mind. And we've had storms always, Arthur.
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Positive> Not like this.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know the hottest day ever was in 1890-something, 98. You know, you can make lots of cases for different views. I have a totally open mind.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My uncle was for 35 years a professor at M.I.T. He was a great engineer, scientist. He was a great guy. And he was … a long time ago, he had feelings — this was a long time ago — he had feelings on this subject. It's a very complex subject. I'm not sure anybody is ever going to really know. I know we have, they say they have science on one side but then they also have those horrible emails that were sent between the scientists. Where was that, in Geneva or wherever five years ago? Terrible. Where they got caught, you know, so you see that and you say, what's this all about. I absolutely have an open mind. I will tell you this: Clean air is vitally important. Clean water, crystal clean water is vitally important. Safety is vitally important.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know, you mentioned a lot of the courses. I have some great, great, very successful golf courses. I've received so many environmental awards for the way I've done, you know. I've done a tremendous amount of work where I've received tremendous numbers. Sometimes I'll say I'm actually an environmentalist and people will smile in some cases and other people that know me understand that's true. Open mind.
<James Bennet> <Negative> JAMES BENNET, editorial page editor: When you say an open mind, you mean you're just not sure whether human activity causes climate change? Do you think human activity is or isn't connected?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think right now … well, I think there is some connectivity. There is some, something. It depends on how much. It also depends on how much it's going to cost our companies. You have to understand, our companies are noncompetitive right now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're really largely noncompetitive. About four weeks ago, I started adding a certain little sentence into a lot of my speeches, that we've lost 70,000 factories since W. Bush. 70,000. When I first looked at the number, I said: 'That must be a typo. It can't be 70, you can't have 70,000, you wouldn't think you have 70,000 factories here.' And it wasn't a typo, it's right. We've lost 70,000 factories.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're not a competitive nation with other nations anymore. We have to make ourselves competitive. We're not competitive for a lot of reasons.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's becoming more and more of the reason. Because a lot of these countries that we do business with, they make deals with our president, or whoever, and then they don't adhere to the deals, you know that. And it's much less expensive for their companies to produce products. So I'm going to be studying that very hard, and I think I have a very big voice in it. And I think my voice is listened to, especially by people that don't believe in it. And we'll let you know.
<Thomas L. Friedman> <Negative> I'd hate to see Royal Aberdeen underwater.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The North Sea, that could be, that's a good one, right?
<Elisabeth Bumiller> <Neutral> ELISABETH BUMILLER, Washington bureau chief: I just wanted to follow up on the question you were asked about not pursuing any investigations into Hillary Clinton. Did you mean both the email investigation and the foundation investigation — you will not pursue either one of those?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, look, you know we'll have people that do things but my inclination would be, for whatever power I have on the matter, is to say let's go forward. This has been looked at for so long. Ad nauseam. Let's go forward. And you know, you could also make the case that some good work was done in the foundation and they could have made mistakes, etc. etc. I think it's time, I think it's time for people to say let's go and solve some of the problems that we have, which are massive problems and, you know, I do think that they've gone through a lot. I think losing is going through a lot. It was a tough, it was a very tough evening for her. I think losing is going through a lot. So, for whatever it's worth, my, my attitude is strongly we have to go forward, we have so many different problems to solve, I don't think we have to delve back in the past. I also think that would be a very divisive, well I think it would be very divisive, you know I'm talking about bringing together, and then they go into all sorts of stuff, I think it would be very, very divisive for the country.
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Positive> I agree, I think speaking not as a journalist now, it's very healthy. There, and then we're going to go
<Michael Shear> <Neutral> MICHAEL D. SHEAR, White House correspondent: Mr. Trump, Mike Shear. I cover the White House, covering your administration …
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> See ya there. [laughter]
<Michael Shear> <Neutral> Just one quick clarification on the climate change, do you intend to, as you said, pull out of the Paris Climate …
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm going to take a look at it.
<Michael Shear> <Positive> SHEAR [interrupts]: And if the reaction from foreign leaders is to slap tariffs on American goods to offset the carbon that the United States had pledged to reduce, is that O.K. with you? And then the second question is on your sort of mixing of your global business interests and the presidency. There's already, even just in the 10, two weeks you've been president-elect, instances where you've met with your Indian business partners …
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure.
<Michael Shear> <Positive> You've talked about the impact of the wind farms on your golf course. People, experts who are lawyers and ethics experts, say that all of that is totally inappropriate, so I guess the question for you is, what do you see as the appropriate structure for keeping those two things separate, and are there any lines that you think you won't want to cross once you're in the White House?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> O.K. First of all, on countries. I think that countries will not do that to us. I don't think if they're run by a person that understands leadership and negotiation they're in no position to do that to us, no matter what I do. They're in no position to do that to us, and that won't happen, but I'm going to take a look at it. A very serious look. I want to also see how much this is costing, you know, what's the cost to it, and I'll be talking to you folks in the not-too-distant future about it, having to do with what just took place.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> As far as the, you know, potential conflict of interests, though, I mean I know that from the standpoint, the law is totally on my side, meaning, the president can't have a conflict of interest. That's been reported very widely. Despite that, I don't want there to be a conflict of interest anyway. And the laws, the president can't. And I understand why the president can't have a conflict of interest now because everything a president does in some ways is like a conflict of interest, but I have, I've built a very great company and it's a big company and it's all over the world. People are starting to see, when they look at all these different jobs, like in India and other things, number one, a job like that builds great relationships with the people of India, so it's all good. But I have to say, the partners come in, they're very, very successful people. They come in, they'd say, they said, 'Would it be possible to have a picture?' Actually, my children are working on that job. So I can say to them, Arthur, 'I don't want to have a picture,' or, I can take a picture. I mean, I think it's wonderful to take a picture. I'm fine with a picture. But if it were up to some people, I would never, ever see my daughter Ivanka again. That would be like you never seeing your son again. That wouldn't be good. That wouldn't be good. But I'd never, ever see my daughter Ivanka.
<Unknown> <Neutral> That means you'd have to make Ivanka deputy President, you know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know, I know, yeah. [room laughs] Well, I couldn't do that either. I can't, that can't work. I can't do anything, I would never see my, I guess the only son I'd be allowed to see, at least for a little while, would be Barron, because he's 10. But, but, so there has to be [unintelligible]. It's a very interesting case.
<Unknown> <Positive> You could sell your company though, right? With all due respect, you could sell your company and then …
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well …
<Unknown> <Neutral> And then you could see them all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's a very hard thing to do, you know what, because I have real estate. I have real estate all over the world, which now people are understanding. When I filed my forms with the federal election, people said, 'Wow that's really a big company, that's a big company.' It really is big, it's diverse, it's all over the world. It's a great company with great assets. I think that, you know, selling real estate isn't like selling stock. Selling real estate is much different, it's in a much different world. I'd say this, and I mean this and I said it on "60 Minutes" the other night: My company is so unimportant to me relative to what I'm doing, 'cause I don't need money, I don't need anything, and by the way, I'm very under-leveraged, I have a very small percentage of my money in debt, very very small percentage of my money in debt, in fact, banks have said 'We'd like to loan you money, we'd like to give you any amount of money.' I've been there before, I've had it both ways, I've been over-levered, I've been under-levered and, especially as you get older, under-levered is much better.
<Unknown> <Neutral> Mr. President-elect …
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Just a minute, because it's an important question. I don't care about my company. I mean, if a partner comes in from India or if a partner comes in from Canada, where we did a beautiful big building that just opened, and they want to take a picture and come into my office, and my kids come in and, I originally made the deal with these people, I mean what am I going to say? I'm not going to talk to you, I'm not going to take pictures? You have to, you know, on a human basis, you take pictures. But I just want to say that I am given the right to do something so important in terms of so many of the issues we discussed, in terms of health care, in terms of so many different things. I don't care about my company. It doesn't matter. My kids run it. They'll say I have a conflict because we just opened a beautiful hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, so every time somebody stays at that hotel, if they stay because I'm president, I guess you could say it's a conflict of interest. It's a conflict of interest, but again, I'm not going to have anything to do with the hotel, and they may very well. I mean it could be that occupancy at that hotel will be because, psychologically, occupancy at that hotel will be probably a more valuable asset now than it was before, O.K.? The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. I can't help that, but I don't care. I said on "60 Minutes": I don't care. Because it doesn't matter. The only thing that matters to me is running our country.
<Michael Barbaro> <Negative> MICHAEL BARBARO, political reporter: Mr. President-elect, can I press you a little further on what structures you would put in place to keep the presidency and the company separate and to avoid things that, for example, were reported in The Times in the past 24 hours about meeting with leaders of Brexit about wind farms …
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> About meeting with who?
<Michael Barbaro> <Neutral> Leaders of Brexit about wind farms that might interfere with the views of your golf course and how to keep, what structures, can you talk about that meeting, by the way?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Was I involved with the wind farms recently? Or, not that I know of. I mean, I have a problem with wind …
<Michael Barbaro> <Neutral> But you brought it up in the meeting, didn't you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Which meeting? I don't know. I might have.
<Michael Barbaro> <Neutral> With leaders of Brexit.
<Unknown> <Neutral> MANY VOICES: With Farage.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I see. I might have brought it up. But not having to do with me, just I mean, the wind is a very deceiving thing. First of all, we don't make the windmills in the United States. They're made in Germany and Japan. They're made out of massive amounts of steel, which goes into the atmosphere, whether it's in our country or not, it goes into the atmosphere. The windmills kill birds and the windmills need massive subsidies. In other words, we're subsidizing wind mills all over this country. I mean, for the most part they don't work. I don't think they work at all without subsidy, and that bothers me, and they kill all the birds. You go to a windmill, you know in California they have the, what is it? The golden eagle? And they're like, if you shoot a golden eagle, they go to jail for five years and yet they kill them by, they actually have to get permits that they're only allowed to kill 30 or something in one year. The windmills are devastating to the bird population, O.K. With that being said, there's a place for them. But they do need subsidy. So, if I talk negatively. I've been saying the same thing for years about you know, the wind industry. I wouldn't want to subsidize it. Some environmentalists agree with me very much because of all of the things I just said, including the birds, and some don't. But it's hard to explain. I don't care about anything having to do with anything having to do with anything other than the country.
<Michael Barbaro> <Positive> But the structures, just to be clear, that's the question. How do you formalize the separation of these things so that there is not a question of whether or not you as president …
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> O.K.
<Michael Barbaro> <Positive> … are trying to influence something, like wind farms?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> O.K., I don't want to influence anything, because it's not that, it's not that important to me. It's hard to explain.
<Michael Barbaro> <Positive> Yes, but the structures?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, according to the law, see I figured there's something where you put something in this massive trust and there's also — nothing is written. In other words, in theory, I can be president of the United States and run my business 100 percent, sign checks on my business, which I am phasing out of very rapidly, you know, I sign checks, I'm the old-fashioned type. I like to sign checks so I know what is going on as opposed to pressing a computer button, boom, and thousands of checks are automatically sent. It keeps, it tells me what's going on a little bit and it tells contractors that I'm watching. But I am phasing that out now, and handing that to Eric Trump and Don Trump and Ivanka Trump for the most part, and some of my executives, so that's happening right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But in theory I could run my business perfectly, and then run the country perfectly. And there's never been a case like this where somebody's had, like, if you look at other people of wealth, they didn't have this kind of asset and this kind of wealth, frankly. It's just a different thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But there is no — I assumed that you'd have to set up some type of trust or whatever and you know. And I was actually a little bit surprised to see it. So in theory I don't have to do anything. But I would like to do something. I would like to try and formalize something, because I don't care about my business.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Doral is going to run very nice. We own this incredible place in Miami. We own many incredible places, including Turnberry, I guess you heard. There's one guy that does — when I say Turnberry, you know what that is, right. Do a little [inaudible]. But they're going to run well, we have good managers, they're going to run really well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I don't have to do anything, but I want to do something if I can. If there is something.
<Michael Barbaro> <Positive> Can you promise us when you decide exactly what that is, you'll come tell The New York Times about it? [laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I will. I've started it already.
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Positive> One of our great salesmen, by the way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can see that. I've started it already by, I mean, I've greatly reduced the check-signing and the business. I've greatly reduced meetings with contractors, meetings with different people that, you know, I've also started by — 'cause I've said over the last two years, once I decided I wanted to run, I don't want to build anything. 'Cause building, like for instance, we built the post office, you'll be happy to hear, ahead of schedule and under budget. Substantially ahead of schedule. Almost two years ago of schedule. But ahead of schedule, under budget, and it's a terrific place. That's the hotel on Pennsylvania.
<Thomas L. Friedman> <Neutral> Just so you know, General Electric has a big wind turbine factory in South Carolina. Just so you know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well that's good. But most of 'em are made in Germany, most of 'em are made, you know, Siemens and the Chinese are making most of them. [cross talk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They may assemble — if you check, I think you'll find that the, it's delivered there and they do most of the assembly.
<Julie Hirschfeld Davis> <Positive> JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS, White House correspondent: Mr. President-elect — I'm sorry I entered late, but I did want to ask you about …
<Dean Baquet> <Neutral> You should introduce yourself.
<Julie Hirschfeld Davis> <Neutral> I'm Julie Davis, one of the White House correspondents.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi, Julie.
<Julie Hirschfeld Davis> <Negative> I apologize for my delayed flight. I wanted to ask you about personnel. They say personnel is policy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't quite hear.
<Julie Hirschfeld Davis> <Neutral> Personnel.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Personnel.
<Julie Hirschfeld Davis> <Positive> You hired Steve Bannon to be the chief strategist for you in the White House. He is a hero of the alt-right. He's been described by some as racist and anti-Semitic. I wonder what message you think you have sent by elevating him to that position and what you would say to those who feel like that indicates something about the kind of country you prefer and the government you'll run.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Um, I've known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was a racist, or alt-right, or any of the things that we can, you know, the terms we can use, I wouldn't even think about hiring him. First of all, I'm the one that makes the decision, not Steve Bannon or anybody else. And Kellyanne will tell you that. [laughter]
<Kellyanne Conway> <Neutral> KELLYANE CONWAY: 100 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if he said something to me that, in terms of his views, or that I thought were inappropriate or bad, number one I wouldn't do anything, and number two, he would have to be gone. But I know many people that know him, and in fact, he's actually getting some very good press from a lot of the people that know him, and people that are on the left. But Steve went to Harvard, he was a, you know, he was very successful, he was a Naval officer, he's, I think he's very, very, you know, sadly, really, I think it's very hard on him. I think he's having a hard time with it. Because it's not him. It's not him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've known him for a long time. He's a very, very smart guy. I think he was with Goldman Sachs on top of everything else.
<Unknown> <Neutral> What do you make of the website he ran, Breitbart?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The which?
<Unknown> <Neutral> Breitbart.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Breitbart's different. Breitbart cover things, I mean like The New York Times covers things. I mean, I could say that Arthur is alt-right because they covered an alt-right story.
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Neutral> [laughing] I am, I am. I'll take whatever you say. I am always right, but I'm not alt-right. [laughter, cross talk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The New York Times covers a lot of stories that are, you know, rough stories. And you know, they have covered some of these things, but The New York Times covers a lot of these things also. It's just a newspaper, essentially. It's a newspaper. I know the guy, he's a decent guy, he's a very smart guy. He's done a good job. He hasn't been with me that long. You know he really came in after the primaries. I had already won the primaries. And if I thought that his views were in that category, I would immediately let him go. And I'll tell you why. In many respects I think his views are actually on the other side of what a lot of people might think.
<Julie Hirschfeld Davis> <Positive> But you are aware, sir, with all due respect, that African-Americans and Jews and many folks who disagree with the coverage of Breitbart and the slant that Breitbart brings to the news view him that way, aren't you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, well Breitbart, first of all, is just a publication. And, you know, they cover stories like you cover stories. Now, they are certainly a much more conservative paper, to put it mildly, than The New York Times. But Breitbart really is a news organization that's become quite successful, and it's got readers and it does cover subjects that are on the right, but it covers subjects on the left also. I mean it's a pretty big, it's a pretty big thing. And he helped build it into a pretty successful news organization.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, I'll tell you what, I know him very well. I will say this, and I will say this, if I thought that strongly, if I thought that he was doing anything, or had any ideas that were different than the ideas that you would think, I would ask him very politely to leave. But in the meantime, I think he's been treated very unfairly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's very interesting 'cause a lot of people are coming to his defense right now.
<Reince Priebus> <Positive> We have never experienced a single episode of any of those accusations. It's been the total opposite. It's been a great team, and it's just not there. And what the president-elect is saying is 100 percent true. [cross talk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And by the way, if you see something or get something where you feel that I'm wrong, and you have some info — I would love to hear it. You can call me, Arthur can call me, I would love to hear. The only one who can't call me is Maureen [Dowd, opinion columnist]. She treats me too rough.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know what happened to Maureen! She was so good, Gail [Collins, opinion columnist]. For years she was so good. [cross talk]
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Positive> As we all say about Maureen, it's not your fault, it's just your turn. [laughter]
<Ross Douthat> <Positive> ROSS DOUTHAT, opinion columnist: I have a slightly different, but somewhat Steve Bannon-related question, I guess. It's about the future of the Republican Party. You started out here talking about winning in so many states where no Republican has won in decades, especially Midwestern Rust Belt states. And I think many people think that one of the reasons you won was that you deliberately campaigned as a different kind of Republican. You had different things to say on trade, entitlements, foreign policy, even your daughter Ivanka's child care plan was sort of distinctive. And now you're in a situation where you're governing and staffing up an administration with a Republican Party whose leaders, and Reince, may differ with me a little on this, but don't always see eye-to-eye on those views.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Although right now they're loving me. [laughter]
<Unknown> <Positive> Well, right now they are. [cross talk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Paul Ryan right now loves me, Mitch McConnell loves me, it's amazing how winning can change things. I've liked Chuck Schumer for a long time. I've actually, I've raised a lot of money for Chuck and given him a lot of money over the years. I think I was the first person that ever contributed to Chuck Schumer. I had a Brooklyn office, a little office, in a little apartment building in Brooklyn in Sheepshead Bay where I worked with my father.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And Chuck Schumer came in and I gave him, I believe, I don't know if he's willing to admit this, but I believe it was his first campaign contribution, $500. But Chuck Schumer's a good guy. I think we'll get along very well.
<Ross Douthat> <Positive> I guess that's my question is, how much do you expect to be able to both run an administration and negotiate with a Republican-led Congress as a different kind of Republican. And do you worry that you'll wake up three years from now and go back to campaigning in the Rust Belt and people will say, well, he governed more like Paul Ryan than like Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't worry about that. 'Cause I didn't need to do this. I was telling Arthur before: 'Arthur I didn't need to do this. I'm doing this to do a good job.' That's what I want to do, and I think that what happened in the Rust Belt, they call it the Rust Belt for a reason. If you go through it, you look back 20 years, they didn't used to call it the Rust Belt. You pass factory after factory after factory that's empty and rusting. Rust is the good part, 'cause they're worse than rusting, they're falling down. No, I wouldn't sacrifice that. To me more important is taking care of the people that really have proven to be, to love Donald Trump, as opposed to the political people. And frankly if the political people don't take care of these people, they're not going to win and you're going to end up with maybe a total different kind of government than what you're looking at right now. These people are really angry. They're smart, they're workers, and they're angry. I call them the forgotten men and women. And I use that in speeches, I say they're the forgotten people — they were totally forgotten. And we're going to bring jobs back. We're going to bring jobs back, big league. I've spoken to so many companies already, I say, don't plan on moving your company, 'cause you're not going to be able to move your company and sell us your product. You think you're going to just sell it across what will be a strong border, you know at least we're going to have a border. But just don't plan on it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'll tell you, I believe, and you'll hear announcements over the next couple of months, but I believe I've talked numerous comp — in four-minute conversations with top people — numerous companies that have, leaving, or potentially leaving our country with thousands of jobs.
<Thomas L. Friedman> <Negative> Are you worried, though, that those companies will keep their factories here, but the jobs will be replaced by robots?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They will, and we'll make the robots too. [laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a big thing, we'll make the robots too. Right now we don't make the robots. We don't make anything. But we're going to, I mean, look, robotics is becoming very big and we're going to do that. We're going to have more factories. We can't lose 70,000 factories. Just can't do it. We're going to start making things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.' He said, 'I understand that.' I said: 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.' But we're going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether you're liberal or conservative, I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. It's gotten to be a free-for-all. And companies can't, they can't even start up, they can't expand, they're choking.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I tell you, one thing I would say, so, I'm giving a big tax cut and I'm giving big regulation cuts, and I've seen all of the small business owners over the United States, and all of the big business owners, I've met so many people. They are more excited about the regulation cut than about the tax cut. And I would've never said that's possible, because the tax cut's going to be substantial. You know we have companies leaving our country because the taxes are too high. But they're leaving also because of the regulations. And I would say, of the two, and I would not have thought this, regulation cuts, substantial regulation cuts, are more important than, and more enthusiastically supported, than even the big tax cuts.
<Unknown> <Neutral> Mr. President-elect, I wanted to ask you, there was a conference this past weekend in Washington of people who pledged their allegiance to Nazism.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Boy, you are really into this stuff, huh?
<Reince Priebus> <Neutral> I think we answered that one right off the bat.
<Unknown> <Negative> Are you going to condemn them?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Of course I did, of course I did.
<Reince Priebus> <Neutral> He already did.
<Unknown> <Neutral> Are you going to do it right now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I see, maybe you weren't here. Sure. Would you like me to do it here? I'll do it here. Of course I condemn. I disavow and condemn.
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Positive> We'll go with that. I'd like to move to infrastructure, apologies, and then we'll go back. Because a lot of the investment you are talking about, a lot of the jobs you are talking about — is infrastructure going to be the core of your first few years?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, it's not the core, but it's an important factor. We're going for a lot of things, between taxes, between regulations, between health care replacement, we're going to talk repeal and replace. 'Cause health care is — you know people are paying a 100 percent increase and they're not even getting anything, the deductibles are so high, you have deductibles $16,000. So they're paying all of this money and they don't even get health care. So it's very important. So there are a lot of things. But infrastructure, Arthur, is going to be a part of it.
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Neutral> It's part of jobs, isn't it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't even think it's a big part of it. It's going to be a big number but I think I am doing things that are more important than infrastructure, but infrastructure is still a part of it, and we're talking about a very large-scale infrastructure bill. And that's not a very Republican thing — I didn't even know that, frankly.
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Neutral> It worked for Franklin Roosevelt.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It didn't work for Obama because unfortunately they didn't spend the money last time on infrastructure. They spent it on a lot of other things. You know, nobody can find out where that last — you know, from a few years ago — where that money went. And we're going to make sure it is spent on infrastructure and roads and highways. I have a friend, he's a big trucker, one of the biggest. And he orders these incredible trucks, the best, I won't mention the name but it's a certain truck company that makes — they call them the Rolls-Royce of trucks. You know, the most expensive trucks. And he calls me up about two months ago and he goes, 'Man, I'm going to buy the cheapest trucks I can buy.' And I said, 'Why?' and — you know, and this is the biggest guy — he goes, 'My trucks are coming back, they're going from New York to California and they're all busted up. The highways are in such bad shape, they're hitting potholes, they're hitting everything.' He said, 'I'm not buying these trucks anymore, I'm going to buy the cheapest stuff and the strongest tires I can get.' That's the exact expression he used, 'the cheapest trucks and the strongest tires.'
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're hitting so many bad points, we, you know, I said, 'So tell me, you've been doing this how long?' 45 years. He built it over 45 years. I said, 'Have you ever seen it like this?' He said, 'The roads have never been like this.' It's an interesting …
<Dean Baquet> <Positive> What did, what did, I'm curious what Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan said when you said, 'I'm going to launch a multibillion-dollar infrastructure program.' Are they reluctant to spend that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Honestly right now …
<Ross Douthat> <Neutral> Trillion. Trillion, I think, was the figure.
<Dean Baquet> <Positive> Because they would be in the wing of the Republican Party that would say, 'That's great, but you're not going to be able to do that and balance the budget.'
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let's see if I get it done. Right now they're in love with me. O.K.? Four weeks ago they weren't in love with me. Don't forget — if I read The New York Times, and you don't have to put this on the record — it can be if you want, you might not want …
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Neutral> You say if, but you do …
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I do read it. Unfortunately. I would have lived about 20 years longer if I didn't.
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Positive> There's Nixon's quote right there if you'd love to reread it —
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know. But when you look at the different, all the newspapers, I was going to lose the presidency, I was going to take the House with me, and the Senate had no chance. It was going to be the biggest humiliation in the history of politics in this country. And instead I won the presidency, easily, and I mean easily — you look at those states, I had states where I won by 30 and 40 points. I won the presidency easily, I helped numerous senators — in fact the only senators that didn't get elected were two — one up in New Hampshire who refused to say that she was going to vote for me, who by the way would love a job in the administration and I said, 'No, thank you.' That's on the record. This is where I'm different than a politician — I know what to say, I just believe it's sort of interesting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She'd love to have a job in the administration, I said, 'No, thank you.' She refused to vote for me. And a senator in Nevada who frankly said, he endorsed me then he unendorsed me, and he went down like a lead balloon. And then they called me before the race and said they wanted me to endorse him and do a big thing and I said, 'No thank you, good luck.' You know, let's see what happens. I said, off the record, I hope you lose. Off the record. He was! He was up by 10 points — you know who I'm talking about.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, others — if you look at Missouri, [Senator Roy] Blunt, he was down five points a few days before the election, he called for help, I gave him help, and I think I was up like over 30 points in Missouri. I was leading by a massive amount, 28 points. I gave him help and he ended up winning by four points or something. I brought a number of them. Pennsylvania, brought over the finish line. Let's see, we brought Johnson, in, you know, that was a good one. We brought him over the line in Wisconsin. Winning Wisconsin was big stuff, that's something that …
<Thomas L. Friedman> <Neutral> Mr. President-elect, I came …
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So right now I'm in very good shape, but
<Thomas L. Friedman> <Positive> I came here thinking you'd be awed and overwhelmed by this job, but I feel like you are getting very comfortable with it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I feel comfortable. I feel comfortable. I am awed by the job, as anybody would be, but I honestly, Tom, I feel so comfortable and you know it would be, to me, a great achievement if I could come back here in a year or two years and say — and have a lot of the folks here say, 'You've done a great job.' And I don't mean just a conservative job, 'cause I'm not talking conservative. I mean just, we've done a good job.
<Michael Shear> <Positive> To follow up on Matt, after you met with President Obama, he described you to folks as — that you seemed overwhelmed by what he told you. So I wonder if you are overwhelmed by the magnitude of the job that you're about to inherit and if you can tell us anything more about that conversation with the president and the apparently subsequent conversations that you've had on the phone since then. And then maybe talk a little bit about foreign policy, that's something we haven't touched on here, and whether or not you believe in the kind of world order — a world order led by America in terms of having this country underwrite the security and the free markets of the world, which have been in place for decades.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure. I had a great meeting with President Obama. I never met him before. I really liked him a lot. The meeting was supposed to be 10 minutes, 15 minutes max, because there were a lot of people waiting outside, for both of us. And it ended up being — you were there — I guess an hour-and-a-half meeting, close. And it was a great chemistry. I think if he said overwhelmed, I don't think he meant that in a bad way. I think he meant that it is a very overwhelming job. But I'm not overwhelmed by it. You can do things and fix it, I think he meant it that way. He said very nice things after the meeting and I said very nice things about him. I really enjoyed my meeting with him. We have — you know, we come from different sides of the equation, but it's nevertheless something that — I didn't know if I'd like him. I probably thought that maybe I wouldn't, but I did, I did like him. I really enjoyed him a lot. I've spoken to him since the meeting.
<Michael Shear> <Neutral> What did you say to him?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Just a basic conversation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he's looking to do absolutely the right thing for the country in terms of transition and I really, I'm telling you, we had a meeting, Arthur, that went for an hour and a half that could have gone for three or four hours. It was a great — it was just a very good meeting.
<Unknown> <Positive> Sort of like this meeting. [cross talk, laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He told me what he thought his, what the biggest problems of the country were, which I don't think I should reveal, I don't mind if he reveals them. But I was actually surprised a little bit. But he told me the problems, he told me things that he considered assets, but he did tell me what he thought were the biggest problems, in particular one problem that he thought was a big problem for the country, which I'd rather have you ask him. But I really found the meeting to be very good. And I hope we can have a good — I mean, it doesn't mean we're going to agree on everything, but I hope that we will have a great long-term relationship. I really liked him a lot and I'm a little bit surprised I'm telling you that I really liked him a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let's go foreign policy, sure. Sure.
<Thomas L. Friedman> <Neutral> What do you see as America's role in the world? Do you believe that the role …
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's such a big question.
<Thomas L. Friedman> <Positive> The role that we played for 50 years as kind of the global balancer, paying more for things because they were in our ultimate interest, one hears from you, I sense, is really shrinking that role.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think we should be a nation builder. I think we've tried that. I happen to think that going into Iraq was perhaps … I mean you could say maybe we could have settled the civil war, O.K.? I think going into Iraq was one of the great mistakes in the history of our country. I think getting out of it — I think we got out of it wrong, then lots of bad things happened, including the formation of ISIS. We could have gotten out of it differently.
<Thomas L. Friedman> <Neutral> NATO, Russia?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think going in was a terrible, terrible mistake. Syria, we have to solve that problem because we are going to just keep fighting, fighting forever. I have a different view on Syria than everybody else. Well, not everybody else, but then a lot of people. I had to listen to [Senator] Lindsey Graham, who, give me a break. I had to listen to Lindsey Graham talk about, you know, attacking Syria and attacking, you know, and it's like you're now attacking Russia, you're attacking Iran, you're attacking. And what are we getting? We're getting — and what are we getting? And I have some very definitive, I have some very strong ideas on Syria. I think what's happened is a horrible, horrible thing. To look at the deaths, and I'm not just talking deaths on our side, which are horrible, but the deaths — I mean you look at these cities, Arthur, where they're totally, they're rubble, massive areas, and they say two people were injured. No, thousands of people have died. O.K. And I think it's a shame. And ideally we can get — do something with Syria. I spoke to Putin, as you know, he called me, essentially …
<Unknown> <Neutral> How do you see that relationship?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Essentially everybody called me, all of the major leaders, and most of them I've spoken to.
<Thomas L. Friedman> <Neutral> Will you have a reset with Russia?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I wouldn't use that term after what happened, you know, previously. I think — I would love to be able to get along with Russia and I think they'd like to be able to get along with us. It's in our mutual interest. And I don't go in with any preconceived notion, but I will tell you, I would say — when they used to say, during the campaign, Donald Trump loves Putin, Putin loves Donald Trump, I said, huh, wouldn't it be nice, I'd say this in front of thousands of people, wouldn't it be nice to actually report what they said, wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with Russia, wouldn't it be nice if we went after ISIS together, which is, by the way, aside from being dangerous, it's very expensive, and ISIS shouldn't have been even allowed to form, and the people will stand up and give me a massive hand. You know they thought it was bad that I was getting along with Putin or that I believe strongly if we can get along with Russia that's a positive thing. It is a great thing that we can get along with not only Russia but that we get along with other countries.
<Joseph Kahn> <Positive> JOSEPH KAHN, managing editor: On Syria, would you mind, you said you have a very strong idea about what to do with the Syria conflict, can you describe that for us?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can only say this: We have to end that craziness that's going on in Syria. One of the things that was told to me — can I say this off the record, or is everything on the record?
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Negative> No, if you want to …
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to violate, I don't want to violate a …
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Positive> If you want to go off the record, we have agreed you can go off the record. Ladies and gentlemen, we are off the record for this moment.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Trump speaks off the record.]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now we can go back on.
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Positive> I'm going to play the cop here. We've got only two and a half minutes left, because they have a hard stop at 2. And by the way, I want to thank you again, on behalf of all of us …
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Neutral> … for this meeting, and really I mean that. We are back on the record. Maggie, you get the last question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Is he a tough boss, folks? Is he tough?
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> I have two questions, very, very quickly. One is your vice president-elect left open the idea of returning to waterboarding. You talked about that on the campaign trail. I'm hoping you can talk about how you view torture at this point, and also what are you hoping that Jared Kushner will do in your administration and will you bring him in formally?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> O.K., O.K. So, I didn't hear the second question.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Jared Kushner. What will Jared Kushner's role be in your administration?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh. Maybe nothing. Because I don't want to have people saying 'conflict.' Even though the president of the United States — I hope whoever is writing this story, it's written fairly — the president of the United States is allowed to have whatever conflicts he wants — he or she wants. But I don't want to go by that. Jared's a very smart guy. He's a very good guy. The people that know him, he's a quality person and I think he can be very helpful. I would love to be able to be the one that made peace with Israel and the Palestinians. I would love that, that would be such a great achievement. Because nobody's been able to do it.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Do you think he can be part of that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think he'd be very good at it. I mean he knows it so well. He knows the region, knows the people, knows the players. I would love to be — and you can put that down in a list of many things that I'd like to be able to do. Now a lot of people tell me, really great people tell me, that it's impossible, you can't do it. I've had a lot of, actually, great Israeli businesspeople tell me, you can't do that, it's impossible. I disagree, I think you can make peace. I think people are tired now of being shot, killed. At some point, when do they come? I think we can do that. I have reason to believe I can do that.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> And on torture? Where are you — and waterboarding?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I met with General Mattis, who is a very respected guy. In fact, I met with a number of other generals, they say he's the finest there is. He is being seriously, seriously considered for secretary of defense, which is — I think it's time maybe, it's time for a general. Look at what's going on. We don't win, we can't beat anybody, we don't win anymore. At anything. We don't win on the border, we don't win with trade, we certainly don't win with the military. General Mattis is a strong, highly dignified man. I met with him at length and I asked him that question. I said, what do you think of waterboarding? He said — I was surprised — he said, 'I've never found it to be useful.' He said, 'I've always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture.' And I was very impressed by that answer. I was surprised, because he's known as being like the toughest guy. And when he said that, I'm not saying it changed my mind. [An earlier version made a mistake in transcription. Mr. Trump said "changed my mind," not "changed my man."] Look, we have people that are chopping off heads and drowning people in steel cages and we're not allowed to waterboard. But I'll tell you what, I was impressed by that answer. It certainly does not — it's not going to make the kind of a difference that maybe a lot of people think. If it's so important to the American people, I would go for it. I would be guided by that. But General Mattis found it to be very less important, much less important than I thought he would say. I thought he would say — you know he's known as Mad Dog Mattis, right? Mad Dog for a reason. I thought he'd say 'It's phenomenal, don't lose it.' He actually said, 'No, give me some cigarettes and some drinks, and we'll do better.'
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Neutral> So, I, with apologies, I'm going to go to our C.E.O., Mark Thompson, for the last, last question.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very powerful man …
<Mark Thompson> <Positive> MARK THOMPSON: Thank you, and it's a really short one, but after all the talk about libel and libel laws, are you committed to the First Amendment to the Constitution?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I was hoping he wasn't going to say that. I think you'll be happy. I think you'll be happy. Actually, somebody said to me on that, they said, 'You know, it's a great idea, softening up those laws, but you may get sued a lot more.' I said, 'You know, you're right, I never thought about that.' I said, 'You know, I have to start thinking about that.' So, I, I think you'll be O.K. I think you're going to be fine.
<Arthur Sulzberger Jr.> <Positive> Well, thank you very much for this. Really appreciate this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you all, very much, it's a great honor. I will say, The Times is, it's a great, great American jewel. A world jewel. And I hope we can all get along. We're looking for the same thing, and I hope we can all get along well.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> So I would like to just point out that yesterday I wasn't joking when I said it was going to be the Trump debate and I wasn't joking when I said it was going to be Carly's night. I swear to you, I meant it dead serious, that this was going to become the Trump debate. And joining us by phone Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Donald, you got a ton of face time. It was you everywhere.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> This is the second debate, Donald, where it was all about you. The Fox debate, now the CNN debate. All the questions, the split screens, everything. And yet you thought you were treated fairly last night.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I thought I was treated fairly; I thought I was on too much. I felt badly for everybody else because every question had to do with me, even the first characters. I mean, everything was about Trump and then they launch into this debate and there was split screens all over the place. I've never seen anything like it. It was a little bit unfair to a lot of other people, frankly. But I think from my standpoint, I was treated fairly. Time" magazine just did a poll and it had 67 percent say Trump won the debate. You know
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And 60 percent is big when you have 15 or 16 people up there.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Well, Donald I would just like -- I think Carly did a great job last night.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Yes, stood out.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> I would just like in one debate for moderators to treat you like the other candidates.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Because if you're back on your heels for three hours straight, I'm going to get a different performance from you -- and I'm talking as a Republican now who's trying to figure out who I'm going to vote for -- then if you're treated like the other candidates. I know they love ratings --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, they tried.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> But it's just -- it's distorted.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right, they're taking every sentence I said over the last five months and was, you know, tough. And put it to the other people. And it was a certainly -- that was a Chris McMann would have loved it because it's a WWE kind of thing. But I was involved with virtually every question so it was really a little bit wild. Actually a couple of them came up and they said, you know what, Donald, next time can I hit you so that I can get a little more time? Because some of these guys, I feel badly. A lot of them are friends of mine and they got no air time last night.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yes.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> OK, so I actually think that even though you felt bad for the other guys, I think that the approach of the debate played right -- I'm not surprised there's polls that show Donald Trump doing better this morning. I'll have to check those. But when you gang up on a candidate, I mean, this is what you talk about in neophyte political races. You gang up on the woman or you gang up on one person and that person prevails because you put them in the victim's role.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> And they call your father. What was your father's first tweet last night?
<Nicole Wallace> <Positive> Yes, you know, my dad is a big fan of yours and he texted me five minutes in and said, first of all, they've all signed a loyalty pledge. Why wouldn't the answer to would you Donald Trump with our nuclear codes" be "if he's our president
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> It's a personality test.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I guess they looked at the ratings and somehow they figured out I get the ratings and I will tell you, and I've said it, that normally they'd have maybe 2 million people would be watching this debate. I would say last time at, you know, Fox, that's usually 2 million. Joe, wouldn't you say that's about a 2 million debate?
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then at 24 million. And actually the 24 million goes up after they get their final numbers. This one, I think maybe we'll get more. Other than one thing I did complain about, three hours is too much for a debate.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, it's a long time to be debating but I think it's even worse for people that have to sit up. If there were a two hour debate, it would have been a great debate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Three hours is really unacceptable. What happened is about a week ago we get a call they were going to make the debate almost an hour more. And you know what that is, that means the advertising is so dense and so deep and they're getting tremendous numbers per minute and per half minute that they just added another 45 minutes to an hour to the debate. That had nothing to do with anything else. So I think that was a shame, because three hours is too long.
<Willie Geist> <Neutral> Hey Donald --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How long is Gone with the Wind? Three hours and 20 minutes. [Laughter]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Morning Joe is three hours. [Crosstalk] We're tired every morning. Go ahead, Willie.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> I think that makes you Rhett Butler, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well maybe. That would be not so bad.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> So Donald, obviously most of the debate was about you. But as you stood up there, who else stood out to you? Were you impressed by any of the other candidates?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was. I thought there was nobody that did poorly. I think that -- I think that Carly did well but I didn't see her. You know, Joe was sort of saying and all of --
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> No, it was me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you that Carly did very well and I thought she did well too, but I didn't see it as stand out like you did. But maybe it's a different perspective.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And of course I was being hit 15 different ways. Everything I've ever said about a woman I got hit on that show. There's no question about that. But I didn't see that part. But I think she did well. I think Rubio did well. I don't know. You know, specifics for a period of time. I actually think that everybody -- now I'm trying to be nice when I say this because I've gotten to know some of these people and I like them. But I really think everybody did at least pretty well.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Was Jeb Bush, did Jeb Bush have more energy last night?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He did. I thought he was --actually he's a very nice guy. I thought he did fine. I thought he did very well.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> So Donald, let me ask you about the casino question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought he was going to push me harder to apologize to his wife.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Let me ask you about the Florida casino question. Did you ever ask Jeb Bush personally to bring casinos to the State of Florida? There seems to be some debate between you two about that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, Joe. What happened is a group I knew wanted him to do it. I wasn't involved in it. They wanted him to do it. Ultimately, I think he did it. I didn't even follow the whole process, but I think he did it in some form. But I wasn't involved with it. And ultimately the Indians got gaming approved. But I was not involved with it at all. And as I told him, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. I was not into it at that time. That was a different time of my life. But it was -- it sort of coincided but it was not from me.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Donald --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He knows that. I mean, he knows that. There was a little article some place, so maybe -- and he picked that up. And I was surprised to hear him say that actually because it wasn't true.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Donald, Ben Carson, what did he say last night in the debate that proved he should be closing in on you in the polls?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we just -- are you talking about debate -- what did he say personally to me? Or what did he say --
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Anything.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Just anything.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> I don't know. I just like him as a person, frankly. And I thought his whole thing on autism where he backed me up was terrific.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Because that scene -- I'm very much involved with autism and I see these kids where they go for a shot. A massive inoculation, massive, and all I say is spread it out over -- you know, smaller shots over a period of time.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Same thing. And he sort of backed me up, he did back me up on that. And so did Rand Paul. Rand Paul came out shooting. You know, I'm sitting there and all of sudden I got shot at by Rand Paul. I say what was this? You not supposed to be -- I said you're not supposed to be up here. You have 1 percent and we have 11 people. You're not supposed to be up here. And after that he behaves nicely which actually I was surprised at.
<Richard Haass> <Negative> Donald, it's Richard Haass. The pope is going to be coming to this country in a couple of days, and one of the issues he's really made central to his own period in office is climate change. Last night, there was some conversation about it. People talked about George Chilton, a carbon tax. Other people have other ideas. Where do you come out? How seriously do you take it? What do you think the United States ought be doing about it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, I consider climate change to be not one of our big problems. I consider it to be not a big problem at all.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's weather; I think it's weather changes. There could be some manmade something. But, you know, if you look at China, they're doing nothing about it. Other countries are doing nothing about it. It's a big planet. I do not view -- I view climate change as being -- the big problem we have is nuclear climate change. That's what our climate change is and that's our problem. And I'm a little surprised -- Putin is doing it; I don't believe Putin is a believer at all. Putin is doing it for his own economic advantage if he is actually in favor of climate change.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> John Heilemann in California, John.
<John Heilemann> <Negative> Donald, as you've reflected on your performance over the course of these last few hours, are there any particular moments or responses of yours where you look back and think you didn't do as well as you would have liked to have? That if you could, you'd go back and do it a slightly different way?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, John, I thought I had -- I knew the Carly thing was controversial for the obvious reason. Rolling Stone" did a cover story on me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That was a great story but they happened to have one quote that was I think I did about as good -- you know, I got great reviews from people. You're the one that -- actually you're the show, which is very sad because I happen to listen to your show, as you know, and watch your show. I'm in the car, I just got out of the plane actually. I get great reviews from most other people. I was able to see the television shots and the television shows and we've had great reviews. I mean, there's some things, maybe it would have been better if the guy hadn't heard my statement in Rolling Stone"
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Well, you know, Donald, don't be sad. We've been talking about the moderators hammering at you nonstop. All we're saying is we would like to see one debate where you're treated like everybody else and it's not a constant barrage of questions. Like you said, it's one gotcha question after another; gotcha question. Here's a quote. Let's throw this quote at him. And as you said, Richard Haass, the first 15 minutes of the debate was what?
<Richard Haass> <Neutral> A personality test.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> A Trump personality test.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> It was a Trump debate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it kept going pretty right until the end and, you know, it was a little bit strange and there was the statement, any statement made by me, they'd ask the people, well, Trump said this and Trump said that. So it was a little bit of a difficult situation to be in. But with that being said, and then I'm just looking at the final numbers from Drudge and I'm up to 61 percent, and Time" magazine was 70 percent -- and don't forget -- did you say 65 percent
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> I said you did just fine, because I know what's going to happen in the polls. [Crosstalk]
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> We said it last night after the debate, and we know you have to go, but the same thing after the Fox debate. There's going to be an impression among supporters and others that you were teamed up against and you -- because they did team up against you -- and you're going to probably come out the winner. It's already the case with Nicolle; it's the case with Nicolle's dead; it's the case with my brother. It's going to be a case with Trump fans all over the place.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's very interesting. One of the pollsters just said I'll go up in the ratings because the poll numbers rely on the debate and that sort of leads to higher ratings. So we'll see what happens. Hey, look, I found it to be an amazing experience. It was very interesting. I thought it was very unfair to a lot of other people, Joe, because they didn't get any time.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Exactly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A lot of people didn't get any time.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Totally agree.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I guess I have to be complimented, because supposed they go the other way where they didn't ask me any questions, then I'd be calling you saying I was treated very unfairly because they didn't ask me enough questions.
<Richard Haass> <Neutral> We'll hear that from the other candidates.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> At least you know yourself.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right, Donald Trump, thank you so much for calling in. We greatly appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, folks.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> We will be right back in a moment.
