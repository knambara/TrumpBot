<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> And joining us now, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Donald, good to have you back on the show. How are you doing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning. I am doing fine.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> You love polls. We just threw a lot of poll numbers out --
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> But that Iowa one...
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> They are coming at us fast and furiously. The Iowa one shows it's close out there. There's some polls that have you up a good bit.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> With Ted Cruz.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> [Inaudible] up by a couple. What's your closing argument in the last six days for the people of Iowa? Why should they vote for you? Why do you want to be president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've had a great relationship with the people of Iowa. I am doing really well with the evangelicals. In fact, I met with a large group of ministers and pastors yesterday and I am getting tremendous support.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Why is that, Donald? Because you're not a dyed in the wool evangelical? Why are you doing well?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm a religious person. I have been going to Sunday school for a long time, like you did, Joe. You know, I am a religious person. And frankly, you know, I am a believer.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they understand that. You know, some of the polls came out. It was interesting. CNN said I would be the best leader, the best with ISIS, best on the border by far, I'll be best on a lot of other things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The evangelicals want that. They want that, too. They want a combination of things, but they want that very badly. So I am not surprised that I'm doing so well with evangelicals.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know nationwide I'm way up with evangelicals. So that's very good.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Why is Ted Cruz's numbers slipping? Is it because of your charge that he is from Canada and may not be able to be president if he is elected?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he does have a problem there. No question about it. Nobody knows if he can even run. He has to solve that problem. Get a declaratory judgment from the courts. He could be running and end up being thrown out of the race in the middle of it.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Now, do you really believe that, Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the Democrats -- You know the Democrats will sue the first day. If he got the nomination, there would be a lawsuit day one which will take years to resolve. I think there is a big problem.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> I was going to ask you, Donald, if you really believed that. But then you followed up with what is the truth which is the second he got the nomination, the Democrats would go to court.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> OK, but Ted Cruz is not slipping in every poll. I just read the latest one out of Iowa and there's just a few points between you two.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well I don't know. I assume it's close in Iowa. That's the one place where it's close. It could very well be close.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we're going to do great in Iowa. But you never know. I think Iowa is the one place that's close. Every other state I'm leading by a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just left New Hampshire last night. It's unbelievable the lead up there. I hit 40 or 42 points up there. I think the only place where we could be close is Iowa.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I see it both ways. I see we're either close or I have very big leads. Because I saw some polls yesterday where we have a very big lead. But I think Ted is a nasty guy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People don't like him, at all. He has got all of these senators, Republican senators, he doesn't have support of one of them. He gets a whacko like this Glenn Beck who is always -- every time I see him, he is crying, he's like so emotional. What a mess! And he gets a whack job like Glenn Beck to support him, which is, I think, a negative, not a positive.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think Ted has some problems. He doesn't tell the truth.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Hey, Donald, it's Willie. Speaking of Ted Cruz, he has some new ads up, released another one in Iowa, one in South Carolina, aimed directly at you. Let's take a listen. [Begin Video]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, hey, I lived in New York City in Manhattan all my life, okay. So my views are a little bit different than if I lived in Iowa.
<Unidentified Female> <Positive> [Voice-Over] They are different. Like on abortion.
<Unidentified Male> <Neutral> Would President Trump ban partial birth abortion?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look. I am pro-choice in every respect.
<Unidentified Female> <Positive> [Voice-Over] And what does Trump think about Iowa?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How stupid are the people of Iowa?
<Unidentified Female> <Positive> [Voice-Over] Donald Trump. New York values. Not ours.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> [End Video] Donald, what's your reaction to that ad, particularly the first part that you're a flip-flopper?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's another -- I'll give you an example. First of all, I am pro-life and everyone understands that. I'm pro-life. But going into a second thing about how stupid are the people of Iowa. Then I said, how stupid are the people of the United States. And I was talking about because everybody in this country was believing -- I'm not going to mention his name -- but it was a certain candidate --
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Ben Carson.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> '-- who is no longer doing too well.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> It was Ben Carson's tales of hammers to his mother's head.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah. But it was a [Inaudible] because I didn't say Iowa, I said Iowa and then I said United States. He didn't put United States. Because Ted Cruz lies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He is a liar. That's why nobody likes him. That's why his Senate people won't endorse him. That's why he stands on the middle of the Senate floor and can't make a deal with anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He looks like a jerk. He's standing all by himself. And you know, there's something to say about having a little bit of ability to get other people to do things. You can't be a lone wolf and stand there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's sort of what we have right now as a president. We have a president that can't get anything done so he just keeps signing executive orders all over the place.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Did you just make a parallel between Ted Cruz and President Obama?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they're the same. I think actually Ted is more strident than Obama, if you want to know the truth. Nobody gets along with Ted. At least some people like Obama.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody likes Ted. I don't find anybody that likes him. You talk to senators, I talk to senators that frankly want to come out and endorse me. It's amazing what's happened over the last two weeks.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I told this to Joe, Mika. Over the last two weeks, so many people are calling and saying, you know, we want to get involved with you. We want to endorse you. We have a very big endorsement coming down today.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A very powerful endorsement --
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Who is that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Who is it going to be?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You'll find out a little bit later. But we have a very powerful endorsement coming down today. But so many people want to endorse us because they say Ted Cruz is -- he's wacky. Something missing there. I don't know. There is something wrong. You know, it's wonderful to be a rebel, but you've got to get some people on your side a little bit. Here is a guy with all of the Republican senators sitting out there. He deals with them every day when he's there. He deals with them every day. And he doesn't have one senator supporting him, not one Republican senator supporting him. That's pretty sad.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Donald, when did your feelings about Ted Cruz change? Because for a large part of this campaign, he was the one guy that you said, you know what, he is a friend of mine, he's okay, as you went after the other ones. When did things change?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right. Well no, but I said he's a friend of mine, Willie, and then I kept saying, and I told you too, but when is he going to come at me? Because I know him. know people. I became rich understanding people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I say when is he going to come at me? Because when I say friend of mine, everything I said, it was okay. I could say anything and he said, oh, it's okay, it's okay. Very few of the others were doing that. Although they were -- many of them were very, very respectful and nice to me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like a lot of the guys I'm running with. I'll make a much better president, but these a minor details. With Ted Cruz I'll tell you, very interesting, I kept saying when is he going to come. Then he came at the debate when he talked about New York values and he talked about this and that, and he really came at me very strong in the debate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said to him in the debate at one point, ah, here we go. Okay, good, because I said when are you going to come at me, Ted? And he finally came at me. And I think, you know, according to everybody, I won that last debate, which is always very nice.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Mike Barnicle.
<Mike Barnicle> <Positive> Hey, Donald, one of your friends, maybe a former friend right now, I don't know, Michael Bloomberg, mayor of New York, former mayor of New York, a man just as wealthy, perhaps wealthier than you, is thinking of running for the presidency of the United States. Talk about him. Give us your relationship with him and what you think his chances would be if he jumped in.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He used to be a friend of mine. I haven't spoken to him in a long time. I did a good job for him because he had a project in the Bronx that was a disaster called Ferry Point. It was under construction for years and years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was sucking up money from the city. They were in there for like $300 million. Nobody knows -- It was under construction for 25 years or more. They don't even know when it began.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he asked me to take it over. And I went through the process and I took it over and I got it done in less than a year. I did a great job on it. I really helped him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In fact, I made a promise to him. I said I'll get it done before the end of your administration. It was the last year of his administration. We actually had a ground-breaking in October and he left in January.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I did a good job. Now, I don't think he is a friend of mine anymore based on what I am hearing when I hear he wants to run because Trump is running. I don't know. And I will tell you -- and I'm not talking about John and Mark -- But other than John and Mark, I get treated so badly by Bloomberg.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The things they say are just unbelievable. The worst of just about of anybody. Which is hard to believe because I get treated pretty badly by most. But the worst of about anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They treat me so knowingly badly that I would assume he's going to run. I mean, I hope he runs. Look, I like Michael. I have always liked Michael. I don't think we have any relationship -- the relationship I think is probably gone, which is just fine with me, but I hope he runs because I love the competition. And I think it would be a very different dialogue for the debates. I really think it would be very interesting if he runs. I hope -- I hope that Michael runs. He won't win, but I hope he runs.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> And we have, speaking of John Heilemann, we have John with us and he has a question for you. John.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi, John.
<John Heilemann> <Neutral> Hey, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do you notice I took you out of that group -- Hey, John, I took you out of that group and Mark. You know.
<John Heilemann> <Positive> That's very nice of you. I appreciate that, although I won't -- I will stay --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] he gave me an A in the last debate, so I had to take him out. [Laughter]
<John Heilemann> <Positive> I appreciate that. Although I will stand up for my colleagues at Bloomberg. We always treat you fairly. Tough, but fair is the way that Bloomberg Politics always treats you in every instance, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. Well you're wrong on that. But you and Mark are fine.
<John Heilemann> <Neutral> Let me ask --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You and Mark are fine.
<John Heilemann> <Positive> Like I said, I'll stand up for my colleagues until the end of time.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Okay, guys -- Okay, okay, okay -- Enough of this dance. We've got a delay. John Heilemann, ask the question. Go.
<John Heilemann> <Positive> Let me ask you this question, Mr. Trump. On substance, not on character and personality, but in your head-to-head contest with Senator Cruz, what are two or three areas where you disagree on substance with Ted Cruz that are important for voters in Iowa and elsewhere to understand?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think one of the things is the wall and building the wall. Now, he has just come about talking about it, but I want to build a wall and a great wall that's going to keep a lot of problems out. And believe me, you just have to ask Israel. Walls do work.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There is no question about it. On amnesty, you know, he was very, very weak on illegal immigration. Now all of a sudden he has become much stronger. This whole thing started with that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It all started with that. I think I will be much better with the military. I think I will be much better with health care and Obamacare because I'm going to repeal it and replace it. I think there are other issues.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then of course we agree on certain issues. But implementation is important, too. I don't think he'll implement. He is a politician.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All talk, no action. And if you look at his record, I don't think he will be an implementer. I don't think he'll get anything through Congress because everybody hates him. I mean, you know, the senators, you think you have gridlock now? If he gets elected, you'll have gridlock times ten.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> So let's talk about gridlock, Donald. I have two questions for you. We had former Defense Secretary Bob Gates on the other day. He talked about how running a business is not like running the presidency. And I just heard you say, former friend Ted Cruz, former friend Michael Bloomberg. It seems like you have a lot of former friends. Are you going to have friends in Congress? Are you going to be able to make deals?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think so. You know, look, Mika -- What you don't know and what Joe does know to a certain extent, I have been in politics all my life. I have been dealing with politicians all my life. You can rough up politicians and they'll come back to you because, you know, when they want something.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're always wanting something. It's called cajoling. You have to get them in a room and get people to sign things. I hate what Obama does with gun legislation where doesn't talk to anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He just goes out and signs, like last time, executive orders. In theory you're supposed to, you know, the old fashioned way, get everybody into a room and get something that people agree on. You don't just do what he's doing. And I get along with politicians.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know how to get politicians. That's what I've done. So much of my business has been political where I had to get approvals from massive developments like on the west side of Manhattan. The largest job, dollar wise, every built in Manhattan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So many of my jobs and so many of my deals have been -- and not only in this country, all over the world. I deal with leaders all over the world. So I think I'll be very good with politicians. I deal with politicians for a living.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> I want to underline this point. This is an important point to make. I know you have a follow up, Mika. So Donald, you got into the construction business, what, in '73?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. About '77, yes.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> '77. Who was the mayor in '77?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Beam.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> So it was Beam. Then who was the next mayor you dealt with?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Was it Dinkins?
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Dinkins was next.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I even had a piece of Lindsey, if you can believe it. It's a long time.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> And you had Lindsey. Then you dealt with Giuliani and then you dealt with Bloomberg.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Koch.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> And Koch, who is in there. You dealt with Koch.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right. I dealt with Koch on the Wollman skating rink and many other things.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Wollman skating rink. And then you dealt with Bill de Blasio.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So you have everybody from Lindsey. You've dealt with -- And I'm just underling this point because we were like Donald doesn't know politic blah, blah, blah. And I'm not carrying your water here. I'm just surprised this hasn't been reported.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> You have become a billionaire many times over in one of the toughest cities to deal with politicians. The corruption, the mob, every law -- every regulation of every stripe. Taxes. People don't like working in the city.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> You've worked with everybody from Lindsey to Beam to Koch, Dinkin, to Giuliani to Bloomberg to de Blasio and you figured out how to work with all of them get richer in every administration.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, it's nice that you say that, Joe, but very true. I got along with Lindsey --
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> No, it's --I'm not being nice. It's the truth.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I got along with Beam, I got along great with David Dinkins. He was a very nice man. You know, I got my big job approved with David Dinkins. Now who would think -- you know, the big one on the West Side, which is almost 6,000 units along the Hudson River and everyone said you'll never get that approved.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You'll never be able to do it. I had tens of thousands of people protesting when I proposed the job because I was going to block everybody's views because it's a massive job. Everybody said you'll never get it approved. In fact, I got the land inexpensively because they said it was impossible to get it zoned.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I got it zoned. Not only got it zoned, got is zoned for much more than anyone thought possible.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> And Mike Barnicle, this is my point. He didn't get this stuff done in Omaha. He got it done here. Again, I'm not carrying his water, it's just the press hasn't reported on this and this is the toughest place and I am surprised that here we are six months into this campaign and nobody has written this story.
<Mike Barnicle> <Positive> So Donald, instinctively, and you are a candidate of instinct, what is your instinct about who right now on the Democratic side of the aisle, who would you be able to deal with to cut a deal, any kind of a deal? What's your instinct on that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that I'm going to be able to get along with Pelosi. I think I'm going to be able to -- I've always had a good relationship with Nancy Pelosi. I've never had a problem. Reid will be gone.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I always had a decent relationship with Reid, although lately, obciosuly, I haven't been dealing with him so he'll actually use my name as the ultimate -- you know, as the ultimate of the billionaires in terms of, you know, people you don't want. But I always had a great relationship with Harry Reid. And frankly, if I weren't running for office I would be able to deal with her or Reid or anybody. But I think I'd be able to get along very well with Nancy Pelosi and just about everybody.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, look, I think I'll be able to get along well with Chuck Schumer. I was always very good with Schumer. I was close to Schumer in many ways. It's important that you get along.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's wonderful to say you're a maverick and you're going to stand up and close up the country and all of the things, but you have to get somebody to go along with you. You have a lot of people. We have a system. The founders created the system that actually is a very good system.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It does work, but it can't work if you can get nobody to go along with you. That's the problem that you have with Ted Cruz. He is a guy that nobody likes and nobody trusts, and he is a nasty guy. He says things that are very nasty.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I have to be nastier than him. It's just one of those things.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Donald, do you have a TV? Are you watching us right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I am. I always watch you. Only because of you.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Wow!
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Um, okay, so -- Wow. Look at this video. Because I think I know what you were thinking. I was narrating to some of your friends on the phone. When Sarah Palin was making her stump speech for you and she kept talking and kept talking and kept talking, what were you thinking about right now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I was thrilled with her. Look, she made a speech. It was a little bit longer. But you know, she was endorsing me, so I would never want to go off stage.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would be very -- I think it would be terrible to do. It would be very bad for me to do that. I think it would be very disrespectful. Look, Sarah called me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sarah had always supported Cruz. She called me and she said your campaign is unbelievable. You're going to win. I love what you're saying, I love the movement and I'd love to endorse you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said, wow, that's great. And one of the reasons I loved it was that I've always liked Sarah. Always. The other reason is because that really threw an ax into the machinery for Cruz because, man, he expected that endorsement 100 percent and he was planning on big.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I will tell you, she has had a great impact. You look at my poll numbers now, I think I've done great in the debates. According to every online poll I've won every debate. But who knows.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I've done well in the debates and I've run a good campaign, but Sarah coming in is a very, very -- I love the fact that Sarah came in. I had to stand there because I know you and Joe mentioned, why wouldn't you have? She was endorsing me? What am I going to do, take an endorsement and walk off the stage? You can't do that.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> No, you can't. But I know you were thinking. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am a respectful person when I like somebody, and I like Sarah a lot. She has been great.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Very good. All right. Donald Trump, thank you so much for being with us, as always. Great talking to you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Mika.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Donald Trump is on the phone, came up with a good idea. What is it J.D.? You're gonna get some shitty gift for Gary?
<J.D. Harmeyer> <Positive> No. I -- Has he li -- Have you liked my gifts from the past? Like --
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> He always -- He does get something very thoughtful.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thoughtful. Yeah. Like a little book or a little CD or something.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> You know he's a good dude.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He's a good dude but it's crummy --
<J.D. Harmeyer> <Positive> I'm not getting the pay that you're getting.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No. Me and Robin.
<J.D. Harmeyer> <Neutral> I always tried
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm thrilled.
<J.D. Harmeyer> <Neutral> Robin's going to get you a bookcase made of a fucking antique ship or something.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Can be something valuable something. Something of great worth.
<J.D. Harmeyer> <Neutral> I bought you the Nina.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She's gonna buy me the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria. [Inaudible]. Donald -- Donald Trump is -- Thank you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Donald Trump is on the phone. It's always good to speak to him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Good morning. He's opinionated --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hey, Howard
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hi. How are you been?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm good.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I haven't seen you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know it's been a while. It's been too long.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I mean you had a baby. You don't sit home with a baby.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No it's never been my thing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So, how does that work?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I probably should but I never -- No, Melania is a wonderful mother, she takes care of the baby, and I pay all the costs.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you afraid that the baby won't really know you in the sense that -- I mean that, I know you, you're -- you're not -- you're not going to sit around and bounce and get on your knee.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You're afraid of germs and kids carry germs like crazy. Are you afraid to even touch your own kid?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right. Absolutely.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know. I see what you're saying
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> When he has a cold. I just, you know, keep him away from me.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Do you think the kid will be psychologically damaged? Your other kids grow up great but --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They did. Well, they got lucky. It could be. It could very well be. The other day came back he was playing with little children in the park, all little-spoiled kids like him.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And he came back and I saw -- I noticed there was a little sniffle just a very slight sniffle. I wanted nothing to do with that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How was that kid -- you know the kid you had with Marla Maple?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How's that one?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's doing good. Tiffany.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you ever see her.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do see her and she's a great kid.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. She comes to town visits a little bit?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. For about, you know, an hour.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you going to --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi, dad., "Hi
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you going --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's a great kid
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Are you going to hook her up in business, like you did with the other two?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I might. It depends on her abilities. I mean, we'll have to see the other two, and now actually three have a great business instinct. And, you know, I don't know about that with Tiffany she's very good, she's very smart, she's got great marks. She has all As, all the time. I mean, it's amazing, her report cards are great.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You actually see the report card?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I actually do. I glance at them.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Rank your kids in order from your favorite to your least favorite.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like them all. I love them all.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible] So, Melania stays at home with the kid. I see pictures of her, she's always with the baby.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But then when you want to go out and stuff you've got a full-time staff watching that kid, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have -- We have people to take care -- Even we can go out, but she really is a very hands-on mother.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I think you like your daughter the best.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like them all.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I think you most proud of her, even better than the son.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's great. No, the son is great. They're all really good kids.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He has two sons.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And if they weren't that lovable the same -- You know you just, I know -- I know people that have one child who is just amazing. and then they have other kids that aren't, they love them all the same. I love them all the same. And my son has done an amazing job in terms of business. Actually, don Jr.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well who isn't amazing then.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So far I'm lucky, Robin. I mean, so far the kids have been good, you know I can't say Eric just joined. He was a great student in school.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Which one is Eric?.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He's the youngest son.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Eric is six foot six, he's my young -- He's exactly your height.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I don't even know which live next hour Eric is your. Yeah that's have on him. And what's the other son Frank as they say in the horce racing business from Havana. Oh I didn't really I didn't realize that with three from my three. And he's been really good. I mean, you know, very good student just started with me. I think he's going to be good. I mean. I'll let you know that the answer to that question, Robin in about five years.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay. You know, I've been thinking about this. Won't be so great if I wasn't in love with Beth, I would totally be dating Donald's daughter. She is getting hotter and hotter, getting hotter, and hotter she's wearing hotter outfits and she really is good in business. I mean, to me that's a hot package and it would drive Donald nuts. But he'd have to accept me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It would drive me totally nuts. If I didn't love you it would drive me totally nuts having you be the son in law just -- I don't know. But I think you and Beth make the per -- When are you getting married, Howard? Will you just marry her, please.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Maybe next time. Maybe next summer
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're never going to find better.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> No. She's great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know how to get you married quickly, if I represent it best I would tell her to do certain things, you would marry her so fast.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right. To leave me for a while.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah a little bit. I'd say call him up. Tell him how much you love him. But you're leaving town for about a week or two.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I tell you, you better hope we don't break up because I'm going right after your daughter. It just I'm not kidding. I exactly know where I got myself in.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Now you have the best interest.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Best interest.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And just think Melania would be my stepmother.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That also is a good also a good-looking combination. No I tell you, Ivanka has -- she's really become a great beauty, but she's also really smart and she's doing very well.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And then I go to the like that that Mer-a-Lago and I got all the like really --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You would hang around Donald's different houses.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He'd hanging around and I'd be sitting there miserable.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, yeah, the thought of Howard Stern with your daughter.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I'd be saying, "Can you believe this happened to me?"""
<Howard Stern> <Negative> The worst luck ever.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Know, I could do worse. Not a hell of a lot worse. When you think of it
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Am I really that bad?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you'd be an interesting son in law.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I mean, I'm good in business.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I wouldn't say you're the classic. You're not exactly what I had in mind.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's 25 years old. Not exactly, but of course, I wouldn't say I'm exactly what a lot of mothers have in mind either, but I'm --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Am I too Jewy?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do have some compensating balances.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Am I too Jewy to fit in with the Trump thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. Not at all.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, no, no. Come on, let's be honest.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Be honest.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm too aren't I?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Of course not.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> The schnozz and the whole thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No not at all.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You know you should do.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And then we'll get Ivanka to convert.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You know what you should do is become a real Jew. You should get with a yarmulke. You know the whole thing
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I might show up tomorrow Mar-a-Lago, "That's mine father in law."""
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Tell him to get out here immediately.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That would kill himself.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That would be a beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That would end your life.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That would be fun, Howard. In many ways I'd love it in many ways that'll be a lot of fun, I'd be depressed but also have some fun.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know my feeling on you is you know d is mentioned in the Rosie O'Donnell book of course you know because of the big feud. I think that you like that Rosie O'Donnell is even acknowledging you in the book I mean it actually is good for your business in a sense of celebrity.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, first of all her book is a total disaster.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, it's ridiculous.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You read it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, you know, yeah. I've seen excerpts of it and there is absolutely you gain nothing other than she banged her fingers with a baseball bat. You know this is a real beauty. And you know when I took on Rosie -- Because Rosie -- You know I didn't do anything. Somebody called me up from the press they said, "do you know Rosie O'donnell went on a 15-minute tirade about you?"""
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said, "She did? What did I do?"" I gave Tara Conner who was in the big show tonight. I gave Tara Conner a break. You know I gave her a chance to remain Miss USA and all that stuff and go to rehab and it really -- So far it's been over a year and so forth
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Snd it set off Rosie O'Donnell
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And it sets her off.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> That's an odd thing to set a person off. Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I always said because she wanted Tara. She wanted her. So. you know, one of those things. I'm sure she would have loved to console Tara.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> She calls Mr. Trump a torn scarecrow whatever the fuck that means.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And a slug
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. I don't know what that means either.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I honestly did not anticipate the malice of his response.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, did is what she wrote in the book?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I assume Donald believed he had money. I did not assume Donald believed he was money, but apparently he does. The stuffing of his self spilled out, think of a torn scarecrow instead of, hey, it's crisp $100 bills blowing through the cornfield. Boy, you two are really going at it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't even know what the hell -- You know I was a great student. I have no idea what she's talking about. You know I've always said Rosie's a dummy. You know Rosie's not smart. And Rosie's ratings were not good on the viewer until she started the feud with me.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Do you feel you are responsible for her success.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I feel I'm somewhat responsible Actually yes I do.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And what about Barbara Walters?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She attacked Barbara Walters rather viciously calling her old, has been, everything else in the book. And you know here's story it's very simple. Rosie was a loser before Barbara reinvented her career. Rosie failed on Broadway failed with a magazine and she got thrown off television. And believe me she got thrown off because the ratings were not good.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> A way to say Do you really believe that I believe she was very successful on TV.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well she was at the beginning. But Rosie will always self-destruct, Howard. She'll always self-destruct in the end she's a loser. And Rosie's ratings were down and they're going to throw her off.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But the book is successful, right? It's on -- Its best-seller?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have no idea of it's successful or not. I mean, that I have no idea but, hey, it certainly gets a lot of publicity. Now I come out with a book on October 15th and I am going to make a wager that my book sells much more than Rosie's
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Your books are very popular.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Now, who are you wagering with?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who are you going to wager with?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I would wager with Rosie but I don't know there's probably nobody to talk to and I'm not necessarily --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That would be good.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I was willing to wager something that my book outsells her by hers by a lot.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But listen you both get invited to a lot of celebrity events and movie premieres is stuff it is feasible that sometime in the near future you will be at an event and run into her. I mean you'll be staring at her face to face. What would you do?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It all started -- You know she came to my wedding.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you think you could beat her up?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think will be close. She is pretty -- You know, she ever fell in the wrong direction I wouldn't have a chance.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She came to your wedding?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She came to my wedding.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Which one?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Marla.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No kidding.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She was at the wedding and I got extremely angry because she ate almost the entire wedding cake.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You know I didn't get any wedding cake when I showed up.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There was nothing left. You were at that wedding too, come to think of it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I don't remember her being there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You killed me at that wedding.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I did, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> After the wedding yeah. You said, "There wasn't a dry eye in the house."""
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I said it's not going to last more than three months, I was right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well you were wrong. Lasted five years.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Four months. But the problem was I was watching television with Marla. She wanted to make love and I wanted to watch television to see how much the press has gotten and now I turned on and the first thing I see is Howard saying he actually said, "There wasn't a wet eye in the house."""
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's it. That's what it was.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I thought it was funny Marla started to cry. Then the second thing, he said, "I give it three months at best"""
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.Didn't go over well in that household, did it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It did go over well with me. Believe me. I thought it was funny I cracked up and she wasn't laughing. She didn't think it was funny at all. You even say that Rosie was at the wedding.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And not as my guest. Actually, she was more friendly with Marla. I don't even know why she was at the wedding. I don't think Marla even knew her. I don't know. For some reason she came to the wedding.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It's funny that she was at the wedding and then you guys ended up being such enemies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I didn't even know she was an enemy until she attacked me over and over Tara Conner. I mean I had no idea she was an enemy.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You also make an enemy out of Elisabeth Hasselbeck from The show The View as long as we're honest. You say she's the dumbest person on television I believe you're right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No I gain new respect for though because when she attacked Rosie they had that debate. Elisabeth Hasselbeck killed her. And I've always said Rosie is not a smart person. Rosie is somebody who is, you know it, was very sad because Barbara Walters put her back on television. Then she got into the fight with me and that's when the ratings went up I hate to say -- I'm not saying it on air. Who cares?.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But that's when the ratings went up had her ratings were no good. Her ratings were about the same as they were. They were going long and then december she hit me with this thing. I responded as everyone said don't respond but I do respond. I'm like you know you have to respond.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yes. We fight back and you fight back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You fight back, yes, I believe in that. And I do believe she was, she never attacked me. But let's say you know they've dug poll 91% are and my cap on the polls --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But it is feasible that you and Rosie will make up o -- Like I was always surprised that you let Imus off the hook. He said terrible things about you. You guys broke up as friends. In fact, I always was thrilled because you were on my show more and more and more. And but then you did go back and let them off the hook so to speak.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't remember him saying bad things about me, Howard/ Honestly. I mean, he may have, you're telling me he said bad things, I never knew that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He did, he did, he did. Of course, you did.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Donald, you can not remember that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But what was the thing?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know what, I have a photographic memory. I don't remem -- I mean, you know, maybe he said something but basically, I don't remember him ever. Had I known that I would not have gone back.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yeah. You said to me. You said, "That fucking Imus is just go get on me. I hate to -- he's a beat of shit."
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I said that?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. I've [Inaudible] the show.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You said he was talking bad about you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I didn't liked the last thing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Should Imus be re-employed?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well here's the thing with Imus, he said something which was you know not a good thing that he said.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it's something that if you listen to rap record every rap record says the same thing. And Imus apologized. When you say 500 times?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think once is enough. You know, if you have to apologized.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Let me ask you this. Why is there this clamor to have him back? He never got any ratings. His ratings are lower than anyone on radio. Including Curtis and Kuby who have no great ratings but they always beat Imus, and now he might, they say in the paper come back and replace Curtis and Kuby.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know he had a high level audience, he really did, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I don't believe it. I saw the Scarborough report.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I don't know. I don't want to argue about -- I can tell you this. Imus had a high level audience.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Every senator, every congressman, they listened to that show like it was a religion.I'm telling you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Listen to this. I'm telling you there's something called the Scarborough report on radio. It's a very expensive thing to buy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And this Scarborough report tells you exactly who your audience is. And this guy had run around telling people that he had a wealthy audience a highly educated audience. You look at the Scarborough report, that's all it does, it doesn't tell you ratings it tells you who your audience is. You know who had the wealthy people and who had the people who at higher education. Right here. But it pained everyone to believe it. That's it
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, said I don't know. I can only say this he treated me nicely. I wouldn't do a show very often but when I get it once every three or four months it was you know it was fine. I always felt he had a very high-end audience and maybe I'm wrong. Who knows?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Don't believe it. You're wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I don't remember him attacking me. And if he did I wish you would have told me that a long time ago.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm going to remind you of that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now you're allowed to use the F -- word on your show.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, that's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would have told him to you know what. But I didn't know he was attacking me here.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Let me hear you say the F-word. I don't believe I've ever heard that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Fuck.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You do say fuck.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now I do say it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Do you talk dirty in bed when you're with Melania.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No I don't.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You've never say fuck my brain out.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's a very extraordinary person.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Would you ever use the word whore? Like in a sexual situation would you say come on whore give me something like that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She would never do that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She was, "Oh Donald
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would never do that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How was the sex life post-baby? Because I always --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very good.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I worry about you. I mean I know you would be germ --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Why worry?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because when a woman becomes a mother -- Donald Trump likes young you know a hot chick. You can certainly get them. It's proven that and I worry that when a woman has a baby he loses interest.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Really
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I'm really asking in a genuine way
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They said -- You know they say as you get older the women stay the same.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes they do say that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A very sad commentary, Robin, isn't it? I'm not saying that I say that because of course I don't say that, but I have a friend who does like women and he does well with women also. And he goes as I get older than all the women stays the same age and that's a sad commentary, you know he likes 25 and they never I mean he's getting older and older and the women are always 25.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You know people will say that's immature.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But wait a minute. But let's talk about Donald, you're generalizing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Are you having as much sexual Melania since the ba -- be honest. And I know you always are. Yeah you are.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The answer is yes.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> More -- Now according to a show that I just watched, on Oprah, of all places. An expert said if you're not having sex four times a week you have trouble in your relationship.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Wow!
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you having sex four times a week?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That I can't comment on. But I'm very satisfied.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why can't you comment on that. A lot of people needs to know this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to have a front page story tomorrow.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No. The story is that you're not [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Every time I do your show I end up with a front page foreclosed story. And what I'm doing is, and Robin, you know this. I'm kidding. I'm kidding around I'm having fun.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But all of a sudden it ends up being like, front page.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, You can't even have any fun.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> If you were single right now --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'll give you an example. You know that View? I did the View, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it was terrible what they did. I did the view. And they were talking about Ivanka and I said, "Ivanka is so beautiful."" I said it. Laughing The audience was laughing everybody was laughing. I said
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So they put out a press release -- "Trump wants to date his daughter""."
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I remember that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, it's terrible.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Personally I want to date your daughter.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But you understand?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It's bigger news that Donald [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Inaudible] Then they put that interview and then they put that slob Rosie on.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Does your daughter have a boyfriend right now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She does.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She does?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.`
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who is it.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You like him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nice guy. Very rich guy, very nice guy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you mean very rich? What does he do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a very rich guy. Much less money than me but he's a very rich guy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What does he do?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's a real estate family.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And you approve?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, he's a nice guy. I mean, you know, it's her choice. Other than you, I approve.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow. And are you worth 8 billion right now? That is the figure I have in front of me that you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so. Yeah
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. You're worth 8 billion.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It depends. It depends on what things offer, but I think probably so. Yeah, 'round there.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Nice. Nice. That's such a feeling of security.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You used to know me when I was with nothing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Howard, you know me years ago in 1990 when the markets crashed the world didn't crash. I had borrowed billions and billions of dollars. I was in deep crap and you know me when I was worth probably nothing I might have been worth less than nothing. Okay. And you never attacked me. Robin used to attack me but you never attacked.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Not when you were down. Not when you were down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You actually Robin started attacking me on the way up.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I liked that better. [Inaudible] Hey, Robin, that's more loyal.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you think that you will stay with Melania even as she gets old?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, absolutely.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You really do.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You're in love.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's great.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I don't believe it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, Howard, she's a great person. She's beautiful. She's solid. She is wonderful in every way.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is she next to you right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd tell you what, she's an unbelievable mother.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is she next to you right now is that what you're saying?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, she's not actually. She's in the other room.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you -- Where are you, in your apartment?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm in my apartment.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What are you wearing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Undies.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What's Melania wearing?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Nothing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She's nude right now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think so.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How's the body after the baby?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Unbelievable.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Just as tight?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> One of the best bodies I've ever seen.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No stretch marks?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No one of the best. You know about 15 seconds after the baby came she went back to the normal way.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You demand that of her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is that in your prenup?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No but that's the way it worked out. I mean, she is in great shape.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And what is -- Okay. Let me give you a hypothetical, Melania gets into a horrible car accident right. She now dies, she's on a respirator.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How long do you think you can wait until you started dating again?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I probably never go out with another woman again.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> If you're single today, and I know you fantasize about stuff like this, who would you be dating? Who is the girl that right now captures your attention?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There aren't too many of them. I'll tell you, I know you and I have discussed this over the years. The most beautiful women aren't the major celebrities because you know you can name like, you know, somebody told me Charlize Theron.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Charlize Theron. I told you she's hot.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Was -- was just voted the best looking woman.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> To be honest, I think Ivanka is much better looking than her.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I agree.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I'll tell you this, I'll tell you this. I've seen her, she's not -- There are many unbelievably beautiful women around but they're not the big celebrities. You rarely see a big celebrity that's that beautiful.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Why is that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because they have to be smart. And it could be a major player. You know when you're successful at life like I know you know over the years I've known all the supermodels I've known everybody, they're beautiful but they're also very good. You don't get to be a supermodel by being a dummy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. You've got to play the game you got to be good in business.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You got to know what's going on, you got to know life, you get you because there are a lot of really great beauties. But the greatest beauties aren't necessarily the most famous people. But what I do is I go out with the greatest beauties and then they become famous.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Do you think it would have been hard for you if your daughter had been ugly like a big chubby kid like maybe you know, look like me? You know what I mean?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't I mean I think it would have been a little different but, I mean I'm using I'm building a big building in Soho -- The Trump Soho it's called.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm using Ivanka and the ads as well, I have to pick a model you know, it's cheaper --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I'm using Ivanka and the ads. And the building is like through the roof, it's like this huge success. It's -- You know where it is -- By the tunnel and by the Holland Tunnel and all. And it's ah -- it's just going up now. It's 45 stories. There was some clamoring about it. 'Oh gee, it's too tall, it's too tall,' and I don't understand it considering 'the next tallest building in the air is about three stories. I don't know 'what they are complaining about [Inaudible] But now they want to stop tall buildings in that area. And I'm all for it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah of course.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no I'm all for it this way you have unobstructed views forever. In fact --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'll have to change but if they do that I'll immediately change my advertising
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> There's a
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- unobstructed views forever. In fact.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> There's a rumor that ah, you once had an ugly child but you had the child killed.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> Oh.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is that true?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That is not true, alright.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, that is not true.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Now Donald Trump has done something I've been talking about for years -- Ah, and I have said this and Robin you've heard me say it. I said these beauty pageants are becoming a thing of the past
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Mm-hm.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> because they're not-I said, wouldn't it be interesting if they turned them into reality shows so that…
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes, you have said that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> If, if you really knew the girls, if you could watch them --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You'd have a stake in it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You'd have a stake in it and I even say that with uh, I said that with football even and when they started that new league with Vince McMahon, I said --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.

<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh that's hot.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> and, Miss Teen USA is beautiful also. And you know [Inaudible] people are captivated by that. You know, it's sort of interesting. I, I don't know if you got to see the girl that couldn't answer the question on the map.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh yes.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes, we did.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> We love that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know that's my deal, you know that's my thing. Everyone set that I set that up. I didn't.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I wish I could promote like that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It wasn't even a hard question --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was the biggest thing on the Internet in like six months.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Mm-hm.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's true.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, I'll tell you what -- her answer was amazing right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, right. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They gave her like seven or eight passwords -- you know Iraq --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is she retarded?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They told that ah -- well, they gave her Iraq, they gave her education, they gave her
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> South Africa. She took every password that they gave, in other words --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know little like keywords for the pageant, right? You know, 'make sure you mentioned Iraq and peace' and think, and she took every word they gave her, and then she, she wi-wielded it into this paragraph and nobody knew what the hell she said.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK, but that's OK. It was a bad answer.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's made her a lot of money by the way that answer --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But it's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was a bad answer. But why, did she have like 29 million hits which is more than anything including the war, including that -- you know that --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Coz she's hot.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Coz she's beautiful.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because she's beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It's fun to watch, it's fun to watch a hot woman be a millionaire
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way That girl isn't hot. She's one of the most beautiful human beings I've ever seen. And, what happened? She's 18 years old and she-. you have to say standing there, in fact David Letterman did something which was funny, they played it and she was so beautiful they said, 'let's play it again.' I thought the answer was absolutely fun. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was actually Very funny. You know let's play it twice -- But it was so amazing because her beauty was so incredible and yet the answer was like people saying, 'what did she say?' It didn't make any difference because she is so beautiful. Now, she is an 11, if you'll. I mean, Charlize Theron is again -- if, if you sign -- Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- them together.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You would go for the, the, the girl, the the less famous girl-.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, let's put it this way. You wouldn't even think about it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It wouldn't be-. It's not even a contest. That's what I mean about people that are famous or not.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But you know in the old days you would have been tagging her. That's the crazy thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, in the old days of cour-- Believe me I would have been -- I wouldn't be talking to you right now.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. You'd be, you'd be all over.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> All over.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, this kid is gorgeous.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> If Melania got fat --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, shit-but let, let me jus --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> -- would you be with her?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If this girl weren't an 11, if she were seven or eight --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Or, nine? Nobody would have cared. So that's --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- the answer
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're absolutely --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know what?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> -- right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- they get bad answers all the time. I mean they get bad answers. I've never heard one quite like that I guess, but they --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> they give bad answers all the time
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And your point is with this new reality show, 'Pageant Place' on MTV tonight.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Is that, you are going to see a lot of hot chicks doing a lot of dumb things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll tell you what. I bought the Miss Universe pageant almost 10 years ago.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And a lot of people wanted it but I got it. And, I took a pageant which is a concept that you people used to say, 'Oh you can't make with pageant,' and look at Miss America. They were off the air and I just got renewed on NBC for three years with the Miss Universe and the Miss USA pageant. So, I, you know they just renewed it for three more years because --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- I have very good ratings. [Inaudible] I took the pageants and made them hot. But, about two years ago, three years ago, you know I have an obligation to do this, Howard. I go backstage and I have to go through the dressing rooms of the girls --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I feel bad for you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- And I have an obligation. You know, if anybody else did that, they'd be considered a terrible person. When I do it, I'm considered the owner and I have an obligation to make sure the rooms are clean, and everything' is --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I walk through and I see all these girls like an hour and a half before the pageant starts and you'll get to see some of that in this whole thing, and I see they are fighting and they're pushing each other and that, they are mean
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, it's terrible.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It's great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're fighting for like, like they have certain stylists and people that do the hair you know.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And that's probably more interesting than the actual pageant.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I tell you what, I said this would make a great reality show. This, happened like three, four years ago. I said that and I put together a group and I, I went to -- I tell you what, MTV is doing it. But everybody wanted it and we came up with a great name, 'Pageant Place' and basically, it's the lives of these girls. Now, it's going to get better as it goes along because we didn't cover that much because we, you know. we didn't really do the idea until sort of after the pageant [Inaudible] but next year we're going to have ah, you know running like two weeks before the pageant comes and it's, it's going to be even more unbelievable. But this --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> This --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The show is unbelievable. The fighting, they're fighting --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> We're going to tune in, I, I will definitely --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<howard Stern> <Positive> -- watch it. Let me ask you one last thing here. Are you e-- Mark Cuban is a billionaire who is a, you know, he, he always tries to be like you. Ah he is on 'Dancing With The Stars.' Do you watch that? -- Because you have a rivalry with him that ah, do you watch it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I haven't watched it but actually, I, I, I have seen him dance and he's not bad.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I, would, you would never do something like that though.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I wouldn't do it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is it demeaning to do some--
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They would love to have me do it all that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Of course, but --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I wouldn't do it. But but you know I know Mark Cuban a little bit, and Mark's a loser. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Mark is a guy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well he went dancing with a surgery -- [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think he'll win. No, he won't win, but but but he's a better dancer than I would have thought.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Why is he a loser? It seems like he's a wealthy man.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Here's, here's what happens with Mark. Mark. It just seems-. In fact, I use him as an example, if he c-- you know I give speeches and 45,000 people show up for the Learning Annex and I use him sometimes as an example. I say, if Mark Cuban can eh-- can make money, anybody can.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You just have to know a certain system. I mean, Mark is somebody that should have won the playoffs last year and, and got blown out. Should've won the year before it le-- the year before it was over. I mean he should have won and he got a blow and a--. He devotes so much time so much money to everything and it just doesn't work.
<howard Stern> <Neutral> What is he worth?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's, he's, I'd say he's worth -- I'd say he's worth a billion dollars.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> A billion.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So that's not even in your category.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, he's not as wealthy as I am, no. But that's not the, that's not the point. What happened is very simple. I did 'The Apprentice,' it became the number one show on television.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right, and he imitated you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A monster -- It just got renewed for two more years, by the way. We'd start shooting next week. But, but it's, it's like this monster show 'The Apprentice,' right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he would say nice things about me and something nobody knows. He lives in one of my buildings in New York, I don't know if you know that enough.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, I didn't know that
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, he lives in -- when he's in New York, he lives in one of my buildings. He has an apartment in one of my buildings. It's got Trump on it. Trump all over the place. [Inaudible] But Mark was very nice and he'd say good things about Trump, 'Trump's smart, Trump the--,' you know that was fine. And then he does the show and some guy said like a month before a show went on. 'You can't be nice to Trump, you've got to attack Trump.'
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Uh-uh
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So he starts attacking me. He doesn't want to shake hands with people, starts you know whatever he could think of. He could he'd say and he'd start truly attacking me and I said, 'wow that's terrible.' Well he attacked me, just like Rosie attacked me and I attacked back [Inaudible] and his show went on. And it was the worst piece of crap --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was terrible on it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ah, and it got no ratings and they threw him off the air. And now he's trying to do something else. Now this isn't his show. But I will say I think he dances pretty well, not bad.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, when I look at Wayne Newton pull a Wayne Newton, I, I felt so sorry --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> They should put him in a box, let me think he's ready to go.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I felt, what happened?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well -- what has happnened?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Could I ask you what happened the way, is that plastic surgery or what?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, she's she's
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes, obviously.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, will that happened to us too, Howie?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No I'm not going to put -- I've made a decision in my life. I am not pulling --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [As if to say] normal.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm going to be normal.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No, I --
<howard Stern> <Neutral> I am not gonna pull my face back --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Has Donald ever gone anything?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> These people with plastic, I have it -- these people with plastic surgery, you know you walk into some of these clubs, you go into like, I'll go into a, a nightclub or a big restaurant or something [way] -- and you'll see some of these people with a plastic surgery and [Inaudible] all you do is say. 'Oh, hi.' And you just look at them you say, they had plastic surgery.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What is --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What's the purpose of it?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well look at this, some of --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know the thing I don't understand.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Look at the like, Clint Eastwood I think he's even done it now.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Oh no.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah I think --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hope not.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I think so.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love Clint Eastwood. I hope he has it. You know the worst thing though on women? It's the pumped lips.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I never see it, it's never been done well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Can you imagine how painful that must be? But, but I don't get the pumped lips, of all the things Robin. You don't do that to you.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Of course not!
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Robin is perfect.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Of all the things, of all the things I don't understand the pumped lips. They. Look. Terrible.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. The worst. Well they all want to look like Angelina Jolie.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She's got that nice.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't understand either because I don't think she's good looking.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well, she's ruined her looks, has she not? With the dieting?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know what it is. I never thought she was good looking.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Sh-- but do you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't, I don't think she's got good skin. I don't think she's got a great face. I think her lips are too big to be honest with you. You know they look like too big.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I, I don't think she's good looking. And you know it's funny, you talk about a transformation. Now the United Nations is honoring her as this great wonder. I remember three years ago she was frenching her brother at the Academy Awards --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Where she was walking in with Billy Bob the next day, she's walking in with Billy Bob. And she was saying she just he just got screwed and all the way up --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now she's saving the world. That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And now they're saying, she's a lady of the, of the peace. She's a -- I mean give me a break. But I never thought she was good looking.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well I'm surprised to hear you say that, that's what I want to say, but she was good looking but now she's lost too much weight.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I don't think she is good looking at all.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well look, we could talk all day.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, I think she's a solid, a solid seven.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> A seven?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, she's a seven, but a seven is not a 10.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who is a 10 right now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Uhm, Ivanka.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think uhm, let's see -- a 10. There are very few of them around.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> See, you can't even think of one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I happen to think Paris is a very good looking girl for getting it --
<howard Stern> <Negative> No, she not a 10.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no I I don't know. But she's very different looking, I think Paris is a good looking girl.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I think she's good looking but she --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Uhm, I mean there are you know, there are a lot of -- 10s are very very hard to find.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, who's has solid nine?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I'd have to think about it, Roberts --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- because you know I'd really have to go through my list.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is Britney Spears is mentally ill?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a sad thing. You know, she's worked for me many times.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, in our heyday like two, four years ago. And you know if I had Britney Spears perform, I'd have kids come from all over the world -- She was like a goddess.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And that was when she was saying, she was a virgin, that she was this, and she was so cute. And I remember I was in an audience at the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, and she was performing and I was in the fourth row, and she was sweating and looked beautiful and she threw her hat, right? Now normally of a performer throws a hat and it's sweaty and wet and everything, I'd have no interest in it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I grab that sucker --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- right, it didn't bother me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Meaning, you know what I'm saying.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm saying, you're saying --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I know what you're saying.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> -- She's so cute.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, she was so cute and wholesome and nice.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You weren't even afraid of her germs?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wasn't even afraid of those germs. Today, if she threw it, I'd say 'get that sucker out of here.'
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Will Joe Tari be fired from the Yankees?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I hope not. But you know, he'd might be better --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes or no? Will he be fired?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Uhm, I think probably. But it's too bad. He's a great guy. He's a great -- he's a friend of mine.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donald Trump has done it again and he'd got yet another television show.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Ah, who will be the next president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well it's going to be between Rudy and Hillary, in my opinion.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who's going to be the next president?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I, I don't know. it's going to be a very tough race.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who will you vote for? Rudy or Hillary?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Alright Howard, I, I don't want to comment yet because they're both very good friends of mine. I don't have to comment.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It's a tough decision, isn't it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well they're both very, very good friends of mine.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm going for Rudy if it's the, it's between the two.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well Rudy is a great guy and he's a fantastic loyal guy who has done an amazing job. I mean they're both great people, Howard --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well let me ask you, Donald. Who's better for business?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] Well, you know it's very interesting with Democrats. Democrats get it and business does very well although in theory, they're not good for business. Who's going to keep taxes lower? Probably Rudy.
<howard Stern> <Positive> But Hillary says she's going to tax the rich. That would be you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I mean you know. OK. I'm here.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Watch Donald Trump's show 'Pageant Place' premiering tonight at 10:30 on MTV. Ah, this is where girls who live together in Donald Trump's apartment --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Beautiful girls.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> -- one of his apartments -- beautiful hot chicks and they are beautiful, I've seen them. He wouldn't put any slouches on them --
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No slouches.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They are seriously beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> If anything, if any of them are shown, to show any signs of ugliness or aging, they're off the show.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They get terminated immediately.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who's that? How old is the oldest woman you've ever been with?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Uhm --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm saying this for a point to show you people who will kind of stand a chance.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm with a woman who's 35.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> 35?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Melania.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Would you think you'd be with her when she's 40?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh yes I think so. I have no doubt, Howard.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Ivana was-How old was she when you got divorced?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's an interesting question --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That really is I would say probably, about 35.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Ohhhh.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Do have the best pre-nup in the business?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a great one, yeah. Great, it's--
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What does it mean? If Melania and you should split up, God forbid eh--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It'll tax dollars.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She gets nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Nay.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But, but I would never have to use it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you give her every 10 million?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ah, I can't talk about what I give her. But you know it's fun. But but --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Would it be in the r-- range of 10 million?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have no doubt. In fact I talk you know I'm doing a book called 'Think Big.' It's, it's a whole big thing it's called 'Think Big and Kick Ass,' and it comes out on October 15th.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> They let you use that title?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But wait a second. Would you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah and I talk about the prenup.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Alright, in the prenup. You're a man worth let's say a million dollars depending on what day it is.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right. It changes rapidly.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I mean what how-- what is a fair amount of money? You've been married you had a kid with her, is 10 million the right amount? -- Is it five million?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It would be fine. Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> 10 is fine?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Five is better though and one is even better.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh my God, Donald --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I remember I was reading -- [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- Fortune magazine --
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> One is big, you would leave your ex-wife with one million dollars? Ah!
<howard Stern> <Neutral> Of course he would.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> The real man.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I wouldn't even think about that -- But listen to this --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh my goodness --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was reading, I think it was Fortune but, but a couple of years ago, they they did stories on really rich people and how they getting killed in divorces, you know guy works his ass off and a woman cooks the dinner and --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- she gets you know a billion dollars right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So anyway, so they're doing the story, now I'll never forget that the list of really rich people and I was the richest guy on the list they had me at X dollars and they, they had like McCaw, did you ever hear of McCaw, this phone guy and they said
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They said he's worth 1.9 billion. Wendy is his wife. I never heard of it but I remember the name because I have a good memory, I remember names [Inaudible] and she got like 900 million.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they went down this list and you know all these guys -- He's worth a billion, she gets 500. And another, guess what too -- They had me at 2.9 billion and they had Marla Maples one million dollars.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Wow.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<donald Trump> <Neutral> Now, it was just a chart. It was a story in divorce and they didn't mention it in the story. Nothing, it was just a chart. I got more phone calls of genius on that call.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Laughs]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah well I mean seriously --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd have more calls, seriously Howard I got more friends of my [Inaudible]. You are a genius, what.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So Melania gets a million dollars if she, ah --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no. She gets whatever she gets. But I'm just --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Tell me what she gets, I wanna know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Tell me what she gets.I wanna know.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I won't tell you, but --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will tell you this, Howard, she'd be very, but she'd be very unhappy because she's losing me. She loves me.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Losing you would be the biggest loss for her.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Losing me would be a major [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Yeah. That's devastating we understand that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She loves me. People love me, they love me like they love Howard. For the same reason because we're whackers.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Didn't you hold a fundraiser for Giuliani.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you hold a fundraiser for Clinton as well?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I did.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You did.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd like her to win in the Democratic side, Rudy to win in the Republic side.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I agree with you. We're 100% in a -- in a --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Sync?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> In sync.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I have to, you know, make a decision, because you have to go -- But -- but they're both great people, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> They are. They're both very good. I happen think so.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think -- I think they're both going to win. And then it's going to be interesting to see what happens.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Listen. We can do this all day.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do say this, Howard, if Rudy stays on his issue of the war
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He's in trouble?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He can't win
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He can't win the election. I agree with him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Anybody who supports the war even vaguely or remotely is going to lose the election.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I believe that too.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> How about the talk about Iran now and that being the next war front.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's different.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's a whole 'nother issue.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's a different issue. But I'm just saying, Iraq we should never been in there in the first place this guy for terrorists you know now that they're now -- it's a breeding camp for them. Bush is the worst president in the history of the United States.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a total disaster.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He doesn't know what he's doing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Yup.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I really don't think he has much of an IQ. I can't imagine he has any IQ at all. He's the worst president in the history of the United States, he's a disaster.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And anybody that stays in Iraq or even -- Look what happened to McCain. He wants to show how tough he is. He goes in, you know, with a war
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He sunk.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> and immediately, and that's where the Republicans.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Yup.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Republicans and Democrats.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Those are people that are hoax and people that believe in the war stuff and they don't even want to vote.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're absolutely 100% right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's the story.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And I would tell you if you were wrong. Watche Donald Trump show, Pageant Place, it premieres tonight at 10:30 on MTV. Here's the formula. Hot chicks all being dopey with one another.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> In one apartment.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> In one apartment and scantily clad, I assume.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's the formula that's worked over the years, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> There is no other formula. That's the formula.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's the one -- that's the one tried and true -- They've tried others. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I tried others. That's the only one that seems to work for me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good looking girls. Lots of sex. Lots of action. It works.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Best of luck with the show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Excellent.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Best of luck with the show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Have a good time.
