<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Mr. Trump, good to see you again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> It becomes almost a cliche in this political cycle that people are fed up with politicians, but back when you announced in June, most of the so-called experts including me, thought you had no chance and that people would end up voting for somebody with political experience. How did you know that discontent, frustration with the system, would be the prevailing mood in 2015?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I felt it. I mean I felt it from within. We have tremendous discontent in the country. We have tremendous problems in the country. And I felt it early on or I wouldn't have done this. But I see tremendous discontent.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Before we dig down into some issues, I want to see how much of a disruptor you would be. And let's do a lightning round quick questions--
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> -- quick answers. Would you be willing to use the debt limit and risk the possibility of the country going into default to get more spending cuts?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would use the debt limit. I don't want to say -- I want to be unpredictable, because, you know, we need unpredictability. Everything is so predictable with our country. But I would be very, very strong on the debt limit. And I would be asking for a very big pound of flesh if I were the Republicans. And the problem with the Republicans, they have two sides.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The smaller side is very strong and the other side is always agreeing and, you know, you can't do that.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> Would you be willing to shut down the government in order to defund Planned Parenthood or to push some other key policy goal?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do not want to say that because I want to show unpredictability. You have to. You can't just go around and say that. But Planned Parenthood should absolutely be defunded. I mean if you look at what's going on with that, it's terrible. And many other things should be defunded and many things should be cut.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> You said in August that you're, quote, "fine" with affirmative action. What about conservatives who say the time for that kind of preferential treatment has come and gone.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm fine with it, we have it, it's there. But it's coming to a time when maybe we don't need it. That would be a wonderful thing. I don't think we need it so much anymore. You know, it has served its place, it has served its time. Some people have loved it and some people don't like it at all. But I think there will be a time when you don't need it.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> You are one of the few candidates who has come out with a detailed tax plan. Let's drill down into that. You would cut the seven tax brackets to four. Zero, 10%, 20%, 25. You'd cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 15. You would limit deductions for higher-income earners. And you would eliminate "carried interest" preferential tax treatment for hedge funders.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> What's the thinking?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well the thinking is we have the highest tax rate in the world. In the entire world, we have the highest tax rate. There's gridlock in Washington because there's no leadership. So what I'm doing is a large tax cut especially for the middle class and they're gonna- we're going to have a dynamic country. We're going to have dynamic economics.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it's going to be something really special. And people are going back to work.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> But there are 2 concerns. The conservative Tax Foundation, conservative Tax Foundation says that over 10 years you would create; you would add $10 trillion to the deficit. And there's also the question of who would benefit under your tax plan. The Tax Foundation says the middle class would see after-tax income increase 7.2%. The top 1 percent would see a spike of 21.6 percent.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> So between that and ending the estate tax the Trump family and folks like you would make out great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The estate tax has been a disaster. First of all it's double taxation, some people could even say it's triple taxation.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> But how about the idea that you're going to blow a hole in the deficit and that the top 1% going to make out a lot better than the middle class.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well they're going to make out better if the economy gets better. The economy is very sick. We're losing our jobs to China to Japan to every country. We're making horrible trade deals. We are losing jobs in this country. Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of jobs are being lost. And part of the reason is our taxes are so high in this country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm also cutting, you know they don't talk about that. And I'm doing that in a different, little policy segment that we're going to be announcing-
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> Cutting spending.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we're going to be cutting tremendous amounts of money and waste and fraud and abuse. You know they had a case.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> Would you cut services? Would you cut departments?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not cutting services. But I'm cutting spending. But I may cut Department of Education. I believe common core is a very bad thing. I believe that we should be lo -- you know, educating our children from Iowa, from New Hampshire, from South Carolina, from California, from New York. I think that it should be local education.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you look at a Jeb Bush and some of these others, they want them to be educated by -- by Washington, DC bureaucrats. So Department of Education is one. Environmental protection, what they do is a disgrace. Every week they come out with new regulations. They're making it impossible...
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Who's going to protect the environment?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- they -- we'll be fine with the environment. We can leave a little bit, but you can't destroy businesses.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> You brought up trade. You would end NAFTA. You would kill the Pacific Trade Agreement. You would impose tariffs on some products like 35 percent on Ford cars made in Mexico. "The Wall Street Journal" says that you are running as, quote, "the most anti-trade candidate since Herbert Hoover."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, so here's the deal. First of all, "The Wall Street Journal" was bought for $5 billion. It's now worth $500 million, OK. They don't have to tell me what to do. "The Wall Street Journal" has been wrong so many different times about so many different things. I am all for free trade, but it's got to be fair.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When Ford moves their massive plant to Mexico, we get nothing. We lose all of these jobs. What do we get out of it? I don't want them to move their plants...
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> But I want to pick up on that because...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, the -- the point is, I don't want them to move their plants. I want them to stay in Michigan. I want them to stay in all of the places where they are, or expanding to other places. But I want it to be in the United States. I don't want them to go to Mexico. I don't want them to go to China.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> This brings up the point, the conservative American Enterprise Institute says, look, Donald Trump, he owns a dozen hotels, properties, all over the world. Your Trump Collection clothing line, some of it is made in Mexico...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's true.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> -- and -- and China.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> And...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want it to be made here.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> I know. But the point they say is you're doing just what Ford is, you're taking...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> -- advantage of a global trading market.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I never dispute that. I put it in my speeches. I say it -- the ties are made in China and different things. I don't want that. I just ordered 4,000 television sets. You know where they come from? South Korea. And yet we defend South Korea for practically nothing. We have 28,000 soldiers. They're making a fortune.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to order them from South Korea. I don't think anybody makes television sets in the United States anymore. I don't want to order from South Korea. I want to order from here. I talk about it all the time. We don't make anything anymore. Now you look at Boeing. Boeing's going over to China. They're going to build a massive plant because China's demanding it in order to order airplanes from Boeing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So Boeing now is going to China, building a massive plant. I don't want that. I don't want that.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> You say that eminent domain is wonderful, and you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I didn't say wonderful, I say eminent domain is something you need Chris. Eminent domain -- if I build a highway -- go ahead. I know exactly what you're saying. But if I build a highway, and if something's in the way of the highway, you're going to have to do something with that.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> I understand that. And that's the idea of using -- taking private property for a public use. But -
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the way, people get paid for it. Everyone thinks they don't get paid. They get paid a lot of money.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> I understand. But in the Kelo case, the big Supreme Court case in 2005, they took somebody's home and they sold it and then paid -- bought it. And then they gave it -- sold it -- to private entrepreneurs, private developers. And that's the question --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's different.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But that's the question I'm going to ask you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But that's different.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Do you support taking private property for private use?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If somebody has a property in the middle of a 7,000 job factory, as an example, that's going to move into the town -- but they need this one corner of this property, and it's going to provide 7,000 jobs in a community that's dying, of which we have many in this country, OK? I am for that. That's a big economic development.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But remember this: all of these people that we're talking about, they're friends of mine. They all love the Keystone Pipeline, right? The Keystone Pipeline is all eminent domain. They're building that pipeline without eminent domain, you wouldn't be able to build.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> But let me ask you since you were involved in a case like this, as you know, in the 90s --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true. That was an economic development.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> -- in Atlantic City.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> You had your hotel, and you wanted to build a parking lot where some woman had her house --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She saved me a fortune.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> But I guess the question is why do you need to take her house, for a parking lot?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I tell you what. Because I have a hotel, and in order to expand the hotel and add 2,000 rooms, I would have had to take her thing. Now, the 2,000 rooms would have provided about 2,500 jobs, Ultimately offered a lot of money, she didn't take it, I didn't build the job. I didn't do it. Saved me a lot of money because Atlantic City, you know, I had the good sense to leave 7 years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I got very lucky. Yeah, I think that would have been a good eminent domain because you would have provided thousands of jobs. And this is a woman who couldn't have cared less about her house. All she wanted was money.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> Something you said on Friday has stirred up some controversy about George W. Bush and the Twin Towers.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> Question: do you blame George W. Bush for 9/11?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, look, Jeb said we were safe with my brother. We were safe. Well, the World Trade Center just fell down! Now, am I trying to blame him? I'm not blaming anybody. But the World Trade Center came down. So when he said, we were safe, that's not safe. We lost 3,000 people, it was one of the greatest -- probably the greatest catastrophe ever in this country if you think about it, right?
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> What would you have done?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I would have been much different, I must tell you. Somebody said, well, it wouldn't have been any different. Well, it would have been. I am extremely, extremely tough on illegal immigration. I'm extremely tough on people coming into this country. I believe that if I were running things, I doubt those families would have -- I doubt that those people would have been in the country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So there's a good chance that those people would not have been in our country. With that being said, I'm not blaming George Bush. But I don't want Jeb Bush to say my brother kept us safe becauseSeptember 11 was one of the worst days in the history of this country.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Let's look at the polls. According to the latest Real Clear Politics average, you are leading everywhere. You are leading, nationally, you're leading in all the early states. Nationally, you're at 23.8 percent, leading; down 7 points in the last month. In Iowa, 22.3 percent, down 6 points. New Hampshire; 26.3 percent, down 6 points.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Let me make it clear, because I know this is important to you -- [Crosstalk]
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> You are still leading. Why do you think your numbers have gone down a bit?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think they've gone down. I think they've gone up. We just had a Reuters poll come out. I'm at 33. We just had, as you know, Nevada come out. I'm 20 points ahead of second place. We had one come out in South Carolina where I'm 18 or 20 points ahead. The polls have been now better than they've ever been.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And what you're doing is a little bit obsolete information. But that's OK. Look, I'm leading in everything.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> Late this week, you forced, I think it's fair to say -- you and Ben Carson -- forced CNBC to change the ground rules for their debate. And Carly Fiorina went after you and Carson. She said, first of all, what are they scared about, standing up for three hours? And then she said this:
<Carly Fiorina> <Negative> [Begin Video Clip] They also apparently asked for prepared statements-you know prepared statements are what politicians do. So honestly, here are 2 outsiders supposedly, Donald Trump and Ben Carson, and they sound a lot like politicians tonight to me. [End Video Clip]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, first of all, she's going nowhere. You talk about dropping in the polls, she's dropped like a rock. I could stand there for 12 hours. I could stand there for 20 hours. But the people can't take it. Who wants to watch a debate for three hours? I couldn't watch Hillary for an hour-and-a-half. And when I heard it was a three-hour debate that was only done to make more money for the company, for the network, I said, I'm not going to participate because I thought that the CNN debate was ridiculous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was too long and people were turning off- who's going to watch a debate that long? You know, it used to be one hour when it started. It used to also get no ratings. And both CNN and Fox broke the all-time record on cable television. So I wonder why. Do you have any idea why?
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> I think -- it -- maybe it was because of the moderators.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think so.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> [Laughs]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do think so. Great moderators.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Which brings me to the question of temperament, which I think you would agree is important --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's very important.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> -- in a president. First of all, what's the deal with the tweets? Why are you sitting there at night watching TV and tweeting out?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it's fine. It's a great way of getting my word out. I love Twitter and tweeting, and I have -- between that and Facebook, I have like 10 million followers. It's a great way. Now if you do something bad to me, I can tweet about Chris. And the world will be seeing it.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> [Laughs] And you have.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, and you know what? Truthfully, it's an amazing way of getting the word out.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> But-- but does Mrs. Trump ever say, 'Donald, turn off the TV? Come to bed.'?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I don't do that much. And usually it's not too late. No, I just think it's an amazing way -- you know, we're in a modern age now. We have to get with it. Twitter and Facebook and all of this stuff is, to me, I mean it's, for some reason -- I'm probably not the youngest person using it. But for some reason, it works very well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm setting records. In fact, for the debate, you know -- I'm talking about the Democrat debate -- and they use Democratic. It's really Democrat. You know that, OK? They called that wrong. It's really the Democrat. But the Democrat debate, I picked up more followers by many times than anybody else. And there were those that said I won the debate because I picked up all the followers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But no, I think it's a great, modern way of getting the word out.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> During the campaign, you have called Marco Rubio a puppet, Jeb Bush low energy, Rand Paul a lightweight. And just this week, you called Bernie Sanders a maniac.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And a communist.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> [Laughs] And a communist. Do you think that's presidential --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Is that the way you would act in the White House?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm running against a lot of people. And if they come out and attack me, very viciously, very viciously. I mean, Perry, I thought he was a nice guy. He was always a friend of mine. He had won campaign contributions. He was always very nice. All of a sudden, boom, I hit him very hard. I hit Rand Paul very hard.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look what happened to him. I'm a counterpuncher. I don't have a choice. If you look what they say about me, it's terrible. I mean, they say terrible things about me. Bobby Jindal -- I mean, you talk about lightweights, this guy is a real lightweight. And he hit me -- I don't even know this man -- and he hit me because -- and they're not hitting me on fact.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're hitting me in order to try to pick up something in their polls. The thing I'm most honored about is every single person that went after me, including Jeb Bush, who's down -- boom. Every single person that went after me has gone way down. And I'm very honored by that. And that's what the country needs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The country needs a leader that when the country gets hit, we're going to come out on top, not keep going down. Because we're going down. Our country is going down.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> Then I want to bring up the subject -- hear me out -- of you and me. During the debate, I asked you a question about bankruptcy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> And you -- I thought gave a fine answer.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Begin Video Clip] First of all these lenders aren't babies, these are total killers -- you know, I mean you're living in a world of the make-believe, Chris [Audience Cheers], if you want to know the truth. [End Video Clip]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I did. I thought it was my best answer.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Then, for about a week, you go after me. You say blood's pouring out of my eyes, you compare me unfavorably to my father. And I agree -- he's one of a kind. Here's the question: You're running for president. I mean, we talked to Chris Christie about Bridgegate. We talked to Carly Fiorina about --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Destroying the company.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> -- about [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She destroyed her company.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> So I guess the question is...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's not personal.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> -- are you a little thin-skinned?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm only thin-skinned when somebody says bad things that are false. For instance, if you hit me about something that's true, all right, the bankruptcy -- I used that as a tool. I didn't ever file for bankruptcy. Out of hundreds and hundreds of...
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But it was just a question -- it
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- four times -- I've used it four times. But...
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But it was just a question.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no, I know, but the way it was phrased, the way it was phrased. I could see the eyes, OK. [Crosstalk]
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> -- I don't even know what blood coming out of my eyes is?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I used it as a tool brilliantly. And it was phrased incorrectly in my opinion, the question. And you wouldn't have asked these people about bankruptcy, but you asked me about it. And I've used it brilliantly...
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> I asked Carly Fiorina about Hewlett Packard.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And honest I-- well, that's easy. She destroyed the company, OK. That one is an easy one. So, I'm not thin-skinned when something is truthful. If I did something wrong and you said I did something -- I can handle that and if the press is bad, I -- it's when people hit me when I didn't do anything wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, it's like then -- then it's not a question of thin-skinned, I will fight back.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> You say my father covered you in a much fairer manner. So I decided to go back and look at your first profile on "60 Minutes." He talked a lot about your successes, but he also talked about the fact that you were in a controversy then. The allegation was that you were trying to throw middle class people out of the rent-controlled building so you could create condos for rich people.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Here's a clip.
<Mike Wallace> <Negative> [Begin Video Clip] When they call you arrogant and cruel -- those tenants over there -- Does that get under your skin?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because you see, I think I'm right and when I think I'm right, nothing bothers me. [End Video Clip]
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> First of all...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've been doing this for a long time.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> [Laughs] First of all, whatever happened to that nice soft-spoken young man?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know. I know. I know.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> But was that a fair question¦
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm very [Inaudible]...
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> -- for him to ask you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I thought it was fair because it was very controversial at the time and I thought it was fair.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Not to press my luck, but true or false: you, at one point, considered and tried to put homeless people in some of those apartments to force the tenants to move out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I talked about doing it and I talked about doing it as a charity. That's right. We have a thing called...
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> A charity?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I was thinking about doing that and, you know, I would have done that and it would have been nice and it would have been charitable. But you have wealthy people living and paying like $200 rent on Fifth Avenue or Central Park South, I think it's unfair and it's been proven to be unfair.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Finally, Hillary Clinton testifies before the House Benghazi Committee this week. What is it you would like to find out about both her role in Benghazi and about her e-mails?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think things will be revealed. Personally, I think that Hillary was one of the worst, if not the worst, I mean if you look at the record, secretary of States ever, ever in this country. I think that's the bigger problem that she's got. I don't think Benghazi is as big a problem for her as her past and what's happened.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The world blew up around her. You look at the world, it just blew up around her. Everything went bad, whether it's Libya, whether it's her tenure in Iraq. And there's been plenty of bad tenures having to do with Iraq because of the length. Things that happened during her tenure were a disaster. I think she's...
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> but would...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- probably going to go down as the worst secretary of State in the history of this country. And I think that will be -- what I will tell you, that will be what I will be campaigning on. Now, what's going to happen with Benghazi? It will be very interesting. I look forward to it.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> If you end up as the Republican nominee and she's the Democratic nominee, how would you take her on?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd take her on tough. I'd just take her on, on her record. I'd discuss her record. I think her record is abysmal. And I would take her on, on her record.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Mr. Trump...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Thank you, Chris -- A great honor.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right. So, Newsmax, you do an interview with them. And you say, you will announce that you are going to run right after "Celebrity Apprentice" on the last night of the show, you will do what?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I will be announcing as to whether or not I'll run sometime prior to June, I've been saying that for a long time. Newsmax actually took a little of liberty when they said I will be running. I'm not going to be running. I will announce what I will be doing sometime prior to June.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Which I've been consistently saying.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Where are you now in the decision-making process?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll tell you, we just had the polls and the polls are, as you know, because I watched you the other day, you're the first one that told me because I'm watching your television show. And I'm saying gee- whiz, I'm number one. But the polls have been really amazing. CNN came out with a poll which was phenomenal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm in first place with Governor Huckabee, who is a good guy, by the way. Who I have gotten to know wisely and I think really is a terrific guy. And it's always bad. You know, you are supposed to compete against people you -- I do much better when I don't like the people. But I happen to like him. And I like a couple of the other candidates.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Well, we talk about that in a second. You said you are Barack Obama's worst nightmare, why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I understand him. I understand what is going on. I understand the mindset. They do not want to run against me. I get it. And he doesn't get it. And I watched that speech yesterday, I thought it was an outrage. That wasn't a speech on deficit. That was a political speech. That means he's running and that was his first speech.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought it was ridiculous. Raising taxes and really not doing anything having to do with the deficit, I thought it was an outrage. And look, he's been horrible president. I always said the worst president was Jimmy Carter. Guess what? Jimmy Carter goes to second place. Barack Obama has been the worst president ever.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The history of this country, Barack Obama is number one. And he had this little minion go on television.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> David Plouffe.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And say -- David, whoever. Nobody knows how to pronounce his name.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He ought to make that clear. But he had this person go on television, and make a statement like oh, gee, we certainly --
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> He said you have zero chance you would get hired by the American people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And yet I just won the recent CNN poll, the independent vote. And I was the one that was tied, statistically tied with Obama, the only Republican that was statistically tied with Obama. And I haven't even done anything. You know, I haven't said I'm running. So, and you know, the poles, one of the pollsters actually said that one of the reasons I don't go even higher is a lot of people don't think I'm running.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They think I'm having a good time talking to people like you. You've become my friend for a month but I've watched you so much. I consider you like a friend for a long time.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the fact is, a lot of people in the polls don't vote for me, because they think I'm just having a good time. They think that I'm promoting "Celebrity Apprentice" which I'm absolutely not. And you just told me how good the ratings are in "Celebrity Apprentice." I don't need this --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Let's look at these polls. CNN poll. There's a Newsmax online poll over half a million people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That was the best of all.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> That was the best of all. You're second in New Hampshire in a poll that came out, Mitt Romney first, you're second.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And he lives there.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes. OK. So, he's from Massachusetts. So, the question is, why do you think your message is resonating? What do you think it is about you at this moment that all of a sudden, you come out of nowhere, you say I'm thinking about running for president and these poll numbers go up? What do you think is happening?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I'm known as a really good business man. And I am. And by the way, if I run, I will have to disclose my opinion finances, and my finances are phenomenal. Much better than anyone knows. You know, they know I'm rich. But I've done a great job. I've made a lot of great decisions. And that will be disclosed if and when I decide to run.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I actually look forward to that. It will be I think a very positive thing.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right. Let me ask you about the nomination. So, you are running for the Republican nomination, if you run.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Correct
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You describe yourself politically as a conservative?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm a very conservative person.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Very conservative person, but...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> With a big heart. I'm actually a conservative with a big heart.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Recently, you said that if you don't get the nomination that you would run as an independent. You are asking Republicans --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I didn't say that. I said I would certainly think about that. Because the question is what happens if you don't get the nomination? And this was also before the new polls came out that showed me leading. But they said, what happens if you don't get? Would you consider running? I said yes, I would consider running as an independent.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right. But if you do that, that would be the greatest gift to Barack Obama and --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Unless I won. No, no, unless I won.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> In reality though, if you are a conservative and you didn't get the nomination you are running against another conservative, you split the vote, Barack Obama sails into the presidency.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Unless I thought I could win as an independent. I wouldn't do that, because if I lost, I get a tremendous amount of votes and I would take them all from the Republican Party, which would be terrible. So, unless I thought I could win, really win as an independent, I would not do that. Because I wouldn't want to come in second or third place and Obama ends up winning.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> OK. So, if you thought that it would hurt the chances of defeating Obama, you would not do it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The only way I would run is, would be if I didn't get the Republican nomination and felt through polls and lots of other things that are pretty good and pretty scientific. And seem to work over the years, I've been watching lots of polls, and they seem to be pretty accurate, amazingly, right? If I thought I could win absolutely win as an independent I would do it. If I didn't, it would be devastating because you wouldn't have a Republican in. So, I would have a real problem unless I really felt certain, pretty certain of victory.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You described yourself a conservative. What does it mean for you when you say, that you are a conservative person? How do you describe that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I have great values. I think I really have a great solid strong value. I love this country. I feel so strongly about this country. I love people that work. This weekend I'm making a speech in Boca Raton, Florida, and there was supposed to be like 200 people before it was announced that I was speaking.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And now I hear they have thousands -- they had to lead the hall, it is going to be in some park, where they have thousands and thousands of people coming, which really makes me feel good. But I really relate to the Tea Party people. Somebody was asking me, in fact every reporter asks me, what do you think of the Tea Party?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said, I think they are great. They are workers. They love the country. And you know, their greatest service has been -- and this is very simple -- they've made everyone think. They were the first that brought up the deficit. People, we were just riding this deficit, borrowing more and more money, they were the first ones that really made both Democrats and Republicans think.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I think the Tea Party has served an unbelievable and performed an unbelievable function.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> How do you describe, some Republicans are saying, wait a minute he wants the Republican nomination, years gone by, you have donated to people like Harry Reid, Chuck Schumer, other Democrats. Why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I get along with everybody. And, you know, can I be honest, you are a pretty conservative guy.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don't you think it is time -- I get along with everybody. I get along -- I also have plenty of enemies as you probably know.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Rosie.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> My worst enemy will be Obama, probably. Well, you said Rosie, I didn't. But the fact is, I get along with people. I also come from a place that is almost exclusively Democratic.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> New York.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm in New York. OK. I mean, the Republicans don't even think they have a chance. And, you know, maybe I would have a chance, OK? But they don't even think about New York. So, I've lived in New York. This building, this great tower and many other towers I own, they are in New York. Everyone is Democratic.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, what am I going to do, contribute to Republicans? Am I going to contribute to, I mean, one thing I'm not stupid. Am I going to contribute to a Republican for my whole life when they get, they run against some Democrat. And the most they can get is one percent of the vote? So, I think more importantly, and this question will always be asked.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, I've contributed to Schumer, I contributed -- I've known Schumer for many, many years. And I have a good relationship with him. The fact is, that I think it is time maybe that we all do get along.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Who were the people that you might be running against? You mentioned you like Mike Huckabee. You know, the other candidates, Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I sort of like them all. You know, I have a problem. They've treated me so nicely. I have such a problem, everyone said such nice things. I saw Santorum said something nice.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Newt Gingrich did, Sarah Palin did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The all did. Newt Gingrich last month joined my club in Washington. A little before he heard about this in all fairness, but I already have his money.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> He said something nice about in a speech this weekend.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that is very nice. I mean, so, I wish I didn't like them, does that make sense to you?
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Well you're all going to have to debate each other.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They are all saying these nice things about me. I have a hard time. So, the truth is, I watched Pawlenty the other day. I don't know him but he said these wonderful things about Donald Trump. And I can't now say, oh gee, this and that.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Well, look, you're all...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The good news is I don't think Barack Obama is going to be saying nice things and that's a positive. [Crosstalk] Look, I think I'm a great negotiator. I think I will do a better job than anybody because I'm really a great negotiator. I know how to negotiate. I know how people are ripping us off. I know why they're ripping us off and I know how to solve the problem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And as far as yesterday is concerned and what is going on over the last couple of days, the numbers aren't as bad as you are thinking, because what is happening is, if you take away $300 billion where China is ripping us and you take away Colombia and you take away virtually every nation in the world, who is making a huge -- let's use the word profit on the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When you start equalizing that, not even to make money of them, just to neutralize it, China shouldn't be making $300 billion on us, this year.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> How do you get to --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But therefore, the numbers aren't as bad as what you are seeing. In other words, that has a huge impact.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> $14 trillion is a big --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Headed towards $24 trillion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it is. But we are losing so much money. Every country we deal with virtually we are losing money. When Japan had its horrible accident, they said to me, what do you think? I said, you know what? They've treated us like fools for many years. But still, we should help them. Aren't I nice a guy?
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You are a nice guy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they treated us like fools for years and years and years. They treated us like a bunch of dopes. But you know, what?
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> But would you deal with entitlements? Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. I mean. --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You have to deal with it.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Because --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do worry about -- I have a lot of respect for Paul Ryan. I do worry that he's a little bit far out in front because the Democrats are going to take that Medicare word, that little word called Medicare which to a lot of people mean seniors citizens. And they are going to take that word, and they're going to say, oh, senior, senior.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the Republicans have to be careful not to fall into a Democratic trap.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And that trap is that they would be seen as --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The trap is Medicare.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> -- being mean towards the elderly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- towards seniors. And I will tell you, me, I'm protecting, I don't care what plan the Republicans put, I'm protecting the seniors. The seniors are in a certain way the heart of this country. And I'm protecting the seniors.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> In other words --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I can tell you.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> But do we have to -- look, discretionary something is 12 percent of the budget. The real money --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not enough.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> -- the trillions are in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, there's got to be some adjustment.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Things have to be done but it has to be done with both parties together. It has to be done together. You can't have the Republicans get too far ahead of this issue.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> So, you would say --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are going to lose elections.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hey, if I run I don't want to lose this election. Because I can do a lot of things for this country. And I don't want to lose this election. And I just don't think that -- again, Ryan is great. But I don't think he should get too far ahead in front of this issue. Because I know, you just said, I know Schumer, I know this, I know exactly what they are doing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They love having somebody even talk about the word Medicare.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Extreme. Yes, because --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because they may be then say, oh, they are going to cut Medicare. Even though these guys will end up doing it, you have an election to win. And I think the Republicans frankly are too far out ahead. You know, this debate is supposed to be led by our president.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> He punted.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you have to be very careful that the Republicans don't go too far ahead in front because they are going to lose the big election coming in 2012 if that happens.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> But do you really think you can balance the budget. You become president, how long would it take to you balance the budget?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We would make a huge amount of progress, and you would do some of this stuff, but it wouldn't be the kind of numbers -- look, we're losing so much money. And not only money, we are losing jobs. Don't forget China is taking our jobs. They are not only taking our money, but they are taking our jobs. So, we're losing money, they're taking jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, that means the economy can never come back. Because the best thing for balancing the budget is to have a strong economy. And the economy can never come back if we are going to always have high unemployment.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Here we are. We have a beautiful view of Central Park. And 9/11 happens here. Radical Islam, the president when he first got into office went on an apology tour.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Unbelievable.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> America is arrogant -- OK, so, the question is, do you think he understands the real dangers that led up to 9/11, 3,000 people killed right here in this city? And you recently spoke about the Koran, you said it gives you a negative vibe. And you got some criticism for it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I didn't see the criticism. But obviously, there is something going on. Because every time you turn on a television, 100 people are killed in a grocery store in Iraq.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, everyday a bomb goes off. And I see the wounded. And I spent a lot of time with the wounded, the soldiers, our soldiers, our great soldiers. And they come back with a missing arm, no legs, and for what, for what? Now, I will say this, and some people think it is harsh, and I think it is common sense.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And a lot of people think it's great when I first said it, which was one with week ago. We go to Iraq, we spend $1.5 trillion and our cities are dying all over the place, they don't have any money. We spend $1.5 trillion. Iraq has the second largest oilfields in the world. $15 billion worth of oil, second to Saudi Arabia.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We go over, we decapitate their armies. Their armies are wiped out. They have weak armies, it is a corrupt society anyway, I mean, it's totally corrupt what is going on over there. We then leave in Iran which has fought for years back and forth, back and forth, because they were basically of equal strength, well, now they are not.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Iran will come in and they will take over Iraq, within two seconds after we leave, forget it, it is not even a contest. Sean, I hear they are already starting. I don't even think they have to fire a bullet, because to be honest with you, I hear they are already making great political inroads in Iraq. So, within about two minutes after we leave, Iran is going to come off, take over Iraq.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But they are going to take the oil. So, they are going to have the second best oilfields in the world, second biggest oilfields in the world that we made possible with our soldiers, thousands of people dead, wounded and 1.5 -- less importantly, $1.5 trillion. So, I said very simply that if it is me, we take the oil.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, in the old days, when you win a country, you win a country. Now with our stupid people, we win a country, we lose money, we lose soldiers, we lose lives and then we leave.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> How about a minimum that they pay for their liberation?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> At a minimum.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> At a minimum, they pay us back the 1.5 trillion. That's at a minimum.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Iran, the nuclear threat is real. The way our relationship with Israel is strained. I think we are getting to a point where the Iranian nuclear facilities have got to be taken out at some point, difficult job. If the Israelis, if you are president, the Israelis see the need that they for the national security got to take it out.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Would you support them? Do you think it is in our best geographic, political interests to do so?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all, I was the ground marshal of the Israeli Day Parade, 10 years ago when believe me, it was dangerous because there was a little war going on and a lot of problems. And I walked down Fifth Avenue. And Jewish friends of mine still remember that day. I have a park named after me in Israel that I donated.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm a big fan of Israel. I will say this, I don't understand, I have so many Jewish friends that are big Obama fans. And they are supporting Obama and giving tremendous amounts, wealthy guys, live in New York, wealthy, hedge funds, real estate guys. They are supporting Obama.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Obama is terrible for Israel. He's terrible for Israel.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I agree.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, it is interesting with too Obama if you look at Wisconsin. He made a pledge that he was going to March in Wisconsin. He was going to put on his walking shoes and march with those teachers. Where is he? He's all talk. He's all talk. Unfortunately, he's also action but it's always the wrong action.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right. Let's talk a little bit -- you mentioned recently that you are a Christian, that you go to church. How important is your faith to Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very important. I'm a Protestant, I'm a Presbyterian. Very important. I'm also busy and probably busier than I should be. But I am a Christian. I'm Protestant. I'm Presbyterian.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Pro-life.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm pro-life.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Gay marriage, what do you stand?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm against gay marriage. And, you know, not easy to do in New York, but I'm against. And I have changed views on different things over the years.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Like?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, like pro-life. I was sort of -- I have always torn by it. I was always torn by it. I'm very much, to take the other extreme, very much, very much in favor of the death penalty, especially for terrorists and especially for people that, you know killers that you see so many where the girls are being killed, and then they capture these guys.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm so for the death penalty. And I think as far as terrorism is concerned, death penalty with a speedy trial. Look at the guy that knocked down the World Trade Center. They are still negotiating. I mean, last week I heard they are finally going to try him in a military camp, this after years. So he'll go for years and years, probably die of old age before they even try him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm for speedy, but fair trials, fair, but speedy trials, speedy.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You support military tribunals over bringing him to New York?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely. [Crosstalk] First of all, what is the purpose of bringing him into New York? You will have riots, you have this, you have that. You have the military. Our military is great. Another thing I'd do, I wouldn't cut the military. I would increase the military. We would have, with me, the strongest -- I hate when they say, we are going to cut the military.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why, because China is taking all our money? Because Colombia, little Columbia, they made $4 billion on us last year. Columbia in South America, fourth largest in South America, they made $4 billion.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Who are past presidents that you admire most?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I really like and knew a little bit Ronald Reagan, and I really liked him. You know, not only his policies, smart guy and so much smarter, you know, I always sort of have to laugh to myself when people try and criticize that level of intelligence. And I loved his style. I loved what he represented.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said, there's our president. I would see him sometimes, he once gave a speech, I think it was at the Lincoln memorial. And he was dressed in a tuxedo. And I said, you know there's something to that. There's our president. I thought he represented something very special for this country. And it was a much more special time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What I loved also about him, was no games. When Jimmy Carter lost the hostages, when they were in Iran, they would still be there. And Reagan said, essentially, they will be back the first day -- they were let go the next day.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> They were afraid of them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because as I say, it is the messenger. People say what would you do to OPEC? It's plenty you do. They wouldn't even be there if it wasn't for us, OK? So they say, what would you do? It is the messenger. You know, I have business people that I deal with all the time. I can send one guy into a room and then another guy into the room.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Say this same thing, one guy comes back with the bacon the other doesn't, all the time. It's the messenger.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You would drill on ANWR, you drill in the 48 states.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You would build nuclear facilities.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You build refineries.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And now, I will tell you this, nuclear, and I always say that you have to be a little bit flexible in life, you can't just say boom. I'm a big driller. OK. And with care. You know, I've gotten many environmental awards. I build these great golf courses as I build great buildings, I get a lot of awards for what I do. So, I know the environmental thing probably better than anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I also know it is carried to an extent that is absolutely insane. I mean, I've seen jobs stopped that would have employed thousands of people, but they can because there's a piece of grass that they found.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> There's a turtle egg.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have seen incredible developments with tremendous job producing capabilities stopped, many times because of swamp pink, a little piece of grass like this that doesn't even look good, OK? I mean, I've seen things stopped environmentally that are absolutely -- and I also know, I really play the game at a very high level, I have many environmental consultants.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And when they come to me and tell me why they can't do something, and why we have to do this and why we have to do that, and then they laugh. And I say, this is ridiculous. They say yes, but that's how we make our money. And they go up to Albany and they go to Washington and they make it impossible, so that we have to hire them in order to get around all these rules and regulations.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is hurting our country. You go to China, they are filling in a section of the ocean to build a city. I say to the guys doing it, how long did it take you get your environmental permits?
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> A week.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They don't even know what I'm talking about. They go, this is the ocean. You know, they're filling in a section, a quarter of a mile by a quarter of a mile, big. And I say, in order to build other things, a lot of things, buildings, in order to build cities. But when I say -- because we are so used to it. You know, if you drop a pebble into the Hudson River, you get the electric chair, OK? A pebble.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So here they are filling in, and you see thousands of trucks, just trucks. I mean, literally, thousands. They have dump trucks lined up miles long, dumping, dumping, dumping. And we don't see that in this country.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I cut down a tree on my property, I got a $15,000 fine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, it's unbelievable.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> It's unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you see this and I say these guys how long did it take to get these approvals? Because, you know, growing up in this country, they don't even know what I'm talking about. They said Donald, it is the ocean. They are right. It is a speck. It's so little. You can't even see it from, you know, from our great space platforms that we used to have.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> A lot has been made over the birth certificate issue. And you apparently, you have said in the previous interviews that you have a team of investigators in Hawaii now looking into it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Correct.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> It has a lot of press. Everyone is asking you about it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And what have you come up with your investigators?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't want to say that now. [Note: Video begins here] But it is going to be very interesting. But I don't want to say it now, Sean. But I will say this, I don't love this issue. I'd much rather be talking about how China is ripping us off, how OPEC is -- that's what I'm really good at. I understand it. I can do such a great job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, this issue came up about six weeks ago. And I've heard about it for years. But I never thought too much about it. And I assumed he was born in this country. But six weeks ago, I started really looking into it. He's got a certificate of live birth. That's by the way, despite what certain liberal press says, that's not a birth certificate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It is a big, big step lower. In fact, in some places, you can get married or get a driver's license with a certificate of live birth, OK? So, I say to myself, why.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Only has a stamp, no signature.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's got a stamp. It's got a stamp. No, it's got a stamped signature. By the way, I have my birth certificate. I think I'll show it. I think I'm going to bring it down to Boca Raton this weekend. But I have my, it's got stamps, it's got three different signatures, it's got everything, everything is official.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have to see this thing. It's like a certificate of live birth is not appropriate. Now, I say to myself, why? A few -- just simple questions, why doesn't he show his birth certificate, number one. You know, they say it is sealed. Well, but for the person, you could release it. And if it's the person, you could -- sure, it's sealed, it should be sealed, that's great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But the person, you know, I actually sent to New York for my birth certificate. And they actually got on the phone, they said Mr. Trump, I'm sorry to do this sir, you have to give me your Social Security number. You have to prove, it's really you I'm talking to. I went through a whole big thing. OK, but when they figured out it was actually me, they sent it to me. I had to pay $38, and they sent me my birth certificate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They could do the same thing to him, and I say, why did he spent millions of dollars on trying to stay away from this issue? Why doesn't he give his birth certificate?
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> The one thing on his side is that they have these announcements in the newspaper, eight days after.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Eight days later.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was eight days. Look, he's got a grandmother in Kenya who said he was born in Kenya at the hospital. Then there was bedlam in the room, bedlam. I don't mean like a little, you know, because he was close to becoming president. And there were a lot of people in that room, and he was being, she was talking to a reporter with a lot of handlers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A lot of Obama handlers. So, they had the grandmother, she said Kenya. Then all of a sudden, 51 seconds later, he asked the question again. And you hear people scream, no, no Hawaii, Hawaii! OK? Give me a break. Now, the other one was eight or nine days later from the reported birth date. But you don't know if it was even the reported.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they could have easily come from Kenya or someplace.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> The issue would go away in a minute. Just show the certificate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't understand. Why he doesn't show? Why did he spend millions of dollars on trying to stay away from the issue? Now, it's one of two things. Either, he wasn't born in the country, or he doesn't have a birth certificate that, or there is something on the birth certificate that he doesn't want people to see.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> What do you think that could be? Could it have to do with religion?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. I mean, maybe it says he's Muslim. Which wouldn't bother me. I mean, if it is that thing, you know, if it's that's it, it's it. It's what it is.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> He went to a Muslim school in Indonesia. He talks about studying the Koran. He talks about one of the most beautiful moments being, you know, prayer times at sunset.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, he was born Barry Soetero, somewhere along the line, he changed his name. I heard he had terrible marks and he ends up in Harvard. He wrote a book that was better than Ernest Hemingway, but the second book was written by an average person. He shouldn't have written the second book.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You suspect Bill Ayers.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I said, Bill Ayers wrote the book, the first book.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Why do you think it's Bill Ayers?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because everyone says he's a super genius and he was a great writer. And Bill Ayers just came out recently, because he's not in love with Obama, because like Obama dropped Reverend Wright like a dog, he dropped him like a dog. You know, for 20 years, he's in Reverend Wright's congregation, OK. I'm Protestant and I understand.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's in Reverend Wright's congregation for 20 years listening to Reverend Wright's spew hate against white people. And all of a sudden, he drops him like a dog. And Reverend Wright doesn't -- hates him now, actually hates him from what I hear.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Well, he said --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But the same thing with Bill Ayers. The same thing with Bill Ayers, he dropped -- he was best friends with Bill Ayers. Bill Ayers was a super genius. And a lot of people have said he wrote the book. While recently, as you know last week, Bill Ayers came out and said he did write the book. Barack Obama wouldn't be president, and, you know, I wrote many best sellers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And also, number one bestsellers including "The Art of the Deal." I know something about writing. And I want to tell you, the guy that wrote the first book didn't write the second book. Obama made a big mistake when he wrote the second book. Because the second book was not Ernest Hemingway, it was about 37 classes below.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The first book is Ernest Hemingway plus. The second book was written by somebody that was much more average. How do you have average marks -- how do you have bad marks and get into Harvard?
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Let me go back to the issue. Because I want to talk about media coverage of Obama. Because you are going to have full coverage of your finances, every woman that you've dated, your marriages, all that is going to come up, fair game?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it is fair. But I also think this. My finances are great. I think when you get into social things, I just think this country has big problems. And I sit down and I look at the problems of this country and I just think that we have more important things to discuss with like.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Than who you dated.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, than who I dated or who, and, you know, what? I have unbelievable great relationships with a lot of people and I have a great relationship with my wife. But, we really -- that's the problem with this process. In China, they pick the meanest, toughest, smartest guy. Ruthless. And he's our negotiator.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In this country we pick a guy that has never had a problem. Never done anything, I mean, look at Obama. Obama had bad marks and he gets into Harvard, OK? He wasn't a good student. Everyone thinks he was like the super genius, he wasn't a genius. He had bad marks. And it is a big story. Everyone says, how did he get into Harvard?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How did he get into Columbia? He had horrible marks supposedly. [Crosstalk] He doesn't release his marks. Nobody knows what his marks. But everybody said, because there was some released where his marks were lousy, and yet he gets into Harvard. I mean, this guy really is leading a charmed life. I have to be honest with you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Somebody said, what is his biggest asset? He is lucky politically. He really is. He's led a charmed life.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> The media --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the media is letting him get away with it. I'll give you an example, a better example, Tony Rezko. If you did Tony Rezko, you would be in jail right now.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I believe it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Tony Rezko is his pretty much mentor. Was his big political contributor. There's another guy he dropped like a hot rock. So, you got Reverend Wright, you got Bill Ayers, you got Tony Rezko. He drops these guys and the press leaves him alone. He took -- he buys a house, and then Tony Rezko, his biggest political supporter who is in jail, and a, you know, mobster, buys the lot next to him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm a great real estate guy. I made a lot of money, you will see maybe. Assuming I run, OK? You're going to love it. You will be very impressed with my numbers, I'm a really good real estate guy. But he buys the house next door. The lot next door. Obama wants to expand his house. So, Rezko sells him a little chunk of that lot at from what I can see, under market value, under market value.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Rendering his lot unbuildable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Rendering Rezko's lot, either unbuildable or nobody wants it. Nobody wants to have a -- hey, Mr. Schwartz goes up to buy the house next door. And what happens to the back of it? I mean, where is the back of my lot, I don't want to buy this lot. So, Rezko, gives him a piece under market and more importantly, destroys the value of the lot he has.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, when I heard that, I said oh, that's the end of his campaign he's out. Because if it was you, me or anybody else -- so, here's a guy, did one deal in his entire life and it was Tony Rezko. That's the only deal he has ever done. It is pretty amazing how nothing happened. And it is pretty amazing how Rezko, is in jail now and he never ratted out Obama.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I spent more time than anybody in the media on the issue of Reverend Wright and Bill Ayers. He was asked one question about Bill Ayers, oh, he's a guy in the neighborhood. And then we discovered, he started his political career in Bill Ayers' house. He gave speeches with him. He sat on boards with him. OK, so...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he acted like he hardly knew him.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> He hardly knew him. And his answer was, he is some guy in the neighborhood.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's some guy. Some guy that wrote his book.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Some guy. All right. This is the guy that sounds repentant about bombing the Pentagon, in the capitol in New York City Police Headquarters.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Horrible.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And on 9/11 of all days, he had that in The New York Times. Media ignores it. Reverend Wright, I was fortified by him, he drove around listening to tapes of him. He is, you know, like family to me. And then of course, he got thrown under the bus. There's a picture in that church magazine.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Both of these guys hate Obama because he dropped them. And, you know, what? There's one thing, I'm like a loyalist. I have people that, you know, I try to be loyal to people. He's a very disloyal guy. Because he could have stuck by Reverend Wright and he could have gotten away with it.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> How does he stick by a guy that says g-d America after 9/11.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what? He could have said, gee, I like the guy, he differs from me. He could have done something. He dropped him like a rock. And Reverend Wright supposedly is just incensed right now. OK, incensed. Who cares? Bill Ayers, bad guy but a brilliant guy. I'd love to find out who wrote that book. Because, you know what?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Without that book, he's not president. You know, that book was so brilliant.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> What is it tell you about --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That he became president because the book was so great, everyone said, oh look at this guy. Look at the book.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> If Donald Trump was hanging out with mobsters, and doing business deals with mobsters, real estate deals, wouldn't your associates matter in terms of people's perceptions of you before you become the president on the United States?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the Tony Rezko thing is the thing I least understand. Because if you did the deal, if I did the deal, if anybody did that deal, we would at a minimum not be in office and probably be behind bars.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> If you and your wife were on -- your wife was on a magazine cover with Mrs. Farrakhan, who I think is a vicious virulent anti-Semite and racist, which Michele Obama was on a cover with Mrs. Farrakhan. He lives two blocks away from Obama, he's within the radical community in Chicago. Is that a legitimate question?
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Did you ever meet him? Do you know him? And would that have an impact do you think on the American people in terms of him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it would. But I just don't think the president -- you cover it. A couple of people covered it for the...
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I don't have access. He won't come on this show.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, most of them don't cover it. Most of them don't cover it, and it amazes me. It amazes me the free ride he gets. As an example, when I talk about the birther issue. And it is not my favorite issue, believe me. But when I talk about it, I have some reporters, you could see they are visibly angry at me for even bringing it up. But there's a real question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I told you before, when I first started, I assumed he was born here. When it was first said. Now, I have a real doubt. So they should have a real doubt too. They protect him. They are protecting Obama. Tony Rezko, I mean, why aren't they out there looking into that matter?
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I did. We spend -- we got a lot of heat during the election process because we brought up all of these questions.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They never gave Rezko a chance to rat him out. And yet, anybody else, they let him rat out.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> They would have had Woodward and Bernstein, you know, there every day.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know, the funny thing is if I'm a reporter, hey, look, if I'm a reporter, I want to be Bob Woodward.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to be Bob Woodward. You can have Bob Woodward. If they found out about the birth certificate. If they found out about Tony Rezko. They could be Bob Woodward.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Look, I said in the last election, journalism died in America. They will be much tougher on you. The scrutiny will be much tougher than any Republican candidate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. And every time they're tough with me, I'm going to bring up to investigate Rezko. By the way, every time --
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Is this the difference though, I mean. With you taking on these issues --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sean, every time -- Sean, let me just finish this. Because they will tough. Here's the problem. I've done hundreds of deals, hundreds, I've done transactions and deals by the hundreds. I've done great, OK? I mean, I've done, you know, mostly great deals. And they will be tough on me. Here's a guy did one deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> One deal. That they'll go through every deal, did the secretary dot that "i" oh, gee, there's a typo. Therefore, Trump did something wrong. It is really terrible. You know, I've always heard that a very successful person cannot run for political officer, OK? And I understand it. But the country is in such bad shape that I feel I have an obligation to do it.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And you are willing to open all those books?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, yes. I open my books. Hey look, I'm going to do a financial disclosure.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Assuming I run. I'm going to do a financial disclosure. And by the way, the papers submitted to me are not big enough.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> All right. Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's been great to see you.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I really appreciate your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love your show.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you.
