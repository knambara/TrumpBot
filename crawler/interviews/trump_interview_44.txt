<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Welcome back to Morning Joe. Let's bring in right now on the phone Donald Trump. Donald, we're going to start today with -- how are you doing this morning first of all, Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [On the Phone] I'm doing good. I left New Hampshire last night. We had a tremendous crowd, Joe, as you probably heard. I mean, it was really a tremendous crowd. We had a great evening and I'm here now speaking you to folks, listening to how I'm going to help Bush. Hey Joe, listening to how I'm going to help Bush, nobody believes that. The one that least believes that is Jeb Bush. Believe me.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Yes, you need to take that with Ron Brownstein. We only read the news. But, Donald, we of course expect nothing less than great New Hampshire for you. So we're going to start this a little differently. Before I talk about the Trump challenge with Lawrence O'Donnell, can I ask you did you see -- just yes or no -- did you see what Lawrence did last night?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I heard about it. And I heard he really issued an apology and it was almost --
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Don't kill Shakespeare in the first act -- I mean, don't kill Hamlet in the first act. We're going to play it, Donald, and then we'll get your response. So this is Lawrence O'Donnell last night. Fascinating television. [Begin Video]
<Lawrence O'Donnell> <Positive> Now for a few words about Donald Trump. I like him. When I met Donald Trump just three months ago, Donald was making his grand entrance in the ballroom of the White House Correspondents' Dinner and I was sitting alone at a table minding my own business. He spotted me, called my name. And watch what he did. He stretches out his hand for a handshake. That -- he does that to a guy who savaged him four years ago when he was talking about running for president.
<Lawrence O'Donnell> <Negative> Donald is now bothered by my disbelief that I've expressed about how much money NBC paid him as the star of The Apprentice" series. And today Donald came up with a better idea than threatening to sue me this time. He challenged me to bet 100 percent of my salary that I am wrong about his NBC income. Now where I come from
<Lawrence O'Donnell> <Negative> So, no, Donald, there won't be any bet because I would never bet about anything. And, I might be wrong. I have never said I know exactly how much Donald Trump made for the entire series. I don't know. I've made semi-educated guesses about it and I don't really care very much about it. I stupidly jumped into talking about it again on Morning Joe today where I, in effect, hijacked a few minutes of the show to talk about this thing that I know doesn't matter.
<Lawrence O'Donnell> <Negative> I don't want the prize for the guy who uses the meanest words in the debate. I don't want to be the angry guy about Donald Trump. Because I'm not. I had been eating up time that should have been devoted to Joe and Mika's interview with April Ryan, who had just joined the panel to discuss her very important question to President Obama yesterday in the press conference about Bill Cosby.
<Lawrence O'Donnell> <Negative> Now, I am really sorry that I wasted the time that should have been focused on what April Ryan had to say. [End Video]
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> It was a really compelling moment, compelling apology. You know, Donald, the part we didn't show there because it went for a while is where he said that, after he suffered injuries and was in the hospital, you were one of the first to reach out to him. And after his show, you were -- after his first show, coming back, you were one of the first to reach out to him and it meant the world to him. I thought fascinating television. Now we'll open it up to you, Donald? What's your response?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm very disappointed because I was really all set to go after him this morning. And now I feel guilty if I do that. [Laughter] I feel very, very guilty. A lot of interesting things. I mean, I actually got a semi-nice couple of remarks from Eugene Robinson today. I consider that major -- you know, it's my ambition to someday get a good editorial from Eugene. I do respect him.
<Eugene Robinson> <Negative> We're here to serve, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So this morning is really a little strange for me, Joe. No, I was going to go after Lawrence, big, big league, and I was going to do the challenge and say lots of nasty things about him. But it's hard to do that now. Joe, you really ruined my morning, to be honest with you.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Well, it's not first morning of yours I ruined. I get the e-mails, too, from your office. But, Donald, let's move then on -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Should I therefore not -- Joseph? Joe, I should therefore not give the challenge, right?
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Well, I think he just said that he may have been wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He is wrong. He is wrong. I mean, these are certified numbers.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, as Mark said yesterday very nicely, I'm not going to be putting in false numbers. These are all certified by a accountant. I made a lot of money. The Apprentice" was a tremendous success. I made a lot of money with it. You know that.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right. We all know that. So let's move on to -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, I will not issue a challenge. Let's get on to more important things, OK.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Let's get on to much, much more important things. Yesterday in Tennessee, obviously, a tragedy. Four Marines killed. President Obama had a press conference after a previous shooting saying this happens far too much. Donald, what in the world can the President of United States do to stop people from spreading terror across this country?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's a very tough situation for the country and we're going to have to increase our intel groups and we have some great groups and, frankly, we're going to have to get much tougher with law enforcement. We're going to have -- you know, we have law enforcement that's afraid to go up to people now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They don't want to lose their job. They want to get their pension in 20 years, et cetera. And we're going to have to let the law enforcement go.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to start doing something with these gun-free zones where these four soldiers, highly decorated, in at least one instance really highly decorated, they're not allowed to have guns. So they were sitting there and they were just targets for this guy, for this mad guy, mad man.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know, we're going to have to do changes. And you're going to have to get rid of the gun-free zones. You're going to have to let these people that are trained specialists to not sit there without guns. so some whackjob like this can come in like this and shoot them. And it's a tough -- it's a very tough situation and getting tougher. And I suspect you'll see more and more of it and we are going to have to do something. I mean, he's growing up in an area -- I can't imagine that some people in the area didn't see that he was going off the wire and couldn't have reported him in some form.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> Mr. Trump, Mark Halperin here. I want to ask you two quick political questions if I could. First, you made a big point of trying to get President Obama to release his college records, grades and transcripts. I'm wondering if you would release your records from Wharton?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, interestingly, first of all, I don't know. I mean, it's something I've never thought about. He -- nobody else seem to. But the answer is I will certainly think about it. I was a very good student. I went to a great school, the Wharton School of Finance.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> So you won't commit today to doing it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can -- it's the first time I've ever heard the question. I'll certainly think about it. Wharton, I'm very proud of my record there. I was an excellent student. I will certainly think about it.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> OK, another question is the opposition research is a big part of politics. And if candidates have success, as you know as a student of history, other candidates do opposition research and put it out to the press. Is your campaign doing opposition research on other Republicans and what areas do you think your opponents will come after you on?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I guess my opposition research really is reading the newspapers, seeing what they are. There is plenty of opposition research.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, it's interesting. I was listening to your show and Joe I think was saying that I'll go up and make a speech and I do get the biggest audiences. I do get the most standing ovations by far.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'll make speeches. And I don't have pollsters. And these guys pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for pollsters and they're afraid to act. They're afraid to say anything without going to their pollster and having it tested.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That takes four or five days. Maybe that's why Jeb Bush couldn't answer a simple question on Iraq. Was Iraq a good thing or a bathing? It took him five days to get the answer out and get the answer right, because he probably had to go back to his pollster.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You can't run the country like that. And I don't have pollsters. I can afford pollsters much more than anybody times 100. But I don't want to have a pollster. I mean, you know, if the pollster was so good, maybe he'd be running. So I really do my own research. I read a lot of newspapers, a lot of stories; I read a lot of things about opposition. I know the opposition well. Many of the guys I know very well over the years. And many of them I like.
<Eugene Robinson> <Positive> All right. Mr. Trump, this is Gene Robinson.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi, Gene.
<Eugene Robinson> <Positive> I'm going to keep our aura of good feeling going today. We're on a roll.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good.
<Eugene Robinson> <Negative> But I'm going to ask you about your positions on social issues on which you may be out of step with your other members of your party -- same-sex marriage, abortion, Obamacare. How do you square what you think on these issues with what your party thinks? ,
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think I'm pretty well square. I'm pro-life. The court has ruled very strongly and you know, I would have preferred the court let the states make the decision, but the courts have ruled. And probably most people seem to think that's not going to be overturned or changed by Congress.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It doesn't sound like anybody has the votes, or the stomach for it. But I would have preferred having the states make the decision.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And as far as Obamacare is concerned, it's a disaster. It is really kicking in, Gene, in '16. It is going to be a tremendous negative for the country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And here's the problem. It's terrible. The rates are going up through the roof. You look at every aspect of Obamacare, it is just not working.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And there are a lot of people that still don't have insurance. But the people that had good insurance now have bad insurance. Their deductibles are through the roof. Their rates are through the roof. And I hear more and more complaints. Another thing that nobody talks about, Gene, is doctors. I know so many doctors, they're going to retire, they don't want to do it. One of my friends who's a doctor said, you know what, I have more accountants than I have nurses because of the complexity of it. So it really has to be changed, Gene, and ideally repealed and replaced.
<Eugene Robinson> <Neutral> But you've said in the past that there should be essentially universal health care, haven't you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want health care for everyone, Gene. And that's where I may be a little bit different from some of the people. You can't let the people in this country that are the poor people, the people without the money, without the resources, go without health care.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just can't even imagine. You're sick and you can't even go to a doctor. And I make it in speeches.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I tell speeches. You know, I'm a very conservative guy, but I say one thing -- you cannot let 25 percent of the people in the country because they have no money go without something. So we have to work out a deal with hospitals.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have to work out a deal. We have to take care of those people that really can't take care of themselves. And I'm very strong on that. And, you know, you can say that's not a very conservative way. Well, if it's not, that's going to be a problem for me. But I don't think it will be. I make that speech in front of very conservative audiences and I get a standing ovation when I say that. So I think there's something going on there --
<Andrea Mitchell> <Neutral> Andrea Mitchell here, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> '-- that is very important.
<Andrea Mitchell> <Negative> Sorry, Donald. Andrea Mitchell here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi, Andrea.
<Andrea Mitchell> <Positive> I want to ask you about your online feud with John McCain. He criticized your event in Phoenix saying you brought out the extremists, the crazies. And then you tweeted that you had a great -- there are great Americans that showed up for new Phoenix and you said that Senator McCain called them crazies, he must apologize. And John McCain should be defeated in the primaries, graduated last in his class in Annapolis. Dummy.
<Andrea Mitchell> <Negative> Why take on John McCain, a war hero and a senior Republican? What is at work here with you and John McCain?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all, let me tell you, I supported John McCain. He let us down because he lost.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it was a hard win after what happened with the economy. But I supported him, raised a lot of money for him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A tremendous amount of money. And I'm a loyalist. I'm a person that if somebody is with me, I'm with that person. And John McCain was very disloyal to me, No.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> 1. This is the first time I have spoken to him in a long time. But probably heard I had a total of 15,000 people come to the convention center.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They were expecting 500 at the Biltmore and the Biltmore had 15,000 people come to the convention center. It was an unbelievable day and they weren't crazies.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They were great Americans. I know crazies, believe me. These were great Americans. And John McCain -- and they wanted to know about illegal immigration.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's killing them. Illegal immigration is really hurting these people, especially when you're talking about Arizona and Phoenix. And we had an amazing group of people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And when he called them crazies, I think he will lose in the primary. If the right person runs against him, they'll win in the primary. He's not very popular there anyway. For him to call this group of people -- and you have to understand, we rented a ballroom. We expected 400 to 500 people about three weeks ago.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The ballroom called us, the owner, it's the Biltmore, begging us not to do it because they were being swamped. They were being swamped. We then realized what was happening. We ended up with 15,000 people and they were great Americans. They were great people. And John McCain calls them crazies. I think it's inappropriate. So of course I brought up a point that very few people know, that he was just about or last at his -- at Annapolis and why not? He was very nasty to me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My attitude is this, if a person is nice to me, I will go out of my way to be nice to that person. Like for instance, Ted Cruz at very early in our little skirmish two weeks ago, which turned out I was right, by the way, but Ted Cruz came out totally and strongly in favor of me. I don't forget things like that. I think it was very nice. John McCain made a big mistake. I think John McCain will lose in the primary if somebody good runs against him.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right, Donald Trump. We thank you for calling in. Always interesting. Good luck on the campaign trail. We will talk very soon.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Yes, actually that seems as good a place as any to start, maybe, in Davos...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> ...and if you could talk a little bit about your decision to go and the message you're trying to send there and if you have thoughts about what you're going to say.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think more than anything else it's the great success that we've had in the last year. And you know if you remember the first quarter was a very low GDP, when Obama's last quarter. It was the slowest growing recovery, a very minor recovery, but it's the worst recovery they've had since the Great Depression. And our country was headed in the wrong direction.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We were going down, we were going down a long way. I believe if the opposing party got in, I believe the stock market would have fallen 50 percent instead of gone up to the number it's gone up. The regulations were choking people, choking companies like never before. It was out of control and they were only going to get worse.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The cutting of regulation and all of the many things that we've done, including being a cheerleader for the country -- and perhaps that's part of the reason I'm going to Davos also -- but being a cheerleader for the country. Yesterday it was announced that Toyota is coming in with a very big plant in Alabama. It's going to cost -- they're going to spend billions of dollars, four thousand jobs, create 300,000 cars a year within the country, which is what I want.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Prime Minister Abe told me about it, I pressed him very hard. I said, 'We got to get your companies building here. We don't want a building in Japan; we want to build them here. We have a lot of plants opening, car plants opening; we have a lot of things happening that would've never happened under the Democrats.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I just think I want to tell the story of what's happening in the United States. A lot of tremendous things are happening in the United States, including the fact that you can now live without being strangled by regulation. You people actually wrote one of the best stories that I've ever seen on regulation; you said more than any president in history.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was the full pager, that wasn't...
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ...I mean I actually read it because I've never seen a full page -- it's actually a full page article.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, it was a full pager and essentially said there's never been a president that's been anywhere close on regulation. And you know, just so we understand. We need regulation, but we don't need 19 different roadblocks getting to the same place and that's what we had. And we have a long way to go, we're cutting actually quite a bit of additional regulation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're looking at Dodd-Frank very strongly and I think we'll have something on that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's going to be bipartisan and we're looking at other things and the bottom line is that the spirit in the country -- you saw small business yesterday came out with the most enthusiastic they've ever been in the history of the report, which is a very old report.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Business, generally, manufacturing the same thing, but we have companies pouring back into this country and you saw that yesterday with Toyota.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Did you see the other economy news yesterday? The markets did dip a little bit after some news suggesting that you were going to maybe pull out of NAFTA. I wonder where you're at on NAFTA and if you're concerned about the impact pulling out and renegotiating could have on the market.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not sure that markets would dip; I think that markets would -- I can tell you I'm not sure about world markets, but I can tell you I think the American market would go up if I terminated NAFTA and renegotiated a new deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We are -- when I campaigned I said we'll either renegotiate NAFTA or I'll terminate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And nothing's changed, I have fulfilled many of my campaign promises. One of the promises that you know is being very seriously negotiated right now is the wall and the wall will happen. And if you look -- point, after point, after point -- now we've had some turns. You always have to have flexibility.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> As an example, we've been much tougher on China, but not nearly as tough as I would be, but they are helping us a lot with North Korea.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you see in North Korea what's happening with North Korea all of a sudden. China's been helping us a lot, so you can veer a little bit differently, but for the most part everything I've said I've done.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> And a question on China for you, just to follow up on NAFTA, withdrawal is still on the table for you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If we don't make the right deal, I will terminate NAFTA. OK?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, do I want to? No, I'd rather leave it, but I feel that if that if -- you know, the United States has been treated very, very badly. That has been a terrible agreement for us, and if we don't make a good deal for our country -- we lose $71 billion in trade deficits with Mexico. We lose $17 billion with Canada. If we don't make a fair deal for the United States and the United States taxpayer, then I will terminate it.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Do you have a timetable on that? I know there's another round of talks coming up here this month.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but, you know, I'm leaving it a little flexible because they have an election coming up. So I understand a lot of things are hard to negotiate prior to an election. They have an election coming up fairly shortly, and I understand that that makes it a little bit difficult for them, and I'm not looking to make the other side -- so we'll either make a deal or -- there's no rush, but I will say that if we don't make a fair deal for this country, a Trump deal, then we're not going to have -- then we're going to have a -- I will terminate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> With that being said, I would rather be able to negotiate. We've made a lot of headway. We're moving along nicely. Bob Lighthizer and others are working very hard, and we'll see what happens.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But tremendous numbers of, you talk about auto plants like yesterday, but how about all the plants that have been taken out of this country and moved to Mexico. Like taking candy from a baby. No, I won't let that happen.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> And you mentioned the link between China and North Korea. We talked about that a little bit the last time we were in here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Is that -- does that link still exist for you? Do you feel like China's been helpful enough... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Not helpful enough, but they've been very helpful. Let's put it this way, they've done more for me than they ever have for any American president. They still haven't done enough. But they've done more for me than they have, by far, for any -- I have a very good relationship with President Xi.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like him. He likes me. We have a great chemistry together. He's -- China has done far more for us than they ever have for any American president.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> With that being said, it's not enough. They have to do more.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> So when it comes to some of the decisions you have this month on aluminum, steel, the 301 case, does that... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> For instance, at the very beginning, you know Obama felt -- President Obama felt it was his biggest problem is North Korea. He said that openly. He said that to me, but he said that openly. It is a big problem, and they should not have left me with that problem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That should have been a problem that was solved by Obama, or Bush, or Clinton or anybody, because the longer it went, the worse, the more difficult the problem got. This should not have been a problem left on my desk, but it is, and I get things solved. And one way or the other, that problem is going to be solved.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> China has been helping us, and I appreciate the help, but they can do much more.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Are you worried, Mr. President, that sending -- delaying military exercises on the peninsula for the Olympics sends the wrong message to the North?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Say it again?
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Are you concerned that delaying military exercises on the Korean Peninsula for the Olympics sends the wrong message to the North Koreans, that you're in some way bending to them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're the first one that's asked that question. No, I don't think anybody thinks that I'm bending. I think that people that, if anything, I'm being too tough.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think it's inappropriate to have the Olympics, have millions of people going to the Olympics hopefully, have North Korea going to the Olympics, and we're having exercises on the beach. No, I think that it doesn't -- I think it sends a good message to North Korea, not a bad message. I think it would be totally inappropriate to do that during the Olympics.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> You think North Korea is trying to drive a wedge between the two countries, between you and President Moon?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll let you know in -- within the next 12 months, OK, Mike?
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will let you know. But if I were them I would try. But the difference is I'm president; other people aren't. And I know more about wedges than any human being that's ever lived, but I'll let you know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I'll tell you, you know, when you talk about driving a wedge, we also have a thing called trade. And South Korea -- brilliantly makes -- we have a trade deficit with South Korea of $31 billion a year. That's a pretty strong bargaining chip to me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> With that being said, President Xi has been extremely generous with what he's said, I like him a lot. I have a great relationship with him, as you know I have a great relationship with Prime Minister Abe of Japan and I probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have relationships with people, I think you people are surprised.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Just to be clear, you haven't spoken to the North Korean leader, I mean when you say a relationship with Korea --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to comment on it -- I don't want to comment, I'm not saying I have or I haven't. But I just don't --
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Some people would see your tweets, which are sometimes combative towards Kim Jong Un...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure, you see that a lot with me and then all of a sudden somebody's my best friend. I could give you 20 examples. You give me 30. I'm a very flexible person.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Speaking of being flexible it sounds as if there's an immigration deal that has been struck amongst senators on the hill that's been sent to the White House for approval?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Getting close.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Have you -- have you seen anything from the Senate yet?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No but it's getting close. They -- want, I feel, you know, I have great feeling for DACA. I think that we should be able to do something with DACA. I think it's foolish if we don't, they've been here a long time, they're no longer children, you know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People talk of them as children, I mean some are 41 years old and older. But some are in their teens, and late teens, but nevertheless I think we should do something with DACA and I think we should do something to help people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It wasn't their fault, their parents came in, it wasn't their fault. So we're in the process of trying to work something out. I hope we can do it. I don't think it has to take that long.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The lottery system is a disaster, we have to get rid of the lottery system. The -- as you know chain is -- chain migration is a horrible situation. You've seen the ads, you've seen everything, you know all about chain.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This person on the west side that killed eight people and badly, you heard me say yesterday, badly, badly wounded about 12. I mean people losing arms and legs -- nobody even talks about that. But they say killed eight and that's it. I mean you have people -- ones walking around without -- missing two legs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the person was running to stay in shape and now he's missing two legs. Think of it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But this person, who should've never been allowed into this country, came in through the lottery. When they interviewed his neighborhood, they say he was horrible. You'd say good morning to him and he'd start cursing at you. They didn't want him so they sent him through the lottery, you know, congratulations United States.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So the lottery has to end, chain migration -- he brought in they say 22 people through the chain. So we have 22 of his relatives, why? And I honestly think that the Democrats are with us on that. We'll find out. I mean who wouldn't be? Who wouldn't be? Unless it's somebody that didn't love our country, and the Democrats love our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have different views but the Democrats love our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So yeah, I think, Michael, I think we have a good chance to make a deal. We have to have a wall. We don't have a wall, we're not doing the deal.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Do you have to have a completely funded wall or -- would $1.6 billion be enough? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let me, let me tell you something about the wall. So I've always said we have to have a wall. I've also said Mexico's got to pay for it -- sometimes you know on occasion, I'd add who's going to pay for it? Mexico. Well they will pay for it, OK? There are many forms of payment.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I could name 10 right now. There are many forms of payment, I didn't say how.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Could you give us an example?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They can pay for it through, as an example, they can pay for it indirectly through NAFTA. OK? You know, we make a good deal on NAFTA, say I'm going to take a small percentage of that money and it's going to go toward the wall. Guess what? Mexico's paying. Now Mexico may not want to make the NAFTA deal and which is OK, then I'll terminate NAFTA...which I think would be frankly a positive for our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think it's a positive for Mexico, I don't think it's a positive for the world. But it's a positive for our country because I'd make a much better deal. There is no deal that I can make on NAFTA that's as good as if I terminate NAFTA and make a new deal. OK? But I feel that we have a chance of making a reasonable deal, the way it is now.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> On immigration -- could you see yourself signing a bill....
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The other thing...so the wall. The wall's never meant to be 2,100 miles long. We have mountains that are far better than a wall, we have violent rivers that nobody goes near, we have areas...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, you don't need a wall where you have a natural barrier that's far greater than any wall you could build, OK? Because somebody said oh, he's going to make the wall smaller. I'm not going to make it smaller. The wall was always going to be a wall where we needed it. And there are some areas that are far greater than any wall we could build.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, maybe someday somebody could make that clear, Sarah, will you make that clear please?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I saw on television, Donald Trump is going to make the wall smaller; no, the wall's identical. The other thing about the wall is we've spent a great deal of time with the Border Patrol and with the ICE agents and they know this stuff better than anybody, they're unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They both endorsed me, the only time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate, OK? And they endorsed us unanimously. I had meetings with them, they need see-through. So, we need a form of fence or window. I said why you need that -- makes so much sense? They said because we have to see who's on the other side.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you have a wall this thick and it's solid concrete from ground to 32 feet high which is a high wall, much higher than people planned. You go 32 feet up and you don't know who's over here. You're here, you've got the wall and there's some other people here.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you don't know who's there, you've got a problem.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Well, the other day after your meeting when you talked about wanting to see a deal from Congress. In particular, I'm thinking of the tweets from Ann Coulter. You know, a straight -- I mean, they want a wall. Do you feel that you have some room to negotiate here with your own base, when it comes to the wall?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't have to because the wall is the same wall I've always talked about. I can understand why I have to have see-through.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If I'm standing here, I want to be able to see 200 yards out. I want to be able to see, I don't want to have a piece of concrete that I can't see.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now on the wall we have cameras and we have highly sophisticated equipment, but the wall -- the Border Patrol tells me the other way's more expensive. It's not less expensive. We have to have vision through the wall.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> But...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is going to be state of the art wall; this will be state of the art. But, I can fully understand why you'd have to have vision. I'd like to be able to see three or four hundred yards instead of we're at a wall we have no idea who's on the other side. Does this make sense or am I just wasting my time.
<Hope Hicks> <Positive> It’s what you’ve always talked; it’s consistent with what you’ve always said.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, this is the same. I hope I don't read tomorrow, Trump is going to make the wall, I always said, we need a wall.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I never said the wall's going to be two thousand, but there are -- there is a vast amount of territory where nobody comes through.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> There's this famous metaphor in politics about Nixon going to China.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Is there a possibility that Donald Trump could sign a comprehensive immigration bill which would provide a path to legal status, citizenship for 11 million people who are here illegally?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm not talking amnesty at all. I'm not talking amnesty at all, that's the other thing. No, I think my base is with me. My base feels that these 800 thousand young people should not be thrown out of the country, OK? My base is with me and now I you know; and I think my base actually gets bigger.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm not doing it because of the base or anything else, I'm doing it from the standpoint of heart, I'm doing it from the standpoint of common sense. I'm doing it from another standpoint too. You have a lot of people of those 800, they work hard, they have jobs. We need workers in this country; we need people to come in and work because I have a lot of companies moving in.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm getting a lot of questions like we want to move to Wisconsin, we wanted -- like Wisconsin, I have Foxconn coming to Wisconsin; that's my deal. You know the head of Foxconn, you know he's a friend of mine. He's still only moving there because of me. And the governor has been fantastic.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The governor of Wisconsin has been fantastic in their presentations and everything else. But I'm the one who got them to look at it. Now we need people because they're going to have thousands of people working it's going to be a -- you know -- that's -- that's the company that makes the Apple iPhone.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Is that -- they're going to build them here, they're going to build other things here too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We need people so we have to be a little bit flexible. I don't want to be so -- I've had another pledge that I'm going to move companies back into this country. I don't want to make it so tough that they can't come back in.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Would you say that's a correct statement, Gary, we have to have people.
<Gary Cohn> <Positive> Yeah.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> So when you say you have to have people, clearly there's the 800,000 'Dreamers,' but there's also the larger group of people who are currently in the country...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's a different discussion.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> So, you said on Tuesday...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's comprehensive -- well, if we could do that, that's fine. I don't know that that's going to be possible.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There's a lot of -- there's a lot of -- there's a big difference -- first of all, there's a big difference between DACA and Dreamers, OK?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Dreamers are different. And I want American kids to be Dreamers also, by the way. I want American kids to be Dreamers also.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But there's a big difference between DACA and Dreamers. And a lot of times when I was with certain Democrats they kept using the word dreamer. I said, "Please
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK, people think they're interchangeable, but they're not.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So -- I -- I think we have a very good chance of making a deal on DACA, I would like to be able to do it; I think that the people that are Trump supporters agree with me on it. I would never do it without a wall, the wall is the wall and it's the same wall that we're always talking about. It's -- you know, wherever we need, we don't need it where you have mountains; you don't need it where you have rivers and -- you know, vicious rivers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So -- so we have sort of natural barriers.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Barriers, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, obviously, we never intended [Inaudible].
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Just to be really clear, because I don't want to have any misunderstanding.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, be really clear, I'd like to -- because I love The Wall Street Journal. I hope that you guys are clear. OK.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> For sure.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> When -- on Tuesday you said that you supported the idea of signing comprehensive immigration reform...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no I support the idea of discussing it.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, maybe, it's possible to get it. You know, that's what I do, I make deals. Despite what you read with -- by these people that don't know me, that were never interviewed by -- to me, you know.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> But first we have to [Inaudible]. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The man with the three hour interview, he spent three hours -- the man who said he spent three hours in the Oval Office who I never met once in the White House. OK, you know -- despite all these characters that are -- that's something you can talk about, is the libel laws, because we've got to increase our libel laws so when people make misstatements, like yourselves, but when people make misstatements somebody has some, you know, recourse.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Do you have a plan for that, Mr. President?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, I do, I would -- I would say -- I don't know that I'll be able to get it though -- but I think that when somebody makes false statements and libelous statements, whether it's in a book or a newspaper or anything else. When they have phony sources, when the sources don't exist, yeah I think they should have a liability.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Do you think Congress needs to make new libel laws?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know if Congress has the guts to do that.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> But do you want them to?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would like to see that. Yeah, I'd like to be able to -- look, nobody gets more false press than I do. Nobody -- nobody gets -- nobody comes close. In history -- in the history of this country nobody's gotten more false press and you guys all know it.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Why -- why do you think that is?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They dislike me, the liberal media dislikes me. I mean I watch people -- I was always the best at what I did, I was the -- I was, you know, I went to the -- I went to the Wharton School of Finance, did well. I went out, I -- I started in Brooklyn, in a Brooklyn office with my father, I became one of the most successful real-estate developers, one of the most successful business people. I created maybe the greatest brand.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I then go into, in addition to that, part-time, like five percent a week, I open up a television show. As you know, the Apprentice on many evenings was the number one show on all of television, a tremendous success. It went on for 12 years, a tremendous success. They wanted to sign me for another three years and I said, no, I can't do that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's one of the reasons NBC hates me so much. NBC hates me so much they wanted -- they were desperate to sign me for -- for three more years.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Mr. President, you made reference to the book. Steve Bannon ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Just -- and so -- so I was successful, successful, successful. I was always the best athlete, people don't know that. But I was successful at everything I ever did and then I run for president, first time -- first time, not three times, not six times. I ran for president first time and lo and behold, I win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then people say oh, is he a smart person? I'm smarter than all of them put together, but they can't admit it. They had a bad year.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> You mention the book -- Steve Bannon was somebody important to your campaign, worked in the White House, was on the National Security Council for a while. Do you feel betrayed by him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I do. I feel betrayed because you're not supposed to do that, but I have many people that work for me who were far more important than Steve, right there.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And others, I mean I could take you around to the back and I could show you many people, If you don't -- and some of them you wouldn't know their names so [Inaudible]. Steve was -- I always liked Steve, but Steve became very ineffective because he was such a lightning rod.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Steve, in the end I fired Steve.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Is that relationship permanently broken between you and Steve?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You never know, you know again, the word -- – I don't know what the word permanent means, OK? I never know what the word permanent means. We'll see what happens, but Steve had nothing to do with my win. Well, certainly very little.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Steve's greatest asset is he was able to convince a corrupt media that he was responsible for my win. Hope, just out of curiosity, you were there from day one. What do you think Steve in a percentage had to do with my victory?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean he was there. Corey [Lewandowski] had more to do with it.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> David had more to do with it. Many people --  I mean, there were many people -- it's a little before Sarah's time. If you were here, you would have had more to do with it. No, I talked to Steve very little; I didn't know Steve well, believe it or not.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They made it sound like -- I mean when that guy wrote the book about Steve.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Don't forget, I had vanquished 17 governors, senators plus a couple of very smart people, like Ben and Carly and others. I had vanquished them easily -- easily. I won every debate based on the polls. You know, they do polls -- seven or eight polls.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Time Magazine -- Time Magazine's not a fan of mine.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Drudge, Time Magazine they have seven polls. I don't think, I may be wrong -- I don't think you'll find one poll that I ever lost in any of the 14, 15 debates. Including the presidential debate, you know with her, the three. Steve Bannon, I just wish him well...
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Sir can I ask you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...but he had nothing to do with my -- he was involved, but he had nothing to do with our victory. And he was there two months -- what was it two months after? So, I beat 17 people, OK? So, Michael, you know politics, perhaps better than me.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Not better.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You've been doing it longer, OK? That's the other thing I've only been doing this for two years, two and a half years, OK? You know, it's pretty good. When they said Jeb Bush was off his game; Trump killed him in the debate. Jeb was off his game because he hasn't been governor now. He's been out of politics for eight years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, really? I've been out of politics for -- I was never in politics.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, sort of interesting, but when I won against the 17 people, you can't then say that oh, gee, somebody comes in two months after I won, and he gives me new policy, new idea. I can't change those ideas, those ideas are wedded.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> What seemed like the most egregious thing that Steve said was that was some of the things about your son and the Russian meetings.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What he said about my son is horrible. My son had a brief meeting based on the fact that he thought whatever he thought. And he -- somebody said bad stuff on an opponent. I don't know of one politician in Washington -- if you're a politician and somebody called up that they have information on your opponent that might be negative.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not sure, but I don't think there's one politician in all of Washington that would not take that would not take that meeting, number one. Number two, after the meeting was over nothing happened. In other words, it wasn't like OK let's meet again in a month and let's plan out the -- nothing happened, it was a dead meeting.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Did you ever hear about the meeting during the campaign?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I never did; I never knew about it.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> Excuse me, I just -- we have about two or three minutes left and you've got to go to a meeting.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh I do?
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Yes, you have an 11:15. So, I can push it about five minutes, but that's all we've got. So you're running out of time.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> I'd like to ask a couple of questions about your tweets on the Russia investigation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> You had tweeted yesterday that you wanted Republicans in Congress to take control of the investigations. They control Congress. Do you want them to shut down those investigations?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I think -- I just want them to -- look, all I see of these Democrats, like Adam Schiff  -- it's all he does, he'll have a meeting, and then he'll leave, and he'll call up the meeting, and then I'll have a meeting and then he'll leave. He left meetings where people are being interviewed, and then all of a sudden they say a story about what's going on inside the meetings.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's probably illegal, what he's doing. But the Democrats know it's a hoax. It's an excuse for them having lost the election. They know it's a hoax.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And yet, they are milking it to a fare-thee-well and I think the Republicans --  although I will say that over the last month the Republicans have started to get very tough. Because they realize there's no collusion whatsoever. There's no collusion.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Do you think they're close to ending the probe?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hope so. Hey, look, I got elected president. I won easily, 306 or 304, depending on your definition, to 223. I won a race that should never be won by a Republican because it's so stacked in the Democrats' favor.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, if you figure California, New York, and Illinois, you start off with losing that -- you have to run the entire East Coast and every --  and the entire Midwest.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I won an election that should never be won, because the Electoral College is far harder to win than the popular vote. The popular vote, for me, would have been much easier.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> But just to be clear, you're not asking for them to shut those congressional investigations down?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I just want them to be tough, be strong. I also think that primary collusion, because there was no collusion on our side, the collusion was on the Democrat side with the Russians. And what went on with the FBI, where a man is tweeting to his lover that if she loses, we'll essentially go back to the -- we'll go to the insurance policy, which is -- if they lose, we'll go to phase 2, and we'll get this guy out of office.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, this is the FBI we're talking about. I think that is -- that is treason. See, that's treason right there.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Does any of that make you less...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By the way, that's a treasonous act. What he tweeted to his lover is a treasonous act.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Does any of that make you less likely or less inclined to testify before Mueller, or talk to Mueller's people?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, there has never been in the history of this country an administration that, number one, did nothing wrong, and number two, was more open with a special counsel. We have -- my lawyers are very good people. We made a decision right at the beginning. And it wasn't their original idea.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They figured, like, well, we'll fight this [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> After they looked at all the letters, all the facts, every email, they saw nothing. They said, "We should be open."" There has never been a more --  they said
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they said, and I agree with them, "We should be upfront
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> So if asked if...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There has never been, in the history -- in the history of an administration anybody that was more open than we were. You understand that?
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We gave them everything. We didn't go to court and say, "You can't have this document
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't have an email. I didn't have a meeting. I didn't have -- did I have one meeting with -- about Russia? And...
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Well, Mueller's also looking at some other areas, right? Like obstruction of justice...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well allow -- let me -- [Inaudible]. So, they make up a crime, and the crime doesn't exist. And then they say obstruction. And how could there be obstruction on firing Comey? When the man who's in charge of it wrote a letter that was far stronger than anything I would have written.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was in charge -- Deputy Rosenstein. He wrote a letter that's far stronger than even what I say.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And here's another thing. A friend of mine brought this up the other day. Comey. Comey has proven to be a liar and a leaker.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Proven. He tries to act like a choir boy. What he did with Hillary Clinton is outrageous. He saved her life, because all of those charges -- I call it "Comey one
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She should have been taken out of the campaign and been on trial.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He didn't do that. He saved her life. But here's the way you look at Comey. Everybody hated Comey, and Comey -- by the way, the FBI, say what you want, go back to look at the day around Hillary -- the FBI was in turmoil.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everybody hated Comey. The Democrats wanted him fired. Everybody wanted him out. You look at what Schumer said about him, you look at what everybody said.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> As soon as I fired him they said, "oh
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So there's no -- you have a no-crime that was created, you have a phony crime and then they talk about obstruction. And how can they talk about obstruction when I was the most open person, in history, in terms of -- there's never been a paper we didn't give them, there's never been a question we didn't answer.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, I could of done it differently. I've been, you know, pretty successful in the courts over the years, I've been a very successful person, you can check -- USA Today said, "he does great in the courts
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> Sorry to interrupt. We have to -- you're late for your meeting. No, I know, finish this thought and then if -- I'd love to get like an infrastructure or tax question in before you guys go -- I know that was sort of the premise of the meeting. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They don't want to talk about that -- they don't want to talk about the biggest tax bill [Inaudible].
<Unidentnfied> <Positive> But, we just have about two minutes left, so -— you finish, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, all right, well we'll do as much as we can.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, just to finish, everybody wanted Comey fired. And then, when I fired, I never forget, when I fired, all these people that had just said, "You've got fire Comey""
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All you have to do is take a look, seriously -- take a look at all these people, they all wanted him fired. And the FBI was a mess. When he announced the Hillary Clinton fiasco where she was guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty and then where they did the interview with no tape recorder, with no swearing in, with no this, with no that -- you know the story.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But take a look at all of these people that became critics of my firing, they all wanted him fired. And they wanted him fired until I said, "he's fired."" But the deputy
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> So you're saying there was no obstruction, if Mueller asks you to come in and talk about it, would you --  [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Of course there was no obstruction -- excuse me. Of course there was no obstruction. But there was no crime. So now they're saying, could there be -- now, I haven't even heard that they're looking at obstruct -- I don't know that they're looking at obstruction.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But how can you -- I'm sorry, this is the most open dialogue ever, I've given everything, number one. That's not obstruction.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The other thing is, everybody wanted Comey fired. And, another thing, and this is just a few, Comey has proven to be a leaker and a liar and, if anything, I should get credit for firing him because it turned out I was right because many thing have been found out about Comey that -- I mean, I should be given credit for having great insight because many things have been found out about Comey that would never have been found out if I didn't fire him.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> [Inaudible] infrastructure [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But just so you understand...
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Oh, sorry.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...The deputy attorney general, who's in charge of the case, wanted -- all you have to do is read his letter. So that's --  there's no obstruction there.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> How about a welfare and a tax question real quick before we wrap it up?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, go ahead.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Yeah, let's finish on that and then you really do have to go, you've got a Roosevelt Room full of people waiting for you. So go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do?
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Yes, you do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, get me a list of those people.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Yes, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'll see the level of it. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do enjoy this, actually.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Yeah, this is fun, thank you for taking the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do ask you this, treat me fairly.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> We always do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We'll do it -- every month we'll do one of these. But -- because I do respect and I love and I think [WSJ editor in chief] Gerard [Baker] -- I always call him the most elegant debate -- I thought it was the best debate, maybe because I like that one good from my standpoint.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I thought he was very elegant. I always say, "You're the elegant host."""
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I went through some that weren't so elegant. But all I'm asking is one thing, you know what I'm saying, it's very easy, treat me fairly.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> We do.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> So I just want to be crystal clear about this, you're open to discussing comprehensive immigration reform, are you open to discussing a path to citizenship as part of that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ready? Comprehensive immigration reform is a far step from DACA. I am always open to discussing everything but that doesn't mean we're going to get anywhere close to getting it done.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd love to get something done if it's appropriate. But there's no -- I think we will get DACA, I really believe we're getting close to DACA and I'm dealing with some great people on the Democrat side. I'm dealing with some people that I really have gotten to like.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Who?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I really believe they have good intention. After we're finished with DACA, assuming that gets done, I would certainly be open to discussing -- you know, the comprehensive immigration. I don't know that we'll be able to make a deal on that one.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Got it. And so on this -- this welfare...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You understand what I mean.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Yes, I now -- I think we're nice and clear on that one.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So that's a very different -- very different topic.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Yeah, do you think welfare reform or infrastructure is more feasible?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I think we're going to start with infrastructure. We're very far down the line. Gary [Cohn] actually met with Elizabeth Warren yesterday and I heard, actually, had a very good conversation. My team met -- Gary, you had a whole group of people -- and they had a good conversation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We'll start with infrastructure and we'll see. If we do infrastructure I think that has to be bipartisan -- and I think it will be. I think we'll have a lot of Democrat support.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I think with welfare reform that will have to be bipartisan. You know, we only have a majority of one and unless we get more Republicans in the next election or the next two elections we won't be able to do that and as Republicans we're going to have to have a bipartisan.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So, if we do welfare reform it's going to have to be bipartisan.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> And just so we understand, what programs are welfare reform targets?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd rather talk to you about that later because honestly, we're doing infrastructure first; OK? We'll do that again.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Infrastructure -- would that be a trillion-dollar direct federal outlay? Or is that a public/private partnership?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's going to be a combination of public/private which is now the new hot topic. We'll be putting up approximately $200 billion. It could be as much as $1.8 trillion spent. We have many, many, wealthy countries, some of whom our country made wealthy, but we have many countries, any people that really want to put up tremendous amounts of money for the infrastructure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That gets it built faster, gets it built better, gets it built on time, on budget and the United States won't be putting up all of the money.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Where does the federal share come from?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The $200 billion?
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that's not a large amount. I mean -- think of this -- I hate to say it but it's not my fault and I did not want to go into Iraq, by the way. But as of two months ago we're into the Middle East for $7 trillion. We made a lot of headway in the Middle East, by the way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've knocked out ISIS and Syria and Iraq and all but --  and we're doing well in Afghanistan for the first time ever. But you'll see the results over the next three or four months like you won't believe.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> You're not talking about taking it out of the military budget?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, never out of the military. No -- no, no. Nothing comes out of the military. We're making the military strong, again.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Just the opposite -- we're building the military budget very substantially; you know that.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> I mean do you have to find cuts or is this new spending? Would you be willing to spend new money on this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. This will be -- this will be money that we will find. There's a lot of places to find $200 billion. There are not a lot of places to find $1.8 trillion.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I see Gary shaking his head, yes; correct? $200 billion sounds like a lot but relative to what we're talking about it's a number that we can easily handle.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Whereas again people will come in and put up vast amounts of money. They will supervise the projects, they will make sure they get built on time, on budget -- or below budget which is even better. And so, what we're talking about is about $200 billion. And, Gary, am I right when I say $1.7 trillion to $1.8 trillion?
<Gary Cohn> <Positive> Exactly right, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Approximately -- so it will be actually $1.8 trillion of investment in our infrastructure which will largely rebuild our infrastructure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That will include bridges, roadways, tunnels; it will include many things. One of the things we're doing separate of that will be air-traffic control. Our air-traffic control is from a different planet. It's horrible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a horrible mess.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Our air-traffic control doesn't work. They have spent billions and billions of dollars on it over the last seven years. Billions and it's worthless. They had many different contractors doing many different locations using all different computers and computer companies.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And when they hooked it up it didn't work. So, I'm good at that stuff -- we'll fix it.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> One last quick question.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> I just want to get a tax one in here too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The tax bill has turned out to be far greater than we ever anticipated.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Can you talk about it in a midterm framework here? Are you going to go out and sell this for the Republicans?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's selling itself, Michael. Michael, it's selling itself.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Do you plan to help in the midterms?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> One thing nobody anticipated was that these companies would come in and pay all of this money to the employees -- to millions and millions of employees. And AT&T started it, but it was picked up by Comcast and another one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Many are announcing today -- and the ones that aren't announcing you know what's happening? The employees are going, what about us? Did you forget us -- to the ones that -- that was never anticipated. That was just one of the many benefits. You know this bill -- and I said from the beginning this bill will be so good -- and the Democrats are very concerned. They're very concerned.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This bill has turned out to be even better than we thought. It's really having a big -- and I'm also hearing a lot of people are bringing money back in. You know, the $4 trillion that we're talking about or whatever it may be. Nobody even knows what it is, but it's a big number.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Just on the midterms, are there concrete steps that the administration is taking to make sure Russia doesn't interfere in the 2018 elections?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to be very careful. We're going to be very, very, careful about Russia -- and about anybody else, by the way.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> What are you doing to make sure?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We are absolutely -- at the appropriate time and first of all we're working on different solutions.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And as you know the last election was not affected in terms of votes -- and I think you do understand that everybody -- even the Democrats agree to that -- a lot of people don't write it. But we are looking at all sorts of failsafes and we are going to make sure that no country including Russia can have anything to do with the result of the midterms or any other election; OK? That's what our country is all about.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Thank you, guys, so much.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Thank you, [Inaudible]. Thank you, Mr. President.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Mr. President, do you expect Rex Tillerson to stay on?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, Rex and I are getting along very well.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> And Gary Cohn, and...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know, Gary, are you staying on?
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> Gary, are you staying?
<Gary Cohn> <Positive> Very happy. We were -- we're doing great things on the economy.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Well usually, it's -- the New Year mark is a time when -- when -- when there's --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I know it's the time. But look, hey, Gary may leave and Rex may leave but I don't anticipate it. I hope Gary stays and we'll see.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> H.R. -- H.R. McMaster?
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Guys, thank you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what? I like him. I like him. I like them all.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We'll find out. But people do leave. You guys may leave The Wall Street Journal, right?
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Thank you very, very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
