<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Mr. President, how are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very good.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> What a trip you had so far.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's been an incredible trip. Last night was really quite unbelievable with the queen because that is a great woman.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> You've watched, I believe, the coronation when you was 6 years old in 1953 with your mother. It was a big monarchist, your mother know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's true.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> And you watched that 66 years ago. And as I watched you last night I was thinking what would your mother have made of her little boy Donald, being the guest of honor at a state banquet at Buckingham Palace with the same queen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Now in her 90s, and you were there as president of United States. What would she have made of it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well she would have been very proud. She would have not -- never thought in terms of president because I never talked in terms of running for president. I decided to do it and I won. I said to a couple of people I think I'm going to do it. And then I said to my wife I think I'll give it a shot, she said, "You know you'll win." But I will say that my mother would have been very proud.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She was a tremendous fan of this country. And she was a -- she loves Scotland. She grew up in Stornoway. She left at 19 for New York. She met my father and they were married for..
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> And she loved the royals didn't she?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She loved the royals, she loved the queen. And I always noticed whenever anything was on about the queen she would watch. She was a big fan of this place.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Did you tell the queen?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I told her last night she was very honored, but my mother would always -- she just had great respect. She understood. My mother understand people very well. She knew people and she she got it right from the beginning. The queen is a great lady and my mother knew that.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Was that, in some ways, putting aside marriage, children, the personal stuff, was that perhaps the greatest experience of your life yesterday?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, I kept hearing, because I've been through some pretty big things, OK, and I kept hearing, I'd watch the news and see the news go on and they'd say, "He's never had to handle anything like this when he walks into that unbelievable room in Buckingham Palace and he sees everybody that's there and he looks at -- " The place is breathtaking.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> As you understand better than maybe almost anybody. And they said -- I was noticing people saying, "Will he be able to handle the moment?" I said, "Oh, I've had some pretty big moments." But I have to say, sitting there I understood what they meant. It was really something.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> So what is it like?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's right up there. I mean, I had an inauguration, which I have to say was spectacular. And we had a big election night win that was, you know, one of the great evenings and outside of the personal things.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> You and the queen seemed to have a natural rapport. She seems warm towards you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We had a great rapport. We had -- we had a conversation that lasted for an hour and a half nonstop.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Really? What did you talk about?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I think really we were -- Well I better not, I'm not going to say because --
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Any little hints.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- I hear that we are not supposed to do that. In fact I said to her, "Tell me about this, I promise I'll never tell anybody about it." So I'm not going to break my promise in one day.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> That's very kind. It's very unusual, if you don't mind me saying, well behaved last night. You seemed like you're on best behavior, as if the queen was somebody that you absolutely wanted to show maximum respect to.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I have great respect for her. And yes I think I was probably -- I think I'm on good behavior most of the time but certainly last night and I really got what, I usually call them the fake news media because oftentimes they are fake, but I really got what they were saying because when you walk in there the moment is very impressive, especially when you're walking in with the queen and she can walk as fast as I can but they didn't do it. She walked very slowly and you know the certain grain of music and then later on we had the bagpipes from Scotland and...
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> We gave you the full nine yards of the [Inaudible] pageantry.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think you gave -- Yes, I think so.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> You have been flirting with Emmanuel Macron, other leaders. Has this trip restored Britain as your No. 1 special relationship?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well it's always been right there and I've actually had a very good relationship with your prime minister, a lot of people don't know that. We've had a little bets but it's been very minor. And if you remember my last trip was really a very good relationship. But I have a good relationship with many of the leaders.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Prime Minister Rabi, very special, just got by. He invited me, as the only country, he invited me as representative of the United States and the first lady to be the only people at a special ceremony for the new emperor, which is the first in 202 years. You know it's a 3,000-year bloodline but it's the first time, where the emperor before death, abdicates.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Would you like to to have a 3,000-year bloodline?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it'll be great. I don't know what I'd be doing for the rest of it but I think it would be great but it was  a great thing in Japan. It was great. This was very, very [Inaudible]
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> I want to clarify one thing, you've been talking about, this Meghan Markle business.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Do you think Meghan Markle's nasty or no?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. You know the question was asked to me and I didn't know that she said anything bad about me. It sounds like she did and that's OK. I mean, hey join the crowd, right? You've heard about that too with yourself.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Of course.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know that, right? But it seems like she had and they said some of the things that she said. And it's actually on tape and I said, well I didn't know. She was nasty. I was referring to her. She's nasty. I said she was nasty about me and essentially I didn't know she was nasty about me. So I said -- but you know what, she's doing a good job I hope she enjoys her life.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> What do you think of her? She's American
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think she's very nice.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> She's an American princess.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Honestly, I don't know her. So I have to be honest, I don't know her. But it just shows you how terrible the news can be because if you read it, I'm sure you did, that was talking about nasty issues...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> [Inaudible] It is a little bit ambiguous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't mind clearing that up actually because you read it. I mean, they have the tape, they released a tape and CNN and some of the other phonies they went out and they -- they took the tape and they even tried to, you know, disgorge it from that. So what happened is they talked about nasty but we were talking about nasty she was nasty to me and that's OK for her to be nasty.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's not good for me to be nasty to her and I wasn't. And in fact I think she's doing very well.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Did you get a chance to talk to Prince Harry?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I did. I did. I congratulated him and I think he's a terrific guy. The royal family is really nice.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Did he say [Inaudible], 'Do you think my wife's nasty?"
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We didn't talk about it.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> You didn't?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was going to because it was so falsely put out there. And when you see that transcript and you see it it's the exact opposite of what they said. Did you look at the transcript?
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> I did.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do you understand what I'm saying?
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> It seems ambiguous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, I don't think it was ambiguous.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> I could see that if people couldn't work out if you meant what she'd said was nasty or whether you thought she was nasty.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> So now you clarify.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What she said was nasty, based on what they told me.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> But Harry -- Harry didn't have a problem with it. There were rumors that you didn't want to talk to you and and you didn't like him
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no, just the opposite. In fact, he spent a lot of time talking to Ivanka and talking to my family. I went up he was -- he couldn't have been nicer. Couldn't have been nicer.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> What do you think of him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he's great. How am I doing?
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> You're doing well. You've been very dignified and kind of [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But see I'm only doing that because I mean it. No I really think he's great. I think he's a wonderful -- I think the family. I spent time in...
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Did you meet Prince Charles?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I did. I spent time with Prince Charles. I spent time with -- I mean we've been -- this has been two days of intensive -- It's not work because I like it and I really like the royal family and of course headed by the queen who is a woman like few others.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Prince Charles is a very -- is very passionate about a lot of issues.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The environment.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> One of which is climate -- is climate change. I assume you talked about that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We did.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Did he manage to persuade you about the merits of the science on climate change.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well we're going to have a 15 minute chat. And it turned out to be an hour and a half and he did most of the talking and he is -- he is really into climate change and I think that's great. I mean, I want that, I like that.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Did you listen to him about it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I totally listened to him and he also talked about architecture he is very much involved and I've done this for years. I think the architecture was earlier but he very much loves architecture and important...
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> What did he say to you about climate change?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What he really wants and what he really feels warmly about is the future. He -- he wants to make sure future generations have climate that is good climate as opposed to a disaster, and I agree. I did mention a couple of things, I did say well the United States right now has among the cleanest climates there are, based on all statistics, and it's even getting better because I agree with that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I went the best water, the cleanest water. Crystal clean has to be crystal clean air.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> What people wanting -- What I am saying is what people want to hear from you about climate change is that you basically understand that almost every scientist looks into this, believes climate change is a very real and present danger and if we don't tackle it now and America has to lead the way along with China or India then we're going to be in serious trouble, do you accept that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well you know you just said it, China, India, Russia, many other nations they have not very good air, not very good water in the sense of pollution and cleanliness. If you go to certain cities, I'm not going to name cities but I can, if you go to certain cities you can't even breathe and now that air is going up. So if we have a clean -- in terms of a planet, we're talking about a very small, you know, very small distance between China and the U.S. or other countries.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> So I think there's mutual responsibility.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, there is.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> The question is do you -- do you personally believe in climate change?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I believe that there's a change in weather and I think it changes both ways. Don't forget it used to be called global warming, that wasn't working. Then it was called climate change, now it's actually called extreme weather because with extreme weather you can't miss. Look, we have a thing now with tornadoes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't remember tornadoes in the U.S. to the extent but then when you look back 40 years ago we had the worst tornado binge that we've ever had. In the 1890s we had our worst hurricanes and I would say we've had some very bad hurricanes.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Were you able to give Prince Charles any comfort that you as a United States president will take him seriously.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I was. Yeah. I think we had a great conversation and it was about, as you would call it, climate change. But yeah, I think we had a very, very good...
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Have he moved you a little bit?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll tell you what moved me is his passion for future generations. He's really not doing this for him. He's doing this for future generations. He really feels. And this is this is real. He believes that. He wants to have a world that's good for future generations.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Do you want -- you want that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I do too. And that really -- He doesn't need that. You know he is Prince Charles. He doesn't have to worry about future generations in theory unless he's a very good person who cares about people. And that's what impressed me maybe the most, his love for this world.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> We're here in the Churchill War Rooms. I mean a remarkable place.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> True.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Full of histories, where Churchill declared war on Germany.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> It's where he conducted most of the business of war. He spoke to President Roosevelt from a room here, a private-secret restaurant.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> How do you feel being here in this center of power. This is the generator, the power, the [Inaudible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's incredible because I'm a big fan of Winston Churchill and I studied Winston Churchill and I said, "Where did you make all the phone calls to FDR, to Roosevelt, and President Roosevelt?" And they were showing me. Here's where he made that call. He is -- you know they have everything documented.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> How did that make you feel to think that could have been you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well it's just an awesome responsibility. I will say being president of the United States, even the way they treated me, I think I have a very good relationship with the people in the United Kingdom. But is it me or is it the country, our country loves your country. I love your country.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> You were half British aren't you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am half. I've been -- if you think about it, right? And...
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> And do you see similarities in yourself to Winston Churchill.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well if I ever said that I would be ridiculed all along. He is a great gentleman. I would certainly like to see similarities but I can't say that but...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> You didn't see any, really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look. He -- What he did better than...
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Nobody's -- is swashbuckling style.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, whatever.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> His fearlessness. He was polarizing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let's just...
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Just see a bit of Winston in you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What I see with him is he was able to handle pressure very well. If you think about a man that handle pressure, he was being bombed, it was over. Hitler was unstoppable at the time. I mean, people forget that at that time Hitler was virtually unstoppable he was going through countries like cheese and he was out there calling Roosevelt, "You gotta get in, you gotta get in.", and then the big moment was Pearl Harbor.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In fact, I spoke to Prime Minister Abe the other night, I said, "You know, Pearl Harbor actually got us into the war indirectly and we helped Britain." That's when we came in. And Churchill probably knew that before anybody -- Churchill when he heard about Pearl Harbor he said, "Now they're coming into the war finally.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So there was a big moment.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> He had an American mother, you have -- you had a British mother and that way you had a link.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It evens out.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It evens out. Now, he was a great man and he was a man that reacted so well under the gun, under a fire, under pressure, and there aren't many people like that. I respect that greatly.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Is he a hero of yours?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so, yeah. I mean, I never like to have heroes. I like to respect people. But certainly he would be right up there. He would be somebody that you would most respect. He would certainly be a hero.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Who is the American president you'd most identify with?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I always liked Ronald Reagan. I liked him for everything, other than, maybe, trade. I thought trade could have -- It just didn't seem to be enough of a focus and that was when we started doing foolish trade deals, that generation that it really sort of began then. But I thought he had a great way about him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> His way was incredible. His -- his manner, his bedside manner. That say about a doctor has a great bedside manner. Some doctors do and most of them don't. He had a great  bedside manner.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> How's your bedside manner?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I actually think it's a lot better than people would think. We have tremendous support. I just found out we have 94% support in the Republican Party that's higher. Ronald Reagan was the highest at 86 and we have 94%. It just came out of approval, the approval rating.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> The economy is doing well in America.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The economy is doing great.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Our economy is pretty much stalling in this country because of his ongoing Brexit fiasco as many people see it. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, apparently wanted to see you declined that kind invitation and you spend the most of today shouting and screaming about you and protesting and saying how awful you are.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> There is a chance if this goes wrong for the Conservative Party in the next few months he could end up prime minister. Could you imagine actually doing a trade deal with Britain with someone like Jeremy Corbyn as a leader?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's always -- it's always possible. Anything's possible. I don't know. He wanted to meet. It was very tough to meet and probably inappropriate to meet, to be honest with you. A lot of things are happening right now with respect to our country and your country, my country ,and let's call him almost the same because I feel that way it's really a tremendous relationship.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I don't think it is appropriate to meet him but I would, I certainly would. I'd have no problem with it. I think it's a long shot when you say that, you know, it's not -- I don't think it's going to happen. You have a lot...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Notably there seems to me would allow Britain to effectively sell the NHS as part of a trade deal. Would you as the American president see that as a deal breaker if none of the NHS was on the table?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't see it being on the table. Somebody asked me a question today and I say everything's up for negotiation because everything is, but I don't see that being. That's something that I would not consider part of trade. That's not trade.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Who do you think is going to win the leadership contest Boris?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, yeah, Boris, who's -- who's doing well. I think Jeremy is doing well. I don't know too many of them but those two have a lot of respect for.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Michael Gove?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know him. I met him last night at the dinner for the first time. I thought he was very good. You have a lot of good people running. I will say this, your next prime minister, whoever it may be, is going to be a very important. You have a very interesting moment in your country's history. Your next -- and I was saying to the Queen last night, the choice of your next prime minister is a very important choice.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You really have to get it.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Prince Charles once told us is veering pro Brexit now. Did he give you that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He really is -- He really wants to be and he's openly non-political. The family is non-political. They want to be, they have to be, I think they have to be. I think it's pretty hard for them to go political, right? But he feels we have a lot of -- we have a lot of good choices. I do too. I think you really do have a lot of good choices.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's very important that you get it right.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> The the D-Day commemoration this week is hugely important for our -- both our countries and for all allied forces who took part that day. What kind of debt do you think we owe the people who fought on the beaches of Normandy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the ultimate debt that was, you know, I was looking at some of these statistics that may have been the greatest battle ever in history. You know you hear so much about different battles not to mention any because they're all important, especially when so many people died in so many of them but there are those that say that was the greatest battle of them all.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And that was something really incredible and being there is going to be -- being at that site will be very interesting
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> You were not able to serve in Vietnam because of a bone spurs condition in your feet. Do you wish you'd been able to serve? Would you like to serve your country?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I was never a fan of that war. I'll be honest with you, I thought it was a terrible war. I thought it was very far away. Nobody ever, you know, you're talking about Vietnam and at that time nobody ever heard of the country. Today they're doing very well, in fact on trade they are brutal. They're very brutal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're great negotiators, they're great business people but nobody heard of Vietnam and I say, "What are we doing? So many people dying. What is happening over there?" So I was never a fan. This isn't like I'm fighting against Nazi Germany, I'm fighting -- We're fighting against Hitler. And I was like a lot of people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wasn't out in the streets marching. I wasn't saying, you know, "I'm going to move to Canada.", which a lot of people did, but no I was not a fan of that war. That war was not something I should've been involved.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Would you like to serve generally [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would not have minded that at all, I would have been honored but I think I make up for it right now. I -- look $700 billionI gave last year and then this year $716 billion. And I think I'm making up for it rapidly because we're rebuilding our military at a level that it's never seen before.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Want to sort of ask you about your -- your military. Is -- this week you tweeted your support for the LGBT community around the world where they're being persecuted or exclude.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's terrible.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Which does prompt the obvious question if you feel that protective of the LGBT community, why did you feel the need to ban transgender people from serving in the U.S. military?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because they take massive amounts of drugs, they have to. And also -- and you're not allowed to take drugs. You're in the military you're not allowed to take any drugs, you take an aspirin. And they have to after the operation. They have to, they have no choice, they have to. And you would actually have to break rules and regulations in order to have that.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> The cost of the medication is minuscule compared to the overall budget, right? But you said that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Yeah, but you also had the...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> The U.S. military spends a lot more money, for example, on giving viagra to service men and women, or service men.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't know that they do.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Than it does -- than it does actual medical bills for transgender people. And so it just seems to me an unnecessary thing for a guy who wants to be supportive of LGBT rights and the community around the world that you've taken this action.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well it is what it is.. Look, massive amounts. And also, people were going in and then asking for the operation and the operation is $200,000, $250,000 and getting the operation the recovery period is long and they have to take large amounts of drugs after that for whatever reason, but large amounts, and that's not the way it is. I mean, you can't do that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I said, yeah, when it came time to make a decision on that, and because of the drugs, and also because of the cost of the operation and I'm -- people were going in...
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Some transgender people in the U.S. military have one serious gallantry awards.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> What do you feel about?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I'm proud of them. I'm proud of them. I think it's great. But you have to have a standard and you have to stick by that standard and we have a great military and I want to keep it that way and maybe they'd be phenomenal. I think they probably would be. But again you have very strict rules and regulations on drugs and prescription drugs and all of these different things and they blow it out of the water.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Good points. Just to wrap up, Mr. President, if I may. Lot of war drums beating about Iran. Iran remains a huge issue for you and your administration. What is the situation there and are you considering military action?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So Iran is a place that was extremely hostile when I first came into office they were in 14 different states between Yemen, Syria, and then many other battle zones. They were behind terrorism in lots of different places. They were a terrorist nation, No. 1 in the world at that time, and probably maybe are today, and they were a funder of terrorism.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> President Obama made a deal, the Iran nuclear deal, which was a terrible deal because it was a short-term deal, didn't do the trick. Paid $150 billion, paid $1.8 billion in cash, if you can believe it, in cash. And I was very much against that. I was very much against the deal. I terminated the deal and Iran is a much different country today.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Do you think you will need to take military action?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There's always a chance. Do I want to? No. I'd rather not. But there's always a chance.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> And Churchill --Churchill said he always preferred to George all [Sp] to war. You have shown that you're prepared to George all [Sp] with traditional American enemies.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Vladimir Putin in Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure. Sure.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Kim Jong-un in North Korea. Are you prepared if it comes to it to George or with President Rouhani of Iran?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You're talking about talk?
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah of course. I'd much rather talk.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> You would sit down with him and have a -- have a chat?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure. Sure. And I said that and he said that. He said the other day. He said I'm not looking to go to war with the United States. The only thing is we can't let them have nuclear weapons. I know so much about nuclear weapons. Don't forget, I'm the one that gets trained and has to study this as president.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Have you thought about the moment that you...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but I see the damage done. I see the horrible damage done. No, no. I don't want them [Inaudible]
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> I'm going to ask you, I mean, you've had to consider the reality as the U.S. president of actually pressing the nuclear button. Very few people have that responsibility.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right. It's a tremendous response.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> What do you feel about that responsibility?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's a terrible responsibility but it's a responsibility I'm prepared to handle. I just...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Churchill sat in these very rooms and had to declare war on Germany. Have you thought about the moment if you had to declare war what that would feel like?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to have to think about it. But there may be a time when I will have to think about it but I will tell you, Churchill didn't have to worry so much about the nuclear. That was early on. There was wasn't so far down the road, when you think about it. But he was very brave and he did a lot of great move and he was -- I don't think he was given credit certainly after what happened.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was given credit later on after death. Much more so than he was after what he did in the war, which is always the problem. I say maybe sometimes you're better off tooting your own horn. I don't think he was given the proper credit certainly during his life. But the nuclear has to be solved. The nuclear is too big a problem it has to be solved.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> On a personal thing, I know Senator John McCain well. I liked him, I respected him. I quite enjoyed your battle with him when he was alive. You would give it to him, he gave it to you and it went on. It seems a little beneath you, if you don't mind me saying, that now he's dead you're carrying on attacking him.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Is it not time to let it go?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't attack him. People ask me like you're asking me. I didn't bring his name up, you did.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You brought his name up, John McCain. So I'm not attacking him at all. I don't think about him. I was not a fan. I didn't like what he did to health care. I didn't like how he handled the veterans because I got him choice. He was always unable, he was on committees that he could've done...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> But he's dead as frozen. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. Excuse me but, Piers, you're asking me a question.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you don't ask me about John McCain I would never talk to him.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> I agree.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Somebody asked me the same question the other day.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> But I'm asking because you know the battleship thing last week, where you know...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I knew nothing about that.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> I'm not --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not even sure it happened.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> I'm not doubting you at all. I'm just saying that somebody clearly said something and it just seems a bit preposterous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But here's the thing, I'm not even sure that -- first of all, I didn't know anything about it, but I'm not even sure it happened. Somebody said they're painting the ship and they had tarpaulins and they're painting the ship and they have tarpaulins all over the place. I have no idea if it happened or not.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hear it's fake news but maybe it is, maybe it isn't. But again, I don't talk about John McCain unless somebody asks me about him.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Final question. 2020 is looming.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Next election. The economy is doing well in United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Most presidents, who are incumbent presidents, who run again on a good economy get re-elected. Are you confident of winning and do you see anybody, Joe Biden is the clear favorite front runner on the Democrat side, do you see any Democrat that you think potentially might cause you problems and beat you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I'm running on maybe the greatest economy we've ever had. I'm in the midst of a couple of trade negotiations, which I think are going to work out very successfully because we have the cards, I have all the cards, you know with the piggy bank, with a bank that everyone wants to steal from and rob, and when you have that, you have the cards.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I do have the cards and I have the cards on Mexico, cleaning up the country, their country so that we don't have the onslaught of millions of people trying to rush our border. So we have a lot of things that I'm working on. They're good things I didn't have to work on and I could have been...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Do you see any Democrat that you're worried about?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't see anybody that I would -- This is not -- There is no Winston Churchill in the group. Let me put it that way.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> You don't see Joe Biden as the new Winston Churchill.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think that would be a big upset if he was, I tell you. That would be a --that would be a big surprise to a lot of people. No, there's nobody that I see that should be able to win. I -- look, I'm running on the best economy in our history. I've rebuilt our military, I knocked out ISIS, you know, I took it out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That doesn't mean people aren't coming around that they're going to blow up their circus because they're crazy. These are crazy people. But when I took over ISIS was all over the place. Now we've taken back 100% of the caliphate. Nobody thought that was possible to do it that quickly. We have an incredible military.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> One thing you also did. I want to pay you credit for this, because when we spoke in Davos after the Las Vegas mass shooting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Right.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> I brought up the issue of bump fire stock and why it was legal when it is used to convert legal weapons to illegal ones. And you did ban bump fire stock.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I ended it. That's right.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> I don't think you got enough credit for that. There's just been another massacre in Virginia Beach, where the shooter used a silencer. What is your view of silencers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't like it.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Would you like to see those back?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I'd like to think about it. I mean, nobody's talked about silencers very much. I did talk about the bump stock and we had it banned and we're looking at that. I'm going to seriously look at it. I don't love the idea of it. I don't like the idea. What's happening is crazy. It's crazy what's going on with schools and not only in our country, I mean, not only in our country but again...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> But America has this particular issue with gun violence. You and I discussed this for years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure, we have.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> There's been 150 mass shootings in America this year alone.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> You know, in Britain we have 35 gun deaths a year. In America, today, there'll be 85. Tomorrow 85 and so on.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But in London you have...
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> What can you do to change the culture?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But Piers, in London you have stabbings all over.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I read an article where everyone's being stabbed.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> We've had about 50 of stabbings. We've had 50 of murders with knives this year in London.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well they said -- they said your hospital is a sea of blood all over the floors.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> We have a big prob- I'm not going to deny it but probably a knife crime.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a sea of blood and they don't have [Inaudible].
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> What do you think you can do as a president though to change the mindset about gun violence?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Just talk about it. You have to talk about it. But Piers, when somebody has a gun illegally and nobody else has a gun because the laws are that you can't have a gun those people are gone, they have no choice. They have no chance. They have no chance. It's a very tough subject. But the bad guys are not getting rid of their guns, pretty much everybody agrees with that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The people that obey the laws, if there was a law passed, they get rid -- Those people are sitting ducks. You know the one I think about the most is Paris, where there are so many people killed were that wacky group of people, went into the nightclub and they just boom, boom, boom, and they killed like tremendous numbers of people horribly injured, so many were still in the hospital, I read the other day.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but if we had -- if there was a gun on the other side...
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If one or two or three of those people had a gun...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Here's my problem with that argument -- Here's my problem with that argument, more people were shot dead in America that week than have died from guns in Paris since the Second World War.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm just telling you...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> The stats are so against that argument, aren't they?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well what are you going to do? You're going to take the guns away from hunters, you have hunters.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> No, I think you can have special licenses for hunters.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> And actually I sort of subscribe to the view of the right to bear arms allowing someone to have a handgun or something of a home thing. I don't understand, never have understood why anyone in America needs a semiautomatic AR-15 assault rifle at home. Why do they need it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well a lot of them use it for entertainment. They do. I mean, it's really...
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> The gun's entertainment?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> For some people it's entertainment. They go out and they shoot and they go to ranges and they have a tremendous amount of fun.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Sport shooting and specific hunting with licenses, I get that. What I don't get is the need. This guy in Vegas had 13 at AR-15 assault rifles. He bought 52 guns in one year.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he was just sick. And if it wasn't guns he would have done bombs or he would have done something else. He was actually a pretty smart guy. He was supposedly a good successful gambler and there's almost no such thing as a successful gambler. And he went out and he -- what he did was incredible. But he would've done...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> But you did something. The bump fire -- Mr. President, to give you credit on that again, you did get bump fire stopped fire.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He used the bump stock.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> You got it back.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> And that will make a difference. I urge you to carry on doing something on guns.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK. Thank you.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Because I think it would be great if the American gun violence could be reduced in some way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> I think we would both agree on that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We do.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> I'd like to end the interview. We have a little gift for you because we're in the Churchill rooms...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> This is where Britain's greatest leader fought the war and he used to wear these famous hats from the hat maker Lock.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's beautiful.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> And so we've had one made for you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like it.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> This is a Churchill hat. Exactly in the style he used to wear it. We've had it monogrammed with D.J.T.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like it.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> And on behalf of Good Morning Britain and ITV, we would like to present you with a Churchill hat.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Piers. It's -- I never knew that kind of sensibility. That's so beautiful. Are you allowed to do this? He didn't do that.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Yeah, I think you can do that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He didn't do that. And he definitely didn't do that,right? I know that. Wow.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Do you want to try it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll try it. You know, right, because the one thing I proved by being a politician, it is my hair. They would've found out a long time ago.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Did you think you or Boris Johnson has the best hair.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know but I do think he's a good person. I think it's gonna be a very...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Who's the British Trump? Is it Boris or Nigel Farage?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I guess -- I guess, well Nigel's another one. I like Nigel.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Who's the British Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to say, I don't want to destroy...
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Give me one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to destroy anybody's career.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> If you had a...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But they're good people. They're good people. And Jeremy's very good. I've gotten to know Jeremy.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Jeremy Hunt [Inaudible]. You like Jeremy. You mentioned him a few times.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. No, I think Jeremy is very good. Let me try this on.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Please try it on, that'll be great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's a little big.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> That's -- We can get that. I mean, that's fantastic.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We'll see how that looks. I think -- I think Churchill...
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> So Winston Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think -- I think Winston looked much better.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Mr. President it's great to see you. Congratulations on a very successful trip.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> And I wish you all the best at the D-Day commemoration. It was very important for both of us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Piers. Appreciate it.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Great to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great to be with you. Thank you.
<Jenna Browder> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you so much for having us on Air Force One.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you both. Thank you both.
<Jenna Browder> <Negative> First question: we're just a few days away from the midterms. How are you feeling and what do you think about this so-called Blue Wave?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think the Blue Wave is dead, frankly, and I think we're doing very well. It looks like we're going to win the Senate, which is very important. That's why I'm here tonight, and we're going to Florida, where we have a great gubernatorial candidate, and a great Senate candidate and Rick Scott for the Senate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Ron DeSantis for governor. And, I think we're doing very well. There's a lot of feeling about the horrors of the illegal immigration problem, where people think they're just going to come into our country and take over our country, and it's just not going to happen. We're not going to let that happen. But the Democrats want to let that happen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's crazy. So, we're doing very well, and the numbers reflected, as you know, and I think we can do -- I think we'll win the Senate. I think we're going to do well in the House.
<David Brody> <Negative> Mr. President, what about Nancy Pelosi's comments? She's already kind of spiking the football with "we will win, we will win." What do you make of some of that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I haven't seen her comments. I know that -- look, she's been losing for a long time, so you know, she would like to win. If you go by history -- but nobody's ever had an economy like I produced. We have an economy that's the best it's ever been. We have probably the greatest economy we've ever had in this country, with jobs and everything else.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But she's been saying she's going to win for a long time. She hasn't been doing too well. We'll see what happens. I think we're going to do very well in the House also.
<Jenna Browder> <Negative> Have you thought much about after the midterms? What's kind of top of your mind?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it depends on what happens. If we win the midterms, we're going to go on to even greater things. And if for some reason we don't, if we, for instance, if we lose the House, it's going to be a different kind of a game. But it can be a very good game.
<David Brody> <Negative> What about -- we've heard so much about hostility and incivility and the media has been on you as -- this just in: the media has been on you. What kind of role do you believe that you play? Do you feel that you have any responsibility in this whatsoever?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I heard the media's extremely unfair. It has been from the time I announced. And a lot of that has to do with the fact that I'm Republican and I'm conservative, for many other reasons, and probably #metoo. But I will say, the media, if you look at yesterday, I went to Pittsburgh. I was treated so well with the first lady.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We were treated so well. It was sad, obviously a very solemn -but it was so instructive, so beautiful. The rabbi was great. We had such a great day. We met the first responders. The -- we met the SWAT team. We met some very brave people in the hospital. We went over to the temple, went into the temple. It was so beautiful.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And there was a small group of protesters, but they were very far away, so we didn't get to see them or hear them. They were very far away. It was a very small group. They tried to make it like it was a big group. It was, maybe a hundred people, maybe less. And we came home, and I thought it was actually a beautiful day.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the media just absolutely, you know, went after me it was the most incredible thing. There was so violent and vicious. All of the news: ABC, CBS, NBC. CNN, I don't even watch, but I assume, you know, I know -- I'm sure, it's with CNN, but because, they're just, you know, automatically fake. But it was really fake news.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We had a great day. It was -- it was so respectful of the Office of President. And if you got home, and if you read The New York Times or The Washington Post, or if you saw any of the networks, you would say it was violence. It was -- it was riots. I mean, it was the most incredible thing I've ever seen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And everybody that was on that trip agreed with us. It was so wrong what they did, it was so phony. And I think that phony news, fake news, when you see the kind of things happen, like happened yesterday where Pittsburgh was so beautiful. Went to the hospital, they didn't even cover it, and they didn't have to cover it. But it was -- it was a great thing to meet these warriors, they're really warriors who did a phenomenal job where it could have been even worse, could have been much worse.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They did such a great job. They don't even cover it. All they did were say protesters, protesters. And the protesters were blocks away and it was a very small group -- I know protests -- it was a very small group of protests. But if you read this morning's New York Times or Washington Post or saw the networks, you would say it was World War 3. It's really disgraceful.
<Jenna Browder> <Positive> There -- there are people, kind of following up on that, who like to call you anti-Semitic, who like to call you a racist, Mr. President. What would you say to these people?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know the word racist is used about every Republican that's winning. Any time a Republican is leading, they take out the R word, the racist word, and I'm not anti-immigrant at all. I'm all for people coming into the country legally, and people based on merit. But when you see a caravan that's pouring up to our country with thousands of people, maybe 10,000 people now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then you see the violence that was caused by a second caravan that's forming on the northern Mexico side, where you look at what's going -- Guatemala and Honduras, and you look at the violence, and people being hurt. Mexican soldiers being hurt and police. They're throwing rocks in their face. Look, we're not going to let them come into our country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have 10, and we might even go up to 15,000 soldiers on our border. We are building a wall in its own way. We're putting up walls and barbed wire, and when you look at what we're doing, they're just not coming into our country. They might as well go back now. But take a look at the violence that they've created down there, the level of -- of I mean these are not -- these are not angels, as you would say. These are not angels.
<David Brody> <Negative> You were -- you say you're not going to let him into the country. What is this about tent cities? And -- that could be a tricky situation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we're going to build housing -- obviously it has to be built very fast. And we're going to give them better housing than many of them have. We're going to hold them. We are not going to release them. We're going to hold them until their deportation hearing goes and their asylum hearings.
<David Brody> <Negative> No catch and release?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, we're not we're not going to do catch and release Catch and release is no good. Obama proved that. President Obama proved that. Catch and release is no good, and we've got it down to a very good system, and we're going to be very strong on it. We're not going to be releasing people into our country that never show up for their court case.
<Jenna Browder> <Positive> I want to ask you about the African-American vote, Mr. President, and Kanye West coming out and saying that he's getting out of politics. What did you make of that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I've a very good relationship with Kanye. In fact, one of my people spoke of just a little while ago. Kanye is very happy with me, as he tells me, and I think we have a very good relationship. I think I'm doing great with the African-American vote, because we have the best unemployment numbers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you look at our unemployment numbers that just came out again, they're the best in the history of our country, for African-Americans and frankly, for Asians and for Hispanics. They're the best ever in our country. Best in 65 years for women. So, I think when people see that I think, I'm doing very well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You've seen the African-American numbers. You've seen the Hispanic numbers. Look, I'm strong on the border, but you know who wants that more than anybody else? Hispanics that are living in our country.
<David Brody> <Positive> Real quick, on immigration, one last question. What about the critics who say, look you're just doing all of this for political, you know, to gin up the base, and everything. What -- what's the answer to that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, if I am, I've been doing it for a long time, because I've been on this issue for a long time. Ever since you've known me.
<David Brody> <Positive> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And now we have a chance to do something about it. The problem we have is we have no Democrat votes. We need Democrat votes in order to pass bills, and, you know, because we have a very tiny, little majority. We'll see what that is. But now we have another election coming up. We need Republicans, because the Democrats will give us no votes on anything.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They don't mind open borders. They don't mind crime, because open borders mean crime. They don't mind crime. They don't want to take care of our military. They don't want to take care of our vets. And that's where we are. But we have no votes on immigration for, you know, with the Democrats and we can't let that happen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I've been very strong on immigration, David, as you know, right from the beginning. Right from the first time you saw me.
<David Brody> <Positive> Okay, well I guess I wanted to ask you about the evangelicals. I know you love the evangelicals. We've talked about that. 2016, they showed up in spades for you. If they don't do it this time, then there could be a much different outcome. Are you in agreement with that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they're going to show up for me, because nobody has done more for Christians, or evangelicals, or frankly, religion than I have. You see all the things that we've passed, including the Johnson Amendment, and so many things that we've nullified. Nobody has done more than we have. Mexico City, take a look at that.
<David Brody> <Neutral> The embassy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Things -- things that, frankly, until Ronald Reagan, I mean nobody -- nobody did anything. So, I know they're very happy with me. We've seen them very happy. The question is whether or not they're going to go out and vote when I'm not running. I have no doubt they're going to be there in '20. I hope they're going to be there now, because it'll be a lot easier if they are, a lot better.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, many of the things that we passed to make it good for Christians and Evangelicals and so many others.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at any religion you really talk about. So many of those things can be terminated. You know -- it's all fragile. You put the wrong people in office, and the evangelicals, all of a sudden, they're going to end up losing a lot of the things, maybe all of the things, that I gave them, and got for them and fought for them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They've been tremendous supporters. I love 'em. I think they love me. I think they understand me. They've been great. We've had great support.
<Jenna Browder> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you so much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Thank you, Jenna. Thank you.
<Miranda Combs> <Negative> There's no one in this rally that hasn't been affected by the drug epidemic. Here in Kentucky, we started in more of a holistic approach, and I noticed you're doing that on a federal level too --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<Miranda Combs> <Negative> -- by -- by adding all the cabinets in. Talk a little bit about that and the importance of that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We are, and we just got $6 billion approved. That's a lot of money, and we're going to do another six billion for next season toward the opioid problem, and the drug problem. We're building a wall. It started already, and we're going to stop a lot of the drugs from coming in.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not only that, human trafficking, so much is coming, it's ridiculous, and we're very much into fixing -- I mean, I'd like to say totally eliminating, but sometimes that's awfully difficult to say -- but fixing the drug problem -- you know it's down about 15 percent, and the opioid distribution is down more than 15 percent. So we're working very hard. We have a lot of money coming at it, and we have to. We can't play around with it.
<Miranda Combs> <Negative> No, because a lot of people in Kentucky feel like we've lost a generation. Even more, industry won't come here, because no one can pass the drug test. It's that bad down in southern Kentucky specifically.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know. Kentucky has a big problem. There are a few states that really have a problem. But, I will say with all of that, Kentucky's job numbers are the best they've ever had. But, we have to try and help these people. They have a real problem. We have to try and help them, and we're sending a lot of money this way -- you have a great governor -- and we're sending a lot of money this way, and it's going to be spent wisely.
<Miranda Combs> <Negative> This is -- speaking of the governor. You guys are buddies. How did that start? Just on a personal level?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what? He was a businessman, very successful. I was a businessman, very successful, and somehow I got to know him. I liked him. You have your best numbers that you've ever had in the state, between the two of us, and he's really a terrific guy. He loves the state. He'll do what's not politically popular in order to make the state good for a long time. He's a terrific guy, and we're very proud of him. Matt Bevin, he's doing a fantastic job.
<Miranda Combs> <Positive> And why important for you to come down and support Andy Barr today?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Andy has been a warrior for us. He helped with tax cuts. He helps with regulations, all of the regulations that we've cut. He helps with everything -- right-to-try. You know what right-to-try is? That's an incredible thing, that when people are very sick, terminally ill, they're allowed to use medicines that are in the pipeline, but not approved. This didn't happen for 44 years. They've been trying to get it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Andy has been an incredible warrior. And, I just felt I wanted to make sure Andy's fine, because, you know, it's a tight race. His opponent is never going to vote for -- she's never going to help with the MAGA, which is make America great again. And Andy Barr is there every single time. So, I said, I will come down to Kentucky -- First, of all, I love Kentucky. You know, I had very good luck in this state. We won to so much, it was ridiculous right?
<Miranda Combs> <Positive> 15 percent just in this district, right?
<Miranda Combs> <Positive> Yeah, I think it's 15 percent, or more. But, Andy is spectacular and I'm here to support Andy Barr.
<Miranda Combs> <Positive> What is it like to see the people lined up on the streets like a parade?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's pretty incredible outside, right? But, it's -- and it's like, that in all fairness, it was like that in Missouri, in West Virginia, and every place we've been. We've been to, I guess, 13, 14 places, and it's been like that almost from the beginning when I announced. It's been this tremendous spirit, and we're fulfilling what we said.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, we very much want to do great for the country. I didn't need this, but I love doing it. I love doing it. Today, we brought home Pastor Brunson, as you know, from Turkey. He was going to be there for 35 years. We got him out, and we got him out. We would not pay ransoms or anything else, because that creates a terrible precedent. And he came out, he's an incredible man. We saw him in the White House. I was just -- I just left the White House a little while ago, with his beautiful family, and he's happy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But he would have been in there for 35 years, and a great Christian pastor, great person, and what happened to him was very unfor -- but we got them out. So it's a big celebration day.
<Miranda Combs> <Positive> A pleasure. Thank you so much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> During what seemed an interminable campaign, a divided country found all kinds of ways to describe Donald Trump – visionary businessman, vulgar self-promoter, political neophyte.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> But after Tuesday, for all Americans, there's only one description that counts: president-elect.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Since the election, demonstrations against him have broken out in over a dozen cities across the country. And people on both sides are on edge.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> What we discovered in Mr. Trump's first television interview as president-elect, was that some of his signature issues at the heart of his campaign were not meant to be taken literally, but as opening bids for negotiation.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Tonight, you will also hear from his family about whether they'll play roles in a Trump presidency.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Well, congratulations, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> You're president-elect.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> How surprised were you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I really felt we were doing well. I was on a string of about 21 straight days of speeches, sometimes many a day and the last two days I really -- I really had a pretty wild time. I did six speeches and then I did seven and --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> But everyone thought you were going to lose.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know, I did my final speech in Michigan at 1:00 in the morning and we had 31,000 people, many people outside of the arena. And I felt -- when I left, I said, "How are we gonna lose?" We set it up a day before. And we had all of these people. And it was literally at 1:00 in the morning and I said, "This doesn't look like second place." So we were really happy, I mean, it was -- these are great people.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> On election night, I heard you went completely silent. Was it a sort of realization of the enormity of this thing for you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so, it's enormous. I've done a lotta big things, I've never done anything like this. It is so big, it is so -- it's so enormous, it's so amazing.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> It kind of just took your breath away? Couldn't talk?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A li -- a little bit, a little bit. And I think -- I realized that this is a whole different life for me now.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Hillary called you. Tell us about that phone call.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So Hillary called and it was a lovely call and it was a tough call for her, I mean, I can imagine. Tougher for her than it would have been for me. And for me, it would have been very, very difficult. She couldn't have been nicer. She just said, "Congratulations, Donald, well done." And I said, "I want to thank you very much, you were a great competitor." She is very strong and very smart.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> What about Bill Clinton? Did you talk to him?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He did, he called the next day.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Really? What did he say?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He actually called last night.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> What did he say?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he -- he couldn't have been more gracious. He said it was an amazing run. One of the most amazing he's ever seen.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> He said that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was very, very -- really, very nice.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> It was a pretty nasty campaign. Do you regret any of the things you said about her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it was a double-side nasty.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean they were tough and I was tough and -- do I regret? I mean, I'm sitting here with you now and we're gonna do a great job for the country. We're going to make America great again, I mean, that's what -- it -- it began with that and that's where we are right now. There are so many --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> So no -- no regrets about --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can't regret. No -- I wish it were softer, I wish it were nicer, I wish maybe even it was more on policy, or whatever you want to say. But -- but I will say that -- it really -- it really is something that I'm very proud of I mean it was a tremendous campaign.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Can we talk about yesterday with President Obama?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> 90 minutes. You were scheduled for what? 15?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> 15 max. [Barack Obama: We talked about foreign policy, we talked about domestic policy.]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This was just going to be a quick little chat and it lasted close to an hour and a half. And it could have gone on for four hours. I mean it was -- just -- in fact, it was almost hard breaking it up because we had so many things to say. And he told me -- the good things and the bad things, there are things that are tough right now --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Like what?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well…
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Give us some meat.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look I don't want to divulge, but we talked about the Middle East, that's tough. It's a tough situation. I wanted to get his full view and I got his, you know I got a good part of his view.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Uh-huh.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I like having that because I'm going to be inheriting that in a short period of time. I found him to be terrific. I found him to be -- very smart and very nice. Great sense of humor, as much as you can have a sense of humor talking about tough subjects, but we were talking about some pretty tough subjects.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> –and we were talking about some victories, also, some things that -- that he feels very good about. But --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Like --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, what I really wanted to focus on was -- the Middle East, North Korea, Obamacare is tough. You know, healthcare is a tough situation.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Oh, I bet he asked you not to undo it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he didn't ask me, no, he told me -- you know, the merits and the difficulties. And we understand that.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> You looked pretty sober sitting there in the Oval Office, did something wash over you or --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I think I'm a sober person. I think the press tries to make you into something a little bit different. In my case, a little bit of a wild man. I'm not. I'm actually not. I'm a very sober person. But it was respect for the office, it was respect for the president. Again, I never met him before, but we had -- we had a very good chemistry going. And -- and I really found—it might not be that I agree with him, but I really found the conversation unbelievably interesting.
<Notes> <Positive> [Barack Obama: I want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are gonna want to do everything we can to help you succeed, because if you succeed then the country succeeds.]
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Was it at all awkward, at all, given what you've said about each other? You said he was not born in this country, he said things about you, he said you're -- unqualified --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what, it was a very -- it was a very interesting thing because -- I mean, few people have asked me from my family, what was that first period of time like?
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We never discussed what was said about each other. I said terrible things about him, he said terrible things about me. We never ever discussed what we said about each other—
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> There was no awkwardness?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll be honest, from my standpoint zero, zero. And that's strange. I'm actually surprised to tell you that. It's -- you know, a little bit strange.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Do you think that -- that your election is a repudiation of his presidency?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think it's a moment in time where politicians for a long period of time have let people down. They've let 'em down on the job front. They've even let 'em down in terms of the war front. You know, we've been fighting this war for 15 years --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> This was the message of your campaign.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And you look at our roads and our bridges and our tunnels and all of the -- and our airports are, like, obsolete. And I think it was just a repudiation of what's been taking place over a longer period of time than that.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> You know, you surprised everyone by winning the primaries, beating 17 other Republicans or 16, whatever -- people are really surprised that you won this election. Are people going to be surprised about how you conduct yourself as president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I'll conduct myself -- in a very good manner, but depends on what the situation is, sometimes you have to be rougher. When I look at -- when I look at the world and you look at how various places are taking advantage of our country, and I say it, and I say it very proudly, it's going to be America first. It's not going to be what we're doing—we, we've lost -- we're losing this country. We're losing this country. That's why I won the election. And by the way, won it easily, I mean I won easily. That was big, big.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Are you going to sometimes have that same rhetoric that you had on the stump? Or are you going to reign it in?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, sometimes you need a certain rhetoric to get people motivated. I don't want to be just a little nice monotone character and in many cases I will be.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Can you be?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure I can. I can be easily, that's easier. Honestly to do that, it's easier.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> So let's go through very quickly some of the promises you made and tell us if you're going to do what you said or you're going to change it in any way. Are you really going to build a wall?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> They're talking about a fence in the Republican Congress, would you accept a fence?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I'm very good at this, it's called construction.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> So part wall, part fence?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, it could be – it could be some fencing.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> What about the pledge to deport millions and millions of undocumented immigrants?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably two million, it could be even three million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate. But we're getting them out of our country, they're here illegally. After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people that you're talking about who are terrific people, they're terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that -- But before we make that determination -- Lesley, it's very important, we want to secure our border.
<Notes> <Positive> [Paul Ryan: We had a fantastic, productive meeting.]
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> So you were with Paul Ryan, you met with the Republican leadership, what was the -- one thing that you all agreed you want to get done right away?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I would say there was more than one thing, there were three things, it was healthcare, there was immigration and there was a major tax bill lowering taxes in this country. We're going to substantially simplify and lower the taxes --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> And you've got both Houses?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I have both Houses and we have the presidency, so we can do things --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> You can do things lickety-split.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's been a long time since it's happened.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they gave me a lot of credit. Don't forget, I was abused four or five weeks ago, they said I was going to -- instead of having all three, we would lose all three. So that was good. But those are the three things that we really discussed.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> You said that lobbyists owned politicians because they give them money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> You admitted you used to do it yourself. You have a transition team—
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And when you say lobbyists, lobbyists and special interests.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> And you want to get rid of all of that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't like it, no.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> You don't like it, but your own transition team, it's filled with lobbyists.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's the only people you have down there.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> You have lobbyists from Verizon, you have lobbyists from the oil gas industry, you have food lobby.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure. Everybody's a lobbyist down there --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Well, wait
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's what they are. They're lobbyists or special interests—
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> On your own transition team.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> –we are trying to clean up Washington. Look --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> How can you claim --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Everything, everything down there -- there are no people -- there are all people that work -- that's the problem with the system, the system. Right now, we're going to clean it up. We're having restrictions on foreign money coming in, we're going to put on term limits, which a lot of people aren't happy about, but we're putting on term limits. We're doing a lot of things to clean up the system. But everybody that works for government, they then leave government and they become a lobbyist, essentially. I mean, the whole place is one big lobbyist.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> But you're, but you're basically saying you have to rely on them, even though you want to get rid of them?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm saying that they know the system right now, but we're going to phase that out. You have to phase it out.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Let's talk about your cabinet.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Have you made any decisions?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Tell us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I can't tell you that, but I have made --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Oh, come on—
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know the amazing thing to show you the incredible nature of our country. First of all, every major leader and probably less than major le- has called me, I've spoken to many of them and I'll call the rest of them, but and I said, "Boy, this really shows you how powerful our country is." France and U.K. and I mean everybody, all over Asia—and very, just to congratulate. But it really shows the power of our country.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> One of the things you're going to obviously get an opportunity to do, is name someone to the Supreme Court. And I assume you'll do that quickly?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Very important.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> During the campaign, you said that you would appoint justices who were against abortion rights. Will you appoint -- are you looking to appoint a justice who wants to overturn Roe v. Wade?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So look, here's what's going to happen -- I'm going to -- I'm pro-life. The judges will be pro-life. They'll be very—
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> But what about overturning this law --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, there are a couple of things. They'll be pro-life, they'll be -- in terms of the whole gun situation, we know the Second Amendment and everybody's talking about the Second Amendment and they're trying to dice it up and change it, they're going to be very pro-Second Amendment. But having to do with abortion if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states. So it would go back to the states and --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Yeah, but then some women won't be able to get an abortion?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it'll go back to the states.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> By state—no some --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, well, they'll perhaps have to go, they'll have to go to another state.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> And that's OK?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we'll see what happens. It's got a long way to go, just so you understand. That has a long, long way to go.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Are you in any way intimidated, scared about this enormous burden, the gravity of what you're taking on?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Not at all?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I respect it. But I'm not scared by it.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Now you're not scared, but there are people, Americans, who are scared and some of them are demonstrating right now, demonstrating against you, against your rhetoric --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's only because they don't know me. I really believe that's only because --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Well, they listened to you in the campaign and that's --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I just don't think they know me.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Well, what do you think they're demonstrating against?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think in some cases, you have professional protesters. And we had it -- if you look at WikiLeaks, we had --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> You think those people down there are—
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well Lesley—
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> are professional?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I think some of them will be professional, yeah --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> OK, but what about – they're in every city.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> When they demonstrate against you and there are signs out there, I mean, don't you say to yourself, I guess you don't, you know, do I have to worry about this? Do I have to go out and assuage them? Do I have to tell them not to be afraid? They're afraid.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would tell them don't be afraid, absolutely.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> But that's not what you're saying, I said it-
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I think, no, no, I think -- I am saying it, I've been saying it.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Don't be afraid. We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, don't be afraid. You know, we just had an election and sort of like you have to be given a little time. I mean, people are protesting. If Hillary had won and if my people went out and protested, everybody would say, "Oh, that's a terrible thing." And it would have been a much different attitude. There is a different attitude. You know, there is a double standard here.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> It has been five full days since the election and anti-Trump demonstrations, driven in part by Hillary Clinton's edge in the popular vote, have been significant.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> When we interviewed him on Friday afternoon Mr. Trump said he had not heard about some of the acts of violence that are popping up in his name… or against his supporters.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Nor he said had he heard about reports of racial slurs and personal threats against African Americans, Latinos and gays by some of his supporters.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am very surprised to hear that -- I hate to hear that, I mean I hate to hear that --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> But you do hear it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't hear it—I saw, I saw one or two instances…
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> On social media?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I think it's a very small amount. Again, I think it's --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Do you want to say anything to those people?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say don't do it, that's terrible, 'cause I'm gonna bring this country together.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> They're harassing Latinos, Muslims --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am so saddened to hear that. And I say, "Stop it." If it -- if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> During the campaign Mr. Trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into Hillary Clinton's email issue.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> So we asked him if he plans to carry that out.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> On Friday, Donald Trump announced that he was changing the head of his transition team. Governor Chris Christie was replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Mr. Trump also added his three older children to the transition team.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Between now and Inauguration Day, the team must fill the new administration with 4,000 political appointees. That's 4,000 new hires in just nine weeks.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> When we talked to Donald Trump on Friday, the enormity and gravity of his new role was just sinking in. He was subdued. We wondered if as president he planned to temper his rhetoric, lower the flame.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> I want to ask you about the tweet that you put out, I think it was last night or the night before, about these demonstrators.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> You said that they were professionals—and you said it was unfair.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I said some of them. Some of them are --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> But are you going to be tweeting and whatever you're upset about just put out there when you're president?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So it's a modern form of communication, between Face -- you know, Facebook and Twitter and I guess Instagram, I have 28 million people. 28 million people --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> So you are going to keep it up?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a great form of communication. Now, do I say I'll give it up entirely and throw out, that's a tremendous form -- I pick up -- I'm picking up now, I think I picked up yesterday 100,000 people. I'm not saying I love it, but it does get the word out. When you give me a bad story or when you give me an inaccurate story or when somebody other than you and another network, or whatever, 'cause of course, CBS would never do a thing like that right? I have a method of fighting back. That's very tough --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> But you're going to do that as president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm going to do very restrained, if I use it at all, I'm going to do very restrained. I find it tremendous. It's a modern form of communication. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of. It's -- it's where it's at. I -- I do believe this, I really believe that, um -- the fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they're spending much more money than I spent. You know, I spent my money. A lot of my money. And I won. I think that social media has more power than the money they spent, and I think maybe to a certain extent, I proved that.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Are you going to ask for a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton over her emails? And are you, as you had said to her face, going to try and put her in jail?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do, I'm going to think about it. Um, I feel that I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on healthcare, I want to focus on the border and immigration and doing a really great immigration bill. We want to have a great immigration bill. And I want to focus on all of these other things that we've been talking about.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> You -- you know, you --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And get the country straightened away.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> You called her "crooked Hillary," said you wanted to get in jail, your people in your audiences kept saying, "Lock em' up."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. She did --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Do you—
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She did some bad things, I mean she did some bad things --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> I know, but a special prosecutor? You think you might…
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to hurt them. I don't want to hurt them. They're, they're good people. I don't want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes together.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> With that…
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Donald Trump
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> We were joined by the next first lady, Melania Trump. She'll be only the second foreign-born first lady. She's from Slovenia. John Quincy Adams' wife Louisa was the first.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> You know, I asked your husband if he was at all intimidated and scared about what lies ahead. The enormity. You're about to be first lady. Are you a little nervous about it? Little tense? A little --
<Melania Trump> <Positive> Well, there is a lot of responsibilities. And it's -- a lot of work needs to be done. And -- it's -- your -- stuff on your shoulders. And -- we will take care of it -- day by day. I will stay true to myself. I'm very strong and um -- tough and confident. And I will listen myself and I will do what is right and what feels to my heart.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> What kind of a first lady do you think she's going to be?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She will be terrific. She is very strong and very confident, but she's very warm. And I think she'll have a platform where she'll really be able to do a lot of good. And that's what she wants to do.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> You know, first ladies usually have a cause. And you've already said you're interested in speaking out against bullying on social media.
<Melania Trump> <Positive> I think it's very important because a lot of children and teenagers are getting hurt. And we need to teach them how to talk to each other, how to treat each other and to, to be able to connect with each other on the right way.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> It's an ironic choice since her own husband sent out a stream of pretty nasty tweets during the campaign.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> What about your husband's tweeting?
<Melania Trump> <Positive> Well, sometimes he -- it got him in trouble. But it helped a lot as well. He had unbelievable following.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> So you never say to him, "Come on"?
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> I did.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She does --
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> I --
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> You know, of course, I did many times, from the beginning of the campaign. But…
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Does he listen to you?
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> Sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn't --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm not a big tweeter. I mean, I don't do too many, but they hit home. And they have to get a point across.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> If he does something that you think crossed a line, will you tell him?
<Melania Trump> <Positive> Yes, I tell him all the time.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> All the time?
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> All the time.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> And does --
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> And --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- he listen? Does he --
<Melania Trump> <Positive> I think he hears me. But he will do what he wants to do on the end. He's an adult. He knows the consequences. And I give him my opinion. And he could do whatever he likes with it.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Did you ask Melania sort of, for permission, in a way, to run for president? Did you get her approval?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I actually sat down with Melania and my whole family and we talked about it. Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany. Barron to a lesser extent, but Barron too. Um, because in a way he's affected every bit as much. Maybe more.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Maybe more.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And so we all had a dinner and I said, "I would like to do this. I think I can do a great job." And I wanted to get, number one, a consensus and number two, ideally, their permission. And they all agreed.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Your son Barron, what is he, 10?
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> 10
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> 10. He was on camera the whole time you were giving your acceptance speech. Does he get it? Does he know?
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> He knows. He knows --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> He knows?
<Melania Trump> <Positive> -- what's going on. and, he's very proud of his dad.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Now -- you met with Michelle Obama yesterday. Was there any awkwardness, given --
<Melania Trump> <Negative> No.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- What everybody was saying about everybody in The campaign?
<Melania Trump> <Negative> No. I didn't feel it.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Not at all?
<Melania Trump> <Negative> No.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Tell us about the meeting.
<Melania Trump> <Positive> Yes, she was a gracious host. We had a great time and we talk about raising children in the White House. She was very warm and very nice.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> You know, she raised the two kids in the White House. But she had her mother living there. That's an enormous help. Your parents are here, right?
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> They're here.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Will they go to Washington with you?
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> They might. We will see. We will discuss that.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Are you prepared, both of you, for the lack of privacy and the intense scrutiny? And you know, first ladies are really criticized if one little hair's out of place. Are you both prepared for this?
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> We are used to it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will say, it is on a different scale now, 'cause I've had a lot. But I've never had anything like this.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> You won't be able to walk down the street --
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> I didn't do that for two years already, so you know, it will just continue. It's another level, but it will continue.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> At that point, the discussion turned back to some of the thornier issues Mr. Trump faces.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> FBI director James Comey. Are you going to ask for his resignation?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think that I would rather not comment on that yet. I don't -- I haven't made up my mind. I respect him a lot. I respect the FBI a lot. I think --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Even though they leak so much?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there's been a lotta leaking, there's no question about that. But I would certainly like to talk to him. And see him. This is a tough time for him. And I would like to talk to him before I'd answer a question like that.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Sounds like you're not sure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, sure, I'm not sure. I'd wanna see, you know, he may have had very good reasons for doing what he did.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Are you gonna release your tax returns?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> At the appropriate time, I will release them. But right now I'm under routine audit. Nobody cares. The only one who cares is, you know, you and a few people that asked that question. Obviously, the public didn't care because I won the election very easily. So they don't care. I never thought they did care.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Now, for months, you were running around saying that the system is rigged, the whole thing was rigged. You tweeted once that the Electoral College is a disaster for democracy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> So do you still think it's rigged?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think the electoral ca -- look, I won with the Electoral College.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Exactly.But do you think --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, it's --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- it's rigged?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, some of the election locations are. Some of the system is. I hated --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Even though you won you're saying that --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hated -- well, you know, I'm not going to change my mind just because I won. But I would rather see it where you went with simple votes. You know, you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes and you win. There's a reason for doing this because it brings all the states into play. Electoral College and there's something very good about that. But this is a different system. But I respect it. I do respect the system.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> What about vacations? You're not going to take any vacations? You've said that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have so much work. There's so much work to be done. And I want to get it done for the people. I want to get it done. We're lowering taxes, we're taking care of health care. I mean, there's just so much to be done. So I don't think we'll be very big on vacations, no.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Are you gonna take the salary, the president's salary?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I've never commented on this, but the answer is no. I think I have to by law take $1, so I'll take $1 a year. But it's a -- I don't even know what it is.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do you know what the salary is?
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> $400,000 you're giving up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm not gonna take the salary. I'm not taking it.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> In a moment, the Trump children join us and we will ask the president-elect where he stands on gay marriage, Obamacare, and ISIS.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> On Tuesday, Donald Trump reached deep into America's ranks of the discouraged and neglected, a largely white constituency. They feel their America hasn't been great for a long time. And they accepted a promise to make it great again.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> But Mr. Trump's appeal wasn't just to the disaffected. A map on election night was a sea of red, as he won support across the traditionally Republican South, but also deep into what used to be the blue wall of the Midwest.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Hillary Clinton came up short among her own supporters in large cities and affluent suburbs, among minorities and especially women. Just 51 percent of college-educated white women voted to make her the first female president. Her base didn't come with the enthusiasm and the turnout she needed to fend off Donald Trump's new and energized coalition.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> On Friday Mr. Trump's four older children – Tiffany, Donald, Jr., Eric And Ivanka -- joined us to talk about their father's surprising victory.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Set the scene. It's election night. Your father -- no one's expecting him to win and it begins to dawn on you. Tell us about being in that room.
<Eric Trump> <Positive> You start to see the states falling. You start seeing Florida come in and he was declared the winner. And then you saw Ohio, you saw North Carolina. You saw Pennsylvania. You saw Wisconsin. I mean, you saw all these great states – they're all falling. And I think it was when we got Pennsylvania that we knew. And it was amazing. We were high fiving and we were all hugging as a family. And I actually think our father was the calmest of all of us even though he was really obviously the center of attention. So --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> He went quiet is what I heard.
<Eric Trump> <Neutral> -- it's -- it's --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- IS What i heard.
<Eric Trump> <Positive> -- it's A moment I'll never forget, i can tell You that. i mean, The team was around and everybody's cheering. and it was just -- it was -- it was A beautiful night.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> It is hard to put into words the experience or the emotion when your father becomes president of the United States of America. We had enormous pride, joy. It's incredibly exciting. And we're very grateful for the opportunity. And we take that opportunity very seriously.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Tiffany?
<Tiffany Trump> <Negative> I mean I don't think we can really prepare for our father becoming president. But we were all there together with everyone that's worked so hard. And my dad has worked so hard. And it's just – it's really awe-inspiring.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> At some point that night and into the next day, calls from well-wishers started pouring in – including, Mr. Trump told us, from both ex-presidents Bush. Neither of whom supported him in the campaign.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> What did the b=Bushes say when they called you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it was very interesting. I got a call from Father Bush, who is a wonderful man. And he just said, "Congratulations. It was an amazing campaign." And then I got a call from George and he said -- "Congratulations. It was great." And, you know, look, it's -- it's a tough situation. I went to war with Jeb. And Jeb's a nice guy, but it was a nasty campaign. It was a nasty campaign. And, I mean, I'm disappointed in one thing. He signed a pledge and I don't know how you sign a pledge and then you don't honor it. It was a rough primary. It's a rough primary. Although I think the general was probably just as tough. Probably as a combination, it was the roughest ever.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Ivanka, you said that your father's changed in the campaign. How has he changed?
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> I think it's impossible to go through this journey and not change for the better. You meet -- and in my father's case, literally millions of Americans, and they speak to you with a candor about their struggles, their challenges. They share with you their most intimate stories. So you connect with people in a different way. And you grow.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Do you think your father's changed?
<Eric Trump> <Positive> I think as a family, we've changed, to tell you the truth. I mean, how big this platform is, is incredible. And I have to say, one of the most rewarding things of my life, and I can speak on behalf of really all of us, it's fighting by our father's side every single day as you've gone through a grueling, grueling process like this.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Don, did you discover something about your father that you didn't know before?
<Donald Trump, Jr.> <Positive> You know -- we -- we know him pretty well. And we've got to, you know, be by his side for many years, both as a father and in business. So, you know -- the tenacity that he's always shown -- was just there. But it was just so much more. When I was watching him working 20-hour days, doing seven major speeches to tens of thousands of people and just saying, "Well, it wasn't triage. Which state are we gonna do today," it's, "We're just gonna do 'em all. We're gonna speak to all of these people." And I think people saw that energy. They fed off that energy. That energy was so much of the movement -- that he was able to create. And, you know -- it -- it only furthered what I already knew.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> I want to ask you all about something that's going on right now around the country. A lot of people are afraid. They're really afraid. African Americans think there's a target on their back. Muslims are terrified.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's horrible if that's happening. I think it's built up by the press because, frankly, they'll take every single little incident that they can find in this country, which could've been there before. If I weren't even around doing this, and they'll make into an event because that's the way the press is.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Do any of you want to say anything about this fear that's out there?
<Donald Trump, Jr.> <Negative> I -- I think the fears, you know, while they may be there, some fabricated, some not -- are totally unfounded.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> One of the groups that's expressing fear are the LGBTQ group. You --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And yet I mentioned them at the Republican National Convention. And --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> You did.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Everybody said, "That was so great." I have been, you know, I've been-a supporter.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Well, I guess the issue for them is marriage equality. Do you support marriage equality?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It -- it's irrelevant because it was already settled. It's law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean it's done.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> So even if you appoint a judge that --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's done. It -- you have -- these cases have gone to the Supreme Court. They've been settled. And, I'm fine with that.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> One of the issues that has come up in the campaign is your father's temperament. And he has himself has said, "If someone insults me or says something unkind about me, I'm gonna strike back." And now people are saying, "Well, maybe he should kinda soften that, control that a little." What -- how do you think he's going to comport himself as president?
<Eric Trump> <Positive> I think very presidential. At the same time, my father, if he needs to be a fighter, he can be a fighter. And I think this country, quite frankly, needs a fighter. And I think that's what this country elected.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They spent $1 billion against me on the word "Temperament." It was given by Madison Avenue. And they thought that, by temperament, they could maybe, you know, win the election. Obviously, it didn't work because we're here and they're not. And I think my strongest asset is my temperament because I have a temperament where we win and we're going to start winning again. We're going to win on trade, we're going to win at the borders, we're going to knock out ISIS.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> You have said that you're gonna destroy ISIS. Now, how are you going to?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't tell you that. I don't tell you that.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Yeah, but what can --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not like the people going in right now and fighting Mosul and they announced it four months before they went into Mosul and everybody now is -- it's a tough fight because, number one, the people from the -- leaders of ISIS have left. What do you -- why do I have to tell you that?
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Troops on the ground?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm not gonna say anything. I don't want to tell them anything. I don't want to tell anybody anything.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Yeah, but what about—the American people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I wanna do the job. We have some great generals. We have great generals.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> You said you knew more than the generals about ISIS
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll be honest with you, I probably do because look at the job they've done. OK, look at the job they've done. They haven't done the job. Now, maybe it's leadership, maybe it's something else. Who knows? All I can tell you is we're going to get rid of ISIS.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Let me ask you about Obamacare, which you say you're going to repeal and replace. When you replace it, are you going to make sure that people with pre-conditions are still covered?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Because it happens to be one of the strongest assets.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> You're going to keep that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Also, with the children living with their parents for an extended period, we're gonna --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> You're gonna keep that --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Very much try and keep that. Adds cost, but it's very much something we're going to try and keep.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> And there's going to be a period if you repeal it and before you replace it, when millions of people could lose -– no?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, we're going to do it simultaneously. It'll be just fine. We're not going to have, like, a two-day period and we're not going to have a two-year period where there's nothing. It will be repealed and replaced. And we'll know. And it'll be great health care for much less money. So it'll be better health care, much better, for less money. Not a bad combination.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Roles during the administration. Any of you want a job in your father's administration?
<Eric Trump> <Positive> So we have an amazing company. You know, one of, I think, the fortunate things for my father and our father is that he was able to step out of the company to run for commander-in-chief. And I think he's going to rely on us more than ever. And --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> So you'll stay up here?
<Eric Trump> <Positive> So we'll -- we'll -- we'll be in New York and we'll take care of the business. I think we're going to have a lot of fun doing it. And we're going to make him very proud.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> People think that you're going to be part of the administration, Ivanka.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> I'm -- no. I'm going to be a daughter. But I've -- I've said throughout the campaign that I am very passionate about certain issues. And that I want to fight for them.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> But you won't be inside --
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> Wage equality, childcare. These are things that are very important for me. I'm very passionate about education. Really promoting more opportunities for women. So you know, there're a lot of things that I feel deeply, strongly about. But not in a formal administrative capacity.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Let me ask whether any of you think that the campaign has hurt the Trump brand.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> I don't think it matters. This is so much more important. And more serious. And -- so th -- I -- I -- you know, that's the focus.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think what Ivanka trying to say, "Who cares? Who cares?" This is big league stuff. This is -- this is our country. Our country is going bad. We're going to save our country. I don't care about hotel occupancy. It's peanuts compared to what we're doing. Health care, making people better. It's unfair what's happened to the people of our country and we're going to change it. As simple as that.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> The microphone is on here.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. Your mic is actually attached to your headphones. It's very professional now. How are you Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm fine. This is my daughter Ivanka.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hi, Ivanka.
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> This is my son, Don.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And hey we will put you some headphones on you guys so that we can hear you. Hi Ivanka, nice to meet you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> How are you? Nice to meet you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm very good to see you. And Donald is here as well. So you're all three are on the show this year.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Is there a lot of pressure. Apprentice four or five is it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is number five going on tonight.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Is there a lot of pressure to come in big with this. Everybody always looks at you and expect you to be number one in all that.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I don't know you know the finale as you see I just gave you the ratings was number two. And that was last month number two for the week in television. Right. The show's been number one a lot of the time. Yeah it's always tough. You know it's like your show you get if you drop one percent. They have a headline, Howard Stern writes down on the stand, you know and then you read it. And if you really read it seriously, holy Christmas is new to him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's it's tough competition a lot of competitors.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But don't you think as a result of this fight with Martha that there is even more scrutiny so it's like if you take a slip now everybody will be ready to pounce.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I think so and a lot of people thought that I started the fight with Martha because of you know gets a little hoopla going on and you know...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I think that's brilliant.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You do. You wouldn't do a thing like that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I mean really when I was the first one to go on the air and say this fight will start up the new season.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I mean it's unfortunate because Martha Stewart was your friend.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You don't mind sacrificing a friend for ratings.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well It's not a question. I don't sacrifice I mean I like Martha, I've always liked Martha. I still like Martha but the fact is that she was blaming myself and Mark Burnett for her failure at ratings and you know her show did not do well. The show didn't have it it didn't have the temperament, it didn't have the mood, it didn't have anything. She wasn't doing a good job at it. And every time I read an article she was blaming me. And my show is the number one show on television and she was saying I'm going to go fire Donald. Now...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Can I say something to you.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're like me. I get crazy about everything. I'm telling you I'm nuts. I get crazy about it everyday. I sat down and I started to analyze what Martha Stewart said. And I was saying this to Robin in a way she's saying, there was too much apprentice on the air which is something you were saying as well. And she said this guy Burnett came to me and said Donald doesn't want to do this forever. They said to me the plan is to fire Donald Trump in a cute way and I will take over. That was my goal. That was my understanding. And when that didn't happen both of us are stuck on the air, is too much Apprentice on the air. It should have been one Apprentice moving into the other apprentice. That was our understanding and I'm thinking...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Is that a bad thing to say what she said. She didn't really say anything bad about Donald.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I don't think she really criticized.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You see I viewed it as negative, but I know exactly what to say.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I would too.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I viewed it as negative because I don't want to be fired when I have the number one show on television, Number one. Number two, do you fire Jennifer Aniston three years ago when Friends is blazing. Because you want to fire and put somebody else it doesn't make sense. I mean the concept doesn't make sense.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What did Burnett did say to her, listen I don't think Donald going to stay with this forever. This guy got a major things going on in his life. It's going to take long forever.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You would like TV. That's what they were saying and maybe He... You've got a lot of things going on. Maybe he won't want to continue this.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I viewed it as negative. And I'll tell you something. I viewed it numerous times because this wasn't the only said this was a news week story but I've heard it before.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I am the same way. I am telling you I was at war with who I was at war and they came and we played the clip I think I knew who it was, Jack Black. I listened to a piece of tape where he went on another radio show and criticized me. I heard the tape. I blew my stack, I said that Jack Black and I went into a thing about him for a month. Jack Black comes into my studio. I don't know what he did wrong. I want to apologize. I don't think I said anything right. I want to play the clip to your face. I played on the clip and I'm listening to it I got. I must be insane The guy is not saying a word. I must be mentally ill. I get crazy.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Well I think that..you know it's one thing for Donald to say you know what. My friend Martha I defended her. I don't understand what she's saying. But you go into attack mode. All they have to do is say Donald Trump and you know you are on attack mode.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're like me. I think people are attacking me.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> And you slay people. You don't just not calm in a little bit. You don''t just hit him punch you once, you just destroy, and she felt destroyed by you.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well you know I've never really thought of that but Howard is that way as a long time, this is Howard. I mean and a friend of Howard, Howard is that way. When I called up innocently A. J. Benza he didn't say anything so bad. I went startled crazy...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You wouldn't actually taking his girlfriend.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I Let me ask you..I know you took his girlfriend and you're okay with that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> We're on the air.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Know what She's a wonderful person too. I'll tell you what. And I'm very proud of it. But I didn't really like he didn't say anything that bad. All of a sudden the thing I'm most proud about, 11 Howard once said that that was in the top five in the history of television.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I was. I love arguing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't think you have that tape anymore do you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I don't.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're not allowed to play that
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In fact that's the only thing wrong with this show is that you can no longer play the A. J. Benza tape.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Did you and Martha really have a friendship or was it just one of those things you'd see each other casually.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was more casual but we had a friendship. We like with each other and you have to understand the one thing and you knew it because I came on your show tonight. I came on. I had nothing to do with the show. I own the show with Mark Burnett. Martha just got paid a fee. I have nothing to do with it so...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Did anything... You might have been mad at Mark Burnett because he went and signed Martha Stewart where he shouldn't have maybe done that by the way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know NBC really liked it. Look the Apprentice is doing tremendous. Numbers continues but He's just doing tremendous number. So NBC rightfully probably said let's do a second version. Martha is getting a lot of publicity unfortunately because of her problems. That's a second version of the Apprentice
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And will get a cut of the action.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I didn't like the idea. But you know I made a lot of money with that show. I made a lot of money with that show. Who doesn't want that to be.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So it wasn't so bad.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it wasn't so bad.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> But I think in time you will see. I'm just guessing. That Martha Stewart did not say anything that bad about you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. I mean it but...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But you mean it like ninety five or something.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what I'll forget as soon as you forget all of your little disputes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I can't I can't I cannot forget my disputed...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Split personality sickness.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> For example Andrew Dice Clay, Andrew Dice Clay is coming on the show. I've had a very... For years now I haven't spoke with him. We were friendly is somewhat and helped him buy a house out on Long Island. I went through with a broker with him. I mean he got something of a friendship and he came in and he did a interview with me and then I read and he said something like Howard was in on his game the interview wasn't that good. That's all I needed to hear. He came and he wasn't prepared he wasn't doing a good job on the show. And he's blaming me. I mean I can only ask so many questions the guy's got to put out a little bit and that was it. Bam bam bam. I mean it's been out of control so that's a legitimate .
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Wait a minute. That he actually did something. I have seen you forgive people and mend fences.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I have.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know that Donald does that.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Do you ever forgive anyone have you ever been in a feud.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The answer is rarely, rarely. I''ll tell you Dan is saying something to me.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Neutral> He didn't say nothing it doesn't happen.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go ahead say it Duncan as you said that...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He basically he's too nice to people he doesn't know that well. That people who he starts to dislike whether with merit or not he just takes it away too far.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> OK. Had you ever been in therapy for this you do have anger issues.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> No I don't. I haven't because I'm too busy to be at therapy. That's a good news. I'm so busy that I don't have time.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Isn't it hard though. I'm going to ask the kids this question and this is something you got to come clean with. Isn't it hard to be Donald Trump's kid because you know if you screw up with him he will not be forgiving.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> Definitely he wouldn't treat us differently than anyone else.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's why...
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> So we really understand that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So in other words if you don't buy into Donald Trump's world even as his children.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You're out.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're out. So it doesn't allow you to rebel. It doesn't. You've never had the chance to say hey dad screw you you're wrong.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Neutral> Mom gets it all.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Am I right or am I wrong?
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> There's definitely truth in what you're saying.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I would think it would be very hard to be Donald Trump's kid.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> There are some advantages as well.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> Understood. I understand. O understand. I'm not saying he's a bad dad or anything like that. I'm saying I just know with his personality.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It's part of what's great about him now because you understand things he's so blunt. There's no sort of ambiguity about how he feels about things. If you just go to him and you know you can say how do you feel about this and get an honest answer and there's sort of no
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> It's black or white.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right. And now if you went up to your father and you said you know what Dad, you're an F and A-hole, I think we should ...
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> We would never say that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Hold on a second. Let's say you screwed up you got angry with him. You did that. Would your father be able to come over to you and hug you after that and say I'm proud of you for speaking up.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> I think he definitely likes it when we speak out and we don't always agree with him and we don't have to always agree with him.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You know we now work for him if we always agreed with him that would be a problem we have to bring something to the table in our own viewpoint. But that being said, there's a way in which you can disagree with somebody being respectful and not insulting.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And you've got to also always keep in mind your father is a very wealthy man. It's a nice security blanket. If you go outside the line, He could cut you off because he is that kind of guy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do you hold that over there.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donna how many times have i said today?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> All the time.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Neutral> Really. Mr. Trump
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> All the time. I will call in those lawyers I will cut them out of that real so fast. Those kids, they will have nothing.
<Ivanka Trump> <Negative> Do you get that smile but he's not okay.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> .That's so funny.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Neutral> The twinkle in his eye.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Have you guys, have you guys ever said to your Dad, Listen. How much is in the will and what am I going to get when I get out of this whole thing with you know if you go into the great beyond what you have you ever discussed it.
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> Not really.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Negative> You want to discuss it now you want me to broke this whole thing.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I would Howard...
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> I think Harry will do a better job than we will so maybe...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Isn't that equal Donald?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well it's a funny thing about wills.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Wills are very hard to talk to with parents or whatever. You know you love somebody and the kids...you know honestly the kids, they're very good business field. They went to work, they got all A's. They were great students, great everything.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The fact is, they have... And I've often thought to myself, you know we talk about deals and everything else, the big deal is how much am I going to leave them. Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The big deal is how much taxes is going to be paid. How much is how much.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> They find it hard to bring that up and yet we'll talk about much smaller things about business and very intently. And the reason they don't is out of respect in all fairness and you would have that with your father let's say are you would...you know it just ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> For sure.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> My father is not leaving me anything.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If you do...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm not leaving you of something.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> But the fact is when you have a paren't it's it's a terrible to discuss death. and you're basically saying when you die what you going to call it, so my kids are very nice and the fact that they've never brought it up and I'm sure they think about it all the time. They've never brought it up.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Aren't you annoyed by this new baby coming on the scene. I mean...
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> I think that's another one.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's another cost in theory...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Can we sort of...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well is it not Well let's be honest.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Can he slow down.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Neutral> Why didn't we start with his children.
<Ivanka Trump> <Negative> I think it would be much more difficult if we were sort of around 13, 14 and I think in a lot of ways it was more difficult when Tiffany came around. Because we were still sort of in the nest. Now we've grown up, we're working for fairness and it's sort of a separate thing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah its the...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It's the age gap is such that...
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Negative> We're going to cut Tiffany out.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But the Tiffany will now be going through it, right.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yeah. Tiffany doesn't deserve equal cut. I'm sorry I don't see her on the show. I don't see her on the Apprentice.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She is not working.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What about Donald. Is it fair in a world to say certain children get more and certain children get less. What is your philosophy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it is fair but I think what happens is Ivanka and Don and soon Eric will be working with me and so I'll be doing things for them because they're working. I mean they'll be working on a deal so they get a piece deal, don't do this, don't do that. So they have a certain advantage anyway. It's it depends on...I love all the kids you have to love them and ideally love them the same I think you love your kids.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> There could be... I know occasions where kids are really bad kids. I mean I know parents who have a really, really bad kids and I don't love the kids. I mean I know parents that won't ever talk to the kids. They truly, they're bad kids and they know it. I have good kids they're all good kids. Tiffany is a great kid also.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I see. We can put Tiffany on the show also on the Apprentice show next season let's say?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Will she ever [Inaudible] for you?
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> She's already 12 years old.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She's only 12. I think she'd be terrific on that.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> I think I know how it works is that he really rewards hard work. So the fact that Don and I are working fine, I mean we really are sort of busting our ass everyday working extremely long hours flying all over the world and country and we're loving it but we're working hard. And he realizes that and you know therefore ...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What about the rumor that you two guys are calling the new baby parasite. This have been going around... I think you just started a new rumor. I didn't know where did you get that. Melania that is not accurate. That's what we're hearing. Donald is upset about it. It's a big round it.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> So has it been discussed of it all? So you, so you, you guys are now working for your father. I am very impressed that you went to Wharton School of Business, do you get...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Because that's one of the hardest schools to get into.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> Oh it is one of the best. It is probably the best.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do people think that your dad bought...You know, did you put a wing on Wharton. Did you...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No actually.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They haven't done...
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> The fact is they...it's a great school. To me it's I think it's the best school in the world probably for business . To get in you have to be very, very smart. You have to have very very high average. You have to have great marks and if you don't you don't get it. I don't care who your father is.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Ivanka what kind of SATs do you have to have to get in.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> I don't know very high. I think it's not just about sort of one component. There you have to have a grade, you have to have the SATs, you have to have the extra extra curricular. In the interviews, you have to be well.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So you have to be smart. What kind of SATs do you get?
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> We all did very well.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Over 15 or 16? What is it over 1500 right?
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> Way over.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No kidding.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I actually, I have the tendency to think, that I think SATs mean nothing.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They got 800 time math. Did you guys get 800 in math in class.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I think close.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I produce smart people.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm nowhere near it.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I think that Tiffany took that [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Tiffany is a very good student.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You're thinking full credit.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what Tiffany is a very good student.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> He's thinking full credit for all good thing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All the good things I take credit.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> The good thing is that in my world as we know those people we grew up with people whose parents did donate the wings to warrant and they didn't get in. So it's not you know he couldn't buy our way and even if he wanted it
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay I want to ask you a [Inaudible] question, work or school in business.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes.
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> What is 17 times six.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Neutral> What is he a human calculator.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> See that is not a practical...
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Neutral> 96?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Wrong.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Neutral> 1 94
<Ivanka Trump> <Negative> Wrong
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> 11...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That is not a practical application though.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Ivanka 17 times six...
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> It's 11 12. It's 1, 12
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Wrong
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What is 17 times six?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> 17 times six anybody knows.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> 92
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> 102
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Inaudible] 112.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It is 112?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> 112
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> What gets you, you're genius. The kids didn't know. That's why your dead.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's why I'm dead. All right i have a question because you ...
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Positive> The second thing I want to say is that unless for mankind to get only six times 20 minutes two times six times a hundred
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Or better yet just bring out a calculator. [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It's 102.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Guys you're wrong. [Inaudible] I was right, hire me. Give me a job.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I want to go back this Martha Stewart thing for just a moment because she, you know the things that she said that hurt her the most.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let's see her get into Wharton.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> First of all, she did say that Donald had this [Inaudible] with a silver spoon in his mouth and he was not a self-made man. She was really, she started punching bag pretty hard.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When my father was a builder in Brooklyn and Queens and I and he was successful and he was a great guy. I learned a lot about business from my father and that's true. I mean in that sense absolutely.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But you took the business and you made it into a multi-billion dollar business.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> The biggest developer in New York I have a lot of fun doing it. I'm doing very well and you know what can you do right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But she also said she took great offense at your attacks on her daughter.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well look I mean her attacks on her daughter. Her daughter and her supposedly didn't speak for years. The daughter didn't have any chemistry on the show. Her daughter and Martha were fighting over the same man. I mean give me a break.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And what about that I heard a rumor about that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Supposedly Martha stole the daughter's boyfriend.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Now I heard that's true.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sam whatever his name [Inaudible] Did you hear that too Gary.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know it's funny when when
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> That might not be true.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've got to ask the daughter about that because she works here in the morning.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's the guy that got her into trouble right
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> When Alexis was on our show that was actually in the note which we never got today. Let's get Alexis. Where is she?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Come on. I never saw that in a note.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know I mean that's a little unusual for the mother to see another boyfriend. I don't know if it's true is it true Gary?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> There' s a rumor that we were going to sort it's a [Inaudible].
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I'll tell you what they both wish they never met the guy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Your son should have sex with Martha and Alexis and get him all back.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> This all up.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look I wish mother the best. I hope she does well I really do. I mean I just don't want to be blamed .
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes i do. I don''t want to be blamed for the failure of her show. She didn't get a job because it didn't have what it takes. Watch tonight, you'll see what it takes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now the show your new show Apprentice 5.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Got great reviews in the paper today. They say you've revitalized it by bringing your kids in.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well and for other reasons.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they say the new cast is more attractive and sort of more exciting.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What was the focus this time when you were picking the new [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Just great, smart, amazing people. I mean we just have amazing and really smart people and it's a terrific cast. We have a great cast and Bill Carter in The New York Times today wrote a fantastic story on The Apprentice.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he said how the finale which was a month ago was the number two show on televisio. So Bill Carter is a great writer for The New York Times, he wrote a great story today.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So you're on tonight at 9:00 Tonight at 9:00
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And you don't go up against American Idol or you do.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's good.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Next Tuesday.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You don't want to go up against that.
<Ivanka Trump> <Negative> That drives me crazy because it dilutes the oh no that's a monster but that's on Tuesday and Wednesday.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So Ivanka obviously you are a very attractive one.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> There's no question about it. Your father says you're one of the most attractive women on the planet. I don't disagree.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What's going on. You're quite the package you're wealthy. You're bright, graduated Wharton. Top of your class. Yes?
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> Really. What number?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Cum Laude. Well I don't know Summa Cum Laude actually and I don't know why we didn't get a number breakdown in all that. I guess. Who's single Howard.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> Dean already had not seen each other for a month and a half.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I want to introduce you to the bachelor party.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What would you really single as well.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That would be a nightmare.
<Artie Lange> <Negative> I would do a terrible terrible and I would be I couldn't be worse than it already was this is a tough tough guy. I can't think of anyone worse out of respect for that. All I could think of was I had lunch at Marlo. I visited the ground.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It is a very WASPy it is a beautiful place. I knew I didn't belong there. Not with my nose in my back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I knew I was right. I had the good sense to leave with. Nobody wanted to see.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> If an Artie Lange was to marry I. It's safe to say that she would not even be welcome at Mar-a-Lago right.
<Artie Lange> <Positive> Am I right that that's true. She would probably not be my daughter.
<Artie Lange> <Neutral> She would never be at Mar-a-Lago. Right. I get that.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> Imagine the movie would be like Arthur really because it would be giving up all her worldly possessions to marry the great movie by the way.
<Artie Lange> <Positive> Unbelievable what a movie it just never would happen.
<Artie Lange> <Positive> I mean that's my point about being Donald Trump's daughter even though there's a lot of good stuff but a lot of that there can with regard to the dating thing and to be very careful. But I think generally when you grow up and you have a lot of money and you sort of have the houses we have in the plans you're a little bit more skeptical general of people's intentions. So you either have to have a great ability to see through people and really focus and see who's sincere and who's not. If you don't have that ability you're just screwed in life again.
<Artie Lange> <Positive> For the record I have a lot of family relationships but in business and everything I read for Donald I honestly I mean I have a lot going out with a i already.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I of roasting Donald when I he said that my mother said one day I could show my grandkids that I actually met the legendary Donald Trump and the guy and the did you right.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> You will impress a photograph. So let me understand.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know I like to bring up something here because Donald introduced Donny to his wife is he going to find a mate for Ivanka.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> I think right now I'm focused on working working hard for him and the guys that are doing this.
<Artie Lange> <Positive> Bingo. Yeah. One of my best friends. And Donald did not like him. No. He's a nice guy. I think he did like him did not like him. I thought he was a very nice guy. You're being diplomatic I think.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I thought he was I mean I didn't know him. I really didn't know. I grew up with thing. I've known him for years you know 10 years something I guess we dated for three and a half years you know I'm going to find Bingo a waffling like an alcoholic or something like that.
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> That is Fingaz West.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So bingo would fit in at Mar-a-Lago. Yes. He had the right pedigree I suppose. Yes. I mean he has which parents I would assume with a name like that you better take.
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> His actual name is James did you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Did you break up with bingo because you know your father didn't like him. No. Nothing to do with it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> No you can't you can't operate like that. I mean there's something about an attraction between you and another person I can't really be dictated by another. So you know I'm young I'm 24 we have been together for a long time and you know nothing terrible happened nothing salacious just you. I'm sorry. I hope you did not give it. Good. You're still a virgin I assume of course like Donald do you ever discuss sex with your daughter. No you do not. No. You've never had a feeling we're not going anywhere. No no. I mean we can make this up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Donald seriously do you know about sexual predators and things like that. I mean why. Would say. That's an uncomfortable topic for you as a father.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> Yeah I think so. I mean the kids probably know more about it than I do anyway. When you get right down to it but you know they've been good kids they've been always hard working. They've gotten tremendous marks in schools and no matter where they went and you know I mean I'm very proud of another and business with me Don has been in longer. He's doing a fantastic job Ivanka just came in recently. What does a monkey do when the company. Working with done basically it was an all encompassing developmental role that projects don't we have no money.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you got going on what's what we've got 2.7 million square for building in Chicago it's going to be the largest building built in North America since the Sears Tower. We have a 13
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> We have two products in Fort Lauderdale just recently signed a huge deal in Dubai by building around 17 buildings.
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Neutral> You do that on your own or your father figures a lot. We know you got them all with the idea.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He's know he's always you know at the end of the day he has the final say on absolutely everything. Well one of the great advantages and working for him also and as children is he really allows us the flexibility to try things and see for us things at us. And maybe you know in terms of our experience level would be you know sort of a challenge and he sits there and he'll help us and monitor us and you know got us in the right direction at the same time live learning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's pretty cool. I wish my dad would have done that. OK.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And so you're not you're not so friendly with your mother anymore I hope.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know I don't want you see her when I was part of her contract. No reason to be friendly with her I don't see why you got that. What do you need her for.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I mean I mean she's fine to me but I've been and I think she's great as well and they both did a really good job with us you know bringing us up and stuff so you know we owe a lot to her as well. Do you see that as disloyalty don't you think you probably fine. Let me ask a question. And this is going to matter a lot. And I know Donald and I respect the man and I've always loved him. You parents are on a boat that begins to sink.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> 1 There's room to save one paren't what do you save.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> 2 You go for do I you me say Well I think in that scenario I probably just drown myself and I don't feel comfortable making sure you've got to make it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You might as well say what you going to let everybody down today can I come home with mom tomorrow and say Let me give you the.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Martha Stewart shot a cannon into the boat. Apparently she had it in for the whole year.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> 3 What are you willing to say your father Martha did it. Then I have to say him so he can strike back. Right. You know because it's a Trump thing we have to end up winning. You know that's obvious. What does he say mom because when Dad dies that's all the money that's actually you know getting it all.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I know smart. I think he is.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He will control those assets from the grave even after he died five years ago. And also I think you know me my mother would like to be able to swim and my father and I could be a scary Howard and have one minute laugh with him. I'm not kidding. Where you go off to. Listen. OK so you just did today with your friend Katie Couric and we're now going over to Fox on Fox.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> 4 How can I ask one question. I've got to ask a question. Donald Jr got married I've always wondered what kind of a wedding gift did you get from her dad.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> 3 I guess the wedding wedding wedding the wedding you know. That was a life. Yeah. What are you going to do. It's been great. We just have so much fun together and really really change. It's actually surprising that nothing has been incredible.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> Someone told me actually your father is a very modest man that for your wedding gift you've got Florida.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> 3 The state didn't want me to tell me there's no one on the horizon for you today.
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> There are few people on the horizon that know one specific thing.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You hang out with Paris Hilton all those kind of kids.
<Ivanka Trump> <Negative> No not particularly.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You're too bright for that.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> She was in that movie with the Johnson kids movie with the rich kids. That was pretty interesting because you saw a lot of your friends in there right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She is the silly when they didn't look like almost all the kids came up pretty bad.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> I was you know and I am good friends with a few of the people in that movie. And it's sad the way sort of a few of them are behaving themselves.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Would you ever date a black guy. That will not go over at Mar-a-Lago.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes she know that I would have you know probably you would have no problem. No problem. I would love that.
<Ivanka Trump> <Negative> I know I would have that problem Gary.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Black guy. YNot like they'll talk darker than flavor flavor flavor. No no I'm saying And you have a couple of prospects and I'm sure
<Ivanka Trump> <Negative> I would have no problem with that. No problem with that.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> I'm not I'm just having fun. I was three and a half year relationship. Now I'm not really focused on dumb guys. I'm hanging out with my girlfriends. Just you know having a good time.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You decided she should get married you get married some time prior to 28 or 30 and really probably take place at the new ballroom at Mar-a-Lago.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That is that the answer really. That's what you want for her.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it would be nice probably sometime prior to 30 would be nice. You know if you meet the right guy if she doesn't meet the right guy she doesn't have to get married ever forget it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> How many dates before you would make love to a guy. Let me ask you a question that…
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> You already established that I was a virgin Howard?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, what about Bingo? Seriously. Did you wait a long time with Bingo?
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> That's something I'm not going to talk about here.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why, because your Dad's here?
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> Amongst other reasons and because of the fact that we're…
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He doesn't care, he wants to know.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> Millions of people are listening.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Actually, I don't want to know to be honest. I don't want to hear it.
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> He's actually inching out of the room.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, his skin is crawling from my question. First of all I want to thank all three of you and wish you the best of luck with Apprentice 5. Yes. Which is an amazing accomplishment when you think about whoever thought Donald Trump would be one of the biggest television stars. And here you've done it again. So congratulations to the kids. It's great you really are nice kids. You really are. Donald Trump on the season premiere of The Apprentice tonight at 9:00 on NBC. Check out Donald's travel Web site.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Yeah, and that's another thing that a new business since last we saw the travel site where you can book your travel. You know it's no trump that old trump dog
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's gotrump.com. And you get the best airlines and air fares the lowest prices. Hotel rooms and vacations. And it's really great. Gotrump.com. It's great
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> One last question I've been would you ever go out with another woman?
<Ivanka Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Never would kiss a girl?
<Ivanka Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Interesting.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> Hey now.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's just not her deal. You know what? Not her deal.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't believe it. Go out with me, I'll corrupt you.
<Ivanka Trump> <Negative> I have no doubt about that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You really want to give your father a heart attack. Don't worry Donald, you're safe I'll stay away. I'm all spoken for. And how's Melania doing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's great.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She's great. OK. All right listen... now what about this thing. Port security real quick. Dubai. Talk about that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well you know I'm partners with Dubai. I do a lot of business we're going to do 28 buildings in Dubai. So I know the people very well they're really fine people. But I'm sorry I'm so conflicted out of this discussion because I'm partners with everybody but you probably don't like the idea though, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm concerned about it because I do feel that our security is everything that Dubai has had a history of financing al Qaeda has had ties over there. And you're talking about even though the Coast Guard does and the United States government is in charge of port security, the companies that run these ports are in charge of enacting a law. So I don't know there's a little conflict of interest. It's a tough one. Anyway I'm really looking for the show I'm watching this season.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Because I want to see the kids that like you and I wish you the best of luck. Everybody tune into The Apprentice Season 5 tonight at 9 o'clock on NBC. [Commercial Break]
