<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just heard that you were doing a story on... this stuff. General Kelly's doing a very good job. We have a very good relationship. The White House is running very, very smoothly. We've had a big week. We just got a Supreme Court justice on the bench. We have the USMCA, meaning the NAFTA replacement, and many other things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We had a great meeting with North Korea. It was a great meeting. The secretary of State's coming just in ten minutes. But I want to tell you a couple of things: the chief is doing a very good job. I'm very happy with him, we have a very good relationship, number one. Number two, I didn't offer anybody else the job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't talk to anybody about the job. And I'm not, I'm not looking. Now, look, with time, do people leave? As an example, Nikki Haley told me six months ago, even a year ago -- but six months ago, that, you know, she's been governor, she's done this, she's helped us with the campaign, a lot of good things, and you probably saw the conference.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was a very, very positive thing. We have a very positive story going on at the White House. We have a very positive story for the country. We're doing a great job. We have the greatest economy in the history of our country. We have among the greatest job numbers. Among many groups, we have the greatest job numbers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have things going on that are phenomenal on trade. China wants to make a deal -- I said, you're not ready yet. But they wanna make a deal, and at some point we might. Iran wants to make a deal. They all wanna make a deal. We have great things going. We have a very smooth-running organization even though it's never reported that way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So the real story is that. It's really the real story. When you walk in here, you don't see chaos. There is no chaos. The media likes to portray chaos. There's no chaos. I'm leaving for Iowa in a little while. We're doing something that's going to be very exciting tonight in Iowa. A big, a big announcement, actually.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Doing four rallies this week. I think the rallies have, frankly, built up our poll numbers very greatly. What am I now in Rasmussen? 52?
<Sarah Huckabee Sanders> <Neutral> [Confirmed the Rasmussen Number]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Plus there's 10 percent, they think, where people don't respond, unfortunately. I'm not sure if this is nice or not nice, but when they don't respond, that means it's an automatic Trump vote. But it's a 52, and we're doing very well in the polls. You see what's happening with respect to the election, I mean, you know, to the midterms, even though -- I know -- historically, the president, you don't tend to do so well in the midterms, but we have, this is a different presidency and this is the greatest economy ever.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, we'll have to test that. But even the polls are saying that we have really come a long way in the last three weeks. I think we're gonna do well. And that's all I have to say. I want to just tell you that I'm very happy with General Kelly and I get along very well with him. We have a very good relationship. And if we didn't, I wouldn't stand for it for a minute, and he wouldn't want it any other way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it's just a different narrative than what you were saying. And with that, you're gonna have to write what you have to write, but the truth is, we have a really smooth-running White House and nothing and nobody has done more in their first two years as president. We're not even up to the second year.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Calling to assistant outside the Oval Office. I've gotta give you the list. Nobody has come close to doing what we've done in less than two years as president. Whether it's regulations or tax cuts or so many other things. [To assistant] Give that to Olivia. These are just some of the things that were done since taking office. So it would be great to have an accurately written story, because we do have -- when you walk in here, I think you see, if you read something, it's totally different than the fact.
<Olivia Nuzzi> <Neutral> [Asks question about the White House was different with John Kelly as Chief of Staff]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a four-star marine. He is a man who likes to see order and discipline, which I like. We came in and it was more free-rolling. We did a lot! We did a lot during the entire period. But I think there is great order now. He claimed that this has never been a point of frustration, as has often been reported.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I like it. I like order. I like it both ways! Honestly, I've had it both ways. I've had it both ways in my life and in my business, and sometimes freewheeling is a very good thing. You know, it's not a bad thing. We did a lot. If you look at the first six months, we did a lot.
<Olivia Nuzzi> <Positive> Like what?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you can take a look at some of the things on the list. Some of that was done early. Look at the pipelines. That was done early. A lot of great job-producing events. A lot of regulation cutting, we did tremendous regulation cuts. That was all done pretty early. So what I'm saying— and this is not even updated.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have achieved a lot in the last month and a half, two months, since that's been done. But we've done a really great job and it's so reported by those that are, by those that want it to be accurately reported. And I think, at least, I should be able -- because I know you're gonna go in and write something -- at least I should be able to tell you, out of respect, that the relationships are very good and I think you could say, Sarah, that the relationships in the White House have been very good, especially over the last six months, seven months.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's been very, very smooth. It's been a very smooth-running White House.
<Olivia Nuzzi> <Neutral> [Asks question about if relationship with Kelly
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I made changes. For instance, secretary of State, I put somebody in that I wanted. And it's really working out very well -- he's done a very fantastic job. Mike Pompeo, Mike Pompeo. But tht doesn't mean that we weren't doing a good job before, whether the relationships were good or not good. But I wanted to make a change and I made a change.
<Olivia Nuzzi> <Neutral> [Completes question about relationship, contrasted with staffers who have been removed in the past.]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is Olivia, she's going to say very, very wonderful things about you. This is General Kelly. Come in, Mike! Olivia can write badly about you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Stay there for a second. I just wanted to see Olivia for two seconds. Look, look who comes in, and we actually have lunch today
<Olivia Nuzzi> <Negative> [Asked if she is invited to lunch, jokingly.]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Anytime you want.
<John Kelly> <Positive> Best French fries in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But Bannon, if you've seen Bannon on shows over the last month... [Trump goes off the record]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look who you have here. Look who you have here. We had a meeting scheduled! This is Olivia. She's a disruptive writer but that's okay.
<Olivia Nuzzi> <Positive> [Clarifies question about why it is challenging to believe Trump will keep a staffer on the team.]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [No precise quote, but states that he has good relationships, asks Nuzzi to name anyone speaks bad about me on the record.]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People that are off the record -- I think it doesn't even exist. I think writers make it up. Generally, generally. Not in all cases, but generally.
<Olivia Nuzzi> <Positive> Well, you've cited anonymous sources before. Were they made up?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I say this: we have a really great White House. We have a really successful White House. We have -- I call it a well-oiled machine. It's ruled with tremendous people. And if you remember, you heard my story, when I got elected -- I haven't been to Washington my whole life, very rarely, probably never slept over.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All of a sudden, I'm president of the United States. I didn't know a lot of people in Washington. Now I know everybody that I want to know, a lot of people. And I bring changes, and those changes have been great changes. One of them over there.
<Olivia Nuzzi> <Positive> [Asks if Trump is happy in Washington, or misses New York.]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love it. I think it's great. Do I like it? Do I like the work? I love it. I actually really love it. Do you know why I love it? One simple reason, because nobody has accomplished as much in so short a period of time.
<Olivia Nuzzi> <Neutral> How are you measuring that, exactly?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> See the list that's in your hand?
<Olivia Nuzzi> <Neutral> But are you comparing it to a similar list from previous administrations?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm saying in the first two years of a president, and we're not even at two years, nobody has come close to it. No one. Take a look. I mean, you take a look, and nobody has come close. So, I heard you're gonna do a nasty story ...
<Olivia Nuzzi> <Positive> [Laughs]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, but it was. And at least I should say, I never— one of your things was that I offered Nick, that man right there, a job. I didn't. He just walked in!
<Nick Ayers> <Neutral> I told her that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He has a good relationship with the general. I didn't offer Nick the job. I mean, I'm telling you in front. Now, you can write that I did. But now, you have him, you have me, and I didn't offer him a job and he didn't accept a job. And there was no offer!
<Olivia Nuzzi> <Neutral> [Questions whether Trump met with Ayers in the White House residence to discuss the job.]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No! He's been in the residence, but the only time I can remember him being in the residence is with Mike. He's Mike's guy. And I would never offer him something without speaking to Mike. I don't do that. I don't take people from people... Even though I guess I can. There's no reason to do it though, so your narrative is wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's just amazing. We're all having lunch and it's so great that you're all here. This was not set up.
<Olivia Nuzzi> <Negative> [Jokes their interview seems spontaneous.]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When he says I didn't offer him a job. When he says I didn't, and when I didn't, it's just a false narrative. And I have a very good relationship with him. And if I didn't, I'd have no problem, I'd say, 'John, time to go.' But you know what? I'm very happy with him. He's happy with me.
<Olivia Nuzzi> <Negative> Have you ever had an argument in which you have --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I argue with everyone. Except Pompeo. I don't think I've had an argument with Pompeo!
<Mike Pompeo> <Positive> Stand by!
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Stand By!
<Mike Pence> <Neutral> The day is young.
<Sarah Huckabee Sanders> <Neutral> Let's make this the last question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not sure I've had an argument with Mike!
<Olivia Nuzzi> <Negative> [Asks if Trump is worried, looking ahead to the midterms and the Mueller investigation.]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the Mueller investigation, if anything, it's showing that the Democrats colluded with Russia and others. And it's showing there's no collusion from me. There never was. And yes, I'm very satisfied with the way that's going. It's a process. I'm very satisfied. I consider it to be an illegal investigation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It should've never been called. But is there anything there? Nothing. There's no collusion. There is no collusion. By the way, I don't know if you heard, Richard Burr just came out, he said, 'No, we have found no collusion.' He's a judge at the Senate committee. And you know, Nunes and all of them, Congressman Nunes came out and said there's no collusion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, you have two committees that spent much more than a year on this and they have found no collusion. Richard Burr just made the statement, just very recently. He said: 'I found no collusion.' You know why? Because there is no collusion. And they only interviewed, like, hundreds -- I mean, the number of people is, like, incredible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The money that's been spent is incredible. They've found no collusion. So, as far as other things are concerned, I think we're just doing great. Yes, am I concerned about the election? I'd rather win elections. I've never lost an election in my life, okay? You know that, right? I've run one time. It was for the presidency.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I actually had a senator come in and say, 'Mr. President, I've been a senator for 24 years. Sir, I think this is the way you should do it.' I said, 'Well, you know, I've just been a president for two years. It's the only time I ever ran for office.' He said, 'You know, that's one of the most amazing things that I've ever seen and I've been doing this a long time.' It is sort of interesting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I've only run one election, and I've won. But we have an election coming up, I think we're going to do well. I think, on the Senate side, we're looking very strong. In fact we're getting numbers in that, Olivia, races that people said six months ago we wouldn't even challenge, we could win. Or do very well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, either way we'll do very well. I won't name senators because I'm not looking to embarrass anybody or have somebody say, Oh, gee, you're wrong. But there are races for the Senate that really weren't going to be in play. I mean, one would be Heidi. I would say Heidi was not really in play and now I just see that she's down, supposedly, 14, 12 to 14, 10 to 14 points.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know. Maybe she'll do very well... But we'll see what happens. I think the Senate looks very good. In the House, I think it looks like we have a good chance of doing okay.
<Olivia Nuzzi> <Negative> [Asks if Trump has discussed a worst-case scenario.]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no, I don't discuss it. If we don't do okay, I think we'll be in great shape. And if we do okay, I think we're gonna do very well in the Senate, and I think we're gonna do much— here's the thing, I've given you, and without the regulations and without the taxes, I've given you the greatest economy in the history of our country or, at a minimum, close.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Four-point-two percent? Nobody thought that was even possible this early. You know, we're talking about early. Jobs numbers, production numbers, everything up. Confidence levels, everything. I think we're gonna do very well in the elections. If we don't, we'll do very well, we'll find a way to do very well.
<Olivia Nuzzi> <Negative> You're saying that the narratives about your White House and your staff are false, but why do ...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Asks Nuzzi to speak louder] Have you been told that you speak very softly?
<Olivia Nuzzi> <Negative> You were saying that the narratives about your White House and your staff are incorrect. Why do they...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Stated it was not true among everybody, just some people.] I'll be honest, I think Fox has covered it very accurately. They say, you know, we are producers. We produce like very few people anywhere produce. So, others don't cover it as accurately.
<Olivia Nuzzi> <Neutral> [Questions why non-Fox News narratives persisted, such as the question of his relationship with John Kelly.]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because you were gonna write a bad story about the relationship. I have a good relationship. Uh, general, what do you think of the president?
<John Kelly> <Positive> He's a great president. Do we disagree sometimes? We do. My job is to make sure that that man has all of the information available from whatever source so that he makes the best decision, and then, when that decision is made, my job is to then implement that decision. There is, to the best of my knowledge, no chaos in this building. We've gotten rid of a few bad actors, but everyone works very, very well together. The biggest surprise when we bring new people in, like Bill Shine, it's like, 'I thought this place was gonna be full of backstabbers and chaos and, Chief, people all like each other.' To the best of my knowledge ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Bill was actually a little disappointed. He thought it would be a lot more exciting.
<John Kelly> <Positive> So that's why, with all due respect to you, people like you listen to people that I've had to let go, and they continue to report about chaos and this type of thing. The president of the United States is who I serve, right after the people of the United States and the Constitution, and right now this president is well served, not just by me, but by an entire White House staff.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I respect you. I just wanted you to get the real picture. The timing was incredible. This was like, it was like ...
<Mike Pence> <Positive> We had a lunch plan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Is that a correct statement? This was just, like, perfect timing.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> You've got some excitement out on your lawn today. Hello, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A little excitement.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> What brings you here?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Are we on already?
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> We're on. We're live.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Wow, wow. That's good.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> We're actually -- we're on every channel.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We had a very exciting trip over here, I have to say.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> No kidding.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was good. It was good. How are you?
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> I'm doing OK. I was here for the baseball game. How about Steve Scalise last night?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he's great. How about that play? The first play of the game.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a great guy. Courageous.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> He couldn't...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Courageous.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Like you.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Yes, sure. Having you stop by live. I got some questions.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was mugged by the media.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> They've got questions for you. I'm hoping I can ask a lot of the questions. They've got...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very nice people.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> You know, the I.G. report came out yesterday. The FBI looked bad.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very bad.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Your FBI.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, no. It was Comey having to do -- talking about Comey, not my FBI. It was Comey. The people in the FBI are incredible. I would bet if you took a poll in the FBI, I would win that poll by more than anybody's ever won a poll. But the top people were horrible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at what happened: They were plotting against my election. Probably has never happened like that in terms of intelligence, in terms of anything else. But they were actually plotting against my election.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> The headline right now...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, he's a showboat. He's a grandstander. The FBI has been in turmoil. You know that. I know that. Everybody knows that. You take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil. Less than a year ago. It hasn't recovered from that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm actually proud, because I beat the Clinton dynasty...
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...I beat Bush dynasty, and now I guess hopefully I'm in the process of beating very dishonest intelligence. Because what they did was incredible and a real insult to millions of people that voted in that election on both sides.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> The headline right now from the Wall Street Journal, "DOJ Clinton Report Blasts Comey And Agents But Finds No Bias In Conclusion."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the end result was wrong. I mean, there was total bias. I mean, when you look at Peter Strzok and what he said about me, when you look at Comey all his moves.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I guess -- you know it's interesting it was a pretty good report, and then I say that the I.G. blew it at the very end with that statement, because when you read the report it was almost like Comey. He goes point after point about how guilty Hillary is and then he said, "But we're not going to do anything about it." The report -- the I.G. report was a horror show. I thought that one sentence of conclusion was ridiculous.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> What about, apparently, the love birds talking about you, "We will stop it"?
<Lester Holt> <Neutral> Monday, you met with the Deputy Attorney General Rob Rosenstein. Did you ask for a recommendation?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What I did is, was I going to fire [James] Comey. My decision. It was not...
<Lester Holt> <Negative> You had made the decision before they came over...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I... I was going to fire Comey. There is no good time to do it by the way. They...
<Lester Holt> <Positive> Because in your letter you said I... I accepted... I accepted their recommendation. So, you had already made the decision.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I was going to fire regardless of recommendation.
<Lester Holt> <Negative> So there [inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He made a recommendation He is highly respected. Very good guy. Very smart guy. The Democrats like him. The Republicans like him. He made a recommendation, but regardless of recommendation I was going to fire Comey, knowing there was no good time to do it. And in fact, when I decided to just do it I said to myself, I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats having lost an election that they should have won. And the reason they should have won it is, the electoral college is almost impossible for a Republican to win. Very hard. Because you start off at such a disadvantage. So, everybody was thinking they should have won the election. This was an excuse for having lost an election.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, they said they will stop me. While in the meantime the economy hit an all-time high this morning. Never been better. Jobless rate the lowest -- the best in 44 years, just came out. We're going to have some incredible things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're just announcing very big tariffs today on China because China has been -- look he's my friend, President Xi. He's a great man. He's a wonderful guy. But at some point we have to straighten it out. We lost $500 billion in trade deficits last year. We can't do that.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Is the new tariff something like 25 percent on...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's being announced right now as I speak.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> OK. You can announce it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Maybe you have the first announcement. You may...
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> What do you know about your tariffs?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You might beat the Wall Street Journal, all right. You just beat the Wall Street Journal by a lot. Well, we're just going to do $50 billion on $50 billion of high-technology equipment and other things coming into the country, because so much of our secrets -- you know, we have the great brain power in Silicon Valley, and China and others steal those secrets.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we're going protect those secrets. Those are crown jewels for this country. And, you know, you read so much about China, you read so much about other countries, we have the great brainpower right in this country, I'm proud to say. And you're certainly a member of that group.
<Lester Holt> <Negative> Are you angry with Mr. Comey because of his Russia investigation?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just want somebody that's competent. I am a big fan of the FBI. I love the FBI. I love the people of the FBI. but when you have a land of people taking on that investigation I think that.
<Lester Holt> <Neutral> But were you a fan of him taking up that investigation?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think that... about the Hillary Clinton investigation?
<Lester Holt> <Negative> No, about the Russia investigation and possible links between...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't care... look, look, let me tell you. As far as I'm concerned, I want that thing to be absolutely done properly. When I did this now, I said I probably maybe, will confuse people. Maybe I'll expand that, you know, I'll lengthen the time because... it should be over with, it should... in my opinion, it should have been over with a long time ago, because all it is, is an excuse, But, I said to myself I might even lengthen out the investigation, but I have to do the right thing for the American people. He's the wrong man for that position. [Break]
<Lester Holt> <Negative> Let me ask you about your termination letter to Mr. Comey. You write: I greatly appreciate you informing me on three separate occasions and I am not under investigation. Why did you put that in there?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because he told me that. I mean, he told me...
<Lester Holt> <Negative> He told you you weren't under investigation with regard to the Russia investigation?
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> I'm an America. What about the fact that there are a lot of people that say, "What's he doing? He's going to start a trade war? If he slaps 25 percent on $50 billion for China that's going to be bad for Americans"?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, the trade war was started many years ago by them and the United States lost. There's no trade war...
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> So you're saying we're on the losing end of it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, no. There is no trade war. They've taken so much. So last year $375 billion in trade deficit. We had a 300 -- with China. We had overall over $800 billion over a period of years -- each year close to $800 billion in losses on trade. Not going to happen anymore. It's not going to happen. Can't happen.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> A week ago you were up in -- up in Canada and you met with the G-7 people.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I was.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> That didn't end so well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, it ended well. For the United States, it ended well.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Well, the world community thinks the United States is turning our back on them.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, and I've heard that, I've heard that from others.
<Lester Holt> <Negative> Was it in a phone call? Did you meet face to face?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I had a dinner with him. He wanted to have dinner, because he wanted to stay on. We had a very nice dinner at the White House very early on.
<Lester Holt> <Neutral> He asked for that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That dinner was arranged. I think he asked for the dinner. And he wanted to stay on as the FBI head. And I said, I would, you know, consider will see what happens. But we had a very nice dinner. And at that time, he told me you are not under investigation, which I knew anyway.
<Lester Holt> <Negative> That was one meeting. What were the other two?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> First of all, when you are under investigation, you're giving all sorts of documents and everything. I knew I wasn't under... And I heard it was stated at the committee, at some committee level that I wasn't. Number one.
<Lester Holt> <Negative> So that didn't come directly from him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> But your opinion is that it's you got elected to represent America and America needs help.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We need protection. Everybody's taking advantage of us. The European Union made $151 billion on us last year. The -- if you look at -- I told you about China. You look at Japan, you look at South Korea, you look at so many -- and we help these countries militarily on top of everything else.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, you know, at what point does it stop? And when I left China, it was absolutely a fantastic meeting. We left, we hugged, we kissed. Everybody was leaving, and then I get onto Air Force One and the prime minister up there, Trudeau, didn't think, I guess, that we have any televisions on Air Force One. But they have, I think, 21 televisions or some ridiculous number...
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> And so, you saw it and you hit the roof.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you have to understand, we're hugging, we're saying goodbye, everybody's happy. I made changes to the agreement because I wanted it to be much better for the United States. I made changes. We're all happy. And then he got up and started saying that he doesn't want to be pushed around by the United States. Well, they charge us almost 300 percent on dairy products.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So, we can't do that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Then during the phone call, he said it, and then doing another phone call he said it. So, he said it once at dinner, and then he said it twice doing phone calls.
<Lester Holt> <Neutral> Did... did you call him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In one case, I called him. In one case, he called me.
<Lester Holt> <Neutral> And did you ask am I under under investigation?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I actually asked him, yes. I said, if it's possible, would you let me know if I am under investigation? He said you are not under investigation.
<Lester Holt> <Negative> But he's... he's given sworn testimony that there is an ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign, and possible collusion with the Russian government. You were the centerpiece of the Trump campaign. Is he being truthful when he says you're not under investigation?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, all I can tell you is... all, well, I know.. I know that I'm not under investigation, me personally. I'm not talking about campaigns. I'm not talking about anything else. I'm not under investigation
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Have you heard from any of the G-7...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. They all called me to wish me happy birthday yesterday.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Really? And how was that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was very...
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Not your birthday, but the message from the other side.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I took it very well.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, they all called. I mean, I have great friendships. The new prime minister of Italy is great. Got to meet him. Very -- very strong on immigration...
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Lester Holt> <Negative> Did you ask him to drop the investigation?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, never.
<Lester Holt> <Negative> Did anyone from the White House...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, in fact I want the investigation speeded up.
<Lester Holt> <Neutral> Did anyone from the White House ask him to end the investigation?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, why would we do that?
<Lester Holt> <Negative> Any surrogates on behalf of the White House?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not that I know of. Look, I want to find out if there was a problem with an election having to do with Russia, or by the way any, but... anybody else. Any other country. And, I want that to be so strong and so good. And, I want it to happen. I also want to have a really competent, capable director. He's not. He's a showboater. He's not my man, or not my man, and I didn't appoint him. He was appointed long before me. But I want somebody who's going to do a great job, and I will tell you, we're looking at candidates right now who could be spectacular and that's what I want for the FBI.
<Lester Holt> <Negative> What you said a moment ago about supporting the idea of investigation a lot of people would find it hard to believe that the man who just said that tweeted very recently it's a total hoax. It's a taxpayer charade.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...like I am, by the way. It seems that strong on immigration wins now.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Sure. But this is...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the Democrats, by the way, are very weak on immigration. If you notice when I came over, they were all saying about separating the families and that's a Democrat bill. That's Democrats wanting to do that, and they could solve it very easily by getting together. But they think it's a good election point. I think it's a horrible election point for them.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Ultimately Congress has got to change the laws...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They got to change the law.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> ...but at the same time, Mr. President, people say, "Look, you rip these families apart. Even though it is the law, it's heartless."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But that's the law. And that's what the Democrats gave us. And we're willing to change it today if they want to get in and negotiate, but the just don't want to negotiate. They're afraid of -- they're afraid of security for our country. They're afraid of a wall.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Although I must tell you, most people now really -- they want the wall, they want to stop the drugs, they want to stop a lot of people from coming in that shouldn't be here, like MS-13.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I think that looking into me and, the campaign...look, I have nothing to do. This was set up by the Democrats. There is no collusion between me and my campaign and the Russians. The other thing is the Russians did not affect the vote. And everybody seems to think that.
<Lester Holt> <Negative> There is an investigation under way though, an FBI investigation. Is that a charade?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't know if it's an FBI, or if it's, there's so many investigations. I don't know if it's an FBI investigation or if it's a Congress, if it's the Senate, or the House...
<Lester Holt> <Neutral> Well, James Comey testified there was an an FBI investigation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, but I think they're also helping the House and the Senate. So, you probably have FB.. FBI, but you have House, you have Senate. They have other investigations.
<Lester Holt> <Negative> But when you put out tweets it's a total hoax, it's a taxpayer charade, and you're looking for a new FBI director, are you not sending that person a message to lay off?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I'm not doing that. I think that we have to get back to work, but I want to find out... I want to get to the bottom. If Russia hacked, if Russia did anything having to do with our election,
<Lester Holt> <Positive> Well, there's already, already intelligence from virtually every intelligence agency that yes, that happened.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right. A lot of -- I was up on Capitol Hill yesterday with Steve Scalise. They were having a leadership meeting. It sounds like they were going to take a vote on a couple of different bills on immigration probably next week.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> One of them the Goodlatte bill, the other is something more moderate. Would you sign either one of those?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm looking at both of them. I certainly wouldn't sign the more moderate one.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> What does the bill have to have in it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I -- I need a bill that gives this country tremendous border security. I have to have that. We have to get rid of catch-and-release.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Got to have the wall? Does that mean the wall?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to have the wall. If we don't have the wall, there's no bill. We have to have catch-and-release. We catch a criminal, a real criminal, a rough tough criminal, we take his name and then we release him. And we say, "Please show up to court in a couple of months." You know what the chances of getting him to court are? Like zero. OK. It's crazy. Then we have the lottery program, right? It's called lotter-visery.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you this. If Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections, I think it's a horrible thing, and I want to get to the bottom of it, and I want to make sure it will never ever happen.
<Lester Holt> <Negative> Were angry with James Comey when he went public and said he can't support your unsubstantiated charges of wire tapping... that your your predecessor wiretapped you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was surprised he said it but I wasn't angry. There's a big thing going on right now which is spying, and it's.... you can call it anything you want. The, the unmasking, and the spying, and to me, that's the big story right now. That's a very very big story.
<Lester Holt> <Negative> You didn't take that as a sign of disloyalty that came out and contradicted you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I didn't... I didn't. I don't think of it is loyalty. I mean, I want, whoever the director is, I want them to do the right thing.
<Lester Holt> <Negative> And what about when he went public and said that there was in fact an FBI investigation looking at your campaign and Russia. Did that anger you? I ask that because there's... there is a sense that there was a building anger here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, I have that. I have that. No, no, no. I.. I know, every once in a while you'll see that in the newspaper, anger, somebody will report, or they'll have fall sources that maybe don't exist, because of the media, the way the media is. No, I will tell you I think that, um, I want, very simply a great FBI director.
<Lester Holt> <Neutral> And we expect that they would would continue on with this investigation?
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Diversity Lottery Program.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, well, the lottery visa.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> OK. One of the...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK, whatever. They have fifty names. Still -- everyone of them has lottery. Do you know what lottery is? That's when you pick names to come into the country. Well, when a country gives names, they're not giving us their finest. So we're picking people, it's not good. We have to end that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have to end a couple of them and we are going to be so secure as a country. Now, with all of that being said, we're doing a great job. ICE -- we're getting MS-13 out by the thousands. But we shouldn't have to be going into towns in Long Island and other places and getting them out. You know, it's almost like we're liberating towns. It's incredible.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> You mentioned court. Regarding a legal proceeding, you got Robert -- the -- the Mueller investigation. I know we, kind of, touched on that a little while ago. Rudy Giuliani is out this morning. He said the investigation should go away. Time to fold up the tent. Or it's time to investigate the investigators. Are you on the same page...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, we have 13 angry Democrats. There are -- I call them 13 angry Democrats, and others worked for Obama for eight years. I mean, they have no Republicans, you have no -- it's a very unfair situation. But the I.G. report totally exonerates -- I mean, if you look at the results and if you look at the head investigator is saying, "We have to stop Trump from becoming president," well, Trump became president and we have the best economy today we've ever had.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh yeah sure, I expect that.
<Lester Holt> <Negative> General Flynn is a part of his investigation. You know, Sally Yates recently testified that the White House was notified that he had been compromised, he was at risk of being blackmailed. It was eighteen days later that he was finally fired. During that eighteen days he had access, I assume, to all the nation's top secrets. One day, you meet on the issue of Comey...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Lester Holt> <Negative> ...and you fire in a humiliating way while he's sitting in a room with his colleagues and it's appearing on the TV.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Cause my White House Counsel Don McGahn, came back to me, and did not sound like an emergency of any... it didn't make it sound like he was, you know... and she actually didn't make it sound that way either, in the hearings the other day, like it had to be done immediately. This man has served for many years. He's a general. He's a, in my opinion, a very good person. I believe that it would be very unfair to hear from somebody who we don't even know and immediately run out and fire a general. Now...
<Lester Holt> <Neutral> She was the acting Attorney General at the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have much greater border security than we ever would have had.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And when we do it -- when we have the laws changed, it'll be like perfecto.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Rudy says that you should not talk to a lawyer.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A lot of people say that. Look...
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Getting the I.G. report and stuff that's going on.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're getting people who say something a little bit off. "Is it a nice day?" "Well, you know, no, it's not a great day." "Oops, you lied." He goes -- you know, got problems.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> What...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People are afraid of that. And I would like to talk, but it seems to be very biased.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Uh, my White House counsel came to me. They had, I believe two meetings. And we ultimately fired, but was fired for a different reason.
<Lester Holt> <Neutral> You're talking about General Flynn.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> General Flynn, yes.
<Lester Holt> <Negative> Because of, because of lying to the Vice President.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, but everything plays in. Everything plays into it. But we fired him because he said something to the vice president that was not so.
<Lester Holt> <Neutral> Did you know that he had had that received payments from the Russian government, that he had received payments from the Turkish government?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no but Obama perhaps knew because he had clearance from the Obama administration. And his clearance... and, and this is something they never want to report. He had clearance from the Obama administration, the highest clearance you can have. And, I think it's a very unfair thing that the media doesn't talk about that. You know you're talking about 2015. I don't know that I knew him in 2015.
<Lester Holt> <Negative> The Senate intelligence committee wants, wants info... information from the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Unit about your finances, your business' finances.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> One of -- some of the texts -- and we're not going to quote them -- were very...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Vicious.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> ...vicious regarding people who support you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Vicious. I have the greatest supporters in the world. By the way, they're the smartest. They're the hardest working. They pay taxes. They're incredible. They're loyal. I have the bikers. I have the -- the construction workers.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have them all. I have -- by the way, I have the FBI. You go into the FBI and take a poll of the real FBI, not the scum on top, not Comey and that group of people that are total thieves...
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Most of those are gone.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know how Peter Strzok is still working there, to be honest with you, OK.
<Lester Holt> <Positive> Can you tell us whether you, your family, your business is... your surrogates have accepted any investments, any loans from Russian individual or institutions?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, in fact I just sent a letter sent to Lindsey Graham from one of the most prestigious law firms. in the country, a tremendous, highly-rated law firm that I have nothing to do with Russia. I have no investments in Russia. None whatsoever. I don't have property in Russia. A lot of people thought I owned office buildings in Moscow. I don't have property in Russia. And I am in very... I'm, I mean... I'm in total compliance in every way. Now I have to tell you, I file documents, hundreds of pages worth of documents, with the Federal Elections Bureau. Everybody's seen that. I built a great company. But I'm not involved with Russia. I have had dealings over the years where I sold a house to a very wealthy Russian, many years ago. I had the Miss Universe pageant, which I owned for quite a while, I had it in Moscow, long time ago. But other than that, I have nothing to do with Russia.
<Lester Holt> <Neutral> And one last a question on this matter, did you ever...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I have a certified letter, just so you understand. It... I'm not just saying that. I've given the letter. I've given a letter to Senator Lindsey Graham. He has the letter, and I think frankly... I assume he's going to give the letter out. But it says, I am not involved in Russia. No loans. No nothing.
<Lester Holt> <Negative> Did you worry at all when you made the decision to fire Comey when you did, the day before Lavrov was here in the White House, and the Russian ambassador. Did you think through the optics of the way this would look?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I never thought about. It was set up a while ago. And frankly I could have waited but, what difference does it make? I'm not looking for cosmetics. I'm looking to do a great job for the country. I'm looking to create jobs. I'm looking to create strength and security. I'm looking to have strong borders. I'm looking for things like that. I think it's really a good thing that I meet with people. Now, this is a public meeting, because you know, when you cover this, the people watching may say, oh he met with Lavrov. Well, this was announced that I'm meeting with Lavrov, just like the number of days ago I spoke... had a very good conversation, very public in the sense that everybody knew this was taking place. I meet, I... I talk all the time. I just spoke, with the head of, the new head of South Korea, who just got elected. I speak with the head of India. I speak with the head of China. I have to speak with Putin also. It's called Russia. But when I spoke with Putin, he asked me whether or not I would see Lavrov. Now what, should show I say, no I'm not going to see him? I said I will see him. During that discussion with Lavrov, I think we had a great discussion having to do with Syria, having to do with the Ukraine, and maybe that discussion will lead to a lot less people getting killed, and will lead ultimately to peace, so I'm... I'm okay with those discussions Lester, I think it's a good thing, not a bad thing.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> He's working in H.R. This is...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's even worse.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Mr. President, this is your FBI.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know. But do you know what I've done? And you know this. I've told you this. I'm so involved. Great new secretary of state.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Just -- I have a fantastic relationship now with North Korea. You know, there were missiles being thrown about.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People aren't thinking about it anymore. I said on the Department of Justice, I would stay uninvolved. Now, I may get involved at some point if it gets worse. I say I'm staying uninvolved. I'm letting this report go through. I did nothing wrong. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. There was no one...
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> But, Mr. President, I was on Capitol Hill yesterday, and there are a number of congressional Republicans who are -- you know, they're trying to get some documents from your Department of Justice, your FBI.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I tried to stay involved. I may not stay involved, again -- uninvolved. Because they have to get the documents. Look, I think everybody...
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> But your FBI is stonewalling.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think that Road -- Rog...
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Rosenstein.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...Rosenstein thinks that you have to get the documents. I really believe that. I saw him yesterday. He gave me a briefing. It think that he believes you have to get the documents.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> What did he say regarding the I.G. report?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he wasn't thrilled about it. I mean, you know, you can't be if you're in there now. But it really was talking about the past. It's not talking about us. It's talking about before us. And it's talking about the election.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What they did during the election was a disgrace. It's probably never happened in our country before. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. What's going to happen when we go further? And there was total bias. I mean, total bias.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> From what you've seen so far, should James Comey be locked up?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, look, I would never want to get involved in that. Certainly he -- they just seem like very criminal acts to me. What he did was criminal. What he did was a terrible thing to people. What he did was so bad in terms of our Constitution, in terms of the well-being of our country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What he did was horrible. Should he be locked up? Let somebody make a determination. Look at all the dishonest things that crooked Hillary did. Look at -- look at what -- what's gone on. It's very sad.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Sounds like he was using a private e-mail, too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He had a private e-mail. That was -- of all the things, that wasn't to me maybe the most interesting, but it was probably the funniest.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Because she got in big trouble for her private e-mail. Oh, James Comey's using one, too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was a little bit of a surprise, I have to say.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Yeah. From what we've seen, though, regarding the I.G. report, it -- it sounds like Comey made some bad judgments but nothing criminal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, if you look at what happened -- and don't forget all of these people like Strzok, what he did was criminal, Strzok and so many others. McCabe is now...
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Do you mean biased the analysts?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, they all work for Comey. And Comey knew everything that was going on. You think McCabe didn't tell him everything? McCabe told him everything, and McCabe is up for criminal right now. And most people...
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> And now he's suing the Department of Justice.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he's now suing. And it's a total mess. They're all going against each other. No, I -- I think Comey was the ringleader of this whole, you know, den of thieves. It was a den of thieves.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Are you confident that, either through the congressional investigators or the I.G. report or new management at the -- at the FBI, things are going to work out..
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think so. I think so.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> ...things are cleaning up and we'll get to the bottom of all that stuff?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do believe so. I think its happening. It's happening slowly, but it's happening. I think Christopher Wray's a -- very different from Comey. Which is what you need, you need different. You need, like, the opposite. And he's moving step by step.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you're going to see a whole new, very proud FBI. I think that the Justice Department will end up being great. It's all going to happen. It's all going to work out. But I tried to stay as much uninvolved as I can.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> You were very involved in going to Singapore, negotiating with Kim Jong-un.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> When you finally met him and sat across the table from -- you know, we've heard a lot of bad things about little rocket man. And suddenly you guys seem to be best friends.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We got along very well. We had a good chemistry. I don't know if that's supposed to be popular or politically correct to say. But we really did. We had good chemistry. You haven't had any rockets shot up in the air for seven months. You haven't had any research. They just blew up their test site. They're blowing up their engine test site for ballistic missiles. He's giving us back our great heroes who died, as you know.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're getting their remains back. And I've had so many people, so many parents, so many fathers and daughters and sons asking me, "Please, please."
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is during the campaign and after. I say, I don't have exactly a good relationship. Anyway, during the meeting -- and we really did hit it off. During the -- you know, good chemistry.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> You -- you have since used some very friendly words regarding him. And you're taking some heat for that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. I mean, that's what it is. I take heat. But what am supposed to do, walk out and say "terrible"? I mean, I -- I got along with him very well. We have good chemistry. I asked him, "The remains; I'd like to get them."
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He said, "Yes, we will do that." They are already starting to produce the remains of these great young soldiers who were left in North Korea.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're getting the remains, and nobody thought that was possible.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> The way you have described things, it sounds like you feel that he's on the road to denuking.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, absolutely. It's in the agreement: It says he will denuclearize.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right. I know it's, kind of, broad...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, it's funny -- it's funny when you see the fake news, because -- and you guys aren't fake. But I signed an agreement where we get everything. Everything. But they say "Trump lost because he agreed to meet. Trump agreed to meet."
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Got the picture.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's a funny thing. You got to watch CNN. I mean, what -- what a fraud it is. They go, "Trump is..."
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> They're listening. They're right behind you, right there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's fine. Do you hear me? "Trump agreed to meet." I say I agreed to meet. Of course you got to agree to meet. If you don't agree to meet, you know what you're going to have? You're going to have nuclear war, that's what you're going to have. I have a great relationship. He gave us back our hostages. I didn't pay $1.8 billion. I paid nothing.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it was very smart that he did it. He gave us back our hostages. He's giving us back the remains of probably 7,500 soldiers.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. There's a tremendous number of soldiers. Tremendous number of MIAs, you know, folks that just never -- they've never been found.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> It sounds like...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And they -- and by the way, they know where many of these bodies are.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> What -- what is the stage of the meetings now? I know, you know...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's great. Mike Pompeo is just leaving there. He was in South Korea.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Any developments [Inaudible]?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're getting along great with South Korea. We're getting along great with China. Probably until this morning, because we just did a tariff in China. But that's OK, because I have a wonderful relationship with President Xi. We'll all work it out. He understands it's unfair.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They can't believe they got away with it for so long, Steve.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They can't believe it. I mean, they got away with it for 25 years. I'm not just blaming Obama. I'm blaming many presidents and leaders.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> At what point...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It should have never happened.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> At what point do the sanctions come off of North Korea?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When we can be sure there will be no more nuclear.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> How close are we to that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very close. We're very close to getting it started. He wants to do it. He wants to do something great with his country. He wants to make his country great.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> So, you are saying that you'll relieve the sanctions once whatever he's going to do...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Once we know...
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> ...is completely -- that stuff doesn't work anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Once we know that it can't happen.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm telling you right now, with the relationship I have, it's not going to happen. Hey, you haven't had a rocket test in seven months.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was with Prime Minister Abe, another good friend of mine from Japan. I said, "When's the last time you had a rocket flying over Japan?" He said, "It has not happened." I said, "It won't happen. Don't worry about."
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right. Are we close to seeing Mr. Kim here at the White House?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It could happen. I mean, yeah, I would have him.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Did they talk about that...[Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. I think it's something that could happen. Yeah. Hey, he's the head of a country. And I mean he is the strong head. Don't let anyone think anything different.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He speaks and his people sit up at attention. I want my people to do the same.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Well, just before you met with him, he cleaned house. Three of his top generals, some of the hardliners he fired.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, that's what I hear.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Then you go over there. And you got -- you took some heat over saluting one of the generals.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think he fired at least, OK, when you say he fired.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Three that we know of.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think maybe fired at least. "Fired" may be a nice word. That's right, I met a general. He saluted me, I saluted him back. And I guess their using that as another sound bite. I mean, you know, I think I'm being respectful to the general. We are -- we have a very good relationship with North Korea.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When I was talking to President Obama, he essentially was ready to go to war with North Korea. He felt you had to almost go to war. And I did ask him: "Have you spoken to him?" He goes, "No." I said, "Do you think it would be a good thing to speak to him maybe?"
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. Because if you go to war there, you're not talking about 100,000 lives, which is a lot.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You're talking about 30, 40, 50 million lives.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Seoul is 30 miles off the border. They don't even need nuclear weapons to take out Seoul. They have thousands of cannons -- they call them cannons; they have big guns -- thousands pointed right at Seoul. We have a really great relationship for the first time ever. No president's ever had this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I get hit by these fakes back here. Not all of them. Some are phenomenal. But I get hit, because I went there, I gave him credibility. I think it's great to give him credibility. Here's what we got: everything, point after point after point.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> One point, I think it was in the last week, 10 days, things are going faster in Washington, just saying. But...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're having a lot of fun, right? So supposing Hillary got elected instead of Trump, do you think it would be so exciting? Your ratings would be way down. Number one show in the morning, folks.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Well, thank you. I've heard you say the others -- in cable news. That's right. It was within the last...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Actually also beyond cable news you're doing pretty well.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> We're doing OK. Thanks for dropping by...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like ratings.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> All the others [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I study ratings, broadcasting.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> You had mentioned the NFL players and the -- you know, some taking a knee. And you would like to hear some of the stories of people who you should pardon. And you mentioned professional athletes. Have you heard from any of them?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I haven't heard. You know, they were all saying, "Oh, it has nothing to do with the flag. It's the way we've been treated," and in the meantime they're making $15 million a year. Look, I'm all for the athletes. I think it's great. I love athletics. I love sports. But they shouldn't get the politics involved.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When you're in a stadium and they broadcast that national anthem, you got to stand, and you got to be proud, and you got to have your hand up, and you got to do everything that's right. And then go out and play really tough football.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And once you leave that stadium, go and do whatever you want to do. Run for office, or do whatever. But I did say, you know, I have this tremendous power of pardon. And Kim Kardashian came in, and the woman 22 years in jail
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> People can't believe that you would be listening to Kim Kardashian.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I did. I don't know her, and I met her and she was really nice, I have to say, and very capable. But she came in and she said, "This is a very unfair situation." I looked at her and I agreed. Twenty -- she's in there for 22 years, she's got another 20 years to serve, and you have drug dealers that are doing big stuff and they get a two-month sentence, OK. You know, it was just unfair. And I thought it was a beautiful scene when that woman left prison and ran over to -- it looked like her grandkids, it was a couple of big strong guys.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Big strong guys, some wonderful women. They were all hugging and kissing and everyone's crying. To me that was a beautiful scene. Well, she thanked me but, you know, thanked Kim, because I wouldn't have known about it.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I told the NFL players, I mean, indirectly -- I said, "You have somebody that's aggrieved" -- because they're saying people are aggrieved, OK. "Let me know about it. I'll look at it. If they're aggrieved, I will pardon them, I'll get them out."
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> I'm shocked you haven't heard from a single one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think I've from one. Now, maybe they've called the staff, but I have not personally heard from one.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Yeah. Speaking of the staff...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because I don't know if it's a real issue. I don't think it's a real issue.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Sarah Huckabee Sanders, your press secretary, she's -- she took a lot of heat yesterday from the people behind you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, she did? I didn't know that.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Well, she did. There was some suggestion that maybe she'd be leaving the White House.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think so. You know, look at a certain point everyone, sort of, leaves. You have to leave. I'm, sort of, just standing -- I'm like a ship, just keep going, bing, bing. But Sarah loves this job and she's announced -- not with me, I read that same report. Somebody put it out, I think it was CBS -- when she said it's a false report.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it's fake news. But at some point I'm sure she'll leave, like everybody leaves and we'll get somebody else. But Sarah's done a fantastic job. No, I don't think she's leaving.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> What do you make of the...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In fact, she was very insulted that they came out and said that.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I don't think she's leaving.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> What do you make of the back-and-forth between her and the press? Because sometimes it gets loud.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think the press -- I think the press treats Sarah very unfairly. That White House correspondent...
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> But I think some of them feel she's not answering their questions, so they're going to ask it again and ask [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I gave a press conference in Singapore that was like an hour and a half, and that was like the biggest press group I've ever seen. And I answered every single question. I'd answer anybody's question. I guess that's not supposed to be my job. I'm here with you today, you're giving me a lot of...
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Well, thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...lot of interesting questions. But -- but, Steve, I think Sarah is really a good person and a nice person, very capable. She's got a lot of the father's genes, because her father is great.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Mike. OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Don't forget he got up there on that debate stage and he said, "Nobody's going to beat Trump." And I even decided to -- he was running. And I even decided to wear a Trump tie. And I said, "I love that guy." I loved him, OK. Mike, is a very talented guy and Sarah's a very talented person.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they treat her very badly. What they did Sarah at the White House Correspondents -- now, the only difference I would have done, I would have walked out. I thought she should have walked out instead of sitting there. But, you know...
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> She took a high road.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She took a very high road. Sometimes...
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ...you don't take such a high road.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> We had Stewart Varney on our air...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, he is great. I love Stewart.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> That little part, he's going to be running every day now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I love him. And he's right. He knows what he's talking about.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Well, he suggested that the next quarter GDP could be 4 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they're predicting -- you know, the Atlanta Fed predicted 4.8 percent. I think, you know, that's a lot. Don't forget, then I got elected, I took this thing over, it was 1.2 and each point is $3 trillion and 10 million jobs. You know, a point -- people will say at home, "Oh, it's a point, what difference does it make?" Well, it was 1.2 and it was going down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You probably saw this morning I put out, they would have raised your taxes instead of cut your taxes, and they were going to put on more regulations. The last thing we need is regulations. I actually think my regulation cutting had more of an impact on the economy than the tax cuts.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> When you were running, you said, "For every regulation we enact, I will cut two."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> But you didn't cut two, you're cutting a much bigger number.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. 22, it turned out. 22. And -- and by the way, you need regulation. I want the cleanest water in the world, I want the cleanest air in the world, I want that air to be so perfect. And our air now is better than it was two years ago, with all of the talk and the nonsense.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Clean -- crystal clean water, clean air. But I also want our companies to be competitive so they can go around the world and compete. And we were shutting down companies over the environment and they weren't doing anything wrong. And that's jobs.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right. But there are some who say, "Look the EPA is relaxing a lot of rules that are out there to protect people."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Only rules that don't mean anything or rules that are duplicative. You know, rules where you have...
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> There's a lot of those.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, not only that, I mean, some of them you have nine different times you have to get the same thing approved by different agencies.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> To build a highway in this country takes 19 years of approvals. I have it down to two years. And you'll get rejected if it's wrong, if it's environmentally bad.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I have it down to two years. I want to get it down to one year. And that's indicative of everything else, too. A company comes in from China, from Japan they want to spend a tremendous amount of money on building a plant or something, right? It takes them seven years to get a permit, and they don't do it because it's too long.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have it down to one year and even faster. Now, if they're wrong, we know immediately.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, you don't have to wait seven years. How about going through the process seven years and getting rejected? How about a highway that spends 19 years getting approved and then in the last vote they get a three-to-two vote no?
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That happens oftentimes and they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the approval. Not going to happen anymore.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> I saw a headline on Drudge, I think this morning, unemployment at a 44-year low.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, yeah. Drudge is great, by the way. Matt Drudge is a great gentleman who -- who really -- I don't know, he's got an ability to capture the stories that people want to see. But that was the number one story on Drudge. Forty-four year low unemployment, and -- and I saw that in very big letters actually...
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...and I said "That makes me very proud."
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Another story out there was -- this past week is, while you did meet with Kim Jong-un, it sounds like you and Mr. Putin may be sitting down sometime soon. What -- what can you tell us about that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We may. And -- and it started because a reporter shouted to me, "Should Putin be in the G-7?" I said, "No, he should be in the G-8." It used to be the G-8 a few years ago, and I think President Obama didn't like him or -- even though they gave advance notice about the election to Obama...
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...people forget about that. You know, Obama was told by the CIA or somebody, FBI, about Russia. He didn't do anything about it. How come he never gets blamed?
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In September, just before the election, my election, he should have done it, because maybe I would have won by more.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right. Yesterday, a big day. Not only did the A.G. report come out, but it was your birthday.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Get any good presents?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I got a lot of good kisses. I got a lot of phone calls from people that I would never have gotten phone calls from. I got phone calls from...
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Who'd you get the kisses from?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> From my beautiful wife...
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...who's really doing great, she's doing great. But -- and my kids.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Oh, speaking of your wife...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah?
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> ...you know, we saw a story -- I think as you were heading to the chopper you said, you know, she can't fly for a month.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> One month. Well, the doctor said, "Don't fly for a month," but she'll be able to very shortly.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Because she's on the mend?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, she's in great shape. She's like perfect.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She -- somebody said, "Did she have a face lift?" No. "Did she have this? Did she have that?" I mean, the speculation, even after the doctors gave a full -- and these are White House doctors. They give -- you know, they give really straight stuff. But no, she's doing fantastically well.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> We had your son Don Jr. on our show, and he said he was not getting you anything for your birthday because you've got everything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I just want to have a successful country. I'll be honest, I -- this is so intensive. We've done more -- I don't say this in a bragging way, actually some of the haters actually say this. We've done more in 500 days -- so now it's 510 days -- than any 500-day president first term by far.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that's what I want to do. I want to really -- you know, I got elected to make America great again. Very simple: Make America great again. That's what we're doing. And we are respected around the world. You take a look at Iran, they're not talking about Iran taking over the Middle East. I took that crazy deal that Obama gave them away. Iran is not looking to the Mediterranean anymore. You know, they had to go through a lot of territory to get there.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're looking to survive. But I will tell you, some day soon they're going to come back and they're going to want to negotiate a deal and we'll make a deal. But they were nasty. They were very, very nasty, and it had to be stopped. I took away the deal, and I think they've been treating America with much more respect.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I have to say that you don't see the little boats circling our boats anymore; do you notice that? Remember with Obama, you had this beautiful destroyer, you had this Annapolis captain on the boat, and he's sitting there, and you could see he's like a boiler waiting to explode, because he was giving orders. And they were circling us with those boats, right? And he wanted to shoot the hell out of them...
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Well, they were harassing -- trying to engage...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He wanted to -- they were harassing our -- our guys. And he wanted to shoot the hell out of them.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you don't see that stuff anymore. By the way, when they captured our 10 sailors and made them get on their knees, you're not going to see that anymore.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> I hear the bells in the distance. We're coming up on 9 o'clock in the East. How're you going to celebrate Father's Day?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Work. I'm going to work. I'm going to actually be calling North Korea. I'm going to be calling...
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> What are you going to say to him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just had -- right now I have a call from your friend from France, Emmanuel.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> What are you going to tell him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm going to tell him, "You have to treat us better on trade." European Union's not treating us well on trade. I love trade. You know, trades always been my thing. Even 20 years ago when I'd be talking to you, trade was always my thing. It's probably -- I'm getting a lot of credit for what we're doing foreign, but I -- I think my best thing is going to be trade.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have to straighten out our trade. You know, we're doing well despite our bad trade deals. After we do our trade deals, what 'til you see the numbers.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Right. Mr. President, I don't think in the history -- anybody ever know of the sitting president come out on the North Lawn?
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> Never.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Never. Never happened.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Secret Service is thrilled...[Laughter] ...as I -- as I stand here.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> On the way...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look at these guys they're ready to..
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Yeah. I feel very secure.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> You know what? He --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is definitely your son. By the way...
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> It's fine. He's not...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...I looked at him -- I look at him, there's no question that's your son.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> That's very kind of you. All right, Mr. President, thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> [In Progress] Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. He's filing papers today to be on the New Hampshire ballot. Mr. Trump, did I get you out of bed? You ready to go?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [On Phone] No, you didn't get me out of bed. I'm ready to go. I'm leaving for New Hampshire very shortly. We'll be filing our documents today. That will be very exciting actually.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> You'll be on the ballot there. The polls show you should expect to do well. The polls are all over the place to be frank. Quinnipiac, the national polls show you locked up with Carson, as you know.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> They see a big bump for Rubio and Cruz after the debate. People were expecting that. Now we see it. There are also state polls that tell a different story in terms of your growth.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Here it's stagnant on the national side but in states like Georgia, South Carolina, you're seeing pops. Make the case for why you believe the polls say you're doing just fine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> One just came out in Florida and I'm way ahead. Just came out a little while ago. I'm way ahead. The polls I've done very well in.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's amazing, last week we had ABC/"Washington Post", I was way ahead in a national poll that came out and CBS came out where I was slightly behind by two points and everybody thought it was bigger than the Benghazi story with Hillary Clinton. It was amazing. I said well, what about the ABC/"Washington Post" poll? They said, oh, well, we didn't see that one. So you know, I think it's a pretty unfair playing field. But that's okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because ABC/"Washington Post" was a great poll for me. It came out just about the same time as CBS. It's an incredible thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think I'm doing really well in New Hampshire. We're doing really well - You saw yesterday, we took the lead back in Iowa. We have a huge lead in Florida and South Carolina. We continue to go on. Look, the bottom line is it starts on February 1st.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everybody will see what happens on February 1st. But you know, I'm getting the biggest crowds by far. Yesterday other than Sara Murray didn't report it very well, because she never flips the cameras to show the lines. I think she's absolutely terrible, your reporter. We had a line that went down to Park Avenue from Trump Tower where --
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> I drove past it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was an incredible scene there.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> I drove past it --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] people said they have never seen anything like it.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> I saw the lines. The book's selling well.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If you listen to Sara Murray, you would think were three people standing in the atrium of Trump Tower.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> No, no, no. That's not the way she did it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that is the way she reports. She has no idea --
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> That's the way you took it. I understand.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Either she's a very unemotional person or she's not a very good reporter. One or the other.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> All right. Let's talk about the tactic. First of all, I opened up your introduction and interpretation of the polls to give you your say. I didn't mention the Florida poll because our people in house don't like the methodology of that poll. We're not using it until we can confirm the numbers. The other ones I gave you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But if somebody else were leading, I guarantee you'd be using it.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> No, absolutely not. If the methodology isn't good, we don't use it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, fine. I accept your word on that, Chris.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> I appreciate it. I take yours as well. So when you use these tactics of negativity about the media, I get that they are working for you, but it's also my job to check them on you. You lumped me in with what you would call the Sara Murrays.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> You know she's a top-notch reporter.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know that. No, I don't know that. I don't see it.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> She does a good job. Well you've said the same thing about me, too, though, right? If I say something you don't like, you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You are a top notch. I don't see it with Sara Murray.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> All right. I'll take it for today.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She never reports on my crowd sizes. You know, we have the biggest crowds. She shows her face, never scans the room and shows the tremendous crowds I'm getting.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> All right. Well let's make it about you, not Sara Murray.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know, it's one of those things. Maybe she's a low-key individual that doesn't believe in showing crowds. I see other people, they have crowds that are tiny by comparison and everybody shows their crowds. They never show mine.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Everybody is uniform in their reporting that you are certainly the biggest celebrity in the race. Nobody is questioning that. It's how it will translate into you as a leader, into you as president. That's what the testing is about.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> However, these tactics have worked well for you. The question is will they continue to? Yesterday you were outspoken about how you thought Hillary Clinton had gotten a pass, only easy questions in the debate. Now we both know you tweeted that you thought Anderson did a great job in the debate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said he did do a very good job. I thought he did a terrific job.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> He was the one asking the question. So how did she not get good questions if he did a great job?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And by the way, he asked them tough questions but they weren't tough like the questions that we were getting and the questions that I was getting, it wasn't even a question from John Harwood. He was making wise guy statements with the questions.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> Right. But that's one example from one guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they went to Governor Huckabee, who is a terrific person by the way, and he asked him a question about me and Governor Huckabee let him have it. I thought he did a great job. The difference is, I thought Anderson Cooper did a great job, but comparison - and they were tough enough questions but they weren't tough like us. Ours weren't even questions.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They were statements given over by the moderator.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> I know. But Mr. Trump, can you imagine what would happen if he came out against Hillary Clinton -- Here were his first questions. "Will you say anything to get elected?" "Do you change your political identity based on who you're talking to?" Are you a progressive or a moderate?" He then looks at Bernie Sanders and says, "Is there anybody else here who's not a capitalist?" And then starts to dictate what he says that the GOP made to go ad against him as a socialist who honeymooned in Russia.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> These were heavy blows that Anderson brought. He tested them, he showed what you want to see in a debate which is when I punch you in the nose, how do you respond? This should be something you should embrace, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The question is, did he ask about the e-mails in any great length? He asked Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders somehow gave her a pass. That was the end of --
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Bernie did. Not Anderson Cooper. That was Bernie's judgment, not Coop's.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. Did he go into the emails with Hillary during that question - during the questions?
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Sure he did. He did his job. This is about you guys, not about the media.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I understand. There were other things. There were a lot of things that could have been asked of Hillary that could have been nasty, so nasty I don't want to bring them up. There are many things he could have asked.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> With that being said, I thought Anderson was professional and tough. But if you look at the questions that were asked of us, they were much tougher than that.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> All right. So let's leave that as it is. The obvious --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They weren't even questions. They were statements.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> The obvious takeaway, I think we'll both agree on this, is that you should do CNN as often as possible because it is obviously the fairest place doing the job at the highest level. Agreed?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you'll get your best ratings.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Agreed? Agreed. Let's move on. The book comes out, the reaction is huge. People are looking at it, buying it, buying multiple copies.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> We start to look inside. There are two things I want to get your response on. There's this guy, Michael D'Antonio. I know that you were working with him in the beginning when he was doing his research then you cut him out. He tells a different story about how you got your start, the help you got from your family. My question to you is this. What is wrong with acknowledging the help that your father, who's one of the legends in New York City in terms of building a better city, what's wrong with the fact that you had a successful family who helped you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> My father was very, very proud of me. Michael D'Antonio wrote a third grade book. He's a guy I don't even know. I did two or three interviews with him, little ones. I saw where he was going. I left him. Walked out of the room.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He worked with somebody from "People" magazine. He said my sister and brother and people gave me a $30 million loan. They didn't have $30 million. When I started out they didn't have 10 cents.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They did well on their own and they didn't have money. My father never gave any money. When my father passed away he gave some, but by the time he passed away, I had already built my business, frankly. When my father passed away, who was a wonderful guy --
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, your father really knew my father and liked him a lot.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> He liked him, he respected him. He thought he was one of the giants of New York, that your father did the right thing for the right people and that's why he was respected by politicians and others.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> My father wasn't - You know, he was a builder Brooklyn and Queens. When my father - When I went into Manhattan, my father didn't want me to go into Manhattan. My brothers and sisters didn't have money until my father passed away. When my father passed away, they got something from my father.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not nearly as big as people think. But they got something from my father. Whatever my father left was split up. Don't forget.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have two brothers, two sisters, me and other people got things, OK?
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Right. I just don't understand --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Listen -- Just so you understand, by the time it was all split up we had a thing called estate tax, which is a massive tax, so you have to pay --
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> No question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- state tax or whatever you go. But by that time I had long built my company. But this guy D'Antonio said my brothers and my sisters gave $30 million -- They didn't have $30 million, especially in those days. You know, you're talking about -- he was talking about the '70s and '80s.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They didn't have any money.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Right. My point of the question is, I know -- as you know, I know your family's history very well. Your father is basically beyond reproach as far as I'm concerned in terms of what he did for the city. What's wrong with acknowledging that he helped you early on?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, my mother was a big fan of your mother. They used to use the same beauty parlor in Queens and I think they really loved each other. My mother thought your mother was one of great ladies. And by the way, so do I.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Well, look, you certainly won my mother over. She's already going to give me nasty talk this morning for asking too many question, you should have let Donald talk. But I'll deal with her when I get off with you. I'm just asking that question because it shows --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You just heard my answer. My answer was my father was totally supportive. I learned he was my mentor, my best friend. My father didn't have that kind of money where he could give that kind of money out. My father didn't want me to go into Manhattan. And I took a small loan.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was relative -- when I say small, small compared to what I built. I mean I have a net worth of much more than $10 billion.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So anybody that can take a small amount of money and build up that kind of a net worth, and I'm not saying that -- and I also own some of the great assets of the world, including Turnberry in Scotland, Doral in Miami, hundreds and acres in Miami, Trump Tower and many other buildings all throughout. The Bank of America building in San Francisco, a big chunk of that. 1290 Avenue -- I have some of the great real estate assets and you know, so it's not just like they throw off x dollars. They throw off a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have very little debt. You saw that because when I did my filing. And a lot of people said oh, well he'll never file because -- But then I have all these people writing books about I got this, I got that, I got peanuts. Brooklyn wasn't worth - I mean I've heard numbers where I was given so much money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Brooklyn wasn't worth that kind of money at that time. You're talking about a long time ago. When I built the Grand Hyatt Hotel, in fact, I got hired to put up a lot of the money because frankly to put up that kind of money coming out of Brooklyn and Queens was impossible. But I built the Grand Hyatt Hotel --
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> I understand. I just wanted to give you a chance to correct the record. It was set up like you were moving away from your dad. I wanted to give you a chance to answer.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> One of the things I'm going to have to do, I have a cousin who calls me all the time. He sort of does like a family tree. He said, you know, Donald, someday you're going to have to correct all these horrible books that are written. They're so wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Like Wayne Barrett, a total dope. A total loser. He wrote stuff that is just incredible. He wrote if I had a lawyer -- and if the lawyer 20 years ago represented some mobster or something, immediately I became best friends with the mobster because I had the same lawyer. Even though Steinbrenner had the same lawyer, [Inaudible] Newhouse had the same lawyer.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Some of the biggest people in New York.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But if I had a lawyer who at some time during his career represented a mob guy, all of a sudden I was friendly. Wayne Barrett was one of the worst. You have so many bad reporters and my cousin said you really have to do a book. This was not that book.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Although it is a book talking about the assets and debt and talking about all of the things I've done so well. Because I'm trying to show that that's the kind of mindset we need to run the country where we have $19 trillion in debt and we don't make good deals anymore.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> I get the case you're trying to make.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will make great deals for this country. I'll get us out of debt because I'm very good at it. Nobody can do it like I do. By the way, Carson does not have the mentality to do that. He has no chance. And you look at Rubio, he's totally overrated.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He has debt on his credit cards --
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> All right, good. You made the segue I need to make here, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me?
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> You made the segue that I needed to make. So thank you for that. When you talk about your opponents, which you've been doing more and more recently. Ben Carson doesn't have the temperament to do it, he doesn't have the experience.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Marco Rubio, you talk about his personal finances. Jeb Bush, you talk about his energy.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Here's what they say in response so you can respond. The Carson camp says this is genius what Donald Trump is saying because he's using his own weakness as what is Dr. Ben Carson's actual strength. You are the one with the temperament issue.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Anyone you disagree with, you call a loser, you say they stink. No matter how good a reporter they are, you say they are a terrible reporter if you don't like what they say. That you have never been in public office.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He says the same thing, by the way. He's had his own issues with reporters.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> He says it differently than you and he doesn't say the kinds of things that you would say, which often you'll back up on but it still hurts in the moment.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Ben will not be able to deal with China. He will not be able to deal with Iran. He will not be able to deal with any of the countries that are really abusing our country. They're abusing it.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> What is the proof that you could?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He will not be able to deal with Japan.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> What is the proof you could?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because that's not his thing. Frankly, when you talk about energy, he has lower energy than Bush.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> What does that mean, "low energy"?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're not going to do anything.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> But what does that mean, "low energy"?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know where Ben comes from. But if Ben got in, you would say oh, my god, we have ourselves a problem.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> But Ben Carson -
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will tell you that right now.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Here's what I'm saying. I'm not here to advocate for them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People can put them in - I have the ultimate temperament - My temperament is great. You can't have a bad temperament and build a great company.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> But all you do is attack those who disagree with you. You can't do that on the world stage.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Of course I do, because I have 90 days left. I want to win. I have 90 days left and I'm a different guy than Jeb Bush who said Marco is terrific, he's my dear, dear friend, he's such a wonderful person. You know what I said? Three months ago I said they hate each other.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I turned out to be right. They hate each other.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> No, no, listen. They both say they don't hate each other. They both say they are doing what you say you want to do. They want to win.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me, they hate each other. To be specific, they hate each other.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> They both say they don't hate each other.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> More than you will ever know how much they hate each other.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> So you know better than they do, I guess.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Marco was extremely disloyal to Jeb Bush and everybody said Marco will never run because without Jeb, Marco would have never been where he is. And Marco, frankly, I mean, when he ran, it was shocking to people, especially to the people of Florida. It was shocking that he ran.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> But here's what --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because of the loyalty factor.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Here's the criticism. Here's the case that you need to make.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, I think those people are right. He should have been more respectful to Jeb Bush.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> I think that he actually got a lot of points in the debate because he was so respectful, that when there was this open attack, a naked attack by Bush about whether or not he goes and does the voting or not, how did Marco Rubio respond? With empathy, as a friend would. Certainly if had said that to you, he would have gotten a different response.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The problem is that Jeb is so weak in terms of his attack and his counterattack. There was no counterattack.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> No, but I'm saying Marco Rubio didn't counter --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What Jeb should have done is he should have then refuted what Marco had said. Because Jeb had the better argument but he was a bad messenger.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Well, maybe. That's your take. What I'm saying is this.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's not my take. That's everybody's take.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> It's not everybody's take. You don't know what everybody's take is. You only know what you say.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He had a counterattack. He attacked him and that was fine. His message was not as badly delivered as people said.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> Here's what I'm saying.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He attacked -- The problem was Marco then went on, talking about how wonderful it is that he didn't vote, which is wrong and other things. Jeb just stood there and didn't say anything.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Here's the point. You cannot effectively think that you're going to win to be president by just attacking the opponents all the time. It has to be what you're going to do, what is positive, how you will do it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've said what I'm going to do.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> You say what you want to do -- .
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm going to renegotiate our trade deals where we're losing billions and trillions of dollars.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> I know. But you have to do more. You have to say how you'll do it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to have the finest trade deals. Right now we're suckers for the rest the world. I'm going to start immediately with renegotiating our trade deals, I'm going to build up our military. I'm going to take care of our vets. I'm going to get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something much better --
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> That all sounds good but the devil is in the details.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've said this 100 times. I mean, unfortunately, you have me followed by Sara Murray and she doesn't know what she's doing and she doesn't report what I say.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Listen. Mr. Trump, you have to stop insulting people who do their job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nor does she report the energy, to use another good word, nor does she report the energy in the room. She stands there like there's 12 people in the room.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> She's a good reporter.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I get by far the biggest crowds.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> You know she's a good reporter. You were nice to her yesterday when you saw her at your book signing. But now you use this tactic of attacking her.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was nice to her until I saw her report the same night. She didn't even show the lines of people.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Oh, so what she didn't show the lines.? People know how many people were there. You tell everybody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It stretched -- Excuse me. It stretched all the way down to Madison Avenue from the door. Three and four abreast.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> I get it. We know that there were big crowds.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And you would have said there were three people standing there.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> We get that there were big crowds. We cover it all the time. I get as much criticism for doing the interview with you, how I do it, as I do for having you on in the first place because they say you get so much attention.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I guarantee you this -- I doubt that. I guarantee you this, if there was nobody at the book signing, Sara Murray -- she would have covered it then she would have showed all the empty space --
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> I don't think you have a good case that the media is mean to you. I just don't think you have a good case. You get the most attention.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- but instead of that, the place is packed and she gives a very inaccurate story. Now I don't know if that's because she's incompetent or she doesn't like me or maybe she's given instructions from up above.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Oh, please.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Who knows. I don't really care.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Listen, you know she's not getting instructions. You know you get the most attention.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm sure she's not. I'm sure, yeah. CNN is very straight, I'm sure.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> You see now? You went from saying CNN is good, that we do a good job, now you're taking a shot at us. That's what I'm pointing out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm complaining about the reporter that covers me. I think she's terrible. But that's fine.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> All right. Let's talk about "Saturday Night Live". Let's change -- I can't have you going after Sara Murray. I'm going to have to come find you after this --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK, you'll defend her later. I'm sure she'll defend herself in a very timid way.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> She's doing a good job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, she's not. She's not reporting accurately. She's not reporting --
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> I'm telling you -- She is reporting accurately. You just don't like the reporting.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- what happens in those rooms. I go into rooms have 4,000, 5,000, 6,000 people. When she reports it you'd think there were five people there. The people are going crazy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they love -- We're going to make America great again. They go crazy and she stands there reporting, well, I'm here, never talks about the crowds. The crowd size. Usually she reports when everyone has left and she's standing in an empty room.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's not good reporting.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Mr. Trump, that's your perspective on it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There has to be an agenda some place in CNN.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Listen, her agenda is truth just like the rest of us and when you don't like it you attack us and it works with your supporters, I get it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK, fine. Let somebody else have her.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> All right. Let's talk about "Saturday Night Live". Let's end it on a funny note. So you're going there to do it. I was very surprised that they invited you because I thought you were at war with them, then all of a sudden they wanted to have you on. You say it's because of ratings.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're never at war when you get great ratings with a network, OK? Nobody gets ratings like me. You think that you would have had 24 and 25 million people watching CNN and Fox --
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> No, I don't. I'll tell you what. I don't think the popularity is enough.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You think if Rubio was there - If Rubio was there, you would have had two people watching.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> I think that you help ratings, there's no question with it. I see it in my minute by minutes. It's one of the reasons that we get frustrated that you don't do everybody evenly. You like to go to the safe harbors where they give you a pass.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> You don't like to come on as much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like to go to places where they treat me fairly.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Do you think I treat you fairly?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I won't comment. Go ahead. I'm not talking about you - by the way - and I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about CNN.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> All right. But I'm talking about me. I only do this one show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like to go to places where I get treated fairly.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Do I treat you fairly on New Day ?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like you. And I like your treatment and I do think you're fair. But your other people, I can tell you, do not.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> All right. Well look, that's your opinion. I'm just saying no matter how you feel about Michaela Pereira, I want you to know that I still invite you on New Day whenever you want to come on because you're relevant. You're the front-runner.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Let's talk about "SNL". Why are we going to expect from you out of this? Why are you doing it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I say because Lorne Michaels - Actually, it started off as a skit. I said, all right, I'll do it. They took it up to Lorne Michaels, who is an amazing guy. He's run "Saturday Night Live" brilliantly for many years and he's a friend of mine and all and he said wait a minute, Donald's agreeing to do the skit. Would he do the whole thing? They came back and he called me, said would you host "Saturday Night Live"? And I said, you know what, I would.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because it's an honor.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I did "60 Minutes" a few weeks ago where Putin was with me. We were stable mates, right? They got tremendous ratings on that show, among the highest ratings. They did really well. And then Lorne called and he wanted me to do it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So you know, that's, to me, hosting "Saturday Night Live", being on "60 Minutes" with a really good piece like they gave, I think that's their iconic things. They're great --
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Ben Carson says that being president is a serious thing. Ben Carson says you shouldn't be joking around about becoming president. It's a serious endeavor. Should be treated seriously.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> That goes to your tone as well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well let me - Can I respond to that? Ben Carson would have done it in two seconds if they asked him. But if they asked him, nobody would watch.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> He says no.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So they wouldn't ask him. They are about ratings and current culture and they ask people. I saw that where Ben Carson said, oh, I'm too serious to do "Saturday Night Live". I'd never do it. I mean, give me a break. He would have done it in ten seconds and he wouldn't do probably "60 Minutes" either because it's not serious enough. Ben Carson would have done "Saturday Night Live" in two seconds if they asked him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they didn't ask him. They won't ask him, most likely. Maybe they will. Who knows.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they probably won't ask him because it is ratings driven. He's not going to get ratings. And frankly, if they asked him he would have done it in two seconds. So when I heard his statement about this is too serious, give me a break. He took a two-week tour of a book where he left the campaign in order to promote a book. So he'll leave the campaign in order to - I mean, he announced I'm leaving the campaign to promote a book.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> You have a book out, too. He said he was just modifying his schedule.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Give me break. He'll do that but he won't do "Saturday Night Live"? And if you look at "Saturday Night Live", probably every president we've had for many years has done "Saturday Night Live". So what Ben Carson said is a lot of bunk and you know it.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Well, I'll take your criticism on it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, you don't have to take my criticism. You know it's true also. Every single major politician in this country probably for 30 years has done "Saturday Night Live" -- if they're invited. If they're invited. But to do it you have to be invited.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And to the best of my knowledge, Ben Carson has not been invited. And probably won't. But he would do it in two seconds.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> All right. I look forward to watching you on "Saturday Night". It's past my bedtime. But I'll watch it because I'd like to see what you do there.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Thank you for coming on New Day , thank you for not throwing me under the bus this morning. But don't do it on Twitter after this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK. Thank you very much. Thank you.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> I'm going to be watching the Twitter feed, Mr. Trump. Good luck in New Hampshire today.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK. Very good. Thank you very much.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Take care.
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> Donald Trump. We apologize on some of the transition lines. We had audio problems, but tomorrow, you're going to hear more of Donald Trump.
<Diane Sawyer> <Positive> A very personal Donald Trump, sort of surprising. It's now 19 past. Charlie: Well, as you have undoubtedly heard, Donald Trump isn't saying yet whether he's going to run for president, and we talked about that a bit yesterday, but we had a wide-ranging conversation about a lot of things, from religion and regret, to women.
<Diane Sawyer> <Positive> In fact, in the past, he has said that smart women can be killers, great at, in effect, running circles around men. This topic arises out of his assertion that there's a need for stronger leadership in this country. He says in his forthcoming book, The America We Deserve.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'd like to have the American people see who they like, who they would want to represent them when it comes to other nations ripping off this country, and they are doing it in spades. When you look at what Japan is doing, when you look at what so many nations -- look, we had a...
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> What's the alternative, a trade war?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We had a summit -- Diane, we had a summit -- no, it doesn't have to be a trade war. If they think there's going to be a trade war, there won't be, OK? The problem is, they don't think there ever will be because they think we're a bunch of saps.
<Diane Sawyer> <Neutral> The man who said that 'Women, the smart ones, act very feminine and needy but inside they are real killers, and excellent at manipulating men,' does this mean that you would like to have a government mostly of women?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I think that women are terrific. I admire women. I respect women. I think in many -- you know, the morons say the weaker sex. They call the women the weaker sex. They're not at all the weaker sex. I have great respect and admiration for women. And certainly...
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> But if women are so good at manipulating men and such killers...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible]...and many -- I can tell you a lot of men, Diane, are laying strewn all over the highways by women.
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> Why not populate a government with them, then?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You don't have to populate the government. But certainly, if I were president, women would play a major role in the administration.
<Diane Sawyer> <Neutral> So what's the difference between the women you date and the women you would appoint to your cabinet?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Obviously, the women that would be in the administration would have years of experience, would have tremendous brainpower, and everything else. I'm not saying that the women I date have years of experience, and have tremendous brainpower, but certainly they're very smart.
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> I've got some personal questions. What scares you the most?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think failure...
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> Personally?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...would scare me the most. I hate failure, and it does always -- you know, life is very fragile. We all know that. No matter how well you're doing, or I'm doing, you know, it's just a very fragile thing, and it's...
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> And failure is not being on top?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, failure...
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> Not to be rich, not...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...to me is just not being on top, it's just not being there. And you know, it's something that I don't exactly cherish. So I think that's something that scares me.
<Diane Sawyer> <Neutral> What do you want to make sure is in heaven if you get there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd like to be sure in heaven that I'd have my parents in heaven, because they are great. My father passed away recently, and he was something very special. He was somebody, to me, very special. And my mother is a tremendous woman. They were married for 63 years, so, you know, they didn't understand the word divorce
<Diane Sawyer> <Neutral> You are? Are you religious?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. No, I believe in God. I'm religious. I'm religious in my thought. And I just hope, in fact, that we're all right in believing that there is a heaven, and perhaps in believing that there is a hell. I mean, we have to be here for something. We have to be doing this for some reason. There has to be a reason. And I believe that there is in fact a reason, and I believe heaven could be that reason.
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> What do you feel guiltiest about, then?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I feel guiltiest about not having had a successful marriage, because you know, coming from parents that were married for 63 years, and having gone through all that, I think the thing that I would probably feel most guilty about -- look, my business has been unbelievable, so I can't feel too guilty about my business. I think I've done well, I've made a lot of people very proud, I've made a lot of people very rich. But the business aspect has been very pure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The part of my life I think I'm most disappointed in that I have not had the great marriage. And I would have thought that would have happened, because I came from a home -- you know, it's not like some of my friends, they get divorced, but their parents were divorced twice or three times. I came from a home where marriage was just incredible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, my parents truly loved each other.
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> And we want to make an apology. Yesterday, we showed a photograph of what we said was Donald Trump's older brother. In fact it was his father, it was inadvertent, and our mistake, and we are sorry. And another note, in yesterday's interview with Trump, he said as he has before that some of Democratic candidate Bill Bradley's views are suggestive of Marxism. Well, yesterday, reporters asked Bradley about what he had said on Good Morning America while Bradley was campaigning in Columbus, Ohio, and here's how he responded to Trump's statement.
<Bill Bradley> <Positive> We have not been on the best of terms.
<Reporter> <Neutral> We know that.
<Bill Bradley> <Negative> Actually, since the 1986 tax bill in -- which cut tax rates dramatically and eliminated loopholes, and some of the loopholes were his, and he was very angry.
<Diane Sawyer> <Positive> It's now 14 minutes past, and Good Morning America has more ahead.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald Trump joins us. Donald, you just heard what Bill Maher had to say about -- let me talk about two topics. One is the issue of exceptionalism and the United States. Tell me your response to him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Via Telephone] Well, I have a lot of responses. Exceptionalism can be wonderful. I wish we were exceptional. We'd like to be exceptional. I think we can be exceptional again. And I expect that if Mitt Romney becomes president, I think we really should be an exceptional country and we should be the country.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> When he mentions the fact that we're a stupid country, I assume he's talking about how Obama is running it because we have become a country that is not very well respected, and in many ways, is stupid. When you look at what's happening with OPEC, when you look at what's happening with China, the way they're just stripping our money from us like we're babies, we are really becoming a stupid country.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know that's not the way he meant it. But I guess I would take it differently. That's the way Obama is running the country.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You know, I know a lot of people are upset by Bill Maher saying this. And you know, I'm a little bit sort of curious by that. I mean, he's a standup comic. No one thinks that he's making some sort of profound announcement about the direction of foreign policy. If he were to look at the United States in terms of exceptionalism, I know that you take issue with how the Obama administration is running the country, but in general, the United States has been providing aid in so many different sectors across every single continent in the world.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> We do agriculture, economic, education, women's rights, human trafficking, water and sanitation, earthquake, tsunami help, any crisis -- I mean, we are -- I mean, we do take the lead in so many things, so that while, you know, there's that -- some are saying that we're not as exceptional as we have been before, we are nonetheless quite exceptional as a country.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, and there's also aid that this country can't afford. We're giving aid to others that we really can't afford. You look at us and we are up to $16 trillion in debt. We're borrowing from the Chinese and others. And it's just aid we should probably in many cases not give. We give aid to some people that can't stand us. They go around and they take advantage of us, stupidly for us, but they take advantage of the country.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But, again, it's aid in many cases we can't afford.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But that is a slightly different issue, how do we exercise our exceptionalism. There is a great debate whether we should give a particular amount to a particular country for something. But nonetheless at the core of this is the United States does remain exceptional in the sense we have -- we have a willingness to try to make the world better, I mean, as in, sometimes even to our personal detriment.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think that is great. In the past, it was great when we were a rich country. We're not a rich country anymore. A lot of bad politicians have seen to it we're not rich. When you are not rich, when you don't have money, when you have to go borrow the money, we can't afford to do what we are doing. We are doing so many different things.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We give money to countries that laugh at us behind our back and even laugh at us to our face. So there are many things we could be doing much differently. The potential enormous, but we are doing things that are laughed at and scoffed at.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You talk about laughing and more of the controversy about Bill Maher. Let me repeat, he is a standup comic. He does satire. His whole thing is comedy. But he refers to Mormonism, the religion of the Republican nominee, as being stupid. And that is just old fashioned bigotry. Your thoughts -- I mean, you know, he is laughing at it and he has the crowd laughing with him.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Your thoughts on that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's tough stuff when you say that. He is a comic, but that is really not funny. And frankly, it's amazing. And if the other side referred to someone's religion, as an example if a nice conservative Republican said something about another religion, I won't even say which one, but let's say another religion, there would be hell to pay on the front page of every newspaper tomorrow.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Here is something that is hardly being covered. Although you're covering it, but it's hardly being covered.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> It's interesting when the crowd laughs, it's hard to -- people oftentimes don't realize they are being bigots if they get people laughing with them, other bigots I guess.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know Bill Maher. He is doing his thing. He is having a good time doing it. He is doing well with it, I guess. But it's a tough statement. Frankly, if somebody else made that statement, and certainly if a conservative Republican made a like statement about somebody else's religion there would be hell to pay.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It would be all over the place. It would be the end of that person's career as you know it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Let me turn to another subject. Last week the president said and everyone is stomping all over him about this. He said in part the private sector is doing fine. I'm curious what you think the president is thinking today about what he said?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, he is getting hit hard on that statement, because even his own support is saying what are you doing? What are you saying? Calling at it big gaffe, a major gaffe. I heard some people saying it's earth-shattering. I don't think it is earth-shattering, but it certainly was a mistake he made in saying it. It's not doing well.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're at 8.2, but the 8.2 unemployment is not a real number. The real number is 15 or 16 percent. Some people say it's 21 percent. But the real number, they rig it up so you have the best of all worlds. You look for a job, you stop looking for a job and they take you out of the stats. It doesn't work that way.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The real number is 15 or 16 percent. It could be 21 percent. That is not doing fine. He is taking heat for it. It listened to it and I heard it I was surprised by the statement. But his own groups picked it up and they didn't like it. He is taking a lot of heat.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Was it a gaffe, or is it something that he intended to say something his economic philosophy and how he views the economy and who he sees as sort of winning and losing, I mean, is it part of his economic ideology or a misstatement and he regrets today and seeks to clear it up?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I really watched -- I was watching as he made it. Frankly, I think it was a gaffe because his body language is very confused and very confusing after he made the statement. I don't think he felt good about the statement after he made it and I think he would have liked to take it back. So I think it was a gaffe, absolutely.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You were very busy tweeting today. One thing you mentioned is that another Barack Obama credit downgrade coming in part. Do you fear a credit downgrade coming? What did you mean by that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We are going up to $16 trillion very soon. It will be higher than that before he gets finished. When you have in the 20s and 21, $22 trillion, you are talking about a downgrade no matter how you cut it. Something has to be done. You have to cut the debt. You can't keep going. We're going to be a large scale version of Spain or Greece or another number of countries that are doing very badly.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let's see what happens in terms of the recession. "Recession" may be a nice word. I just closed on Dural today. I bought it in Miami, a big deal, fantastic land in Miami with hotel units and got courses, a very important thing. I am putting a lot of people to work. I'm proud of it. I think it will be an amazing place and amazing resort but I want to see the country do well so everything does well.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right now frankly the country isn't doing well, and the price I paid is reflective of that.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Last question. Another tweet today, and because you have been very successful with "The Apprentice, let me ask you. It says one of the tweets CNN and MSNBC need big help in the ratings. I can tell them where they are going wrong. I'm curious, what is it that you think they are doing where they are "going wrong"?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They are really wrong and they are really doing badly. By the way, you folks are doing very well. I'm very proud of you. But they are really doing badly. Honestly, I wouldn't say it to them and I wouldn't say it publicly, but if they called me I would certainly give them ideas that would be better than what they are doing right now.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They are so far off. MSNBC is so far off and CNN is so far off. And it's actually sad to see it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> It's not just fair for us to give them a swat right now. Give them a tip.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't want to do that.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You are not going to give them a tip?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know some of the people over there. I actually know the people at MSNBC in terms of the top people because I have "Apprentice" on NBC, and I know them well and have a lot of respect. Should they call me I would give them ideas a lot better than what they have on now. All you have to do is watch MSNBC and you can be a seven-year-old child and tell them what they are doing wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's pretty pathetic.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Is the appetite for the news change or -- appetite for news changing or people sick of politics?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think their politics are wrong. In politic politics in many cases are perceived as dishonest so people aren't trusting.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Dishonest or you just don't agree with them?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't think it's that. I think people aren't trusting them. When they don't trust, you don't watch. You had the great Walter Cronkite. When you watched him, you trusted him. He was like your father. It never forget, to me he was the ultimate. Edward R. Murrow was great but I didn't see him. I watched Walter Cronkite.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He was something special. You watched him and you trusted him and you believed in him. Therefore, you watched. With MSNBC, I don't think people believe it. They look at what they are saying. They don't have confidence in him and therefore they don't watch.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Isn't there room for a diverse opinion on all sorts of issues, whether political -- I guess not -- the facts are the facts whatever they are. But a lot of the political discussion, doesn't it enrich to us have a diverse argument about, or a diverse debate?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Diversity is great, diverse debate is fantastic. You have to be believable on both sides. And in certain cases they're not believable.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, thank you very much for joining us.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK, thank you, Greta.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hello.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> Sir. It's Bob O'Harrow and Shawn Boburg from The Washington Post. How are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, I'm good. What's up?
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> Hey, thanks for squeezing us in. We're going to tape as usual. You may not remember, but we spoke a couple of times about Roy Cohn for the Trump book and for the story that we're doing. We have sketched in the story and we thought that if you had a moment, we would just tell you about where the story goes and see if there's anything else you wanted to add.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. Go ahead.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Neutral> So I'm going to rip through this, but essentially, we took your lead and used the time way back when, when we're all younger and where you met Roy Cohn at Le Club and asked - according to one of your books - for advice about the Justice Department's allegations against you and your father and that --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Which, by the way, it was a lawsuit against many developers all over the city. You do know that, right?
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> Yeah. There were others. LeFrak and others were sued as well. In this case, Roy, according to your account, which we thought was charming, you didn't like settling, and he said in effect, my view is to tell them to go to hell and fight the thing in court. And after that, we talked about how Roy Cohn represented you in legal battles. He had a hand in setting up the prenuptial agreement in your marriage and advised you on various things. I guess you guys went out as well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, no. Roy was a lawyer. I mean he represented me as a lawyer. Why would you say go out? He represented me as a lawyer and he was a very good lawyer. For me, he was a good lawyer. For some people, they weren't as happy, but I was very happy with him. He also represented a very good friend of mine, George Steinbrenner. It was George. He represented the New York Yankees and George Steinbrenner. He represented Conde Nast. Probably, his best friend was Si Newhouse. Si Newhouse of Conde Nast was one of his best friends, but he represented many people, not just us.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> We actually have you saying that in the story and also you pointed out that he was a lawyer, that he wasn't a mentor or whatever. Here's what you told us before. In interviews with The Post, Trump maintained Cohn was his attorney, stressing that he was only one of many of Cohn's clients in New York. Trump also downplayed the influence of Cohn on his aggressive tactics and rhetoric saying, quote, I don't think I got that from Roy at all. I think I have a natural instinct for that. Now, you should know that part of the reason I wanted to share this was that Roger Stone described Roy Cohn as being much more than a personal lawyer. That's his words. And that he was kind of a cultural guide to Manhattan for you, as he put it. And then also Wayne Barrett, who's spent a lot of time with both you and Roy Cohn, here's what he wrote about you. I don't know if you've ever read his book, but --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I never read it because his book was total fiction, but I never read it. Believe me, Wayne Barrett was just nonsense. Anything he wrote was nonsense. But anyway, go ahead with Wayne Barrett.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> Well, he described you as an adviser and as a mentor and just for what it's worth, Barrett says that he can -- I'll just read you this. He says Barrett now says Cohn's stamp on Trump is obvious. Quote, I just look at him and see Roy - Barrett said in an interview - both of them are attack dogs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Well, I don't see myself as an attack dog. I see myself as somebody that's made a lot of money and done a great job and put a lot of people to work, but I don't see myself as an attack dog unless I'm attacked.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Negative> I understand.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I don't see that.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Negative> So we go through -- go ahead, I'm sorry.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I get it, but Roy represented lots of people, but Roy was a tough guy. Anyway, so go ahead.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> We give the background of Roy Cohn, which as you know is fascinating to say the least. His work in the U.S. Attorneys' Office, his work in Washington on various cases including as an aide to Joseph McCarthy, and his decision to come back to New York and he established himself when you were just a little guy in New York. He developed this network, which is pretty incredible looking back on, the people he had in his parties.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Neutral> He had a direct relationship with J. Edgar Hoover.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He had amazing people at parties. That's true. He had really an amazing group of both glamorous people, influential people. I have not seen anything like it since and frankly, he really had amazing people, fellows at parties. In terms of interesting parties, they were the most interesting.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Negative> We give that background. We got some letters that he wrote to J. Edgar Hoover and we looped back to when you guys met and his representation on that first case and the $100 million dollar lawsuit. We say this, that you signed a consent decree, but that in effect you and your father declared victory because there was no legal finding that you had discriminated as far as I can recall.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Unlike others where there was a finding. But many people were sued under that whole situation.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Neutral> In Barrett's book, there's this passage where it talks about you once gave him a statement and said this. Trump once said that Cohn represented him in two libel cases against journalists. Though Trump said the legal work cost $100,000, he said it was worth the money because, quote, I've broken one writer, according to a statement he once gave to reporter, Wayne Barrett. Do you remember that writer?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I don't remember the statement. You have to understand, anything Wayne Barrett wrote was fiction. It was all made up from his mind. I'd say there were three to four guys like that that I've met over my lifetime, but there are some writers that anything they write is total fiction.
<Shawn Boburg> <Negative> But did Roy represent you in two libel cases?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not that I remember.
<Shawn Boburg> <Negative> He didn't represent you in any libel cases as far as you remember?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me see. Where's the statement? What's the statement? Which statement?
<Robert O'Harrow> <Negative> The statement was that before Wayne Barrett's original stories came out in the Village Voice, you gave him a statement that said that Roy Cohn had represented you in two libel cases and that you paid $100,000 for the legal work and that you, quote, I've broken one writer. It was before the stories came out, so presumably it was kind of a little bit of a reminder that you were willing to sue.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I never said that.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Negative> Okay. You never said it or you don't recall it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I certainly don't recall it and I don't think I ever said it.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> We're going to add that to the story, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, frankly, I'll go a step further. I don't know of any lawsuits that I sued. A couple of times, I sued writers because they were dealing with fiction, which of course many of them do, but I don't believe I ever said a thing like that to Wayne Barrett.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> Okay. Fair enough. So we go on to talk a little more about Roy Cohn and we do it because his influence does -- oh, go ahead. I'm sorry.
<Shawn Boburg> <Positive> Well, I just wanted to ask real quick. You do recall Roy representing you with regard to the prenuptial agreement with Ivana?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Shawn Boburg> <Neutral> Okay.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Negative> In any case, we talked about Roy Cohn's background as almost sort of it's kind of like fiction except it's not. He was very open about his distaste for taxes in the city and with the IRS. He talked in his book - he wrote a book called How to Stand Up for Your Rights and Win about --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He won the case for me, you know, the Trump Tower tax case. You know that.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Neutral> What's that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The Trump Tower, the tax case.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> Right. Well, in any case --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Roy said he didn't [indiscernible] the tax abatement so, you know, the tax deal on Trump Tower and I ended up winning.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> Got it. We talked a little bit about the Studio 54 days and his representation of those guys and the club itself. We talked a little bit - just FYI - about going to Studio 54, and you going to Studio 54 and recalling it. There's a quote we took from TrumpNation about just those days and that you were just kind of looking back on it, you were amazed that --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What was TrumpNation? What was TrumpNation?
<Robert O'Harrow> <Negative> That's the quote about Studio 54 and saying that it could probably never happen again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. I think that's correct. TrumpNation. Who wrote TrumpNation?
<Robert O'Harrow> <Neutral> TrumpNation was Timothy O'Brien.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He was almost as bad as Wayne Barrett. I mean frankly, but TrumpNation was a zero book. That was a zero. That was total fiction. In all fairness, I would say between those two guys and probably a couple of others, but that was -- so, you took a quote out of the TrumpNation?
<Robert O'Harrow> <Negative> Yeah. I'll read you the quote. The quote was, "What went on in Studio 54 will never happen again," Trump said years later, according to Timothy O'Brien's TrumpNation. "First of all, you didn't have AIDS. You didn't have the problems that you do now. I saw things happening there to this day I'll never see again about supermodels and all that." And you said that there was just wild stuff happening in the middle of the room and that just won't happen anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You mean weren't the problems that there are today?
<Robert O'Harrow> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You mean generally in the society?
<Robert O'Harrow> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just don't know what he wrote. I sued him on that book. He wrote a totally false book, but unfortunately, the libel law still allows that kind of a victory, but that's okay but we'll be back with it.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Neutral> What do you mean we'll be back with it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, when people do false stories, I bring lawsuits.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Negative> Oh, I see. Okay. We [audio glitch]. Let's see. Roger Stone meeting Roy Cohn for the time and with Roy Cohn was Tony Salerno. He was amazed by that and then Cohn recommended -- this is in the book that Zion wrote with him that Cohn recommended that Stone reach out to you, and then Cohn began a relationship with the Reagans. We say this --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Roy was very close with Ronald Reagan actually. That's true.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> Here is this. I'd say in 1981, Ronald Reagan wrote Cohn, a registered Democrat, a warm note of thanks for his support. Cohn tapped into that network on Trump's behalf a short time later according to The New York Times account. At Trump's request, Cohn lobbied Ed Meese III, a senior White House aide to secure an appointment for Trump's sister, Maryann Barry, an experienced jurist in New Jersey to the United States Court of Appeals. Trump told The Times, quote, my sister got the appointment totally on her own merit. If The Times reported that Roy Cohn called on your behalf, did you ask him to call Ed Meese and help your sister out?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. I don't want to comment on that.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Neutral> Okay. That's the first no comment I've ever heard from you, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. That's fine.
<Shawn Boburg> <Negative> Why don't you want to comment on it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just don't want to comment on it.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> Fair enough.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm proud of my sister. She's done a great job. I just don't comment on thas.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> We talked about the birthdays a little bit, I won't bore you with that. We talked a little bit about Trump Tower. Some of the stuff you and I have talked before about campaign contributions and you were advised by your lawyer at one point when you gave campaign contributions to do it through your subsidiaries. One thing that I'm not sure about is something about John Cody. John Cody was described as a very tough guy and a guy that if he wanted to stop a project, he could. The House of Representatives found he was, quote, universally acknowledged to be the most significant labor racketeer preying on the construction industry in New York. Cody claimed Cohn as a friend. Cody also worked with Trump. He said he also worked with Trump with Cohn serving as the intermediary. Quote, I knew Trump quite well. Cody said, quote, Donald liked to deal with me through Roy Cohn. What about the John Cody relationship?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't know Cody well. I know that he was a bad guy. He caused a lot of problems in New York with labor. A nasty guy. I didn't like him. I'm not a fan of his. And I don't know who I dealt with him. He was there with the Teamsters.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> Two things that I think are interesting. One is there was an allegation that in 1980 -- not an allegation, but apparently in 1980, you were asked to talk to the Organized Crime Strike Force. Tell me about why, what did they ask you there to talk about Cody?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't remember that at all.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Neutral> Oh, you don't remember giving the deposition?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't remember that, no. But I would have said Cody was a bad guy if I did. John Cody was a bad guy.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Negative> Barrett reported that Cody claimed that he offered Trump peace with the union workers in exchange for an apartment. And you told Barrett that you, quote, emphatically denied any such deal. We're reporting that from your perspective, it never happened, is that so?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wouldn't have made a deal with John Cody for a lot of reasons. Number one, I wouldn't have made a deal and number two, he was a very bad guy.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Negative> Now again, I know this isn't your favorite writer, but Tim O'Brien reported this, "Trump claimed that Cody stayed out of his way because Cody considered him tough." Quote, you know how I dealt with him, I told him to go fuck himself all the time. O'Brien said that you told him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Anything in O'Brien's book is fiction. Okay. You saw that. But anything in his book is fiction. That's been proven to be fiction, by the way.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> But, is it true --?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know that I ever spoke to him about Cody. I can only tell you this, Cody was a bad guy and I didn't deal with him almost at all because I knew the kind of guy he was. He was a very bad cookie.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Neutral> And you never offered him? There was no deal for an apartment, is what you're saying.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Of course not. It's all ridiculous.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> Yeah, okay. Thanks. We're just trying to run this stuff by you. We write a little bit about Cohn and the FBI preparing to bug his office because of the tie to Fat Tony Salerno.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I didn't know Tony Salerno. I think he was a client of Roy's, wasn't he?
<Robert O'Harrow> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. I never met him, but I think he was a client of Roy's.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Negative> Now Zion talks about an episode that is really interesting, and I'll just read you the paragraph. Cohn had his setbacks and once turned to Trump for help. Cohn had personally charted a 747 for a group of male friends to travel to Europe. The group trashed the plane and Cohn never paid the charter bill. The airline sued Cohn unsuccessfully but could not get any money from him. An executive called Trump to see if he would pay. Quote, are you kidding, Trump responded. According to Cohn's autobiography, quote, I felt for that poor bastard because Roy just wiped out that plane. Trump told Zion about the episode, but what was I supposed to do? Hey, it was Roy, what was anybody supposed to do? Does that ring a bell?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, yes. Yeah, I do. I remember that there was an episode with an airplane with Roy and his friends. I guess they were pretty wild, but they trashed the plane. And I remember the airline calling me to see if there's any way I could help because I was one of their clients and it had something to do with the airline and charter planes and things. They called me and they asked is there anything I can do. Well, I thought I might have helped them something with Roy, but I don't know. It was a long time ago. But I do remember that there was a plane that was pretty well damaged inside from Roy and one of his parties. I think he had a party on the plane or something, right?
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> Yeah. Apparently a non-stop party, no pun intended. You wrote yourself, quote, I don't kid myself about Roy. He was no Boy Scout. Trump once wrote in one of his books, quote, he once told me that he'd spent more than twothirds of his adult life under indictment for one charge or another. That amazed me. I said to him, "Roy, just tell me one thing. Did you really do all that stuff?" He looked at me and smiled, "What the hell do you think?" he said. And then you wrote, "I never really knew."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When did I write that?
<Robert O'Harrow> <Negative> It's in a footnote and I don't have my computer open. Do you remember which book that was?
<Shawn Boburg> <Positive> Art of the Deal.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> I think it was the Art of the Deal.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's pretty much as I remember it, yeah.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Negative> We talked about Roy Cohn becoming ill in '84, and we say this, "He maintained he had liver cancer but he was suffering from the effects of the HIV virus. As he struggled to stay alive, Trump pulled back from his friend for a spell. Cohn was apparently thrown off balance by this betrayal." Quote, I can't believe he's doing this to me, Cohn said. According to Barrett's account, "Donald pisses ice water." And then we talked a little bit about the disbarment proceedings and how prominent folks, including you, weighed in on Roy Cohn's behalf but he was disbarred in any case. That before he was disbarred that spring, you had resumed your visits to Cohn, and that spring had invited him down to Mar-a-Lago for a brief stay. And we say that on --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Roy got sick, and he was pretty sick. I remember quite vividly that he lost much of his strength. As a lawyer, he was very, very weakened, you know, physical condition. And it was very difficult. I remember George Steinbrenner calling me on the same thing, because he was so physically weakened that he couldn't really represent you. He didn't have the physical strength at that point.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Neutral> Do you recall the visit to Mar-a-Lago? In other words, it looks like you distanced yourself from the accounts from him for a little while but resumed your friendship before it was too late.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Roy wanted to know if he could go to Mar-a- Lago. He got a friend or something; a woman, a society woman who he wanted to see Mar-a-Lago. And I remember that sometime prior to his death, he toured Mar-a-Lago with the woman. This is a Palm Beach society woman who was a friend of Roy also. I worked that out for him to do. I worked it out for him to do.
<Shawn Boburg> <Positive> Cohn died on August 2, 1986, he was 59. His friends, - I'm reading from our draft. "His friends had a memorial service for him. Trump stood in the back silently. Zion, the journalist, wrote that Cohn was misunderstood by his critics." Quote, what curdled their blood with Cohn was his headline hunting, his gunslinger style, his contempt for the niceties, his contempt for them. One year after his death, Trump professed admiration for Cohn. "Tough as he was, Roy had a lot of friends," Trump wrote in his book, Trump: The Art of the Deal. "And I'm not embarrassed to state that I was one." And then based on a recent chat you had with us, we write, "Trump remains fond of Cohn today." Quote, I actually got a kick out of him, Trump recalled in a recent interview with The Post. Quote, some people didn't like him and some people were offended by him. I mean they would literally leave at dinner. I had one evening where three or four got up from the table and left the table because they couldn't stand the mention of his name. But with all of that being said, he did a very good job for me as a lawyer. I get a kick out of winning and Roy would win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, it's true, fellows. That's true. He was a winner. He knew how to win if he wanted to, if he wanted to. He had things that he wanted to do, and when he wanted to win, he was tough.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> Well, that's the overview of our story. Obviously, the link here is that his representation of you, and the skills, the tactics, the rhetoric - he's like he was in your face if he wanted to win. It has an uncanny similarity to some of your approach as you're trying to win the presidency. And so that's what makes it, I think, an interesting kind of feature story.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was wondering why we're going on but that's okay. Look, Roy, as a lawyer was superb. As a lawyer, if he liked his client -- and he liked a few of us, there weren't too many of them, frankly. You understand that. But if he liked his client, and if he liked the case, he was an absolutely superior lawyer. He could be really great. I would say, yeah, pretty much that last sentence that you read me before was correct.
<Shawn Boburg> <Positive> Mr. Trump, so you have a good idea what's going to be in the story. Anything that you want to add?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. Just that he was a tough, smart guy. He was very controversial at the time. You guys figured that one out pretty quickly, but he was very controversial. But I think it's like Sidney said –- who was that Sid? You meant Sid Zion when you said Zion?
<Shawn Boburg> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, because he did have a good heart in many respects. And he fought very hard for his clients.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Negative> How do you feel now that you've got a lot of years under the belt and you could think about it? Let me read you a quote from somebody to give you the tenor of the dissidence here. Bear with me. Quote, he was a great source of evil in this society, Victor Kovner, a Democratic activist in New York City and a First Amendment lawyer, told The Post, "He was a vicious, red-baiting source of sweeping wrong-doing." How does it feel to call that kind of guy -- I mean, is that misguided?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Roy had two sides. Roy had people that would like him and respect him and felt very strongly about him. Like Si Newhouse and George, and George Steinbrenner and myself, and others. And he had people that absolutely hated him. I'd never seen anybody that was to that extent that way. He would have people that thought he was terrific and for whom he did terrific work, and he'd have other people that like Victor Kovner, who couldn't stand him. He'd have that. But Roy was very much that way. There's no question about it. No, there were people that disliked him intensely, and there were other people that thought he was terrific.
<Shawn Boburg> <Positive> Mr. Trump, we've seen photos of Studio 54 and Roy, heard stories about his charisma. He obviously had a big network of friends and people who were very loyal to him. And part of that it seems was, there's a social component to him. Obviously, as a lawyer he's very talented, but also there's a social component to his personality that people were attracted to.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Shawn Boburg> <Negative> Tell us a little bit about your social interactions. There's a picture of you with him in Studio 54, for example. Tell us a little bit about how you interacted with him besides the parties.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It wasn't much of a social relationship. It was a business relationship. So much of what I do is business that the people I meet are through business, so in a way that was through business. But he was close with Ian Schrager and with Steve Rubell and he was at Studio 54 a lot. I'd take friends to go to Studio 54. I'd go there a lot with dates and with friends, and with lots of people. Roy would always make it very comfortable because I didn't know them at the time as well. I got to know Steve and Ian very well later on, but I didn't know them at the time as well. One thing with Roy, you always met interesting people and his parties were the most interesting. They were glamor. They were people of great significance in lots of different ways. You'd meet very glamorous people. You'd meet very successful people. You met lots of different people at his events.
<Shawn Boburg> <Neutral> What was he like in that setting? He just worked the room? Obviously you'd --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was much more subdued in a social setting. He'd be a much more subdued guy. He just liked to take it in and sit and watch. He was a much more subdued guy there than he would be in a legal or business setting.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> I'm going to read something to you to make sure we've nailed it. First of all, Roger Stone said that Roy helped sort of -- you were still a young man and that he kind of would say, I know these people, I know these people. He kind of guided you through the Manhattan thing, but here's the sentence I want to be sure that we get right. "Trump maintained a reputation as a straight-laced teetotaler, but he loved to be in the mix late at night, especially among beautiful women."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. I never drank. Fortunately, I probably wouldn't be talking to you right now, but I was never a drinker [sounds like]. I never drank actually. I never had a glass of alcohol. Yeah, that would be -- read that again? Let me just --
<Robert O'Harrow> <Neutral> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who's making that statement?
<Robert O'Harrow> <Negative> No, that's us, based on everything we've read. "Trump maintained a reputation as a straight-laced teetotaler, but he loved to be in the mix late at night, especially among beautiful women."
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, I would certainly be there. You're talking about parties generally or kind of --?
<Robert O'Harrow> <Neutral> Yeah, you liked hanging out, but you weren't a big drinker. I've never heard - no pun intended - a whiff of you using any drugs or anything like that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's never been my deal. Never been my deal.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> All right. Well, you sure have a very good sense of the story. It associates you with a guy who represented you aggressively, who showed you around a little bit, who turned you on to people, who himself was considered by some people to be charming and by others something of an antichrist who went after people and hurt people, and that sort of thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But he also helped people. We won the tax deal on Trump Tower. What they did to me was very unfair, and he did a great job in that case, and others. He helped people also. Well, is this part of your fabulous upcoming book?
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> There is a section -- we mentioned this to you in a previous conversation for the book, this is the piece that we're doing for the newspaper that we've done some more reporting and written it for the newspaper. So it should run on the paper in a week or so.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right. Good. Well, he was an interesting character. It was an interesting era.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> While I have you, there's sort of a distilled section, and I figure I'll just share it with you now. All right. So you meet Roy Cohn, and it's on October 1973. It's an important relationship in your career that he represented you in legal battles, counseled you on the prenuptial agreement, introduced you to people in New York. "And Cohn also showed Trump how to exploit power and instill fear through simple principles – attack, counterattack, and never apologize." Here's something we think is fair to use, but let us know what you think. "Since he announced his run for the White House a year ago, Trump has used such tactics, meaning attack, counterattack, and not apologizing, more aggressively than any candidate in memory."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hey, do you think? I don't think so. Do you think so?
<Robert O'Harrow> <Negative> Oh, by far.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Really? Why should –- I'm opposed to saying that I can't believe that.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> Well, if it's wrong, make your case. But it's pretty clear that -- I don't think there's ever been a candidate like Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's true.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Negative> The side effect is that your opponents have felt demeaned, minorities have felt insulted and women, and of course your supporters -- you have the ability to get them whipped up through anger and other measures. In other words, demeaning opponents, insulting minorities and women, and whipping up anger among your supporters.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think they respect what I'm saying. I think I have great supporters and I think they're extremely loyal. One thing that seems to have come out very strongly in polls and other things is that my supporters are the most loyal that anybody's ever seen to this date. We have great supporters, great loyalty among my supporters. You've seen that I guess.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Negative> Here's the thing, and I'll tell you I'm a actually a little baffled, just maybe because I'm naive and I haven't seen it before, but the tactics of the aggression where you are demeaning opponents and insulting people, the Mexican- American judge, from all I can tell, and certain women, feel very insulted by some of your remarks. Is that an overall strategy? What's that about?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't feel I insult people. I don't feel I insult people. I try and get to the facts and I don't feel I insult people. I hear what you're saying but I do not feel that I insult people. Now, if I'm insulted I will counterattack, or if something is unfair, I will counterattack, but I don't feel like I insult people. I don't want to do that. But if I'm attacked, I will counterattack.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> Clearly. Listen, thank you, you should have a very good sense of the story. And if anybody has any questions have Rhona call or whatever.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Just treat it fairly fellows, that's fine. Just be fair and that's it. A great honor to talk to you guys.
<Shawn Boburg> <Positive> Thank you.
<Robert O'Harrow> <Positive> Thank you. Bye-bye.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Take care of yourselves. So long. Bye.
