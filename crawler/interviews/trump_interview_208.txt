<David Brody> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you for inviting CBN News here into The White House -- the People's House. Thank you, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, David.
<David Brody> <Neutral> Let me start, by the way, do you like Mr. President or Mr. Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You can call me anything you want.
<David Brody> <Neutral> I will call you Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You've known me a long time.
<David Brody> <Positive> Wonderful. Let's start with the Supreme Court. I know you're narrowing down the list. I know you've talked about who you kind of have an idea of who is going to be this person, but let me ask you where does the final result lie? In other words, is it a gut instinct for you? Because they're all good on this list. So what's the bottom line factor when deciding?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think also it's who's going to get approved. And you know we have to go through a process after I pick the person that I am going to be picking. I think I know, but I'm not 100%. I can't guarantee it. We're doing some further checking. The vetting, they call it the vetting process and the vetting process is very, very strong. But we have all 20 are fantastic people. You know we put out 20 before the election. I said these are the people I'll pick. And I think the person that I pick will be big, big I think people are going to love it. I think evangelicals, Christians will love my pick. And will be represented very, very fairly.
<David Brody> <Neutral> Let me ask you about the embassy in Israel as it relates to moving this embassy to Jerusalem. Evangelicals, it's important for evangelicals. Are you committed to doing that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm looking at it, we are setting it, as you know, we discussed this before, we are studying it very, very long and hard. You know, it's a very big decision because every president for the last number of presidents, large number, they have commented they were going to do it and then all of a sudden, they decide they don't want to get involved. It's a big, big decision but we are setting the issue right now. I have always liked the concept of doing it, I will tell you that. I will have a decision in the not too distant future.
<David Brody> <Positive> Are the chances good?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there is certainly a chance of it. Absolutely. But we are going to be -- we are doing very detailed studies on that and it will come out very soon. I hate to do that because that is not usually me, studies.
<David Brody> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's usually, I do what is right. But this has two sides to it, it's not easy to do it, it's not easy, and I will make a decision over the not-too-distant future.
<David Brody> <Neutral> let me ask you about the Muslim Brotherhood real quick. You have had some critical words for them in the past when we have spoken, there is a decision to be made about the Muslim Brotherhood as it relates to whether or not they are a terrorist organization. Do you believe they are?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, there has certainly been a lot of things going on and that is another one. I don't want to keep putting you off. But I am having a meeting on that next week and some bad stuff going on. You know it and I know it. So we will see what happens but I have a meeting on that next week. I will let you know.
<David Brody> <Positive> All right. Let me ask you a little bit about Latinos in this country. You have talked about, you are going to a great jobs president.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<David Brody> <Neutral> And you believe the Latino community has heard you on that to a degree.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we did very well with the Latino community. People were shocked.
<David Brody> <Positive> Better than Romney.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Better than Romney, better than just about for a long way. I mean better than a lot of people thought possible or I wouldn't have won. They are a great community, they are a phenomenal community, spirit, hard working, and you know, the Cuban Americans, I got 84% of that vote. And they voted in big numbers. So we did really well with that community, so go ahead.
<David Brody> <Neutral> I was going to ask you what can you say to some in that community that had some trepidation, that think they are under attack by this administration coming and what is message to them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think I have really solved that because you know, the elections was not long ago and we had a great victory, we had a victory that nobody thought was possible, 306, remember they said there is no path to 270 for Trump, Trump can't win because there is no path, and I kept going up to Maine where Maine had won and we won it, but we didn't need it because we won't Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, we won so many, North Carolina, so you know, I really focused very heavily on the Latino Community or the Hispanic Community. And it was something that I'm very proud of. I'm very proud of the numbers we got. They want protection and they want jobs. They don't want people pouring across the border, they have no idea who they are, and one of the reasons I did so well with the Hispanic community is the fact that they do want jobs and they do want protection and they know that I'm going to take care of that and I've already been producing the jobs because Ford and General Motors and many other companies, even Fiat, Chrysler, in terms of the car companies, but so many other types of companies, they are pouring back into our country now. They want to be here, lower taxes, we are lowering taxes bigly, including for the middle class. Including for people, not just business taxes but we are lowering business taxes and companies are pouring back in.
<David Brody> <Negative> Speaking of taxes, this 20% border tax, or at least this tax on Mexico, or imports from Mexico into the United States. How serious are you about something like that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well it's something that I have the right to do. It's something I can impose if I want. We are getting along actually very well with the Mexican government; we'll see what happens.
<David Brody> <Positive> Do you believe that is a strong move going forward? Do you see -- or do you need...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's an option. It's certainly an option. I can do that, I can do it if I want. But we're dealing with the Mexican government. I just had a conversation with the Mexican government, actually with the President of Mexico. He's a very good man and we'll see where it all goes. We'll see what happens.
<David Brody> <Positive> Can you give us a sense of what that conversation was like?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A very warm conversation. We're talking. We're speaking, and we're going to see what happens."" "
<David Brody> <Negative> What about this, if there was some sort of tax on imports, what about the argument that you've heard about before that indeed, it will be passed along to consumers? What's the argument against that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well I think that some of it may get passed along but it also creates jobs. So I'm not against something like that but with respect to Mexico, something else could happen which would be much more positive for both Mexico and the United States.
<David Brody> <Negative> The Media, I know we only have a limited amount of time, you can talk for an hour and a half about the media.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You mean fake news?
<David Brody> <Positive> Well, if that is what you -- it's your call.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Much of it is fake news. I mean much of the media makes up stories. It's amazing, I speak to people, great people, people that voted for me. And they get it better than most people get it. But much of the media is distorted and fake. And you can see it, I won't mention specific networks as an example or newspapers, but I read stories that they write that are knowingly false. They are knowingly false.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They know it's a lie and they write them anyway and the headlines, and in the end, you know, the media has now a 17% approval rating which is shocking, I think I have done a lot of that, I think I have brought it down because at my rallies, I will speak and they will turn around and the people will start, I mean, going pretty wild against them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We want truthful media, we don't have truthful media, we have people that are, in many cases, I actually think they are sick people. Because some of the stories are so bad.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> For instance, in the oval office, we have a beautiful bust of Dr. Martin Luther King. And they took that bust and they said that I removed it. I never removed it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In fact, I admired it when I first walked in, they said I walked in and I had it removed. And all of a sudden, there are major headlines all over the world that I removed the bust of Dr. Martin Luther King, which I would never do, because again, a man that I have great respect for and have admired over the years greatly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I call my people, why did you take that bust out? I wasn't here. Who took it out? I mean because me, I wasn't so nice. Who took it out?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And they said, Sir
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now the apology, you know what it was? I don't even know if anybody gave an apology.
<David Brody> <Neutral> I think it was something on Twitter possibly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Maybe it was a Twitter, I had headlines all over the world, and I will tell you, it's a very serious thing because what they are doing is they are saying I'm a racist. See, they are not saying I removed the bust, they are saying I'm a racist. That is fake news. These people are bad people.
<David Brody> <Neutral> Steve Bannon, one of your Trump advisers, just the other day, to the New York Times, called the media the opposition party. Do you believe that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think to a large extent they're much more capable than the other side.
<David Brody> <Neutral> Other side, meaning?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, I think the media is the opposition party in many ways. And I think that, and I'm not talking about all media. I know people, like yourself, but I know people in the media that I have tremendous respect for. I respect them as much as anybody, so I'm not talking about everybody, but a big portion of the media, the dishonesty, the total deceit and deception makes them certainly partially the opposition party, absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think they're much more capable than the opposition party. The opposition party is losing badly. Now the media is on the opposition party's side. And I actually said to myself, I say they treat me so unfairly it's hard to believe that I won. But the fortunate thing about me is I have a big voice. I have a voice that people understand. And you see it now. We're bringing back jobs. Ford is making a massive investment now in Michigan, General Motors is going to be making just magnificent investments, so many other companies are coming back in. But yes, the media is a disgrace, and they've called me wrong from the beginning. I mean the New York Times has called me wrong from the beginning.
<David Brody> <Negative> They underestimated you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They actually apologized to their readers. They lost a lot of subscriptions not because their readers even like me, they said how inaccurate could you be? Because if you read The New York Times, there was no chance that Trump was going to win. And yet we go out there, and I felt I was going to win based on the crowds. You saw the crowds better than anybody. So, it's a very interesting fact.
<David Brody> <Negative> Let me switch gears, and you know, it wouldn't be an interview between us if I didn't ask a God question, if you will. How has that spiritual journey been for you? Especially being here and knowing the gravity of the office. Do you feel the need to pray more? Where are you on that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I will tell you what. I have always felt the need to pray so I would say that The Office is so powerful that you need God even more because your decisions are no longer, Gee
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So yes, you realize, these decisions are also important, it's almost not a decision that you make when you are sitting in this position that isn't a really life-altering position. So God comes in to it even more so.
<David Brody> <Neutral> You know, there are a lot of people, I remember when we were in California, on your golf course, a beautiful golf course, I might add.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That I may never see again.
<David Brody> <Neutral> I understand.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I may never see it again.
<David Brody> <Negative> It's disheartening.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's all right, we are doing something much more important.
<David Brody> <Negative> We talked about your -- you tweeting at the time, and I'm wondering nowadays as president, what is the filter here? I mean are you calling this out? Are you doing it yourself? How does this work now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the media is very dishonest, and if they were honest, I wouldn't bother doing it because I wouldn't have to do it because I could call somebody up and I could give them the information or I could issue a press release or something or I could have some kind of a conversation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, I have had conversations with the media, I think I understand the media, nobody really understands the media in all fairness but I have had conversations with people where rather than Twitter, I would call and given them information that on a message I want to get out, and the message will be totally distorted.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I will call up and say, that had nothing to do with what I told you. Well, I sort of thought this -- I would tell you strongly, I'm up to -- I think I will soon be over 50 million people between Facebook and Twitter and Instagram, and you know, the different things.
<David Brody> <Neutral> Do you call it out to folks?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, for instance, I could also go right into The White House but mine is much better, I like @realDonaldTrump because, and we use POTUS.
<David Brody> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I like @realDonaldTrump. But the beautiful thing about it, it's really a modern day form of communication. I can do 140 or 280, and -- or you know, you can extend them. All I do is dot dot dot, right? And you will extend it. So it really gets to be where you do have enough room if you need.
<David Brody> <Positive> You like the flexibility.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But generally just in the 140, but I can do messages around the media and get my word out the way I mean my word. I don't have to have the media distort my message because they go out of their way to distort my message. When the media takes my message, knows what my message is, and then writes it purposely so that it doesn't sound good, I would rather do Twitter. And that is what I do.
<David Brody> <Positive> There are a lot of folks that are going to want to judge these first 100 days, they are going to say this is a success -- they are going to have their own version of what a success is. For you and for these first 100 days, what is success for you exactly?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it started on one of the greatest days of my life. I think the speck turned out very good, I got very good reviews on the speech. The only negative reviews were some people said it was dark. But many people thought it was very optimistic because obviously it's dark when you have people being shot everyday in Chicago and you have things like this happening and when you look at the Middle East, and when you look at what is going on in North Korea and when you look at all of these things that are happening, you can't say life is a bowl of cherries, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I got very good reviews of the speech, we had a tremendous crowd, the audience was -- the crowd was great but the audience, the overall audience was, I think, the biggest ever to watch an inauguration address which was a great thing. That was also distorted in the media. They fought that as much as they could but it turns out it was probably the largest audience ever to watch an inauguration address.
<David Brody> <Positive> Why is it important for you to win on something like that? Because you haven't given that up. You want to make sure they understand.
<David Brody> <Neutral> What is it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, because I'm representing a lot of people, the forgotten people in many cases. And in many cases, not the forgotten people, people generally but many people that are the forgotten people, and they have been forgotten by the media that tries to distort them out of life. And so when I had that massive crowd and they show a picture of an emptier area, we had a tremendous crowd, but the audience which was the word used by Sean during the press conference, and he used the word audience, right in this first thing, is and I think it's indisputable, but if it is not, it's certainly very close but I think it was the largest audience ever. I want the forgotten people to understand that we are not forgotten anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And now the Democrats are after those people because frankly, they can't win an election without those people.
<David Brody> <Neutral> So we are wrapping here but a couple of last questions, on 100 days, is it important for you to have some sort of tax reform bill on your desk or do you want at least the structure in place?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, at least the structure because it takes a certain period of time statutorily, you file and then you have to wait and then you file again and you do something and you do an amendment and so there is a structural component and a statutory component.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So where you have to wait days -- one of those little problems in life but it's not actually a bad thing. And we also have health care that we are working on. And we are working on other things and one of the things I said that I'm going to try very hard to get done during my term and I will get it done is the Johnson Amendment for evangelicals, for Christians, for everybody of faith where we are going to try and end and terminate the Johnson Amendment which is a disaster for religion, in my opinion.
<David Brody> <Positive> It's a priority for you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a priority, absolutely.
<David Brody> <Neutral> Okay, last question because I know we have to run.
<David Brody> <Negative> Persecuted Christians, we've talked about this, the refugees overseas. The refugee program, or the refugee changes you're looking to make. As it relates to persecuted Christians, do you see them as kind of a priority here?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<David Brody> <Neutral> You do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They've been horribly treated. Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, is that the -- everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.
<David Brody> <Positive> Mr. President, a pleasure. Thank you for the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- a whole new set of files -- political files.  [Inaudible]  What does that mean?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Things that I read that I really feel that I want to keep, I keep them around. I have a lot of files [Inaudible] nearby.
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> We saw your Instagram video. Did you turn that up?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, that just came out? Yeah. How was it? Did you think it was interesting?
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> It definitely got people talking.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can imagine.
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> Was it your idea?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. That cost me two dollars, right?
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I must say running the election, I've spent less than anybody else and obviously had the best result. I have less people working for me than anybody else. Obviously, I'm doing better than anybody. Everybody would've said I would've been really working right now while Hillary was watching me. It turned out to be just the opposite. In fact, the end, there was actually a couple of things reported by the Washington Post and others that not only will the convention go to July, but it could be a new convention in August, which I guess happened one time or something in the history of the country where it didn't even get solved. Here I am. I had the big Indiana; well, big New York; big Pennsylvania; Maryland, you know, the whole thing. Then on top of that, the big Indiana and everybody said, no mas.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> We'll get into that because we're here to really [Crosstalk].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's good. You go ahead. Do you want something to drink before we start?
<Dan Balz> <Positive> I'm fine.
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> I'm fine. Really quick on the Instagram video, are you going to keep hitting Bill Clinton? Are there other things that you're planning [Crosstalk]?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't think that's a Bill hit; I think it may be a Hillary hit. They said things about me, which were very nasty. And I don't want to play that game at all. I don't want to play at all. But they said things about me that were very nasty. As long as they do that, I can play it whatever level I have to play at. I think I've proven that.
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> Yeah. These things are so old. Did they still matter even all these decades?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think they do. [Crosstalk]
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> Well, I know you've said that you don't want to dig back all the way into your past on some things. Why go back on Bill Clinton on some of these things?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Hillary has been playing the woman's card 100 percent. I think I'm going to do very well with women. I think women want security. They want safety. They want the military. They want to stop terrorism. They see her horrible moves on -- if you look at Libya. Benghazi came because of Libya. It's a fact, because of what happened in Libya, the Benghazi disaster. Amazingly, the public never picked up on Benghazi like I thought they should have maybe because a lot of people in mainstream don't write too much about it. But the public has never picked up on Benghazi like I would have thought. The Clinton Foundation's going to be very interesting because there's so many things. When you talk about quid pro quo, there are so many things going on there that could be a big factor. But no, the reason is, Jenna, that Hillary's been hitting me on that. So if she's going to play those cards, I'm going to play the same cards. An honor to have you back up. And thank you for being so fair. You've been really fair. Tough one need be, and very tough unfortunately when need be. I really mean this, Dan, you've been very fair.
<Dan Balz> <Positive> Thanks. I will. I try to be fair.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I appreciate that.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> Tough when I need to be. We're working on one of the chapters of the book. It has to do with how you won. As an opening question, as you look back on all this --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> process.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> -- no, no, but give us three turning points in your mind that were the key to your becoming the presumptive nominee.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the first turning point was when I decided to do it. I didn't really know for sure until literally a couple of days before because I have to give up a lot. Look, I've always heard that for a very successful person, a very rich person to run for president is something you just don't do. You don't do. And I can see why: because of the falsities, the viciousness, it's beyond anything. I think I'm handling it very nicely and I fight back. When I hear the Washington Post has 20 reporters on me, which is wrong, and very few on Hillary and very few on other candidates actually, very, very few, so the level of hatred is pretty amazing. So I think, number one, when I decided to do it was a big turning point almost because I was really thinking in terms of not doing it. I thought of it before, most particularly during the Romney run. If you look back, you'll see I was doing very well on the polls, really well. In fact, the day I announced that I wouldn't do it, NBC was putting a lot of pressure on to renew The Apprentice, which they did again. Generally, they sat right in that chair, Steve Burke right there and the heads of NBC one year ago, you know, sometime prior to June 16th, two months prior to June 16th. They tried to convince me to do The Apprentice again. As you know, even in the 14th season, it did fantastically well. They wanted me to do it again. I said no. That was a turning point. When I turned down The Apprentice, in a way, was a turning point because you're turning down, not only -- look, it's still a lot of money. I get paid a lot of money. You saw that. Two hundred and thirteen million dollars was reported as of a year ago is what I've made from doing The Apprentice. I also own -- I have a big chunk of it with Mark Burnett. Mark Burnett and I have the power over The Apprentice. And we chose Arnold Schwarzenegger to take my place. That was a little bit of a turning point because you're giving up a primetime show that has done very well for 14 seasons. It was a lot of money I made. It was reported that I made $213 million. It was reported, certified that I made up until that point. Obviously, you get paid a lot of money for doing it. You're also in primetime television between an hour and two hours a week. Some people think it's trivial. It's not trivial at all.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> What was the decision this time? You had looked at it before, as you said, several times. You were in a run up in 2011 to do it. Why did you not do it then? Why did you do it this time?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay, that's such a great question. In 2011, my children were younger, Ivanka, who you know and met. My children were younger. I was doing numerous jobs, many jobs, and I really wanted to wrap them up. Now, I've just finished Doral in Miami and a couple of others. The Old Post Office is the one - because we own 100 percent of that and owned 100 percent of Doral. One of the misconceptions, although it's a great thing, I do licensing deals, but I own a lot of stuff. We have many licensing deals going on all over the world right now. We're going to have hundreds of them all over the world. The Old Post Office is finishing up. In fact, we'll be one year ahead of schedule, which looks awfully good down on the résumé. We're going to be opening that around September 15th. I mean open-open. That's approximately one year ahead of schedule, which is great. That's what I do. I mean, I think building and building on time, on budget, even ahead of schedule is one of my big strengths, which is awfully a good strength to have for infrastructure of this country, where the country is falling apart. When I go back four years, Dan, I had a signed contract with The Apprentice, so I couldn't say I won't do it because I actually had another signed for another year. I'd actually have to go and get my way out of it. The show was doing very well so it wouldn't be that easy. And I had numerous jobs going on. It's hard to say to NBC where they have a very successful show that, would you let me out of a season? I talked about it routinely with them. But they wouldn't have been thrilled. Also, I had numerous jobs. Now, it's four years later. I think in many ways, the country is doing worse from the standpoint of jobs, from the standpoint of anger. I think the Iran deal was an absolute -- the deal they made with Iran was an absolute killer deal. Killer deal. Hillary's in favor it and I'm totally against it. I thought it was a killer deal. Not that I'm against making deals, but they have to be good deals. They can't be incompetent deals. That's an incompetent deal done by incompetent people. I think as I looked at things that were happening, I just said, this is the right time to do it. My children are four years older. I have great executives. I lightened up on the hard jobs, which is the big building developments where there's risk. You want to get them finished, everything else. That would be essentially a turning point. That's why I decided this way.
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> That's one turning point.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> One turning point would be some time prior to turning down The Apprentice with the extension for a lot of money, for a long extension, too - a lot of money and a lot of prestige. You have a primetime television show that does very well. The other would be just a day — maybe you could put this in the same category — the day and a few days before I announced. Once I sent out the press release, it's going to be awfully hard. I'll take a very bad day if I turned out the press release and then decided not to. When I put out that release that we're going to meet on June 16th, and that was the famous escalator ride down. Such an interesting question, nobody has asked to do it that way. I think a very important element was the polls have me doing very well on the debates. They do all those online polls. Time magazine does, and then Drudge and all of them. There's about six or seven of them. I seem to have done very well on the debates. That was important because I didn't know. I never did that kind of debating before. I didn't know what that was going to be like. I actually like it. But I didn't know that debating would be good, bad or indifferent. I'm debating against the people that do that professionally. I'm running against 16 very capable people. I feel very good. The first debate, I felt I was hit unfairly, but that's okay. But I came out very good on that debate. Every single online poll -- will you get that information [for] Dan? That and the Facebook stuff and that Google Map, which was crazy. But every single online poll — and I'm saying this as we're recording — of every single debate that I was in - I skipped the one debate because I didn't think I was being treated fairly - but every single online poll of every single debate, I won. I won every one of them. Now, these are hundreds of thousands of people. This isn't like, gee, I'm sending somebody, dial in. After the debate, polls have become much -- I think I made polls more important, to be honest with you, because I talk about polls. The new polls are terrific. The Morning Tracking Poll now, it's like that. We're now exceeding her. Your Washington Post came out with a beauty where we're a couple of points ahead -- strongly, strong trend, too, which is very important. Every single poll had me winning the debates. I didn't know about the debates. But I did know because I've always gotten ratings. NBC always called me the ratings machine, the nickname. You found that out. Of course, the numbers came out and there's 24 million for NBC; a couple of weeks later it was 23.5 million for CNN. One was the highest in the history of cable television. The other one was the highest in the history of CNN. They cover a lot of wars. They cover a lot of interesting stuff. I was less surprised by that, I think, than some other things. I've always gotten very high ratings, which I guess is one of the reasons that television has covered me to that extent perhaps.
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> Give us the third turning point. Then we got some specific points.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A third turning point was a little bit Iowa, because I wasn't given proper credit in Iowa.
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> How do you mean?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you. I came in second in Iowa. I should have come in first. My team was not as good as -- I'm a very good manager. And I had a team that frankly I believe that I won -- but you know I'm not a big fan of the caucus system. When people walked in, they had lots of people on the other side trying to turn these people around. Yet I came in a very strong second. I got no credit for it. Marco came in third. They were saying, it's like, great. I said, well, what about me? I came in second. I've never done this before. It did awaken me to the nastiness of politics. People would walk in wanting to vote for Trump. They were just engulfed by Cruz people like, oh, didn't you know this, didn't you know that - all sorts of false things. They also did a very unfair number on Ben Carson where they said he has left the race, he has left the race, because I should have won. I learned all about politics in one evening. I learned a lot about politics in one evening, the dirtiness. I also learned that I should have been given credit. I have never done this before. That's the first election I was ever in. I came in a very strong second.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> So are you angry about that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you. I never got credit for another one at Wisconsin. I got almost 36 percent in Wisconsin. Cruz got 40 something percent. Yet the entire establishment, millions of dollars were spent. The radio hosts were totally against and the governor's entire machine was against me. Somebody should have said I did a really good job to get a number like that. I never heard that, which was interesting. But let me go back to this other point. So I did really well in Iowa. I was not given credit for it, but I learned a lot about politics in Iowa and I'm okay with that. Then I went to New Hampshire and did unbelievably well because I was not expected to win New Hampshire. I won going away.
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> Were you more motivated in New Hampshire as a result of what happened in Iowa?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, because I shouldn't have lost Iowa. I think Iowa was a state that I did really well in. Shenanigans sort of took it away.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> Do you get angry in a moment like that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I know that's the way life works. A lot of times, people ask me, what's the difference between like top business people and politicians? You can't totally generalize, but I would say the business people can be tougher, but the politicians can be much more deceptive. It's a very deceptive group of people. I wouldn't even tell you about the press difference. But there's a big difference there too. I won't discuss it. But I've always found that to be an interesting question. I deal with the top people and there's a certain toughness that they have that's greater than the politicians. But the politicians are far more deceptive, which to me is that's the way it is. That's just my opinion. So I think that New Hampshire was a big moment for me. I'm a pretty political person. I was on the other side giving hundreds -- I guess I gave $350,000 to the RGA, Republican Governors' Association. Historically, I gave always a lot of money to politicians including to New York where I have a lot of stuff and a lot of zoning. I got a city zoned on the West Side of Manhattan from 72nd Street to 59th Street. That was a tremendous success, like a phenomenal success. Nobody writes about my successes. They only talk about, oh, how's your water company doing? My water company's doing great actually. But nobody knows about the water company. I have a water company that does a big business. They talk about my water company. But I said, I wonder, why don't they talk about all of these places all over the country, all over the world that are tremendous successes? They don't want to talk about that. I think that when I came down, when I made the speech and when I won New Hampshire -- New Hampshire was a very important state for me because as a person that was involved in politics but really from the other side — from the donor side I guess you could say, and nobody knows more about the donor side than I do — I think the words, "New Hampshire," meant a lot to me. It's just a very important state politically. I always heard all my whole life, New Hampshire, right? You hear Iowa. You hear New Hampshire. Doing well in Iowa, which I was never given credit for -- I don't know if you remember. When I came in second, it was a strong second. It was a strong second, and I got zero credit, and Rubio came in third. They were talking like he was the next coming. I said, but I beat him by a lot. I beat him. Why aren't they talking about that? So I learned a little bit about lots of things including unfair treatment of the press. But New Hampshire was great because I wasn't expected to win. I would say Bush was probably expected to win. That was going to always be his state. He had spent a fortune in New Hampshire. He had spent a fortune on negative ads on me, a fortune. I'm getting hit 15 different ways with the negative ads. Then I won it by a lot easily, so that was a big one. I'd say another one was a great thing that happened to me was in South Carolina. That was going to be a firewall. Cruz has many firewalls, right? That didn't work out too well because I won the South, all of the South. I won in Alabama, in Arkansas on everything. Kentucky, I won. I mean, the state of Florida was an incredible victory. But I won the entire South. I think, Jenna, right? Everything. I mean, I can't think of anything I didn't win there. That was all going to be Cruz's territory, right? We have everything there. That was going to be Cruz's territory. Not only did I win them, but I won them by massive numbers. I got almost 50 percent in the state of Alabama. During a similar time, I won Massachusetts with almost 50 percent. I will tell you that winning very different places like that with tremendous percentages against many people -- you've heard me say this. I've been treated -- I don't know if it's purposely or is it a lack of knowledge by the pundits, but I think it's probably purposely. As you know, we started off with 17 people. So the first place, I had 16. You had to beat -- and I got a lot of people in Iowa, a lot of people in New Hampshire, but I had many, many people. If you start taking that down where you would normally have one or two or three people instead of 16 people, my numbers were enormous, as good as they are now. And the pundits never bring that out. In other words, when I won Massachusetts -- you'll have to check the number but let's say I had five, or seven, or ten people – we had a lot. And yet, I get almost 50 percent. That's a phenomenal thing. I know that, for instance, in watching somebody like a Charles Krauthammer, he was conscious: "He didn't get 50 percent." But I had 12 people. You understand? You can't get 50 percent. I watched Hillary Clinton the other day -- two weeks ago because now, I'm catching up very rapidly. But I broke the alltime record in the history of the Republican Party for the number of votes in the primary. But she said, "I have 1.7 million votes more than Trump." Well, she's had one candidate, whereas, I start
<Dan Balz> <Negative> There are two early moments that we wanted to ask you about. One is the announcement day and the other is the first debate. And in both cases, you did something that was in a sense off script or unexpected. On announcement day, the short text that had been put out of your speech did not include any of the references you made about Mexicans. That basically came from you. So one question is, how did that evolve? What made you decide to do it at that moment? In the first debate, there's the question about, if there's anybody here who's not prepared to question -- [Unrelated conversation]
<Dan Balz> <Negative> You raised your hand. The only one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It took courage.
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> Put us inside on both of those? How did you come to do both of those things?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, on the raising of the hand, we'll start with that, that was an interesting moment because I had no idea that was going to happen. And if you remember, that was a very big crowd not only because it was the first debate but it was in the arena. It was in a basketball arena that they had cut, and so we had a massive audience and we had thousands of people. And they were Republicans and they were people that wanted to unify and these were people that wanted to see the pledge signed or whatever. And I said this is a rough question. I mean, in a certain way that question might have been tougher than Megyn's question. But raise your hand. And I'm the only one that raised my hand. Now, the question wasn't meant for anybody else in the room. It was only meant for me because the other people in the room didn't really pertain to them, right?
<Dan Balz> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I raised my hand and I got a lot of credit for it. I got a lot of credit for raising my hand. Although the audience --
<Dan Balz> <Negative> The audience didn't give you credit --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, they didn't. They didn't actually. It's funny they gave me great credit as I went through the debate but they really went wild on that one. But it wasn't -- it was sort of a laughing negativity as opposed to an angry negativity. I could see that. I could feel that. It was a little bit of a laughing negativity, Dan. It wasn't great anger. They understood. They got it.
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> Was there a calculation that went through your head as you're deciding if you could put your hand up? What was going through your head?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. There's just honesty. The honest answer is what I gave. Now, ultimately --
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> Then why were you not at that point prepared to say I'll -- ?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because I didn't know whether or not I would be treated fairly. And I think I've been treated fairly. I think the system is rigged. And that was the word that I came up that now everyone is using. They picked up many of my wonderful words. You never heard the system is rigged before until I started it. Now, Bernie Sanders is using the exact same expression. But the system is rigged. It's rigged in a different way. It's rigged for the Republicans differently than for the Democrats. The Democrats, it's a much more obvious rigging of the system because you have the super delegates which are a disaster. With the Republicans, it's really different.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> But at that point in your candidacy, you were not convinced that the party would treat you fairly?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's correct. And that was before I was doing well. Let's see. Was I on center stage? Just about, yeah.
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> You were at that point.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I've been on center stage every single debate when you think of it. I've been on center stage every single debate. And one of the things I was very insistent, although it didn't always work out that way is that I always wanted an odd number because if you have an even number, you're not on center stage. You're sharing center stage with somebody else that doesn't play. I don't know, this is sort of maybe fun for your thing, but I always fought for an odd number. I said, wait a minute, I'm on center stage. I'm winning by a lot. I'm winning every debate. And if you give me ten people, like sharing it with somebody that doesn't belong. So I fought it. I'd usually win that. But I've been on center stage every single debate if you think of it. And you're right, I didn't think about that. But on the first debate, I was on center stage too. So I did raise my hand and that was -- I think it was something that was respected by the audience. There was some booing but it was friendly booing if there's such a thing. But it was friendly booing. They were laughing. They were booing. Everybody understood exactly what I meant. And I did the right thing. It would have been much easier just to keep my hand down. Don't forget that was like -- was that the first or second?
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> That was the first.
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> That was the very first. The first question.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The first thing that ever happened to me as a professional politician on a debate stage, which I had never done before, was that question. And I made the right decision to do it. It showed honesty. And I think people respected the honesty. And then the second, you asked about --
<Dan Balz> <Negative> About the decision to talk about -- on immigration and Mexicans sending rapists and murderers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah. The interesting one on that is that if you got a copy of my speech, we sent out a copy prior to it. Reading it, I'd say, wait a minute. Beyond that question, I didn't want to do that speech.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> You didn't want to do it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I didn't.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> Why not?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because I really view that, again, never having done this before, I viewed that as an outline, not necessarily something that I would have to follow. So I gave out to you what was called an outline. Little did I know that's very unusual that somebody would give out a speech and then go totally off speech. Because I didn't go off speech on Mexico; I want off speech on virtually everything. And I got great reviews on the speech. And then what happened is, about a week later, they said whoa. The whole thing on Mexico did not happen. If you remember, it did not happen. [Interruption]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was strange because I actually got very good reviews on the speech. I was given good reviews on the speech. Although it was interesting because a couple of us that were sitting here reading the speech, it didn't not only having to do with Mexico, it didn't conform in any way, shape, or form.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was weird because I said, wait a minute, I made that speech a week ago. I had actually made two other speeches after that and nobody said anything. I thought that was strange. And what they hit was the illegal immigration. No question about it. And the statements on Mexico and the statements on pretty much on Mexico was a big thing. And if you read what I'm saying, Mexico sending, well, I happen to believe it. I have very good relationships with Mexico. I have great relationships with the Mexican people. I have thousands of employees and have had thousands of employees who are Hispanic. In Nevada, you saw that I won the poll on the exit polls. Wherever they do the exit polls, I seem to win. In fact, I guess it was a poll recently where I'm ahead of Mitt Romney. You saw that where I'm ahead with the Hispanics of Mitt Romney. I'm one point above him. And I haven't started yet. But I think I'm going to do actually very well with this but --
<Dan Balz> <Negative> When you started to get the blowback on that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> About a week later.
<Dan Balz> <Positive> Yeah. You're new to politics --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And by the way, and that was serious blowback.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> That's what I mean.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In fact, I said, wait a minute. How long do we have until the general election? Because if this is the case, that was beyond anything. And I've been a very public person for a long time. That was blowback like I've never had before. And I said to myself, let's see, it's June, so we had a-year-and-a-half before the general. I said is everyday going to be like this? I was being inundated. We're having hundreds of calls.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> And then you were in a fight with Univision over it. And then you were in a fight with --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the Univision turned out to be excellent because I ended up selling the Miss Universe contest because of that whole thing. I probably wouldn't have sold it; it was a great number.
<Dan Balz> <Positive> Right. But you were in a number of things which it was affecting your business relationships.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure. It affected Macy's. I had a deal with Macy's, not a big deal but it's a deal. The head of Macy's was one of my best friends named Terry Lundgren.
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> Did you think at that point --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he bailed on me and I said, wow. And I haven't spoken to him since. But he bailed on me. I couldn't believe it. I actually couldn't believe it. And I said, what's the big deal? He said, "Well, you know, the Mexicans are planning to boycott." I said, "You had boycotts before. They last for about two hours and forget it." "Are they're going to picket the store." And the ties did well. The shirts did well. But it wasn't a big business or anything.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> Did it give you any second thoughts about maybe this is really not the right thing for me to do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I have to do what I have to do. It turned out I was right. Illegal immigration is turning out to be one of the truly big stories of this campaign. You know that better than I do. So it turned out I was right.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> But at that moment, were you convinced of it? Or did you have to --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I didn't know. I didn't know. I'll tell you what, Dan. I got hit so hard. And it was sort of like the delayed. Did you ever watched George Foreman knocking out -- when he hit Joe Frazier, where he hit him? And about two seconds later, Joe went up in the air. It's almost like a spring. He hit him. You know what I'm talking about.
<Dan Balz> <Positive> Yeah. I do remember now, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was weird because it would've been one thing if it was the day after the speech. But it was a week later. It's almost like people started reading the speech a week later. And that was really, really brutal. A couple of weeks went by and then what happened is people started looking at the incredible crime statistics, how bad it is. In fact, let me -- could I have the report on Mexico, please, that I just got? You've got to see this report. It's unbelievable.
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> When did you know that that was a message that resonates? Was it when you got the first batch of polling back or out of --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's a very good question.
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> Or the Phoenix?
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> -- or the Phoenix probably?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've had three or four moments where that's the end, that's the end. It's over. I end up getting polls go higher.
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> Do you think it was over?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Here's Mexico travel warning. You take it back and read it. "U.S. citizens have been victims of vicious crimes, violent crimes such as homicide, kidnapping, carjacking, robbery by organized criminal groups in various Mexican states. This is just out.
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> From whom to whom?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> United States Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs. "The Mexico-U.S. traveler should be aware that the Mexican government has been engaged in extensive to counter organized criminal groups." This just came out recently. It's unbelievable. I'm going to leave it. You can have it here.
<Dan Balz> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And basically this was infiltrating -- [Unrelated conversation regarding interview scheduling]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it turned out that I was right. And then you had the killing of Kate in San Francisco, and the killing of Jamiel, and the killing of so many people, and the horrible situation. And all of a sudden, people said he's right. And people knew I was right. And you're going to have tremendous numbers of liberals in Los Angeles, because I'm going to make a very strong play for California, which no other Republican would even think about. A friend of mine called up. And he goes, "You're going to get every liberal in Los Angeles voting for you because they're tired of the crime and the problems and everything else, you know?" People that never voted Republican before, they're going to vote for me. You watch. So I'm going to make a play for California. No other Republican -- I'm going to make a play for New York. You saw my numbers in the thing. Don't forget, again, even though it's down to three, three people, when you get 62 percent and when you've won every single county and you've won everything. In Pennsylvania, every county. In Maryland, in Connecticut, I won virtually -- I think all of them was every county of every state.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> I think there may be six counties that you didn't win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you check it out but pretty close to it.
<Dan Balz> <Positive> You're right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll say almost every county of every state, nothing like that has ever happened before. So I'm going to make a heavy play for New York. And one of the things I tell people, one of the things I've been saying to people is that let's say Ted Cruz got in or somebody else. They have their six states they have to win. Boom, boom, like cookie cutters, right? And if they lose one of them, it's gone. I think I have 15 or 17 maybe. I was in the state of Washington. We had turnouts like you wouldn't believe a week-and-a-half ago. Now, I was told the state of Washington is not in play for a Republican but I think it's in play for me.
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> And just like --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I may be wrong. Again, famous last words, I may be wrong. You'll tell me. Go ahead, Jenna.
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> It felt like the blowback to your proposed Muslim ban was another one of these moments.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But not like the original.
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In fact, I was asking my people the other day, Jenna. So I've had blowback from a lot. The blowback from the initial assault on Mexico -- and it wasn't an assault. I said they are sending. It's true. The government of Mexico is very smart. They don't want them. People are being sent. In other words, instead of being here, go ahead to the United States. Let them take you.
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> What was the difference on the Muslims ban frame?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It just wasn't as intense nearly.
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> And a lot of people think that it was just kind of a quick decision, but there were several days of planning that went into announcing this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. It's a fairly quick decision.
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> Okay. Yeah. Tell me a little about how you came to this.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was a decision that I made on the boat as you know. It was a decision not on the boat -- going, you know, a couple of days before.
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> But it was time for Pearl Harbor Day.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was time for --
<Dan Balz> <Positive> Pearl Harbor.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, it was in that vicinity. But honestly, Pearl Harbor but it wasn't really having to do with that. I think that was much more of a coincidence than anything else. [Interruption]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, yeah, the Paris and the San Bernardino. And then you start adding up the World Trade Center and lots of other places all over the world. We're not talking about a United States problem.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> But was this something that just kind of came to you? We have to do something and here's what we have to do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, it was. It absolutely was. I said we have a problem. We have a president that won't even mention the term. And we had San Bernardino where they were radicalized. They became radicalized. He probably became radicalized by her. And they killed 14 coworkers that had previously given them a shower party for their baby, a baby shower for the baby. And a wedding shower. And they were friendly, they worked there, and they killed them. And they killed more -- they had many people still in the hospital. And then you had the horror show of Paris where 130 people killed and many, many people in the hospital right now that will never fully be able to recover. And obviously many other things, many other things. So I said something has to be done. So I said we're going to call for a temporary ban on them coming in. And you also had the whole thing with the migration starting to form where people are starting to think about let's let a lot of people come in from Syria, even though we know nothing about them, who they are, et cetera, et cetera. But they do have cellphones. And they do have ISIS flags on some of those cellphones. And you say, what are we doing? I don't know if you know but a lot of the cellphones had the ISIS flag on them. And we let them into our country. So I said it's time we get smart.
<Jenna Johnson> <Neutral> And the first statement that came out --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What did you think was more this way of the two?
<Dan Balz> <Positive> Well, I thought that there was a visceral reaction on the statement about Mexico. And part of it was because you were a brand new candidate. I thought that the reaction on the Muslim ban in a sense crystalized a certain opposition to your candidacy and that it became very intense.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was intense.
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> That you were prepared to say things that no other candidate had been prepared to say. And a lot of people thought it was way beyond that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the way, I've had candidates tell me confidentially - two candidates, maybe three, three candidates - said you're so right on the Muslim thing but I'm never saying it. I've had three candidates say it. And again, I didn't do it for this reason. [Interruption] I will say and I don't know that you remember the moment, but I said it and I guess I said until we find out what the hell is going on, because it was so bad. And it wasn't just -- it was Paris and San Bernardino and many other things in different other countries. Obviously, every day you pick up the paper, you have another event happening. And it was also the hatred. There's tremendous hatred. You look at ISIS, the whole thing is like your basic disaster. And I made the statement. The room jumped up. You can get the tape. There's a massive room on the carrier. We set the all-time record for attendance on that boat. This room was packed. It shows you I was strong, right? The place was packed. There were thousands of people outside. They couldn't get on the aircraft carrier. And they couldn't get on. And I said it and the place went crazy, they jumped up. Like when I did the raising of the hand, you know, it was woo, woo, woo. But it was fun and everyone was laughing and we're having a good time. This was the place jumped up in the air. They were going crazy. [Interruption] Then you guys wrote it. Meaning, the press wrote it.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> So here's a question related to that. You saw the kind of reaction of the pundit class or part of your Republican establishment either attacking you or reservations.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A lot of them attacked and didn't believe it probably.
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> Right. But at the same time, you're seeing the reaction among people you talked to.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Dan Balz> <Positive> What does that tell you? Does that give you confidence as a candidate that you understand something that so-called smart people don't?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I gained that before because I must tell you, I've had good instincts in life, and a lot of this is instinct. You talked about three moments of -- I mean, I could tell you, one was when Charles Krauthammer and others, many others said this is the single most talented field of candidates ever assembled in the history of the Republican Party. They said that. One said since World War II. It's a long time. But they said, literally, there has never been a group of such talented people. This is the single greatest group of people. And I hadn't announced yet. I'm saying what am I doing? These people are saying this group. Why am I doing this? Because I don't know most of these people. But I did it anyway. And now, I say, really? Tell me about it. So you have to go by your own instinct. You can't listen to the pundits. I mean, I watched this poor guy, this poor, sad guy who's on television all the time talking about the party, the magazine. What's his name? Bill Kristol. I watched this poor guy. He's called it wrong for two years. "Trump will never run. He's never going to run. It won't happen. He won't run. He won't run." I'm running. Then, "He'll never file papers. It won't happen. It won't happen. And if he does, he'll ask for two 45-day extensions." I filed my papers. Whereas, guys with a one-day financial page asked for extensions, I didn't and I have over a hundred pages. I watched these people. And they're sad. I mean, he's a sad guy. I watched him the other day on television, "Well, we haven't given up." But here's a guy who has been wrong about me for a-year-and-a-half from before I ever announced. "He'll never announce. It won't happen. He'll never file his papers." Then I filed my papers. My papers are great. By the way, those papers, I filed my new ones and I got pretty rave reviews on that. I have very little debt. I have phenomenal assets. Those are the papers you'll learn something about somebody. You don't learn them from tax returns just so you understand. And I'll file my tax returns when the audits are finished, and they're routine audits. But those are the papers, Dan, that you'll learn something. I filed, I guess, it's over 100 pages - One hundred and four pages of deal after deal after deal. Good ones. They don't even talk about, oh, this one on page 87 maybe wasn't so good. I actually take good deals. I've taken what should be bad deals because the market collapsed and made them great deals, sometimes better than if the market didn't collapse.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> When was the point where you said to yourself, you know, I could win this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's the question. I think it was probably day one because I wouldn't have done it if I thought I wouldn't win. I mean, I wouldn't have done it -- I didn't do it as an exercise.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> But you go into it saying I'm not going to get into this if I don't think I can win. But then you're in competition. At some point --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's fine. I think I wouldn't have done it -- you never know about this. My wife said to me -- my wife is a very smart person. She was very successful before, you know. But she knows me well and she sees me. She sees me out. She said, "You know if you run, you're going to win, don't you?" I said, "No, I don't know that." She said, "I will tell you, if you run you're going to win. But you can't just say you're going to run. You can't just say, 'I'm going to run' but not announce you're going to run." And the polls were not doing me because I did so well in the polls four years before, and then I said I wasn't going to run. So very few people polled me. When I did poll, I didn't do that well. I was down to 3 percent. And Melania said, "That doesn't mean anything." I said, "What do you mean? That's a poll." She said, "No, no. They don't believe you're going to run." And let me just tell you - and she was very strong at this. She said, "If you run you're going to win. I have no doubt about it." And I said, "Well, now they polled me." She said, "No, no, they don't believe -- even though it said 'if Donald Trump runs.' And even if they said Donald Trump will run, they still don't believe." She said, "You have to get up and announce you're going to run." Not that she wanted me to run. She would have preferred the life we had.
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> So are you saying that in August once you went ahead on the polls, you said, "I know I'm going to run"? Or was it --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No. I think when I won New Hampshire.
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> New Hampshire.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Because I won a state that Bush was expected to win easily. He was up there. That was sort of his. It was always Bush territory, right? From day one, he was going to win New Hampshire. I think that that was a big factor. I think even when I saw the polls, when I saw the ratings for television, when I saw that, in the history of cable television, it was the highest rating, I knew they weren't there to watch Jeb, okay? That was an indication. And then a couple of weeks later, CNN gets 23 million people. And that's the highest rating in the history of CNN. That's a big history. It's a pretty important history in all fairness with what they cover especially with the [Crosstalk].
<Dan Balz> <Negative> Why didn't you say to yourself, well, they're watching because I'm a reality TV star, not because they want me to be president.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I didn't feel that. You're right. I guess I should have said that. I didn't feel that. And Variety. It's all over the place. Variety said, "The Trump debate." They called it, "The Trump debate scores record ratings." Then two weeks later, "The Trump debate gives CNN its biggest to date." They only referred to them as the Trump debate. And, you know, years before those debates used to be an afterthought. There weren't even things that got decent ratings on television. In fact, there was a point where the FCC made the television networks put them on. The networks didn't even want the debates. And now they've become like massive television. They say the debate, if it's Trump and Hillary, is going to be Super Bowl numbers. It will be the highest -- you know what, which is a good thing for the country because the country has always had malaise. It's never been the voter turnout. They say voter turnout will be the highest in the history of the country. That's a good thing. And they say that the debate will get the highest numbers, I mean it will be like massive numbers.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> How do you explain that? And also, when we look at these poll numbers that you and she are the two least popular nominees that we've ever had?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think in my case, it's because number one, I don't believe the numbers. But I think in my case it's because popularity is not important as competence. I believe that as an example, I'm going to do very well with women. You've seen where they voted and you had polls. Look at the women votes like the exit polls, because they want strength, they want strong borders, they want a strong military. They want strength. They want terrorism ended. I do great on all of the military questions, all of the military, all of the security questions. And women want that. They want that. And if you look at the polls, like CNN does these massive polls where they talk about everything, I do the best on military, the best on the borders, the best, all of these things. And I think that far outweighs -- I oftentimes tell the story about a woman that came up to me. She said, "Mr. Trump, I like you so much but you have to be nicer." I said this election has nothing to do with nice. This has to do with competence. And the people are tired of incompetent people. Hillary, essentially, is incompetent. I will say that. She may have experience but you look at her decisions -- and I was totally against the Iraq War. They like to say, well, on Howard Stern -- that was while before the war started. And even then, I was, I don't know. That's the first time I was ever asked the question. Don't forget, I'm a businessman. Nobody is asking me about the Iraq War. But Howard is a friend of mine. If you go back to 2004, I was strongly against that war. And I was against it before it ever started because I said it's going to destabilize the Middle East. And Hillary voted for it. But beyond that -- because maybe she was given bad information. Beyond that -- because I said it was going to destabilize the Middle East. Everything I said was exactly right. Iran will take over Iraq. Everything I said that's happening. You saw the mess two weeks ago when they walked into their halls [sounds like]. I mean, the place is a total mess. And they will take over among the largest oil reserves in the world when they do that. So I think that it's just worked out. And now, if you say, do I think it could have worked out to this extent because this extent has been a big -- this is beyond like winning. I thought I could win by a neck on the last day maybe. I had no idea that I'd be sitting home watching Hillary Clinton fighting for her life.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> You alluded to feeling as though you didn't get enough credit in Wisconsin. But that was an important loss and you obviously --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It made me fight harder in New Hampshire. I'm sorry, it made me fight harder in my next group of contests.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> You must have been down that night.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, sometimes I don't have time to get down. But I think I was not given -- two events took place which were interesting. I think I've been treated very unfairly throughout the process. But I think I did really well in Iowa although I should have won. And it made me realize that management -- it's not just the voters going in. It made me realize that management of an election is very important. Because I'm telling you, I had more voters walking through those doors wanting to vote for Trump than Ted Cruz. But he had a massive group of people inside grabbing everybody and giving lots of false stories of my positions and bringing them over. For whatever reason, I didn't have that. So I learned something. But I still came in a strong second. And it's 17 people. So I came in second then I was like, "Trump loses." I came in second. But Rubio - you remember that story - Rubio became a star because of that. And the other one was Wisconsin. I had great audiences in Wisconsin. We had tremendous crowds. I thought I was going to win Wisconsin. Everybody said you can't because the governor and the machine were against you. You had the five radio hosts that were against you. It was a whole lot of things we were against. But I had the biggest crowds by far. And I thought, okay, so I got almost 36 percent.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> But that's a case in which you're instincts failed.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They didn't fail me.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> But I mean your instincts were wrong. You thought you were going to win, you didn't.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I thought I did very well in both places considering, and I wasn't [Crosstalk].
<Dan Balz> <Negative> But you're somebody who knows the difference between a win and a loss. And if you're at 36 and your opponent is at 44 or 45, that's a loss, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know. But when they said I lost, it was like I didn't exist. And you still had numerous people in the event.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> But wasn't part of that that gave life to the Never Trump Movement?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Correct.
<Dan Balz> <Positive> That night --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. The Never Trump Movement spent $12 million on that campaign. I spent zero. I spent almost nothing.
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> No. But I mean they came out of Wisconsin.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It gave them a glimmer of hope.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> That's what I'm saying.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh yeah, it gave them hope. It gave them hope.
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> So what was your reaction on that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the hope was taken away the next week when I came to New York. I'll tell you New York -- I love New York. And New York we blew them out. And then we had the five states right after that, Pennsylvania and Maryland and Connecticut and Delaware, Rhode Island. And I just blew them out everywhere, every one of them. And then, of course, you had the watershed or as they call it, the firewall of Indiana which was going to be a total victory for Ted Cruz. And I ended up winning the evangelical vote and winning all sorts of things that he was hoping to win. That same thing happened in South Carolina, by the way. I went to South Carolina and totally blew everyone out. And I won the evangelicals. So I won the South. I won in South Carolina and I won with the evangelicals and blew them away. I mean, it's been an amazing period of time.
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> You did that in South Carolina after calling the last Republican president of the United States a liar.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Correct. Well, I didn't call him a liar. I didn't call him a liar. I did two things. Yeah, I did three things. Number one, the Pope came out against me. Because he said, you said a wall. Well, that's because he was in Mexico that week and the Mexican leaders don't want the wall because that will stop them from continuing to rip us off and sending the wrong people and sending the drugs and sending whatever. They don't want a wall. So I had the Pope come out. In fact, I remember when Hope and Corey and a whole group came. "Could we see you?" "What happened?" "The Pope." I said, "The Pope? What has the Pope have to do with South Carolina?" "He just said some bad things about you." I said, "The Pope?" And the next day, it was a front page story.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> So you knew what he had said before you responded?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I did. And we put out a very strong statement.
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> But not exactly. It's not exactly what he had said.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I just knew that the Pope just came out. I said what is it?
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> You just knew that there was something negative that you [Crosstalk].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Actually, the way it was basically, the Pope just said something about you. I said, the Pope? Yeah. Where is the Pope? He's in Mexico. I said, is it good news or bad news? They said it's bad news. That's the way it was. I said, is it good news or bad news? And they said it's bad news. I said, what is it? That's when they told me what it was. And then I immediately thought of the Vatican with the massive walls. I said, well, wait a minute, he's got the bigger walls. He's got walls like you couldn't even dream of. So it was sort of strange. The Pope actually came out with a very second statement which was absolutely -- because he was given a lot of false information by the Mexican government.
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> Why hit him that hard? Why not just wait a little bit to see exactly --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I didn't hit him.
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> Or come out and defend yourself [Crosstalk].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But Jenna, I had an election. I had the Pope coming out. I thought this was not -- so anyway, that was one thing. So I had three things. I had the Pope which worked out fine because just before -- and he came out and released a statement that really brought it down a big notch. Then I made the statement about Bush and I talked about two things. Number one, during the debate I talked -- when he [Jeb] said, "My brother kept us safe." I said, really? What about the World Trade Center coming down? And for some reason, he's been absolved of that. It was like the paperclip. It's very, very simple but only one person made money with it, right? He was always known as the president that kept us safe. And Jeb would hit me at the debates -- two times at the Reagan Library. And again, at the next debate, I said I got to do it. I didn't want to do it. I got to do it. Because he said, "My brother kept us safe." And at the Reagan Library, I said I got to let him get away with it. And you know the funny thing, nobody thinks of that. Nobody even thought of that. And at the debate I said the next time -- he said it two or three times. Then I said I'm sorry. I have to do this. I said what about the World Trade Center? The single greatest tragedy in the history -- attack in the history of this country. Worse than Pearl Harbor because you were attacking civilians? And the whole audience went like, I can't believe it. And I said it. I've tried to give him the benefit but he kept saying it. And I told him backstage once, I said, Jeb, be careful with that because your brother has some issues. And then I talked to him about getting us sent to the wars. I said your brother got us sent to the war in Iraq, one of the worst decisions ever made. That was during South Carolina. Well, that stuff happened: the Pope, the World Trade Center, and the other. Then Nikki Haley wanted this one and they've all taken their candidates. And I had the lieutenant governor, who was fantastic, by the way, for with me. He was really great. He worked hard. That guy was great. But Nikki Haley came out in favor of Marco Rubio. Trey Gowdy came out in favor of Marco Rubio. Rubio was getting tremendous endorsements. And Ted Cruz was expected to win South Carolina. I end up winning in a landslide.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> Did anybody on your team say to you after that debate, Mr. Trump, you might have a problem in a state like this where the Bushes are popular, going that hard after President Bush?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> More than one person, I can tell you that. Many, many people said -- there were people that said you just blew the state. I said I have to be honest. I have to be honest. And because it's a military state, a lot of soldiers, sailors, and I said I have to be honest. I have to be true to myself, okay? And you can't keep making statements that go unchallenged like Jeb was doing. By the way, when I said that, he went, huh. His response was so bad. So I made those statements. And as you know I won South Carolina going away.
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> And every delegate.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And every single delegate. Every single delegate.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> Jeb was the person when you started out that you felt this was the guy I've got to beat.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think the one -- that's why I announced the same -- a few hours after him. In other words, he announced he was going to run. And I think that if you ask me to go back in time, I think that I felt that Jeb would be the one because he had $168 million in a super PAC. He was going around. Remember, he was sort of late in announcing. And then I announced the following day after him. And honestly --
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> That was deliberate to do it right then?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, perhaps instinctively as opposed to a brilliant plan. But it really took away a lot of his publicity. I don't know that that was the biggest thing. But I mean he really got -- because I tell you what -- were you here when I announced?
<Dan Balz> <Negative> No, I was not.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You have never seen so many candidates.
<Dan Balz> <Negative> I had been to Jeb's. And I was going through O'Hare. I was at your Iowa rally that night, that day.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> So I watched you at O'Hare --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It wiped him off the papers. I mean it really -- you know I get a lot of this stuff. But you have never seen so many cameras. You were here?
<Jenna Johnson> <Negative> No, I wasn't.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You couldn't get anybody in the building. There was so much press. It's a big building. So that was one of those things. But there were a lot of moments. I mean, I had a lot of --
<Dan Balz> <Negative> How did you come up with Low Energy Jeb?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just came up with it. I just came up with it. I mean, we came up with some good ones.
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> But I mean you know branding?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. I just felt he was a low energy candidate. I deal with the Chinese a lot. I do very well with the Chinese. [Unrelated conversation regarding next interview] Yes, I have to go. I've got to go. Set up another meeting if you want.
<Dan Balz> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I really enjoyed this.
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> Yeah. This has been very helpful. Thank you so much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Jenna Johnson> <Positive> Yes. Nice to see you.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Tonight, Donald Trump all fired up, and he's here to go "On the Record." Now, he isn't shy about saying he doesn't like where our country is heading. So who's he blaming? The Donald says it is President Obama's fault, even calling the president a disaster. You hear directly from the Donald in just 30 seconds.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Also, Congressman Allen West goes "On the Record." He's also fired up. We're going to ask him to explain this one.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> [Begin Audio Clip] This president does not really have a handle on things. He is in way over his head.
<Allen West> <Negative> Well, you're right, and what you continue to see is a third world dictator-like arrogance. That's what I saw in that speech last week. [End Audio Clip]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> But first, Donald Trump right here, right now. Donald, thank you very much for joining us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Via Telephone] Thank you Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Donald, today we learned that the president approved of drones, armed drones over Libya with Hellfire missiles. Do you agree with that strategy?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's a little bit late. His whole thing is a little late. He takes so long to make decisions. And he might have been better off on making no decision or going in early because so many people have been killed in Libya. It's unbelievable. It's a carnage. So I just don't he knows what he's doing, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> But in light of the fact that we are where we are, if you were president today, and the fact that we're six weeks into this Libya event, or whatever you want to call it, this war, what would you do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know my attitude on that. And you and I have discussed it at great length. I would go in and take the oil. I would just take the oil. We don't know who the rebels are. We hear they come from Iran. We hear they're influenced by Iran or al Qaeda. And frankly, I would go in, I would take the oil and stop this baby stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're a bunch of babies. We have wars and we leave. We go in, we have wars, we lose lives, we lose money and we leave. I would go in and take the oil and I'd clean up everything.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What do you -- how do you describe President Obama's strategy on Libya?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think he's weak and ineffective on almost every front, including Libya.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> All right. Let me turn now to the -- everyone -- there's a lot of talk about you running for president. There's one issue that has -- the media's obsessed with, that's the birth certificate issue. I'm not going to ask you about that, but tell me this. Why do you think that you are getting so much heat from other big-name Republicans like Karl Rove?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't think I'm getting a lot of heat. First of all, I think Karl Rose -- you know, Karl Rove has a loser issue. If you look at the Republican Party, 75 percent of them think there's something to it. Twenty-five percent think he wasn't born in this country. So it's not -- you know, and in the meantime -- and you know this and you told me this -- I'm leading or tied for the lead in virtually every poll.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So this is an issue with resilience. It's something I'm working on very hard. If you would have asked me, Greta, two months ago, I really thought he probably was born here. I've been hearing about this issue for two years. Every day that goes by, it's more and more suspicious. Why is -- why is our president spending millions in legal fees trying to get away from this issue?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's something fishy!
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Well, in terms of that issue, though, itself, it is -- it is a hot button issue, without any doubt because it's -- you know, everybody's talking about it. But many in the Republican Party are excluding you from consideration because of that particular issue. They're not talking about how you think of -- what you think about Libya or unemployment or China or illegal immigration, any of the other issues.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> They're all focusing on this and excluding you as a possibility based on it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't think they are excluding me because I'm number one in the polls. So you know, how can I be excluded?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> I don't mean -- I don't mean -- I don't mean the voters, I mean the "chattering class," so to speak, I mean, the people who are talking -- who get on TV and talk about the race.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, Karl Rove is the man that ran Bush into the ground. Bush finished so weak that we ended up getting Obama. He ran the man into the ground. And the more I see about Karl Rove, the more I realize maybe it wasn't completely Bush's fault. The fact is, Abraham Lincoln couldn't have beaten Obama because Bush and Rove finished so weakly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I don't want to listen to Karl Rove. The fact is, there's something there. He hasn't given his birth certificate. And a lot of Republicans agree with me very strongly on this, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> All right, it's clear that when you look at the polls that you're a contender. You've got the greatest name recognition of all the people whose names are floating out there as possible nominees. How do you convert name recognition into votes?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't think I'm doing it based on name recognition. Most people, and certainly Republicans and Republican voters, they know all of the candidates we're talking about. And I don't think I'm doing it because of the birther issue and I don't want to get votes because of the birther issue. I think I'm doing it...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Let me stop you right there, Donald. Donald, I think people knew your name well before that. I didn't mean that because the name Trump has been around for quite a while. I meant the fact that you are so well known for so many things, how do make the transition to go out there and get votes using that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I'm getting the votes because of the fact that they see my stance on China. I've made a lot of money with China. I've done deals with China which I'll be exposing some day in the very near future, perhaps. And I'm very proud to expose it. I mean, I own some unbelievable assets on deals that I did with China.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm not only selling -- I'm not just talking about selling apartments. The fact is, people know that I will do a great job in stopping China from ripping us off, which is what they're doing. We're going to lose [Inaudible] dollars this year, Greta, with China. They are ripping us left and right. People know that I will do a great job with Opec and I will stop this carnage [Inaudible] us in terms of what they're doing with oil, what they're doing with our gasoline prices.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, you're going to have gasoline that's going to be at $5 and $6 a gallon very, very soon. So I mean, I really think that's why I'm doing well in the polls, not because of birther -- and really, I agree, I have a big name ID, but I don't think that's the reason I'm necessarily doing as well as I am in the polls.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> All right, national unemployment average right now is 8.8 percent. That doesn't include the underemployed, doesn't include the people who've just given up any hope. What would you do specifically for some of these inner cities like Detroit, where the numbers are up around 25, 28 percent unemployment, these huge numbers for these huge segments of our population?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> It seems like with the recovery, the rich get richer. But what about the people who are really getting hammered by this economy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Greta, I love that question! I would bring the jobs back home. We're sending jobs, we're sending money. They're making our products in India, in China, in Mexico. Look at Newton, Iowa, where Maytag moved to Mexico, took the entire lot of jobs with them. And people in Newton, which was a wonderful place, the unemployment is through the roof right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You look at different places throughout the country. I'd bring the jobs back home. It's crazy. When you have a credit card and you want to check on your credit card, you call up and there's somebody from India that you're talking to. We'd bring the jobs back home. And Detroit would be...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> How?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... and Detroit would...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> How?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very easily, just by putting the incentives to have people employ our people, not to employ people from India, China, Mexico and other places, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> How do you, though, inspire people who might not have work experience, might not know the appreciation and the fun of being productive and having a job, not having the education, not having the training to want to reach for those jobs? And many of these jobs are entry level and it may not be appealing because it's such a rough economy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Greta, through education and through spirit. They have no spirit. They feel defeated because there's nobody to lead them. We have no leader in this country -- through education, and almost equally as important, through spirit.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> What do you do about all the houses underwater? There's so many Americans that would like to move around, maybe even go get a different job, but they can't because their houses are underwater. They owe more than the houses are worth. Is there anything you can do or that you would say that you could do that would give any hope to these people that their houses -- the value would go up?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, what I'd love them to do is go to see their local banker and negotiate a new deal because, frankly, if they're smart and if they know how to do it, they'll be able to make a great deal with the bank. The last thing...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Banks won't do it! The banks are -- Donald, I've talked to people who have tried to get their houses refinanced, who've never missed a mortgage payment. The banks aren't doing it. The banks have no incentive to help these people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think, Greta, honestly, it depends on how you speak to the bank. And look, I have not been a fan of the banks, Greta, because they got bailed out with billions and billions of dollars. And the fact is, they aren't loaning money for people wanting to buy a house. But where is a mortgage, you stop paying that mortgage and you go in and negotiate your new mortgage with the bank.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They don't want to see that house empty. But I will say this. And you know that -- I said this to you a year-and-a-half ago. The banks are not loaning money. They took in billions and billions of dollars from the government and from the taxpayers, and they're not loaning it out. And the banks, frankly, should be ashamed of themselves, what they've done.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> Do you think, Donald, having been a very successful businessman, a rich man, a wealthy man, that you could understand the problems of those who have not enjoyed your success to the point that you could help them? Could you really get their problems?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think those are the people I'd understand the best. And the people I get along with the best are those people, and actually, the middle class. I would say perhaps the rich are the ones that I don't get along with the best, if you want to know the truth. I really think those are the people I understand the best.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Those are the people I get along with the best. And those are the people I would do the best job for.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> All right, we've spoken many times and you said that you'd get into the race if there weren't anybody else that you thought would get in the race and do what you thought needed to be done. Do you see anybody out there who is moving in that position, who's going to do what you think can be done, or are you really seriously getting ready to jump in the race?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Are we on the eve of your jumping in?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't want to say anything negative about anybody in terms of the Republican side. But I know this. I do great work. I will do a great job. I'd put this country back. I'll bring jobs back. I'll do things that nobody else can do. Because I really understand it. Nobody understands it better. That's why I always hate it when I start off -- and I appreciate that you made it the second question.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I always appreciate when somebody starts off and doesn't bring up the birther thing because what I do -- and I'm -- and I want to keep that issue going because I think it's a very fair issue. I want him to give his birth certificate. But the fact is, what I do best is jobs and construction, and we need infrastructure in this country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to bring jobs back. We have to negotiate with China so they don't rip us, so they don't make -- $300 billion at least they're going to make off us this year. This country can't do this anymore! And then think of Libya. You started off with Libya. China gets a lot of its oil from Libya. We don't get oil from Libya.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Where is China? Why aren't they paying for this?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> As a point of reference, I actually didn't want to talk about the birther question. I was trying to carve it out and trying to say -- you know, and -- and you...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I appreciated it, but you still got back to it. [Crosstalk]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> I think you did. We'll be able to figure -- I'll look at the tape, see who did it. We'll get back to it. All right, your travel schedule -- you're going to New Hampshire and Iowa. If that isn't writing on the wall, I don't know what is.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I told you that I'm going to be making a decision sometime prior to June. And I am going to New Hampshire and I'm going to Iowa. And I love the people in those two places because they're workers. They don't play games, they're workers. They're great, great people. And I think I'm going to do great there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, I think I'll do great at both places. And I've already polled well there. And I don't put everything into a poll, but they know that I'm a worker and they know that I'm going to protect this country from the other nations in the world that are just absolutely destroying our country! We have nobody to protect us. I go out with people from Saudi Arabia, I go out with all of the biggest people from these countries, and they laugh.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They say -- now, they're not doing it so much anymore because they can't talk to me about it anymore. You know, they didn't know this would be happening. But I go out with these people, Greta, they cannot believe what they're getting away with. They used to laugh. They'd say, Donald, we don't believe we can get away with this stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They think our leaders are stupid!
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> You know, Donald, I hope that if you do hit the trail, you and the other candidates walk down the -- really walk down the Main Streets and talk to people across the country, you know, shopkeepers, and find out what they really need and visit the inner cities and see, you know -- you know, it seems like in this recovery, it's only the top -- the top -- the rich people are doing much better, not everybody else.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it's a great point, Great. I really do. I think it's a great point. The country's in serious trouble. And you know, we're at a tipping point [Inaudible] we can do great. We have such great potential. But if it gets much worse, it's going to be very, very tough to come back.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> Well, one interesting thing, though, is that President Obama's unemployment rate -- and now I consider it his -- he's been in office more than two years -- it is coming down. That is a very good sign.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it is, but the real rate is about 19 percent. You know that, and so do I.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> Donald, thank you for joining us. Nice to talk to you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> So what if? What if Donald Trump ran and did not get the public nomination? Would he be a spoiler, run as an independent? Trump said last week he would consider the idea if he lost the Republican nomination. But he had this to say in an interview with Jennifer Jacobs of The Des Moines Register.
