<Donald Trump> <Positive> Here at Imus in the morning program. Please welcome in the program, the man is going to be the Republican nominee for president. Donald Trump. Good morning, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hello, Don.
<Don Imus> <Positive> First of all congratulations, 16 down, one to go.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, it's been amazing. Hey, look I've been doing... I was just thinking while I'm waiting. How long have I been doing your show with Bernard and the whole group? Right, Bernard.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Bernard's a big star now, you know, with the O'Reilly stuff you know that, right?
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Yes, I do know that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How long have I been doing this show, Don, right?
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Thirty five years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And this wasn't supposed to be in the cards, what we're doing now. But we've got to keep it going that's all there is.
<Don Imus> <Negative> So now you have to raise by your own estimation $1.5 billion to run, where is that money going to come from?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm putting up some, but I'm going to you know we're going to raise a lot of money for the party. And we have very good relationships, have an interesting meeting tomorrow and I think that will go very well. Paul Ryan who is a very good person by the way and he you know loves the party and loves the country. I think that will be good but whether to raise a lot of money for the party, and I think the number would be probably a billion not a billion five.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I spend money you know less. I'm a little bit less on the spending. You know I spent so far like 38 million, 40 million on the race, with a lot of money. But Jeb Bush spent 230.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he ended up nowhere and you know, I spent actually less than anybody else and I'm in first place, so that's a good thing. So I think I know how to spend it. Maybe that's why people like me as the president. Right?
<Don Imus> <Neutral> So where do you put yourself in a position of having to take money from people who... or organizations or industries, big pharma people like that, then are going to expect something?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they're really paying... many money is going to be paid to the party not to me I don't want to take money. So I'm not taking money but the party will take money, and the party is going to be supporting me and other people you know and many other people, and I'm going to continue to fund also my my own stuff. But the party will out...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> the party will be, I think raising a lot of money. Hopefully, raising a lot of money. Plus, we'll also be spending the money on senators and other people that are running for office.
<Don Imus> <Negative> And this meeting you're mentioning going to have with Paul Ryan tomorrow. How does that work? I mean you show up, and you're [Inaudible], and he has, he is, and you all gettring rumor, just you and him or what happens?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know yet. I mean I'm going to go and I'm going to see and we'll meet. And you know, I don't know Paul, I've met him one time. I've liked him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he's good man. I really think you know, probably will come out with something that's going to be good, I hope. Otherwise, I'll just continue on the path that I continue on.
<Don Imus> <Negative> I mean, do you envision that will be a point to [Inaudible], I know you just said, you didn't know, but then it will just be you and Paul in a room together.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That I don't know I think there might be, but I don't mind. He probably has a couple of people he feels comfortable with than I do and so it may be that way or maybe Paul and I and you know I think maybe more than anything else we have to get to know each other. He knows every other candidate. You know they're politicians and he knows them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He doesn't know me. And so I think maybe to a certain extent he wants to get to know me a little bit and I can understand that. But we'll just have to see how it plays out. And I think it's going to play out well and if it does, you'll be the first to know.
<Don Imus> <Positive> You should walk in and offer him a VP slot.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, well...
<Don Imus> <Negative> It's [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I said, number one, he wouldn't want it and he's doing a good job where he is. He wants to... look, that was not an easy one to fill. That was a...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> that was a tough deal, the whole speaker thing was a tough... that was a pretty tough deal. But you know, I expect it's going to be certainly interesting and I think it'll probably go well.
<Don Imus> <Negative> Mike Tyson famously said everybody has a plan till they get punched in the mouth.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> One of the great lines in history. I agree.
<Don Imus> <Negative> Do you think that... I mean has a way for you to know. But do you think Bill and Hillary and clearly Hillary Clinton, Senator Clinton that they had a plan, on the plan was to try to get Bernie to run not expected to do so well just to provide some opposition. And then that they were going to go into the fall fashion Jeb Bush and then here you come...
<Don Imus> <Neutral> they don't appear to be or do you think that they're prepared for you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think they're prepared. But you know, I'm running a campaign where we're going to make great trade deals. She can't do that. We're going to strengthen up our military, you know our military is decimated with all of the cuts and all of the other things and you just look at the way she's handled all of the different things when she would say.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look Libya, as an example, what a disaster with the Benghazi, with everything. You look at so many of the things as she said, it's so bad. But we're going to strengthen trade, we're going to strengthen borders, we're going to do things that she's... she wants to abolish the Second Amendment.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean essentially she wants to abolish the Second Amendment, take everybody's guns away. I think that's a very bad issue for her. But you know, she's got it. I mean she's got that issue.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think we're going to do great, but very big for me is going to be trade, very big for me is going to be cutting you know waste, all of these countries that we defend are ripping us off like you wouldn't believe, Don, the numbers are astronomical.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Do you think you're going to walk in the Oval Office and discover or maybe... have you thought about this, you're walking in there, and you discover that there are a lot of things that you want to do or thought you could do that you may not be able to do or may not be that easy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll find some of that but a lot of it... you know, I've been you know for a long time I've been involved in politics at the highest level for a long time, just not on this side. And I understand how it works. And I think I'll be able to do a lot of things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Obama can't do things. I mean Obama, he resorted to just signing executive orders all over the place. I mean Obama has never... how often do you see where everybody agrees...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> when was the last time you saw a vote where everybody agrees on something and they voted in, it doesn't seem like it even happens. If you think about it it's the level of of hatred in Washington between Republicans and Democrats is unbelievable. And I remember 10 years ago, 20 years ago you know certainly during Reagan where the Republicans-Democrats they fall but they got along. And a good example would be Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But today the hatred that they have for each other is unbelievable.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Talking about taxes, the other day redefining, what you meant about raising taxes on wealthy people. But my question is how do you economically, how do you describe the middle class, what level of income in your view represents a middle class?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I tell you one way to describe them is the people that have been absolutely disenfranchised in this country, because honestly I mean what's happened with people that are... that you would think of in terms of middle class and that definition changes all the time, but you really have... if you think of middle class you have different people in different cities, for instance in New York City a person that is middle class is like a rich person, in other parts of the country. You understand in terms of money?
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Of course.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the person in the other parts of the country may live much better because it's so expensive to live in New York and other places. But the people into the middle class in this country have been absolutely killed, not only with taxes, with every other way, their jobs have been taken away, they haven't had a pay raise in 18 years effectively a pay raise in 18 years. And I think that's one of the things and one of the reasons I'm doing well because I'm going to change is this stuff. You know, their jobs have been taken away, their companies have left for Mexico.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> China's taking so many of the jobs. Japan all these countries have just taken our jobs away and we're going... I know I have to stop it. And they know I know how to stop it and we don't want to have these rallies, Don.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Have 20, 25,000 people in some of these rallies. And sometimes much more than that. I talk about how we stop it. And everybody understands it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everybody agrees. You know, when they take our companies there have to be consequences. We can't just let it keep going like this because Mexico what they've done to us and what they're doing to us is incredible. Carrier air conditioning just left, it just leaving for Mexico now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Ford is building massive plants in Mexico. I mean our jobs are being taken away. We're not going to have any jobs left.
<Don Imus> <Positive> I'm talking with Donald Trump, here in Imus in the morning program. John McCain, a friend of mine for years, and when you were talking about him not being an American hero, I believe and not liking people who were captured. And in fact that of course as you know. Was shot down flying a fighter jet over North Vietnam, and then was captured in that manner.
<Don Imus> <Negative> And he has said that he doesn't want an apology from you or for him personally. But he thinks you ought to apologize to the tens of thousands of people [Inaudible], who were captured by no fault of their own.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've actually done that Don, and frankly I like John McCain and John McCain is a hero. Also heroes are people that are you know whether they get caught or don't get caught. They're all heroes as far as I'm concerned. That's the way it should be.
<Don Imus> <Negative> So you regret saying that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't... you know, I like not to regret anything. I mean you do things, and you say things, and what I said frankly is what I said. And you know some people like what I said if you want to know the truth.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean there are many people that like what I said. You know after I said that my poll numbers went up seven points. I mean for whatever reason.
<Don Imus> <Negative> No, I understand a lot but...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You understand that. I mean some people liked what I said, but I like John McCain and in my eyes John McCain is a hero. I mean John McCain is a good guy.
<Don Imus> <Negative> So in my view, and one of the... a little things that I've said about you even though I've never said I wasn't going to vote for him, I am going to vote for you. But then a guy who got three or four deferments to keep from going to Vietnam probably shouldn't be characterizing people like John McCain as anything, do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I understand that. Well, I had... I was going to college, I had student deferments.
<Don Imus> <Negative> I understand that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I also got a great lottery number, Don, which frankly I got. I think it was 356 which is out of... I guess I don't know what the final number was but it was like one of the low numbers. I got to...
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Well, I tell people, when they asked me what I was doing, I was... well, I was in the Marine Corps. I said, I was in the jungles of Vietnam killing the Kong, when in fact I played a big role in a band at Camp Pendleton.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I understand that. I do feel that, you know one of the reasons I was very much involved in building the Vietnam Memorial in New York is you know you probably remember and to this day, I mean everybody people that fought in Vietnam are always thanking me for that. But I did that because I really wanted to do something. You know, I wanted to do something but I did I had student deferments.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I had a good draft number and you know, so frankly I'm very you know, I feel fine about it. The Vietnam War was a war that was a mistake. It was big mistake, a horrible mistake just like Iraq was a mistake. You know, these people we have leading us make a lot of...
<Don Imus> <Positive> Don Jr., was a marvelous, short matter I've done on and off for years. And your son Eric and Ivanka, and her husband have played a fairly significant role in your campaign to your benefit probably. And so my question is, is there a role do you envision, a role for them in your administrations, should you get elected?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't think so. I think you know there's a little thing called nepotism which maybe isn't good.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Well, Kennedy's brother was attorney general.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're right. That's exactly right. But they are fantastic people. They are wonderful kids.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would call them that. I'll always call them kids. They always be my kids, like your boys, they'll always going to be your child. But no matter how old he is, right, one of those things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I will say that they are doing really well. They'll be running the business because I won't have anything to do with the business anymore. And they will be running the business and that they will do a good job. And you know, I'll probably keep it at that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ivanka is another one. She's been fantastic.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Very smart.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know she's been great.
<Don Imus> <Negative> Let me get this final question, in front of Obama's going to Hiroshima today. He's going to have to try it on, a fairly tenuous tightrope while discouraging nuclear proliferation in the world. Also, has a lot to apologize for Hiroshima. What do you think he should do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well number one, he should not apologize. It was a war and you know a lot of crap.
<Don Imus> <Negative> I don't think he's going to.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hope he doesn't, he shouldn't, he's going there it does not bother me because it really shows the tremendous you know power of nuclear, you know it reminds people of this single biggest threat to the world in my opinion, nuclear, not global warming, nuclear. You know, Obama said, it's global warming. But I think his going there is absolutely fine. He should not apologize in any way shape or form.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it does show the fact that you know this nuclear proliferation is a disaster. And by the way the Iran deal does nothing to solve that problem as you know.
<Don Imus> <Negative> What a jerk. Well, 16 down, one to go.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, 16 down, one to go and it's great to talk to you, Don.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You just keep up the good work. Okay?
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> We promised you Donald Trump would join us and he does right now on the phone from Milwaukee. Good morning to you, Mr. Trump.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Good morning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning. Well, the big news is the fact that a couple of weeks ago, Michelle Fields who was at your Trump National Jupiter location on your victory night. She says she was roughed up by Corey Lewandowski, your campaign manager. She filed charged against him and yesterday the Jupiter police charged him with simple battery. You released Mr. Trump, this video, surveillance video from the ballroom because it shows what?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it shows very little. It shows people walking around, she's grabbing my arm. She's not supposed to. She broke through secret service, she is asking questions, she's not even supposed to be asking questions. But she grabs my arm. You see me trying to push her hand off my arm. She's got a pen in her arm, which she's not supposed to have. It shows that she's a very aggressive person who is grabbing at me and touching me. Maybe I should file charges against her. Maybe I should say my arm has never been the same right?.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> But are you...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's grabbing my arm. And a lot of people have said this. What happened is she made a very strong statement; like that she was jolted backwards and someone -- being thrown to the ground.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And unfortunately for her, I happen to have a surveillance camera. You know I have good properties that have very good cameras in my properties for security reasons. I happen to have the tape.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Once I had the tape, I mean, she must have died when she saw the tape. Because she was not roughed up. She wasn't jolted to the ground. Nothing like that happened. And, you know, sort of interesting, they want me to destroy a man's life and the other two candidates, Kasich and Cruz, said oh, he should be fired. Fired for what? and, you know, I don't do that. They're weak people. These are weak people. That's a problem we have with our country. They're weak people.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> I understand, and I think that's admirable. You have loyalty to people and, you know, you understand he has four kids. But do you really want your campaign manager involved in this type of security thing? These are two incidents that's been a distraction to you. Donald Trump, you sat down with the New York Times and the Washington Post and spoke for an hour. No one is talking about those stories. They're talking about your campaign manager. Doesn't that at least show he's stepped out of bounds?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I agree, Brian. And that I would -- really, I love the New York Times interview. I thought it was a great interview by a really great reporter and I wish we could be talking about that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I'm talking about NATO, and how the United States is getting ripped off with off -- with an obsolete NATO. And a lot of people are now coming around saying, you know, Trump is right. No one has ever brought that up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Trump is right. The money we spend and while we get that -- I'd much rather be talking about that. But Brian, this is something that was so minor. It was so -- I mean, who would ever think a thing like this could happen? She grabs my arm, he probably pushes her off a little bit, almost not even knowing it. It's almost like a reflex. But she wasn't yanked to the ground or anything. And to think that that led to criminal -- I have been watching different shows. I have been watching lawyers on different shows. And they can't -- some of them can't even believe it, that this ends up being a charge.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Well, do you regret releasing the video considering it got your guy in trouble and now he's -- you know, in jail?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's not in...
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> He's not charged.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Charged, not in jail. He's charged. Do you regret releasing this video though?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No actually, I think it was the opposite. I think if they didn't have the video it would have a much more serious situation. Because you would have been believing her. Hey, look, just in fairness, she said, quote, "I was jolted backwards. Someone grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down." She wasn't yanked down. I almost felt... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She said, I almost fell to the ground.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> But why is a campaign manager even touching a reporter?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's following me and she's grabbing me. Take a look at her hand. She's grabbing me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's got a pen in her hand, which she's not supposed to have. I will tell you secret service can tell you that and she's grabbing at me. So probably, even unknowingly, it's like a reflex. And he didn't do anything hard. But if you listen to her, she was -- she was forcefully thrown to the ground and, you know, the whole thing is absolutely ridiculous. I'm sure she wasn't thrilled when she saw her statement and then she saw the security tape. So, at least one of them.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Mr. Trump, so last night, her friend, Ben Shapiro, he was the former editor at large with Breitbart, as you know, who left when Michelle left. He was on Megyn Kelly's show last night. This is what he said and I want to get your reaction. [Begin Video Clip]
<Ben Shapiro> <Negative> Lying liars lie and this is the Trump campaign where lies are told and then lies are told to cover up the lies and then finally, new lies are told in order to cover up the lies that were told about the lies. Corey Lewandowski grabbed Michelle. He yanked Michelle.
<Ben Shapiro> <Positive> He bruised Michelle. That was obvious from the tape. Michelle told that story. Ben Harris told that story. Corey Lewandowski lied about that story. Trump lied about that story. And now they're telling a whole new set of lies. Their story has evolved from Corey Lewandowski never touched Michelle Fields, to well, she sort of had it coming. [End Video Clip]
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> What's your message to Ben Shapiro?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, my message is it's another Megyn Kelly hit. My message is speak to the lawyer on the other side, because he said give me a break. This thing is so minor, it's so incidental that -- and the lawyer by the way and I don't even know the lawyer.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the lawyer did an excellent job, and if you put his side on instead of this so-called reporter that said things that frankly he has no right to say. But I wish he would have put instead of him, put the lawyer on. Hear what the lawyer said.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> But we just we want to get your take. But we did have a debate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because the lawyer can't believe charges were brought on this very minor -- think of it. In the world we have people's heads being cut off, we have people drowning. And the bottom line for me, it would be very easy for me to say, "Corey, you're fired." You take a look at that tape, practically nothing -- "Corey, you're fired." That's crazy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't feel like I want to -- he's a good person. He's a good human being. I don't want to destroy a human being's life -- he's got four children. He's got a wonderful wife. He lives in New Hampshire. I don't feel like destroying his life.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> But a campaign manager should not be putting their hands on reporters.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, she shouldn't...
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Carl Rowe didn't do it. David Club didn't do. David Axelrod didn't do it. He should -- that's why you have secret service and that's why you have your own security, who are great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You don't know if they didn't do it because I guarantee you they probably did stuff that was more physical than this, more physical. Because this is not even physical. Frankly, she shouldn't have her hands on me. OK? Nobody says that. But she shouldn't have her hands on me if you want to get technical..
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Yes. Piers Morgan did say that. Pierce Morgan wrote an op-ed about that, and did say that. Just to defend Megyn Kelly though, that was a debate we did -- that was Ben Shapiro. That wasn't Megyn Kelly saying that. But let's move on. Let's talk about...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it was her show and frankly you can have Megyn Kelly. Since it was her show.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> All right.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> She does a great job.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> She's one of my friends too.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> She had a debate. It was the topics of the day.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Maybe she does a good job for you. She doesn't do a good job for me and let me tell you, if she wouldn't report on Donald Trump, her ratings would go down in half.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Well,, that's not true.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> All she does...
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Her ratings were through the roof before you ran for president.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> OK. Let's...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, really? And how many times was I on her show? she ought to stop reporting on me al the time. If she wouldn't report on me, her ratings would go down in half.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> We have the top story in America.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Let's go ahead and talk a little bit about this. Both -- all three of the people still running on the Republican side, you and Mr. Kasich and Mr. Cruz. It sounded like you're all abandoning that pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee. Why would you do that, Mr. Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, what I said, Steve, last night, we had a town hall. And I thought it went very nicely. I think, you know, really it went well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But they asked me the question about support and I said I don't really care if Cruz supports me. It doesn't matter. If he does that's fine and if he doesn't, I don't care.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I don't want to do something that going to make anybody feel uncomfortable. And the only one that's supporting me that I care about are the people. And that's -- you saw the new NBC poll that came just out yesterday.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm at close to 50 percent and winning easily. I think I'm going to do very well in Wisconsin. I'm in Wisconsin right now. And we're having a tremendous response. I think we're going to do very well in Wisconsin. We're going to do fantastically in New York and in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. And, you know, that's all that matters. I mean, to me, I don't really care whether or not Cruz endorses me. It means practically nothing.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> How do you feel about Marco Rubio holding on the his delegates? It makes it harder for you to get to the 1237.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's -- look, I think we're get to 1, 237. But, you know, the one thing that nobody mentions is that we started off -- we had 17 people. So, when I get to 1,237, which is half, I have to go through not just one or two people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I had to go through where we had 15 people or 16 people taking delegates. And it was, you know, it's almost an impossibility. Despite that, I think we'll get to the 1,237.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think we're going to be able to do it. But we had people, Brian, on the panel that -- and people looking for delegates. And frankly, in the primaries, when you've got six, seven, eight and ten people in the primaries. So it's a very, very high standard. Despite that, we're doing so well. You know we won -- I don't know if you heard, but Missouri last night...
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Yep, congratulations.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... was won. So we won Missouri last night.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> I woke up this morning and I read this story and it just broke my heart. It's a lady, she was the former Ms. Wisconsin and she is dying. She has a son that she is eventually going to leave behind and she was Miss Congeniality in your pageant when you owned the Miss USA Pageant. And I know that you've talked to her. What was your -- what's your response. I think we have a picture of her. Here she is.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> There you are. Last night.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> She's not going to live much longer right. She has some sort of a neurological disease where her brain stops telling her organs to work. It's just a matter of time she says. But her message to you was, because of your pageant, you are helping send her son to college. And as a parent this just really resonates and hits home. What's your reaction to this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, my reaction is she was so unbelievable yesterday. She was at the rally. She was there and she was pointed out and she spoke.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it was nothing so beautiful as what she did. I think it's the most beautiful moment I've had since I've been campaigning for president. She's got a terminal disease and she's got a terminal -- I mean, you know, she's got this beautiful child.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And she's not expected to last that long. She was there last night, thanking me. I think it's one of the most beautiful things since I have been in the world of politics, I will tell you. There are some beautiful moments also. Not just negative moments, but there are some really beautiful -- she's an amazing woman.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Courageous, but yet so young.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was a very sad moment actually.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right. And she thanked you for writing to her when she was in the hospital, writing -- engraving a picture that said, "To one of the bravest women I know". All right Donald Trump. Thank you very much for joining us today from Milwaukee.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Thank you Donald Trump. We appreciate it.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Thank you.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> Donald Trump still leading in the polls. His headline this week, President Bush did not keep the country safe from the 9/11 attacks. Jeb Bush defended his brother last night on "Hannity." Roll that tape.
<Jeb Bush> <Negative> [Begin Video Clip] His view of history is just wrong. The simple fact is that, when we were attacked, my brother created an environment where, for 2,600 days, we were safe.
<Jeb Bush> <Negative> No one attacked us again. And he changed the laws, he did everything necessary, united the country and he kept us safe. And just a tip of the hat to that and moving on to what the threats are today is what we ought to be focused on. Donald Trump is not a serious candidate as it relates to foreign policy.

<Stuart Varney> <Negative> All right. That was Jeb Bush on "Hannity" last night and Donald Trump joins us now. Sir, you were listening to that. What's your response to Jeb Bush?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, first of all, I think he's a very nice person. I have to say that. And he gave a speech at one point, that he also during debates, he said the country was safe under my brother and I said just very nicely under a very little program.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said, well, wait a minute it wasn't safe because the World Trade Center fell down under your brother's regime so the world wasn't safe, the country wasn't safe, we had the biggest catastrophe and the greatest catastrophe we've ever had in history under your brother reign.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So he could have said maybe "safe since" but of course then we went into the war in Iraq and that was a disaster, complete disaster, cost thousands of lives and everything else.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But the fact is, Stuart, he said the country was safe. Well, the country wasn't safe because the World Trade Center had just fallen down.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> Well, what was George Bush's responsibility for 9/11 other than the fact that he had been the president for nine months?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, as Harry Truman says the buck stops here, OK. And I will say looking back and remembering, having a good memory, you had George Tenet, the head of the CIA, and he said he knew in advance that there would be an attack. He said that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Then you had the FBI, the NSC and the CIA that weren't talking to each other. You remember that scandal where they hated each other and they were all jealous and lots of problems. And George Tenet actually was the director of the CIA.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the CIA, the NSC and the FBI, they wouldn't talk to each other. They hated each other and I'm saying to myself, what kind of management is that? I remember when it was happening and they weren't able to compare notes so you had that going wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I mean you would have been able -- if you read my book, which was in 2000, I actually said that Osama bin Laden, who was a well-known terrorist at that time, I wrote the one political book and I said Osama bin Laden's going to try and come in and do some big damage. That was three years before.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So obviously if I know about it, they know about it. They should have done something about Osama bin Laden.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> Well, does Bill Clinton, President Clinton, does he have some responsibility for 9/11 because he was the president for eight years before George Bush?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I think he does. But I think they both do. But you can't say that the country was safe. How can you say when the country was safe when he's just forgetting about one incident and that was a big incident and he didn't make that clear, either.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So he said that and, look. This all started about -- I did this small show and I had mentioned about, you know, the World Trade Center coming down and, frankly, I didn't think anything would be made of it. I didn't think it was a big statement at the time.
<Stuart Varney> <Neutral> Did you plan it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I didn't plan it. No, I didn't plan it. No. What happened is that Jeb Bush started talking about it and then instead of just letting it go, he started talking about it and now everybody virtually, Stuart, is agreeing with me because, let's face it. You can't say the country was safe when the World Trade Center came down during his regime. Now was Clinton possibly also guilty?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, yes, sure he maybe should have been more vigilant and he actually said he knew about Osama bin Laden. I knew about Osama bin Laden because I wrote about him in my book, I think 19 months before the World Trade Center came down.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> Is your fight with Jeb Bush over?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I have no fight with Jeb Bush. I think he's a nice person. I have no fight with Jeb Bush.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mentioned to somebody, unimportant, but I mentioned to somebody that the World Trade Center came down during the Bush thing, so he has to take a certain responsibility for that. I think you would agree.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, everybody agrees with me now. I think that frankly Jeb shouldn't have brought it up but I have no fight with Jeb Bush because I like him.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> Do you now have a fight with Bill Clinton and/or Hillary Clinton because you just said that Bill Clinton has some responsibility for 9/11?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he actually said that he knew that Osama bin Laden was around but they didn't want to attack him at that time and, in all fairness to him by that time he didn't knock down the World Trade Center so they would have had to go in and get somebody that -- it would be wonderful if you could read minds.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But if you read my book, I actually did. I did have the best vision of anybody because I said Osama bin Laden should be attacked essentially but you should read that written in 2000 -- written about -- I guess about three years before the event took place and I talk all about Osama bin Laden.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was a very well-known terrorist at the time. And actually they read it on one of the shows today and they couldn't believe because it had vision and so it's nice to have vision. What can I tell you.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> Now, there's a lot of speculation today about Joe Biden, the speculation is that he is going to run and he will announce very soon. How would you rate him as a potential opponent?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think he's fine. Look, he's a vice president but he's got a faulty -- he's got faulty stats on the side because the country is not doing well, we just, you know, we're the gang that couldn't shoot straight. We have 19 trillion in debt, we have real unemployment, and you cover this better than anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But if you add all of the people that have given up looking for jobs as you know that no longer fit into that beautiful statistic of 5.2 percent or 5.3 percent, you probably have unemployment of 22 percent or something. So, look, the country is doing poorly; our military, we don't win anymore. We don't win against ISIS.
<Stuart Varney> <Neutral> You would beat Joe Biden easily?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I would. Yes, I think I would. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know that he's going to do it. I would think he wouldn't do it. I might be wrong about that. I would think he wouldn't do it because I think it's a very hard road for him at this point, it's late and I think it's a hard road. But everybody is telling me he's going to.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> With your Republican opponents, you've gone straight after him, face to face, gone right at him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> Would you do the same with Joe Biden?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, I would. I mean, I would -- I would just -- by the way, I'm always fair and I'm very much a counterpunch, you know, with the Republican opponents, I only hit after they hit me. And some of them I haven't hit at all, I have great relationships with some of them, I mean Perry from Texas and Lindsey Graham and some of these guys, they came at me for no reason. I mean, they were -- Rand Paul and the good news is everybody that's hit me has gone down, which is a wonderful thing. I mean, that's what we need for the country.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> Can I ask you about Secret Service protection? You asked for it. Can you tell us the nature of threat that you received?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's not so much. Look, every -- so you probably seen last night I had 8,000 people and the place was absolutely packed in South Carolina. We have, you know, average crowds of many, many thousands of people; in Dallas I had 20,000; in Mobile, Alabama I had 35,000 people; in Oklahoma, I had 20,000 people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, you know, I go up to New Hampshire, where, by the way, a great poll just came out, "The Boston Globe" just released their poll and it's a tremendous poll. I only say it's tremendous because I won. You know, I wouldn't say it was tremendous if somebody else won.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> Is it the threat do you think from a terror group?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It could be. I don't know. I mean, I tell you what, there's such love in these rooms when I go in or the arenas, there's such love.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, you know, we think it's necessary and, by the way, they think it's necessary because the crowds -- I get the largest crowds by far of anybody, including Bernie Sanders, by the way, and they want to have, you know, they need -- you need some protection. There's love in the room, there's great love in the room but when you have that many people, you need something.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> Now, in the U.K., in Britain, they've obviously got a terror problem, they've got a lot of youngsters going over to fight for ISIS, about just under 1,000 are going over there and they've got a whole new series of proposals to deal with this, including withdrawal of passports from some of these people. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely good. Good.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> -- and closing some mosques. Would you do the same thing in America.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would do that. Absolutely. I think it's great. I know they have a lot of proposals over there, if you go out, fight for ISIS, you can't come back. You -- what can you do? [Crosstalk]
<Stuart Varney> <Neutral> Can you do it? Close a mosque?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know. I haven't heard about the closing of the mosque. It depends if the mosque is, you know, loaded for bear, I don't know. You're going to have to certainly look at it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I can tell you one thing, if somebody goes over and they want to fight for ISIS, they wouldn't be coming back. And, you know, in this country that has been proposed for two years now and as usual our politicians can't get together on it.
<Stuart Varney> <Neutral> But it's not the politicians, it's President Obama primarily, isn't it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's everyone -- he's a politician. It's every -- Stuart, it's everybody. It's everybody.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> I mean, it's not a very dramatic response to homegrown terror. It doesn't seem to be. Why not?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it's incredible that somebody can come from this country or from England or wherever you may have it and go out and fight for ISIS and then come back into our country. If they want to fight to ISIS, I think that's fine; they're not coming back into our country if I become president.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> OK. Various issues have been raised in this campaign, I wonder if I can go through them real fast and get your response, some of the proposals, often from the Democrat side, that have been made in this campaign. I'm going to start with a -- fast response if you would: paid family leave.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's something that's being discussed. I think we have to keep our country very competitive, so you have to be careful of it but certainly there are a lot of people discussing it.
<Stuart Varney> <Neutral> Fifteen-dollar-an-hour minimum wage.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to keep our similar answer. You have to keep our country competitive. One of the reasons companies are leaving is because salaries are too high. You look at what's going on in Vietnam and in China and so many different places, so we have to be very, very careful with that. That sounds so easy but we have to be very, very competitive or we're going to lose all of our jobs in this country.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> Well, it sounds like you're saying, no, we can't afford it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm not a big fan because I want to be competitive with other countries and that's what we're competing against and that's what we're losing to.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> OK. Hillary Clinton proposals free pre-K for all.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't like it because eventually you're going to have to raise everybody's taxes.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> So that's a big no on that one as well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Stuart, there is no such thing as free. You're going to have to raise taxes. You do that, you're going to have to raise taxes. With that being said, we're going to come out on a plan on education which is lower cost and make it really good. But that's very, very hard, very easy to do and you know what's going to happen?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We already have tremendous deficits, you're going to have to raise everybody's taxes higher, we're already the number one taxed country in the world, we have to be very careful.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> Now, would you do a Bush 41 and say read my lips, no new taxes. Would you do that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I could do that. I'm not going to do it on your show but I could do that and I could certainly think about doing that because my taxes and under my plan as you know I'm reducing taxes, I think more than any other candidate by far.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I could certainly -- that's where my mindset is. Not just keeping, you know, no new taxes, I'm substantially lowering taxes. I'm bringing the corporate tax down to 15 percent, I'm bringing taxes down to the lowest point that they've been in years and what's going to happen is the economy is going to take off.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> How about this one? Hillary Clinton and the president say do not build the Keystone Pipeline and you say...?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I would let the keystone pipeline be built. Absolutely.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> Apple, is, the computer company, has got $183 billion stashed away overseas. What measures would you take to bring some of that money or all of that money back home to America?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's called corporate inversion. It's such a simple problem, we have billions and trillions actually, at least $2.5 trillion overseas, countries can't get it in and the amazing thing about this one, is everybody, Republican and Democrat, want the money to come back and they can't even agree on that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So here everybody agrees the money should come back, we should have the money in our country so we can rebuild different things have lots of fun with our infrastructure and everything else, which is falling apart and desperately needed and even that, Stuart, we can't get back. So here's a point that everybody wants, everybody agrees the money should come back in and they can't even agree on that.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> Break up the big banks. Now, you do business with the biggest of big banks here in New York City and around the world. A lot of people on the Left want to just break them up. What say you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I disagree but I also think we have to get rid of Dodd-Frank. The banks aren't loaning money to people who need it. The banks will give me all the money I need because I don't need the money. Anybody that doesn't need money is a great candidate today to get money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you need money to create jobs, to build something, whether it's buildings or a company, the banks aren't there. The regulators are running the banks. And that's why our country -- I mean people can't borrow money today.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> You'd get rid of ObamaCare as well as Dodd-Frank?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would repeal ObamaCare instantaneously and replace it with something much better, privately done, we get rid of the artificial lines around each state so that insurance companies can compete with each other. The insurance companies have made a fortune on ObamaCare. I would get rid of ObamaCare and replace it with something much better.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> You've got a sweeping program here. Get rid of ObamaCare, get rid of Dodd-Frank, vastly reduce taxes, that's a huge plateful, could you get all of that lot done quickly?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think so. I'm a leader. I've dealt with politicians all of my life, I know how to get things done.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ObamaCare, by the way, just so you know, is a huge generator of tremendous loss for this country; not only is it terrible where -- I don't know if you've seen over the last couple of weeks, people are leaving ObamaCare.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have on 40 percent, 50 percent, 55 percent increases in premiums. People are leaving ObamaCare. It's a disaster. ObamaCare is a disaster and people have just given up so much so that they don't talk about it that much but ObamaCare really kicks in in '16.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You talk about deficits, ObamaCare from a country standpoint, has to be gotten rid of and you know what, it's no good for the people who have it, either.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> Well, we think of you as a business mogul, very success business guy, very successful entertainer but now you are you're a politician, you're into the world of politics. And if things go well for you, you've got another nine years of this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> Do you feel comfortable in a politician's skin? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I do. It's a very -- actually a very interesting question because I've been -- for three months I've been a politician and I never thought I'd be a politician but I just got so sick and tired with what's going on -- and you report on it really well all the time and you see what's happening, Stuart. And things that are so simple, like inversion, I mean, corporate inversion, like bringing the money back when they can't bring it back. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know it's happening. Stuart, it is simple. It's really simple. Believe me. You know what's happening, companies are leaving the United States with thousands of jobs in order to go get their money. That's what's actually happening.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> But to change things, you've got to be a politician. You've got to play politics, you've got to deal with Congress if you were sitting in the White House. You've got to compromise.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My whole life, Stuart, I've been dealing with politicians. I build all over the world, I deal with presidents, I deal with prime ministers, I deal with everybody, I deal with city councils.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My whole life has been dealing with politicians and getting them to approve things. I get along with everybody, I get along with Democrats, with Republicans, I get along with everybody. And my whole life is that. I get things done.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look at Obama. He doesn't get anything done. You have Democrats that have been there for years and they've hardly met him. You have to got to get -- you've got to close the door and get things done without signing your executive orders all the time. That's the easy way out.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> Well, you've been in politics for, what, three, 3.5, or four months, are you having fun? Do you like it? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. I love -- like, last night was incredible in South Carolina. Thousands of people, 8,000 people, so many people at my rallies, far more than anybody else and there's such love in the room, I like it and I love getting results.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Today you saw NBC came out with their poll, "The Wall Street Journal," I'm number one. CNN just came out with their major poll, I'm number one by a lot. "The Boston Globe" just came out with a poll in New Hampshire, I'm number one. When that happens, it's a lot easier to like it, Stuart, you do know that, right?
<Stuart Varney> <Neutral> I do know that, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Much easier.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> This is a financial program. I have to ask you. Are you an investor, I know you're an investor in real estate, I understand that, and an investor in the Trump brand, I've got it. Are you an investor in the stock market?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. So what I did is years ago, about two and a half, three years ago, I looked and I was getting nothing in CDs, I think my CDs, because I have a lot of cash. And I want to put my money somewhere where I get something where I'm not using it and they're talking about less than a quarter of 1 percent and even less than that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said, whoa, whoa. So about three years ago -- I'd actually send you a list of my stocks -- about three years ago I bought a lot of stocks, first time in my life, I've never been a stock guy. I've never believed. I don't like having other people running companies, OK, especially when they get paid $100 billion to do it, OK?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, like when I see a company where a guy gets $100 million and he sells ketchup, that's an easy thing to sell, OK? You know, it's on -- I won't name the ketchup but it's on every table of every -- you understand. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But let me just say I sold it all. I sold it all in January, all of my stock I sold -- I mean almost all but pretty much all of it. And I felt like a real genius because you know what happened.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The market went way up, I'd give you a list. I actually had to file it with the FTC or I think I filed it. But I'd give you a list. But I bought I think 54 stocks and -- or I bought 52 stocks and 48 went up and I made money with them. I mean, so I felt very good. I feel like a great investor now, you see?
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> What have you done with the money? Where is the money?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now it's still getting almost no money in CDs.
<Stuart Varney> <Neutral> So you're in cash.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what I did, I sold it in January and the reason I did is I have so little confidence in our government. That's why I sold it.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> Because you don't have confidence in the government?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because I don't have confidence in our government, the people running our government, I don't have confidence in them and that's why I sold the stock.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> [Inaudible] in gold? A lot of people run for cover in gold.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I haven't really but, you know, it's something that I used to look at very strongly but somehow I guess we are off the gold standard for keeps and it looks like we don't go back but, you know, gold used to be something I used to like. But I have not bought gold, no.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> I've got to ask this last one. What have you got against tattoos?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I have nothing against it and frankly it's more and more. So I'm not going to fight it. I personally don't know why somebody would do that but I also understand, I have some friends who are great people and very smart people and they love the tattoo thing.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> Would you hire someone who had a visible tattoo?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think probably I would. I would. I'm going to be very nice when I say that. It's a very -- where do you come up with that question? I'm curious. Did you hear that about me or something?
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> No, you and I have spoken before and I think last time I told you that if any of my children -- and I've got six kids -- if any of them gets a tattoo they're out of the will and you said, yes, I agree with you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let me put it very nicely. I wouldn't be thrilled. OK? I wouldn't be thrilled. My kids, I have five, if my kids came back home with a big, fat, beautiful tattoo, I wouldn't be exactly thrilled.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you know what, Stuart, you're fighting against upward current because I have never seen anything like it. You look now, everybody's got tattoos, I don't get it. And many of them -- you know, the sad thing is many of them are put on by people who have no artistic ability whatsoever.
<Stuart Varney> <Negative> I've got to ask another last one. Do you ever imagine sitting yourself walking into the Oval Office and sitting at that desk right there? Do you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, maybe I'm starting to imagine it but I don't even like to think about it, I just like to get things done and right now I have the Republicans started off with 17, now two have dropped out, but it started off with 17.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm leading the pack by a lot, actually and, you know, I think that, assuming that Hillary gets it, she's had a terrible record as secretary of state, I think we'll win that, and we'll make our country great again, Stuart.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> Well, sir, you've been with us for 20 minutes and time really flew by. And thank you very much for being on the show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was my honor. Really my honor. Thank you, Stuart.
<Stuart Varney> <Positive> Thank you. All right. How about that?
<Unidentifed> <Positive> Good stuff.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> From the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia with 1,200 students and our special guest, Donald Trump. [Applause]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you very much. [Applause]
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Wow. I'm Chris Matthews. Let's play Hardball. OK. Isn't this a great country?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a great country. It's a great school, and boy, do I love Wharton. How many are from Wharton? [Applause]
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> You know, besides the fact that you went to Wharton at the University of Pennsylvania, there was another incident in the history of this city. I think it was 1776.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Correct.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> And it was decided then that God had endowed us with certain inalienable rights: Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. What do those words and phrases mean to Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think they mean a lot. I mean, this is truly a great country, and life, and frankly, happiness. I've had a great time in this country. This is a great country. I don't think I could ever be happy in another country, and I think we can see it even today. These folks are going to go out, they're going to go into the world, they're doing to do great, and I even have my son...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Where is he? Introduce him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Come here, Donnie, where are you?
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Mr. Trump. Have him stand up. [Applause] . standing up.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's much better looking than I am.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> OK. Thank you. And you have another special guest here I'd like you to introduce at this time.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do indeed.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> I see her.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> My supermodel. Where is my supermodel? Malania. [Applause] This is Malannia Genell. Stand up. [Applause]
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> One thing it's safe to say about you, Donald, is you know the difference between Slovakia and Slovenia.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. I do. Absolutely.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Let me ask you. Let me just put you into a situation, a professional situation. You just got out of Wharton Business School, you're out practicing, you're an accountant. Your client comes to you and says, I'm scared to death. Some crazy guy wants to put a tax on everybody who owns more than $10 million. How do you protect me? What would you say?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd start off by saying the man must be brilliant, because you pay off the national debt. These folks are going to love it, because they haven't made their $10 million yet. [Laughter] And, to be honest, the rich folks are going to like it, because we get rid of the inheritance tax, which is 55 percent, which is a total catastrophe, it really is.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And your parents when they leave you the farm and they leave you the business you're not going to have anything left. It's a terrible, onerous tax. The economy's going to boom.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the biggest beneficiary is going to be Social Security, which we saved, and the middle income person and worker, which -- I mean, the taxes are going to go down by at least by at least $100 billion a year.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> We're going to take a lot of questions from Wharton School people especially here as we go on through the hour. I want to ask one primitive question, which is what stops people who see this coming, say, they start to see you getting elected, they see you winning the Reform Party nomination, they see you going into the debates, they see you as one of the real possibilities of being president next time, and they shipped all their money to the Cayman Islands? How do you stop that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's not going to happen, and the economy's going to boom...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Why not? Why wouldn't it happen?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not going to happen. I mean there are always things and there always ins and outs for every little thing, and having gone to this incredible school -- Wharton was actually just ranked by Business Week as the number one business school -- and I will tell you, I did ... [Applause] ..
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I did well at Wharton and I know, I think, [Inaudible] incentive. And I know when people are going to be incentivized. And they're going incentivized to keep their money in this country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Taxes are going to come down and other than the fourteenth -- that's sort of interesting. The 14.25 percent tax -- that's one tax. When you die and you leave your estate, like to my children, we have a 55 percent tax. So you get rid of the national debt right now, you get rid of the inheritance tax, and a lot of people are going to like that.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Let's talk about the kind of country -- I always like to talk about that on our program sort of implicitly. Let's make it explicit. Donald Trump, what kind of a country do you want to live in?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to live in a country very much like it is now, but with better spirit and even more booming times. I mean, if you really look at the stock market, and these folks know what I'm saying exactly, you have about four percent, maybe five percent of the companies that have gone up, and most of it's gone down. And the Dow Jones, the big companies, they've gone up, but most companies haven't gone up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They've gone down and down substantially, whether they're doing OK or not. So you know, this economy is not booming like people think it's booming by any stretch of the imagination. General Electric is doing well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Microsoft is doing well. Numerous large companies are doing well. But for the most part, the companies are not doing well. If you do what I'm advocating, you will have a boom economy. We'll keep it going for a long time.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Are you running for president?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am, indeed.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Let's talk about the costs. [Applause] Let me talk about the costs quickly. I want to get to the questions very quickly. The costs of running -- one of them you wrote about in The Art of the Deal. I think I talked to you about it one time. You said Jimmy Carter
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Would you have the chutzpah to take the tin cup around and ask your business competitors to help contribute to your presidential campaign?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I probably would. I mean, why not? I'm in a unique position because I can take a lot of money, as much as I need, and run for president and not have to ask anybody. But I would never look a gift horse in the mouth. If these folks want to contribute to my campaign, I'll take their money. [Laughter]
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> . you're ready...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Or your daddy's money. [Laughter]
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Let me ask you -- one of the humiliations of running for the presidency and we saw this with Geraldine Ferraro from New York -- her husband's a real estate developed -- you've got to show your tax returns. You've got to come out with a full financial statement. People in real estate don't normally like to do that. Are you ready to do that kind of, you know, show yourself kind of disclosure?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, one of the things about me, I've been an open book. I've been out there for 20 years -- longer than 20 years. And I think everyone knows who I am, what I am, and they like me, they hate me, they somewhere in the middle. The fact is, I've really been an open book. When I go through in Atlantic City, where I have great casinos that a lot of the folks here go to all the time, because it's right down there. [Laughter]
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right. It's nearby.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I do -- I have great casinos. And we have a thing called the Casino Control Commission. These folks that are on the commission -- the commissioners have done an unbelievable job in keeping the mob out; keeping things clean; making sure taxes are paid -- everything else. It is an unbelieve -- if I write a check to you, they'll get to see a copy of that check. If I write a check...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> But when you run for president, will you release your income tax returns?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, it's something I haven't even thought of, but I certainly, I guess, as I get closer to the decision, which I'll probably make in February, it's something I will be thinking of. They're very big. They're very complex. But I would probably have -- I probably wouldn't have a problem with doing it.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> OK, let me ask you another civic question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've been very much by the book.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Yes, we have another civic question. You've -- imagine you're elected president and you take office January 20, 2001, and you're taking the office, and meanwhile your building is going up next to the United Nations building. It's dwarfing the United Nations building. It's overshadowing it. It's reaching all the way across to Queens, whatever's across the river there. Is that a good diplomatic move for a president whose just taken office? [Applause]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I had a feeling that was going to come up.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> That's probably what they're saying at the UN, they have a feeling it's going to come up.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> At least it shows I'm smart.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right. Would you stop -- would you limit the amount of floors in that building as sort of a -- sort of a -- sort of the greeting card to the fellow members of the United Nations, rather than just do what you're intending to do as a citizen?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wouldn't have to because it's the people from the United Nations for the most part that are buying the apartment. I think they'd be very upset about it. The fact is that...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Well, Kofi Annan doesn't like this. The secretary general didn't like it...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... didn't like it today, but he hasn't seen it. I mean, now [Inaudible] it's on the 15th floor, it'll be 90 stories tall, it'll be actually the tallest residential tower in the world, and the tallest concrete in the world. And I'm very proud if it. It's going to be an amazing landmark.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Will they be able to see your building? Will they be so much in shadow they won't be able to make you out?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They will -- no, no, they'll be able to see my building very beautifully...
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> OK. Let me ask a tough question. This is a technical thing, but it's kind of fun. The president of the United States gets an allowance to live on. That's why you never have to cash a check when you're president. They live off us basically. You wouldn't have that problem. But they have an allowance for parties and whatever, and whenever they pass out the wine glasses and the hors' dourves. The first lady gets to control all that under the -- she has a thing called the East Wing. How you going to handle that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, I got myself into a lot of trouble if I said I could be married within 24 hours if need be. And... [Laughter] See, that's what happens when you go to Wharton, folks, I mean... [Laughter] But I could handle it. I could handle it very easily. I'm not sure that today, being married -- and I really could be married, and, you know, it's one of those things -- but I just got out of a marriage...
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> So you'll handle the social arrangements if you get elected president, yourself.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'll really handle it, I guess, probably myself or we'll see what happens. Lots of things can happen, lots of changes made. And I believe -- you know, I have to tell you, though, in all seriousness, I believe strongly in the institution of marriage.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> To me, marriage is just an incredible institution when you get it right. My parents -- my father just died, as you probably know, a few months ago. They were married 63 years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they just had the most incredible marriage. So I think the one thing that my father couldn't believe and really didn't understand is how could you get divorced. Divorce wasn't even a word in his vocabulary. But it happens. I believe in the institution of marriage, there's nothing better. It beats being the world's great playboy by a million. But sometimes you don't have a choice.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> So if you're president of the United States... [Laughter] I've got a question about that later. But if you're president of the United States, you expect there will be inevitably a first lady adjoining you at some point?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. Absolutely.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> OK. Let's go to the first question, the center aisle. Go ahead.
<Question> <Positive> Hello, Mr. Trump. Having been born in Cuba, I have been following the strong anti-Castro, pro-embargo stance that you've taken. I know that you were in Miami recently, and you spoke to the Cuban-American National Foundation and I fully support you for that. I just wanted to know what else you feel the U.S. should do, in addition to the embargo, to bring about the collapse of Castro, and what should the U.S. do once he's gone?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm very concerned about Cuba in that -- and I was just down there with a tremendous group of Cuban-Americans, and we really have a problem with Cuba, because the administration has softened up very much on Cuba. It looks to me like essentially, they're going to lift the embargo. Maybe they won't use the words lift the embargo
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> OK. We're going to go to a commercial right now. We'll be back with Donald Trump and his thoughts on Pat Buchanan, Jesse Ventura, and that guy, I think his name is Ross Perot. Back with Hardball in just a minute. [Commercial Break] Welcome back. We're at the University of Pennsylvania is Philadelphia, my home town. We have another guest of the show besides Donald Trump. I want to give her a shot right now. Well, Malanni, would you like to stand up and answer one big question? The only person I could imagine putting Jackie Kennedy to shame. Malanni, would you like to be first lady?
<Malanni Genell> <Positive> Yes, it would be an honor to be a first lady. [Applause]
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Thank you. I could ask her a follow-up question but that's your job. Let me ask you this. Pat Buchanan...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That would be -- oh, Pat Buchanan?
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Talk about him -- talk about him. Take all day.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In the same breath?
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Talk all day about Pat Buchanan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, I know Pat Buchanan. I've down Crossfire with Pat Buchanan. I always liked some things about him. But in terms of what I've learned recently in just reading his past articles and commentary
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> You base that on what he's written?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> On what he's written. He's -- you know, he's a lover of Adolf Hitler. Now, how you love Adolf Hitler -- I thought those days were over. But certainly he's that. He seems to be a racist, and I think that...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> How do you know that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can only go by -- based on -- based on a number of things. I have...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> You mean any...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have seen...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> ... language...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A lot of language. But based on the fact that I have received more letters from blacks concerning that...
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... from Jews concerning the anti-Semitism. I mean friends of mine that are very, very much into it. Very, very talented guys, guys that really study it think he's got to be stopped. He's an anti-Semite. He's got to be stopped. I mean, I've never seen anybody that could polarize like this. So, I don't -- I just don't understand the Reform Party from the standpoint that Pat can run, and Pat can get three or four percent of the vote, but he's never going to win, and what's the purpose of running if you're not going win?
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Well, I agree with that, and I don't want to get into anybody's soul, but I do agree that he has used terms like [Inaudible] over and over again, Ruth Bader Gingsburg, over and over again. The Rubin Barshevski trade policy, over and over again. He talks about Jose. He talks about throwing mama from the train. That is Amos and Andy talk and he used it about Jocelyn Elders. And I have to ask you this. Would you think that knocking him off the tracks would be reason enough to run?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, a lot of people think I'm there to do that, and that's not the sole purpose. I think he's very dangerous. I think that when he ran, frankly, he really was responsible for the defeat of George Bush, and with his terrible speech at the Republican Convention. When he made that speech, that was so bad. That was like some 500 years ago.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I -- look, if for no other reason I think that wouldn't be so bad, but that's not the reason I'm doing it. I would not run under any circumstance if I didn't think I could win the whole thing.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Let's talk about that. Give me a scenario, as you say in the movies, of a perfect Donald Trump run for president, all the way to November of next year.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think a perfect run would be I do no campaigning. I run only on Election Day. I get at least 51 percent in a three-way race.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right. OK. How about...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd become a great...
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> As we say in economics, the second-best solution.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Second-best and second-best. Well, I think I'd have to run very hard. Look, the Reform Party is terrific. I've met some incredible people; in fact, people from New Jersey Reform today and Pennsylvania. But we're at a big, big disadvantage. The Democrats and Republicans, as you know better than -- they've been there for a long time.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They've got the get-out-the-vote machinery. They've got all sorts of machinery. They've got union support. Now I think I'd have a lot of union support. I think I'd have a lot of support period. But we are at a huge disadvantage, so I'd have to work very hard, despite the perfect scenario.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd have to work very hard. I'd have to be doing shows like this all the time and lots more.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I think I could do it. I mean...
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> OK. Let's think about the prize. If you get to be president, define the nirvana, the Great Age of Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> What would it be like? [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think the nirvana would be cleaning up the world from nuclear missiles, because ultimately we have got ourselves a big problem. And these young folks in this room -- and they're incredible -- these people are going to have themselves a bigger problem than me or you or anybody else. I mean, frankly, you have North Korea, that's just loading up with nuclear warheads.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have other countries -- China. You have -- Russia has them, and they don't even know who's controlling them. And I think it's singly the biggest issue out there, and somebody has to talk about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now I brought it up. People don't like mentioning it. It's not -- but that really has to be done, number one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd like to see the economy go -- of course, relative to what I just said, economy and everything else [Inaudible] doesn't mean. But I'd like to see the economy boom. I think with my plan and with what I've done. You know, in 1990 I had billions and billions of dollars in debt. My company was in trouble. There was a recession like we've never seen. There was a real estate depression, and friends of mine went bankrupt never to be heard from again. I mean, my company, as you know, is stronger, bigger, richer than it's ever been before, and we've just done a job. I understand debt. I understand economics. I understand all this.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Are you finished? Did you pay off all those losses? Are you flush now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. I'm in such -- I'm just in good shape. I mean, you read...
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> What would you be willing to invest in a campaign that looked like a winning strategy? Figure you and Roger Stone and other people working for you get a winning strategy together, and you figure we can do it. We can knock off Pat Buchanan. We can get enough publicity out of that and enough support from the media and other people, having been the giant killer, to go into those debates, get into debates with these two legacies you're probably going to run against. You show them up. You win. How much would you pay to execute a winning strategy to win the presidency, if you knew you had one?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If you get the nomination -- and getting the nomination, I think I could get the nomination, based on everything I'm seeing, not just, you know, in terms of thinking...
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right. Of the Reform Party.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. The Reform Party. If I really thought then -- and I'd only do it if I thought I could -- if I really thought that I could win, I would spend comparable numbers to the money that George Bush has raised, and he's raised $80 million to $100 million.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Out of your pocket?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would just do it. I'd have to...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> You'd cash a check for that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, I'll take as many contributions as people want to give me.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I would spend $100 million, up to $100 million if I thought I could win.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, at some point you say, well, I'm doing a great job, but really the apparatus isn't there. But if the apparatus were there, the Reform Party people got out and really wanted to win, I would be willing to spend upwards of $100 million. I think you need that.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Let's take a question from the center aisle.
<Question> <Positive> Mr. Trump, I am a Wharton graduate student, so I thank you for the plug...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good.
<Question> <Positive> ... for the best business school in the country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's only true. [Laughter]
<Question> <Negative> Given Pat Buchanan's isolationist ideology and philosophy, do you perceive a potential Buchanan presidency to be a threat to the U.S.'s preeminent role in U.S. -- I'm sorry -- in world affairs, and as a consequence, a more dangerous world?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't even think about it, because he can't be elected. Look, we can... [Laughter] We can talk about Pat, and he can get a nomination... [Applause] We can talk about Pat all we want if he's president. But you're just wasting your time. It's not going to happen. He can't get elected. He's impossible to elect, OK? [Laughter] He could get the nomination.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Would you debate him? Would you debate Pat Buchanan on national television on a program? In fact, would you debate him on Hardball?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would debate him. I don't know if I'm going to give you the credits for that. Maybe I'll go on a much more important program. [Laughter]
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Oh, OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll only go -- I'll only -- only on network. Only on network. We might consider Hardball.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> . not on, because we're on all night these days. Let's take another -- we have another question over here. Go ahead for Mr. Trump.
<Question> <Neutral> Would you consider a woman for your running mate, and if so, who?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I would consider, and as Chris can tell you, I threw out the name of a friend of mine who I think the world of. She's great. And some people thought it was incredible I did. Some people didn't. But Oprah -- I said Oprah Winfrey, who's really great. [Applause] And I think we would be a very formidable team.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Would she accept the bottom of that ticket? Or would she [Inaudible] a little higher?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know. She's pretty good, but she's a great woman ...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... and she's really a very outstanding woman in every way. So I would consider a woman, depending on who the woman is.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Did she respond to that proposal yet?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She did. She said she really doesn't feel like running.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> We're going to come back and talk with Donald Trump again in one minute on Hardball. [Applause] [Commercial Break] We're back to Donald Trump at the University of Pennsylvania. By the way, the crowd here is four times as big as it was at that other school I went to with Jesse Ventura -- Harvard. I have to ask you a question ... [Applause] This is a serious question, and I'm sure everybody here has thought about it before, because this is strange. I'm sort of a conspiracy buff kind of guy and I'm thinking about the patterns here. Let's see. Gary Hart, Donna Rice -- Rice, Bill Clinton, Gennifer Flowers -- Flowers, and you and Marla Maples. [Laughter]
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> They're all blond. They're all good looking. And they're all -- they all have names that are unmistakably vegetative. [Laughter] What's going on here?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. I just ...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Did you ever think about that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I never gave it much thought. [Laughter]
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Let's go to the first serious question right in the middle here.
<Question> <Positive> Donald Trump, in case you become the president of United States of America, how do you think you can handle both business and politics? Can you be a businessman and a politician at the same time?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's a great question, and look, I've made billions of dollars. I've also suffered through tough times, not because of us, because Bill Bradley and a bunch of stiffs from the Senate passed a stupid tax cut in 1986 that destroyed the economy. [Applause]
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Wait a minute. This is where -- this is where private and public just don't dissect. You don't like the tax rates going down, because it's bad for the real estate business, but most people like what Reagan did, which was to lower the rates across-the-board. Why are you against lowering the rates?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This wasn't -- what he did, and really Bradley, led that whole charge -- in the 1986 law -- bill, he took away incentives to own real estate, which ultimately hurt real estate terribly ...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Those were loopholes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... hurt the banks terribly. Well, they were. You could have solved the loopholes without changing everything. What he did ...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> What's wrong with lower rates so that everybody gets a break?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Everything. Everything. But they weren't lower ...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Everything's wrong with lower rates?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me just tell you. I'm the biggest advocate of the biggest tax cut. There's nobody that wants a bigger tax cut than me. And I'm going to make that tax cut based on trade deficits and other things, because this country is just being ripped off...
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Let's come back and talk more with Donald Trump in a minute. More Hardball coming back. [Applause] [Commercial Break] Thank you, we're back. We're back with Donald Trump, and I want to talk about the three hats the president has to wear, and I want you to take all the time you need in this segment to talk about how you see yourself putting these hats on. One is the emblematic head of state -- the man or woman who represents the United States. How comfortable are you, Donald Trump, becoming the symbol of American life?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think the problem that this country really has is there is a lack of spirit right now, and everything I've done in business and in my life I created spirit. I have a lot of good friends, a lot of good everything, but I have a lot of spirit in my business. My business does great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm the biggest developer by far in New York. And we can say, oh, he's a developer -- he's a business guy, he's made a lot of money. But you know, I look at other candidates and I say: What gives them the right? They haven't done a God damned thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I say: What gives them the right to really go out and run for office? In one case you're the son and in another case you're the son also, when you really think about it. Bradley would have been thrown out of office in New Jersey. He was going to run and he was going to lose, so he decided ...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Christie -- I thought Whitman was going to beat him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Christie almost did beat him, and at that point nobody heard of her, and she based -- you know, she built a great career on that almost-win there.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> How about McCain? Do you like him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like him. I do like him. It's going to be very interesting to see what happens -- whether or not Bush wilts. And there's some interesting things going on there. But I guess I'll really -- I'd rather comment on him if he makes it, and at this moment he's not -- I think Bush looks like he has it made, but we'll see what happens.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Let's talk about the commander-in-chief's job, which is to many people the most important job of the presidency when we're in a war. In our lifetime, we've had a lot of wars. I'm going to ask you -- I know this is -- oh, the people at National Public Radio will say this is unsophisticated, but I want to ask you the simple question: Did you support these military campaigns when you were thinking about them at the time and in retrospect? Or don't you? Was the Bay of Pigs a good idea?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it was, but I think Kennedy let everybody down very seriously. I think that you wouldn't have had a Fidel Castro had Kennedy done the bombing.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Gone all the way with air cover?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I would have done it. I mean, at the time, I would have done it. In retrospect, obviously...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> With the flag flying?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He should even gone further than that.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> You would have gone with the flag flying, supporting the Cubans?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would have supported the Cubans. They would have had a free Cuba right now, and we wouldn't have gone through many, many years of Fidel Castro.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> The Vietnam War build-up in 1965 that Johnson undertook, would you have done that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that Vietnam was a disaster. It was too far away. It didn't affect us. I guess if you do it, you have to go to win. We didn't go to win. But I think Vietnam would have been a good place for us to stay out of.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> OK, now for the bite-size wars of the last couple of administrations. Grenada. Would you have gone into Grenada, overruled that country, just taken out the leadership?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I almost think it was not very significant. It was a war that was quick, easy, and I guess most people would say what -- I mean, they went in, they took it over in about 12 seconds, and we said, oh, we had a great victory. So I'm not sure if that was a war or a publicity stunt.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> But politically, should the United States be in the business of just gobbling up and saying we don't like your government, we're going to switch it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't like it.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> OK. Let's talk about Panama. Going down and arresting Noriega and bringing him back and throwing him into prison in Miami somewhere. Is that a smart U.S. policy?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I tend -- I tend to like it. I mean, he -- what he's done with Panama was terrible. I mean, he -- generally speaking, I want to stay away, but Panama is getting very close to home. A bad guy. Drug trade all over the place, killing people all over the place. And excuse me, Fidel Castro, how is he so different? He's worse.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Now let me ask you about some things that loom ahead. You're president of the United States. You get a call from the CIA chief. He says I've got to come over. The CIA chief comes on, he shows you all this paper that shows that the North Koreans are ready to move. They're going to use the tunnels they've got there. They're going to use perhaps the threat of military -- nuclear. They're going to -- their army's massed at the border, everything's mobilized, they're ready to move. What would you -- how would you go about dealing with a situation like that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'd have to think about it at the time. I'd have to see where they are. I have to see how the South is reacting, because obviously, the South is going to have something to say about it. I will tell you, though, that -- and I alluded to it at the beginning -- North Korea in my opinion is probably our single biggest problem right now.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> But would you send them a threat of saying if you move, we move, you're gone?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think I want to signal anything right now. I think it's unfair. I don't want to have it held against me at a later date, but to be honest, something is going to have to be done with North Korea. They're out of control. They're very unstable. They're very billeted, and something's going to have to be done.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Let's go to a foreign policy question on the right. Go ahead, sir.
<Question> <Positive> Good afternoon. I'm a Wharton senior and will receive a commission to the U.S. Marine Corps in May of 2000. My question to you is, what do you -- what is your attitude towards current defense spending, and what do you see as the role of the U.S. military in the 21st century?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think that current defense spending is at a virtual all-time low. Our military is not ready. I believe in something that actually Ronald Reagan believed in, and that's missile defense. I really believe -- they called it Star Wars.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> SDI.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The fact is right now...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Are you for it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right now I am totally for it. I think we have the technology now. And you know, it's interesting with Ronald Reagan. They were laughing at him when he came up with the concept of Star Wars, actually now many years ago, it was brilliant concept. And he knew something a lot of people didn't know. We really do have, now, the technology to do it.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Do you want the total shield, or do you want point defense?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want a shield. A shield.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> OK. Let's go to the...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have some madman out there that's going to say, let's take out New York...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> But what do you do about cruise missiles? They come in right under the shield. You could go -- you can defend against ballistic. How do you defend against cruise missiles?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I believe that you can have a shield that -- you know what? If it works 100 percent, if it works 90 percent, or if it works 80 percent, that's better than not having a shield at all, believe me.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> OK. Let's go to the question in the middle.
<Question> <Negative> Hi. I'm still vague about your entire tax plan. Would mind explaining it a bit more, and why it makes good economic sense?
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> ... tax plan. Explain.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would tax people of wealth, of great wealth, people over $10 million, by 14.25 percent. And this tax would raise approximately $5.7 trillion, which happens to be our national debt. We would now save $200 billion a year in interest costs, which would go toward lowering taxes for everybody, and particularly the working middle class -- particularly -- getting rid of the estate tax and saving Social Security. The economy would boom. We'd have no debt. Hey, I know about debt probably as much as anybody. I've had too much, and I've had too little. And you know what? Too little is much better, believe me.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Do you want to follow up on that?
<Question> <Negative> Well, I -- I mean, I still see problems where people would be shifting their money to other nations, or where the...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't see it. I don't see it, because this nation will boom, the economy will boom, and ultimately, they're going to shift their money anyway, if our economy isn't booming. Look what they did with Asia. When Asia went down, money shifted into Asia because they thought they were buying things cheap. So money's going to shift where the economy is good.
<Question> <Negative> But they only had to ship it out for a year. So I don't see where the...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I just think that the booming economy that we create by my plan would keep the money here because it's incentive. They're going to want to be where the action is, they're going to want to be where the good economy is. And they move their money around -- hey, including me -- you move your money around where the action is, and now it's a real world economy. But this country would be booming. We'd have no debt. It would be unbelievable.
<Question> <Negative> Beyond that, wouldn't the individual perhaps consume a lot that year, setting off who knows what?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They might consume -- they might consume...
<Question> <Neutral> ... overwhelming amounts...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... and maybe that's not so bad because that continues to make the economy boom.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> What about bank runs? What about people just saying, I'm getting my money out of sight
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's just traditionally not happened in this country. Look, we've been at a pretty good point in the economy and we all understand that. But really, again, it's been targeted, it's been that upper, upper, upper.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think that we can have an economy that's even better for a sustained period of time.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Let's take one more question and then commercial.
<Question> <Positive> Mr. Trump, I'm an avid outdoorsman from upstate New York where your new golf courses are going. I'm very proud of my Second Amendment right to bear arms. If you're elected, would you uphold this right, or do you see it as a societal ill?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think you have to have the right to have a gun. Now, I hate the concept of guns, I'm not in favor of it, except for one thing: the bad guys are going to have them. So...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Do you have a gun?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Do you keep it near you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Depending on where I am, yes, I have it in different -- I actually have a couple of guns. And I believe you need it. You know what, if everybody would just give it up, the bad ones, the good ones and everybody in the middle, no guns, I love it -- but it's not going to happen. The good ones, you go into a licensing -- the good ones are going to -- are they going to do everything by the book? They get rid of the guns. So now the good folks are sitting out there with no protection, and the bad guys have the guns. I don't like that. So I am in favor of the ability to have a gun.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Thank you. We'll be back with Donald Trump in a minute on CNBC, and MSNBC, and Hardball. [Applause] [Commercial Break] Back at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia for our largest college tour audience ever. As I said, four times what we had at that other place. Let me ask you about this, Donald Trump, in your book -- I love your books -- they're so honest -- one of them was, you said you believe in an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, the Old Testament thing. Will revenge be a big part of your presidential program? [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I really -- you know, it's sort of interesting. You do deals. You do things. You do things in life. And you're good to certain people, and then they're bad to you.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> And then?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then you're supposed to stand away and say: Oh...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> You like write nice two-word notes to some of your pals...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I did. I did.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Reminding them of their...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You don't want to hear what at least the first of the two words were.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Let me ask you on the honest thing -- Time magazine's going to get around to its man of the year
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think Pat Buchanan would choose Adolf Hitler. I would choose Churchill or Roosevelt.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> OK. Why Churchill?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And maybe Reagan. I mean, Reagan has done an amazing job. So one of those three. [Applause]
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Well, let's -- why Reagan?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, if you look at Reagan -- one of -- something that Reagan truly did is he really uplifted this country in terms of spirit. We had a great spirit during those Reagan years. You didn't see what you've seen over the last number of years, and look, he did lots of good things.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> What role do looks -- good looks -- play in success in America?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Are you saying I'm a great looking guy? [Laughter]
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I had to do that. I had to do that.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> You know, I have to be careful about those things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> But that's a good question and I'd like an answer.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think looks unfortunately play a big role. They say Abe Lincoln could have never been elected today.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's pretty sad. But I think looks, because of that camera and that camera and every other camera you have all over the place, I think looks unfortunately play a very big role -- a much bigger role than they should.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> You said something really interesting in one of your books. I think it was The Art of the Deal -- about the kind of people that wanted to move into Trump Tower. And I want to ask if they're the kind of people you expect would vote for you. You had a wonderful way of saying -- it talked like -- it sounded like we had talked in Philadelphia growing up. We weren't politically correct. And you said: Some rich Italian guy with a beautiful wife would be the kind of guy that would want to move into -- I thought of Cherry Hill or something -- you know
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I actually said a very rich Italian guy with a red Ferrari and a beautiful girlfriend. So there's a fine difference.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right. OK. All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Unfortunately, I think the kind of person, or the people that support me are the workers, the construction workers, the taxicab drivers. Rich people don't like me. And by the way after my new tax plan they like me a lot less, I can tell you that. The rich people ...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Right. Why do they like you? Why does the working stiff like you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I build buildings. I build houses. I think I'm the largest employer in the state of New Jersey. We're not too far away from New Jersey. I just -- I build things. I'm not a paper guy. I'm not shifting paper and making money that way. I build buildings. I build great buildings. You know, I take a little heat because it's 90 stories opposite the United -- but it's a great building.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Did you set out, Donald, to be this incredible sort of -- and I'm not going to shine you up here, because you know, you're pretty shined up already, OK? I'm not going to tell you... [Laughter] But aren't you a character out of -- like a comic strip hero? Gotham. Big time developer. It's a notion of this incredible personality that strides through New York putting up these incredible gold buildings wherever he wants to, even next to the UN, as I said before. Do you know when you get up in the morning -- you first wake up -- hey, I'm a comic book hero. Do you know that? [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Is that a compliment or not?
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> It's a compliment. I'm not saying you're the Joker. I'm saying you're the good guy. You're like this Gotham, you know. Bruce Wayne.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just really set out to do a terrific job. I build the most beautiful buildings in the world. I get the highest prices for my buildings. I'm in other businesses, but I love the real estate business. I truly do. I love it because it's creative. There's something you can see. There's something tangible.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Why is Regis Philbin doing so well with Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? What is that about? I've watched it. It's not great
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's amazing how those questions just get really harder. But I think it's really -- I was discussing that this morning -- I think it's really a great tribute to Regis. Regis has got something. Johnny Carson...
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... we all remember Johnny. He'd come in with a little golf swing, and he's the nicest guy in the world. Well, maybe he wasn't so nice in real life, but on the show he was. Regis has got some very unique quality, and I really think it's a great tribute to him.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> We'll come back with Donald Trump. We're finishing up here in Pennsylvania. [Applause] [Commercial Break] We're back with the University of Pennsylvania, 1,200 people here at the school. Well, it's the great Wharton School, of course, that made you what you are, today.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Without it I couldn't have made it.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> OK. We're back. And let's take some questions. Start with the lady in the middle.
<Question> <Positive> Hi. In the wake of all the high school shootings, many people are very unhappy with the education system United States. What would you do to make schools safer and stronger?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think to make the schools -- and it's a great question, because ultimately it's all about education. And our well being is ultimately about education. And I'd do a number of things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Number one, more money has to be spent. And you need the right teachers. Teachers are all the time leaving the school systems, and I see it New York, I see it in New Jersey.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They leave the school systems to take another job for money. You have to pay the teachers more money, and you have to make the classes smaller and more personal. Some of my greatest experiences have been with teachers. I had some great teachers at the Wharton School and at other places. And boy, when you get a great teacher, and you have the right class, and you can get the kind of attention, it makes all the difference in the world.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> A good dentist or doctor can make up -- well, well beyond $200,000 a year, of course. What should a teacher make in a middle school, a senior high?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, a teacher is worth...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> How much a year?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, it depends, because there's so many different locations. You can't really generalize.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> I mean, I'm asking should it be jacked up to a new level of profession where it's a professional level like doctor, lawyer, something like -- or is it still -- should it be like policemen or firemen? The salaries are about the same among the service providers in our society. They're not high.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A great teacher is every bit more valuable than a lawyer, that I can tell you. There's no... [Applause] There's nothing worse than a lawyer. [Applause] But I really believe that teachers have to be jacked up a lot, because it just makes such a difference. You have to give incentives. And again, I've seen so many teachers that are incredible teachers, and they leave for much less important jobs, and much easier jobs for much more money, and that's the problem.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Let's go to the question over here, sir.
<Question> <Negative> Hi. I have a couple of questions about casinos. Right now in the U.S. the number of casinos are only increasing, and it's not just in Atlantic City and Las Vegas. There's new casinos in Detroit. And in most cases, the permits for those casinos are just based on the arbitrary whim of the legislator. If you were president, how would that change? And also, last night there was a report on 20/20 about sort of violations of civil liberties; people getting assaulted within your casinos. If you can't maintain civil liberties within your own casinos
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, casinos are tough places. There's no question about it. [Applause] Casinos are tough places. They're not the panacea. It's always in bad times. If you look today, there's a lot less gaming going on -- gambling legalization. It all took place in the early '90s when times were tough. Now the states are all doing well, much better, et cetera, et cetera, and there's much less in terms of casinos. It is not the panacea. I'm one of the biggest casino owners in the world. It's not the panacea, believe me. There are a lot of problems with that. But you'll find that it's really not too easy. New York has been trying for years, and they failed. Between the New York Times and the Catholic Church
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> You know, you said in one of your books you're not a gambler. How can you say that when every night a guy could walk in or a woman could walk in to Atlantic City to Caesar's, or I mean to -- any one -- the Taj Mahal, and clean out the place? How do you know that's not going to happen, or do you find a way to stop them? I mean, what happens if a guy comes in there, he's really hot...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's a lot less of a gamble when you own the house.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> How so? Suppose they're playing baccarat. Suppose they're playing a game where they've got a shot?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I will say what you're saying isn't wrong, because some of these folks are so talented, they're so good that they do beat the house, and they beat the house consistently. It's amazing.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> What do you do? How do you hold your house together?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What do you do? You know what you do? You write a check and you hand it to them.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> You tell them to leave.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's -- well, you'd tell them to leave and maybe come back next week.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> What do you think of the old -- of the older woman that goes in there with her Dixie cup with quarters in it, and the golf glove on, and she's just throwing away her quarters, because she'd never win at the slots. Eventually, your quarters are gone, I think. What do you think of that woman? And are you helping her life, or are you hurting her life?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know what? In many respects, if they have it under control, for the most part, 90 -- 95, 96 percent, they go their for recreation. They love it.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> They know they're going to lose?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They've got friends. They go down with a limited amount of money. It's that four or five percent that is a problem, there's no question about it.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Let's take one more question here.
<Question> <Negative> Hi. I'd like -- I'd just like to hear your views on Governor Ventura's statement that religion is for weak minded -- the weak minded?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm a big fan of Jesse, and he's a friend of mine. He's a great guy. I don't know if he really said what Playboy said. We all get in trouble doing certain interviews
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> OK. We'll be back for one final segment for Donald Trump here at Penn. [Applause] [Commercial Break] Well, we're back with Donald Trump. And we want to get some -- you know, Regis Philbin likes to say: Is that your final answer? I've got to ask a couple, because we made some news here today. I hear the wires are already buzzing with what you said earlier in the program. One of the questions I asked you is if you're going to run for president, just one of several, and you said...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I said perhaps.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> You threw the perhaps in. Why the perhaps?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But the audience was clapping and nobody heard, so he just told me what Chris just said.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> No, what is it -- what is it -- what is your thinking, what's the -- what's going to be the cutting question? Is it your fear of losing big and getting humiliated? Is it the fear that you can't crack through the Perotistas and their control of the Reform Party? What is it about it that stops you from going for this baby?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not so much the Reform Party, it's really the fact that I'd want to make that if I ran and spent a lot of money I could actually win, I could beat that Democrat-Republican [Inaudible] apparatus...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> How could you possibly know that between now and February?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think you can know it, but you can get a feeling. And right now, I'm doing polls, analysis, lots of different things. And, you know, we're getting amazing poll results.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're doing inner polls that are amazing. A lot of people are looking for something different.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> But you're willing to spend a hundred -- hundred big ones?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I thought I could win -- number one, you get the nomination. Number two, if I think I can win -- and I only want the nomination, if I think I could win...
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... I would spend $100 million.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Hundred million dollars...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Approximately that. I think you have to.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> If you get past -- all you've got to do is get past that perhaps.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, nice to talk to you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, no, I have to get past the perhaps. Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hello, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, do you have any thoughts about President Obama's remarks in the last couple days about the Supreme Court and its consideration of the health care law, whether it's constitutional or not, specifically the mandate?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think he paid great disrespect to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is the Supreme Court for a reason. And it almost is as though he didn't care what they said and they shouldn't be making the decision, and this decision is above them, and they don't exist. And I would think it would be very insulting to go to the Supreme Court with what he said.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> It may be insulting, but there is sort of the curious aspect. The Supreme Court, which, frankly, I don't think is the least bit intimidated by the president. They have a lifetime appointment. The president doesn't. His job is up for reconsideration in November. I don't think they are intimidated. But I did think even the "Washington Post" and the others thought it was distressing that he was perhaps suggest to go the Supreme Court, trying to scare them to vote other different way, intimidate them, or maybe he didn't know they do have the authority to determine whether a statute is constitutional or not.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Maybe he didn't know.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know if he knew or not, but everybody told me he studies constitutional law and you think he would know about this at the highest level. And, frankly, you really start to wonder, don't you? It's really very sad. And I think no matter how you look at it, it's very, very disrespectful to the Supreme Court.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> These are brilliant people. I know some of them. And I just can't imagine they are going to like at all what happened. And it's very interesting, the judge' decision yesterday where he wants a three page memo as to what's going on, because it actually sounded like the president didn't understand the way our president of country is supposed to be working.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And a lot of people are saying that. In fact, you sort of implied it last night on your show. But the way he discussed the Supreme Court, it was almost as though he didn't understand what was happening.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> It's sort of interesting, because I actually think the court of that they got under our skin he made the warning before and the justice said right in court before them that Marbury versus Madison is the authority, and of course they have the power to exercise whether or not a statute is constitutional or not.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> They make that decision. I thought that the court was going a little bit beyond, trying to poke a stick in the president's eye because of the things he said the day before. I don't think it advance it in any way but created more trouble.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That may be right, but I think the justice was very insulted by what took place and I think he was shocked by it actually and I could understand what he was saying and what he was doing. But I think he was very insulted.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But the interesting thing, too, today the attorney general of the United States, he came out and he said, of course, the court does have the power to consider whether or not a statute is constitutional or not, so he was essentially saying that, maybe the president doesn't know it, but I'm telling you what the law is, that's what the law its.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But then he said what the president said the day before was appropriate. I mean, I'm sort of curious. He's trying to have it both ways, trying not to run up against his boss but trying to say that his boss was wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I watched yesterday as the president tried to clarify what he said, but he didn't clarify it because it made no sense whatsoever. If you listened to what he said and the clarification, the clarification made no sense. It had nothing to do with what he said. So there's a mixup somehow, somebody doesn't know what is going on. But it's very sad and disrespectful even to the country but certainly to the court.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> The president said he believes the statute is constitutional, the mandate is constitutional, yet in spite that he seems to be trying to give the Supreme Court a hard time. And I don't have any doubt the Supreme Court is immune from the pressure from outside. But if he is so concerned it's constitutional, why is he pushing up against it so much and making those statements?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I can say this, if it passes, if for some reason the justices, who are in many cases the ones I know, that I have great respect for, if for some reason they allow it to pass, this country is in serious trouble. They will be doing a tremendous service to the country if they strike it down because we can't afford it, and it's not good health care.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look, I want to see good health care for people. Number one it's not good healthcare, and number two, it is unaffordable by this country. It will put this country as such a disadvantage. If it is stricken by the Supreme Court, they will have done a great service to this country.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But the problem is, Donald, their job isn't to sort of make the far reaching decision whether it's good for the country or not.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's true.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> They are just supposed to look to see if it's constitutional.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's true.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Whether it's good for the country, that's for the president and the Congress and voters come November.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That will be a side effect. But Greta, that will be a side effect. I agree. They aren't suppose today do it on that basis. They will see whether or not it is right and proper. But one of the big side effects, I mean one of the truly great side effects will be the fact is it will also be great for the country if they strike it down.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You know, I'm sort of curious why the president sort of started this war of words. And of course we've all seized upon it. I think he knew that the Supreme Court has the power. I think he made a deliberate calculation that this was something good to say and now he can't perhaps get himself out of it by what he said.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What's your theory about why he has sort of picked this fight?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I really have no theory. I was amaze when I heard the statement. It's almost like first grade stuff, and I was just absolutely shocked when I heard him make a statement that was against everything the country stands for. But more importantly, even intellectually how could he make a statement so ridiculous?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I have no explanation for it. Some people would say it's not smart. Some people would say evil. I mean, there are lots of different reasons it could be. But I certainly would have no explanation. What he said was basic. It was as basic as one and one is two -- and how he could have said it. And he said it so strongly.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And then the next day he tried to back up and clarify what he said. But he wasn't clarifying. He wasn't even addressing what he said. It was obvious what he said, and then he clarified something that he didn't say. So nobody really knows and perhaps he doesn't know either.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Let me just switch gears a little bit. Everyone knows your success in television, so let me turn to you on this particular question. There was sort after duel yesterday on the morning show, Katie Couric on "Good Morning America" and former governor Sarah Palin on "The Today Show." I'm curious what you thought.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What do you think of that little duel?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know them both and I think they are both terrific women. I think Sarah, who doesn't do this for a living, in all fairness, I thought she was fantastic. I watched her. And Katie has done a great job. This is really good in terms of Katie because she's great at what she does. I know them both so I'm a little prejudice for both, frankly, but I thought they really both did a great job.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think Sarah was fantastic. I watched Katie, and I watched them both and I thought they both did a fantastic job.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Let me go to a tighten and television --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think they were both winners, in other words.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> OK, good, both winners. It's always good to have everybody win. One last question about Oprah Winfrey, who had enormous success in the TV business, but her network has been struggling. Do you have any advice or thoughts about why that network has been struggling?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She just has to keep plugging. Oprah is a tremendous woman and she's a friend of mine. And I was on one of her last few shows. She did her final wrap-up week. It was a great honor because she honored me and my kids and my family and everything else. I just think Oprah is a tremendous woman. And she didn't really need this.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't really know why she did it. Maybe she wished she didn't, because, you know, it's tough with success. If you are successful like Oprah and you have just a little bit of a misstep, the press goes after you like it is unreal. So I think Oprah is going to do -- she's a winner and she will do absolutely fine.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Some people will say she won't stay with it, she will stay it. I think she'll probably stay with it and probably make it successful. But this is just a blip and they are making it such a big deal, she will do just fine. She's a really wonderful person.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, thank you. Nice to talk to you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you very much, Greta.
