<Greg Hurst> <Positive> Mr. President welcome to the Mid-South.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Greg Hurst> <Negative> You were here to campaign for a couple of candidates for the U.S. Senate. Are you a little disappointed that this race, or these races are as close as they are, especially into deep red states that you won so handily?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think Roger is in great shape and I think Cindy Hyde-Smith -- she's going to be... she's going to do really well, she's leading by, I think, quite a bit. But you just have to go out and vote. And I know my numbers here terrific. We had -- I love the people of Mississippi. They are great people. So, that's why I'm here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If my numbers weren't good, I wouldn't be here. I would not be here at all. But, I won the state by many, many votes. And, these are great people. So Cindy Hyde-Smith's in a race that I think she's substantially up, but I still want to make sure she's in good shape. Roger Wicker is -- Roger's Roger. He's doing great.
<Greg Hurst> <Positive> Mr. President, since you were elected it seems like the political climate in Washington has become even more divided. Do you think that some of the controversies within your administration helped lead to that division, and perhaps even the reason that some of these races are as close as they are?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I actually think we have a very unified party. I just, as you know, there's there are poll numbers showing I'm in the 90s, even sometimes the mid-90s in the Republican Party, which is a record. I think we actually have very, very strong in terms of the Republican -- if you look back to the Obama administration, I think it was worse, OK? And I've said it to a lot of people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It might have been a little bit more silent, but I think it was much more divided than it is right now. But there's no question, there's a big division in the country and I don't like to see it, but it's there.
<Greg Hurst> <Positive> You know, even among the casual observer, they would have to say that your conservative Republican base absolutely adores you. They love you. All you have to do is look at the people who are lining the streets on our trip from the Memphis International Airport to the Landers Center. There were thousands of people out there documenting your journey, wishing you well.
<Greg Hurst> <Negative> Of course, there are thousands waiting for you here in the Landers Center. So you see that, and then you have these Democrats who immensely dislike you. How do you explain that great divide?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well they don't like a strong military. I do. You know, we're going to have the strongest military we've ever had. Everything made right here. You know, the ships and the missiles and everything, and we won't have to use it because we'll be so strong, nobody is going to want to mess with us, right? That's always important.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have a very strong law enforcement ethic. We agree with ICE. We don't want people coming in here. ICE is fantastic. The job they do, and they go after the toughest people, and these toughest people are concerned with ICE because ICE is tougher than them. They want open borders. I mean, basically, they want open borders.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They want crime. They're going to destroy your Medicare. If you look at it, Medicare is a great thing, they're going to destroy it. So many different things, and you look at what they are doing, and you can -- it's actually a little hard to understand where they're coming from. They want high taxes. We want low taxes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, who can feel good about that? But we've cut our taxes, we've cut regulation. We're for law and order. We're a very powerful, strong, you know, presence, because we don't want people hurt. And yet, they're on the other side of the equation. So someday, somebody will explain what that's all about.
<Greg Hurst> <Negative> Mr. President, let us talk briefly about your Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. Are you concerned at all about the controversy that is surrounding his nomination, that he may not be able to serve effectively, and that there are some on the other side of the aisle who say that any decision he makes would be tainted?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I just think he's a fantastic person. You know, for 10 years, everybody talked about Brett Kavanaugh was the ultimate Supreme Court judge, would have been, he was going to go into court some day. This was going on for years, until about three weeks ago, when they started hitting him with all sorts of things, and charges that I don't believe for a minute.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And what they've done to that man and that family is so sad when I look at it. I watched him the other day and I said, he can't believe it. Did you see the one time when he was reading a question, and he was just shaking his head, and you could see, he was shaking his head, saying "I can't believe I'm here." Because this is just something that was impossible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was the most qualified person maybe ever put up. And what they've done to him, and now all of that, I think, just about all of that is all gone. It was all uncorroborated. It was fabricated stories, in many cases. A very, very sad situation. And I'm with him all the way. We can't let that happen, where somebody comes out of nowhere and makes a charge and, you know, you're guilty and you have no chance of proving your innocence?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The whole thing -- it's supposed to be the other way around. You're innocent until proven guilty, and I'll tell you what, the people of Mississippi are with him. I see it, and you see all those thousands of people outside trying to get in. They can't get in unfortunately because it's fact. But those people are with us. We have something going that I don't think has ever happened in this country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have people, and I use the expression Make America Great Again, keep America great. That's going to be in another year, because we've -- we've come so far. You look at the unemployment numbers. They're are at a record low, and for and for every group. African-American, you take a look. Asian American, women.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You look at -- every group is at a number that's historically the best. And we're doing a great job. But what's happening to Judge Kavanaugh is -- is disgraceful. And I think it's energizing the Republican Party.
<Greg Hurst> <Negative> I've got the signal here. I know you're running short on time. Let me ask you one question about tariffs. We have a lot of farmland here in the Mid-South. A lot of farmers. Some of them are concerned about these tariffs hurting them and their production. Even one of your strongest advocates, Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee, who's running for the U.S. Senate as well, she's not sure this is the right course of action.
<Greg Hurst> <Negative> Why do you think it is?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, she doesn't have to worry about it anymore. Neither do you. Because, as you know, we made our deal with Mexico and Canada yesterday.
<Greg Hurst> <Neutral> But about with China?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's not a tar -- well, China is another thing. We're going to straighten that out. China is a very important element going on right now. China, has been taking billions and billions of dollars out of our country for years. $500 billion a year, from -- years. We rebuilt China, and it's got to stop, and about five months ago we started the move.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This should have been done by presidents for decades, and nobody did it, and we are doing fantastically as a country and they're not. And that's to a certain extent because of us. Not that I want that to happen, but they are not doing well, and we're doing fantastically well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I believe that they will come back, just like you have the new NAFTA deal. I don't want to use the word NAFTA, because it was such a terrible deal for a country with what they did to jobs and businesses leaving our country. But now we have a trade deal that's a great deal. And that'll happen with China too. And the farmers appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know what the farmers are saying? "Let the president do what he does best. Let him do it." Because you cannot allow what's happening with China to continue. So, we're doing very well against China. I don't even call it a trade war. We're doing very well. Remember this: billions and billions of dollars are coming into the coffers of the United States, paid for by China, and it's turning very quickly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They would like to talk. They would like to make a deal. At the right time, we'll probably make a deal. But I think it's too early.
<Greg Hurst> <Positive> Alright, Mr President --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the farmers, by the way, the farmers, these are great patriots. They know what I'm doing that's right, and we love them. And just like I produced with Canada and with Mexico, where the markets are now expanded, they're going to have a much bigger market. We're going to do something even more special with China.
<Greg Hurst> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much Greg.
<Greg Hurst> <Positive> Safe travels.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great to be with you.
<Greg Hurst> <Neutral> Do you mind if she gets a quick shot -- [Interview ends]
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Mr. Trump, welcome back to Meet the Press, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning, Chuck.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Good morning.
<Hillary Clinton> <Negative> He is becoming ISIS' best recruiter. They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> [End Video] Now, I know what you're about to say, no fact checker has been able to back up her claim on that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's exactly correct. I was going to say that. Exactly correct.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That nobody has been able to back that up. It's nonsense. It's just another Hillary lie. She lies like crazy about everything, whether it's strips where she was being gunned down in a helicopter or an airplane, she's a liar and everybody knows that. I mean -- but she just made this up in thin air.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> But let me ask you this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because I think that my words represent toughness and strength. Hillary is not strong. Hillary is weak, frankly. She's got nothing.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Wait, let me stop...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She doesn't have...
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- you there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- she couldn't even get back -- George, she couldn't even get back on the stage. Nobody knows what happened to her. It's like she went home and went to sleep.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Why do you keep going on this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She couldn't even get back on the stage last night.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'll tell you why.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because we need a president with great strength and great stamina. And Hillary doesn't have that. We cannot have another bad president like we have right now. We need a president with tremendous intelligence, smarts, cunning, strength and stamina.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> There's a lot of things I've heard about...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Hillary doesn't have that.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> -- Hillary Clinton, the idea, though, she did travel more than any secretary of State. It's a grueling job. This is somebody that has been on a -- on the national stage for 25 years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But she's sitting in an airplane, Chuck.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Well, so are you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But Chuck, she may have traveled a lot, but you know what, she didn't do the job, because the entire world blew up around her. So she wasted a lot of time and a lot of energy and a lot of money and, frankly, she wasted a lot of lives, because her policies were a disaster for the world. The Middle East has blown up around her. Her decisions were horrible. And hundreds of thousands of people have been killed because of her faulty decisions.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> I've heard you say that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Of course.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Where?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Of course.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> What is this charge?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How about Libya? How about all the bad decisions made? Look, how about Libya? How about what's going on right now with the migration, which essentially was caused by her faulty decisions along with her president, her leader. Our great president, who is grossly incompetent. How about now? You look at our president, how about the Iran deal, one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated in my life, Chuck? I mean it's just bad deal, bad decision after bad deal after bad decision.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Why are you so comfortable praising Vladimir Putin?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not. I didn't praise him. He praised me. He called me brilliant. He said very nice things about me. I mean I -- I accepted...
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> You -- well, you called him a strong leader.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean I think he's -- I'm sure he's 100...
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- he is a strong leader.  What am I going to say, he's a weak leader? He's making mincemeat out of our president.  He is a strong leader.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean you would like me to call him a weak leader.  He's a strong leader.  And I'm not going to be politically correct.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's got an 80 percent approval rating done by pollsters from, I understand, this country, OK? So it's not even done by his pollsters.  He's very popular within Russia.  Now, that may change, but I'm not -- he -- I didn't say anything one way or the other.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He came out with a very nice statement about me and I said that's very nice, I'm honored by it.  And it would be very nice if we got along with Russia, Chuck.  It's not a bad thing, it's a good thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He cannot stand our president.  He doesn't like President Obama.  I think it would be a positive thing if Russia and the United States actually got along and they could work to the mutual good of getting rid of ISIS and clean things up.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean right now, we don't get along with them at all.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Right. But right now, Vladimir Putin is the best ally Iran has around the world and the best ally that Assad has...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no...
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> -- in Syria.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- by making -- by making the horrible deal, one of the worst deals I've ever seen made in my entire life, giving them $150 billion, a 24 day check periods, which don't start for a long time after that, 24 day check periods, self-inspection, they -- we don't get our prisoners back, our four prisoners, we don't get them back. We gave them $150 billion. We happen to be in its own sick and horrible way, we happen to have been one of the great allies of -- of Iran, if you want to know the truth. And by the way, just to add to that...
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Yes?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- we also handed them Iraq on a silver platter. We gave them Iraq with the second largest oil reserves in the world. They're taking over Iraq as you speak to me this morning.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we gave them one of the best deals ever made and by the way, they're taking that money now...
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- and they're giving it to Russia...
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Do you...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- and others, where they're buying armaments with...
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Do you -- do you stand...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- which nobody ever reports.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> -- do you stick by the idea that the Middle East would be more stable today with Saddam Hussein and Gadhafi in power?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> One hundred percent. A hundred percent. There's not even - is - is there even a doubt in your mind? And you wouldn't have the migration. And you wouldn't have people coming over to this country that we have no idea who they are. And if I win, they're going to have to go back because we have no idea who they are.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> And if you become president -
<Donald Trump> <Positive> One hundred percent.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Do you let Assad -
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And you know what we would have done with -
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Do you let Assad stay?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know what we -
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Do you let Assad stay?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what, well, you can't fight Assad and ISIS at the same time. You have to fight ISIS first. And I don't say Assad is good, but I think what this -
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> That's exactly what Bernie Sanders believes, by the way. You and Bernie Sanders are in line on this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's OK. Then I agree with him on that. I'm - I'm' - it's OK to agree with - he's a guy - I don't agree with him on much, but if he says that, I'm OK with it. Let me just tell you, you can't fight them both at the same time. And I say Assad's a bad guy. But we don't know who the rebels are that are fighting. Every time we get involved with rebels, take a look at Libya, take a look -
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All these rebels, look what they did to our ambassador and those young - young men, those wonderful young men. Every time we get involved - in Benghazi, I'm talking about. Every time we get involved with rebels -
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The rebels, they call them the freedom rebels, always nice names, it ends up being far worse than the people that were there in the first place. So Assad is not a good guy.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the people that we're backing, a lot of people think they're ISIS. That we're actually backing ISIS. So what are we doing? We have to get rid of ISIS first. Assad we can think about later on.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Let me ask you to respond to your friend Jeb Bush and what he had to say about you yesterday. Take a listen to the full quote and I'll get you on the other side. [Begin Video]
<Jeb Bush> <Negative> Just one other thing. I've got to get this off my chest. Donald Trump is a jerk.
<Unidentified Female> <Positive> Thank you.
<Jeb Bush> <Positive> I feel better now. I just - I just - I gave myself therapy there. Thank you for allowing me to do it.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> [End Video] Well, this has escalated between you and Mr. Bush.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, his people gave him that quote. You could see he was just saying, OK, I'm ready now. I'm ready now to say it. Jeb is a weak and ineffective person. He's also a low-energy person, which I've said before, but he's a weak and ineffective person. Jeb, if he were president, it would just be more of the same. It would be just [Inaudible]. He's got money from all of the lobbyists and all of the special interests that run him like a puppet.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Yes. I mean -
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's got 2 percent in the polls. I have 41 percent in the latest poll. He has 2 percent. He's going to be off the stage soon.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's an embarrassment to the Bush family. And, in fact, he doesn't even want to use the Bush name, which is interesting. Jeb is an embarrassment to himself and to his family.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Why -
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And the Republican Party -
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Has - has essentially - they're not even listening to Jeb.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Why -
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Jeb is saying that. By the way, Jeb -
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Jeb is only saying that to try and get a little mojo going.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But in the meantime, I went up 11 points in the new Fox poll.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I went up 11 points -
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> After the debate and he went down two.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Very quickly, why are you - why has Ted Cruz caught you in Iowa? We can dispute whether you're ahead by a point or two, whether he's ahead by five or six. But the fact of the matter is, Ted Cruz has caught you in Iowa and he might beat you in Iowa.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, I just got back - Chuck, I just got back from Iowa last night.  I was there for a long time yesterday.  We had a tremendous rally.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, frankly, I think we're doing great in Iowa.  I - I don't know.  I mean I can't tell you who caught who.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think Ted is doing well and I'm doing well. It looks like a two-person race because everyone else is way behind. But I'm doing really well with evangelicals who I love. I'm doing really well with every group. With the Tea Party groups, everybody. I mean I can only speak for myself. We really have a good team in Iowa and I'll find out - let's see what happens on February 1st. But Ted is doing well there and I'm doing well there. And if you look at the numbers in New Hampshire, I mean I'm through the roof there.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And in South Carolina, I'm through the roof there. I mean I'm way ahead in those two states. And Ted and I are pretty even, although the last three polls -
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Have me up in Iowa, as you know.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Is it pretty fair to say that if you're not the nominee, you'd prefer Ted Cruz?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I don't want to say anything about that. But Ted has been very nice to me, very respectful. Very - almost in every single instance he backs my ideas and, you know, probably more so. And Ben Carson has been very nice also. I mean I've had people - look, I get along with a lot of the -
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Believe it or not, I get along with a lot of the people on that stage, but Ted has been very nice to me, yes.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Well, I think everybody right now except Mr. Bush.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You, too.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> I look forward to a face to face before - right after the first of the year.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You, too. Merry Christmas, happy New Year to everybody -
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> You got it. Stay safe.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it's been an - It's been an interesting time. Thank you very much.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Yes, it has, sir. Thank you.
