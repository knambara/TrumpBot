<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> In nine months in office, you've already accomplished more in the way of job creation. The move in the equities markets has been extraordinary and record setting. All of the indexes, at or near record levels.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> You have accomplished so much in that nine months. And yet, as you say, we need tax reform. You're meeting resistance from within your own party. You're meeting resistance from the Democrats. How do you move from here?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think we're going to get it. I think these Senators are going to come together. I think the House is looking really good, you know, they're passing this bill along very rapidly. In fact, that's going to happen hopefully today. And I did make a couple of calls. I said -- fellas, please, no changes. Just pass it along. We have to get tax cuts. And just pass it along.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to get tax cuts. And just pass it along. Now normally, they want to make their 15 points or their 20 points and then it has to go back and it has to be re-voted and everything else. I said just pass it along. And they said think we're going to do that. And let's see what happens.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think they're going to do that. And so look, we have actually in the Republican Party, in a true sense, we have great unity. Look at the Democrats with Bernie Sanders who got absolutely taken advantage of by the DNC. And now see it, you know, all the stuff coming out. You see worse happening.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you look at Hillary and Bernie, that's big league stuff. We have very, very minor -- we have great unity. I was with the Senate yesterday, the entire Republican Senate. And other than two people, I tell you, there was a lot of love in that room.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> A lot of love and a lot to get done.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A lot to get done. Yes.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> And -- and the -- and tax reform is critical because of what you have established as the standard now for economic growth under the Trump presidency, tax reform is going to be absolutely critical to driving that growth, job creation and bringing capital back, which you've been talking about for two years before you were elected --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> For many years.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Many years before.
<Lou Dobbs> <Neutral> So where do we go, in terms of capital repatriation for corporate America, how do you incentivize corporations to get back to America with all of that money for investment in jobs, plant equipment, research and development?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we have many things. Number one, we're bringing the corporate rate down to 20 percent from 35 percent. That's a massive -- this will be the biggest tax --
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- cut in history. In the history of our country. And that's great. And we need it. Because right now, our country's about the highest taxed or certainly one of the highest taxed in the world. And we can't have that. So we're going to have a country that's toward the lower end. I can't say it's the lowest. You know, Ireland is going now lower and others are going lower.
<Lou Dobbs> <Negative> They played the game a lot better than our people have played the game, I can tell you that. But we're going to have a country that's going to have tax incentive now. And we are going to bring back -- you know, I've been talking and I even heard you say it not so long ago -- two and a half trillion.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> But you and I have both been using that number for years.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> A conservative number
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That number is much higher now, because it's, you know, built up over the years. And I would be surprised if it weren't close to $4 trillion. That money's coming back. And nobody would bring it back now because the tax is so astronomical, they'd have to be desperate to bring it back.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean any company that would bring it back and pay the tax that they have to pay, which probably ends up being close to 40 percent, who's going to pay that to bring money back in? So what they do is they leave their money in these other places and other countries and they spend it there and they create a lot of additional wealth there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We want the money coming back here. But it could be $4 trillion. And what we're doing is substantially lowering the tax. And we're also getting rid of all the bureaucratic hurdles. It wasn't just the tax. I have friends that want to bring money back. The amount of work they have to do to get the approval to bring the money back is absolutely ridiculous.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So that's going away also.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> And the middle class -- you say this is for the middle class and small business and the pass-through rates are all very attractive. What do you expect the impact to be for working men and women, the middle class, those who aspire to be in the middle class?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, we've done so well. Pretty much record setting, certainly record setting for nine months in so many different ways. Nine months of a presidency. But you look at the market, how well it's doing, so you'd say well why do you have to do anything. We can actually do better.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I think we will do better. We are going to have so many jobs created by what we're doing. And you know, we're going to have companies that aren't going to be leaving our country anymore. You look at what's happened over the last 25 years, you go down and take a look at Mexico --
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- and see how many car companies have built these massive factories in Mexico. Not here. We want them built in Michigan, and Ohio, and our places. And they just leave, and they fire everybody, and they go and open up plants. That's not going to be happening anymore, plus they're going to be penalized in many different ways if they do it.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Well you're the first President to talk openly and honestly about offshoring of production, the outsourcing of jobs. Millions of jobs --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's terrible.
<Lou Dobbs> <Negative> that -- that have begun, under your administration, to come back to the country. The idea that made in America, buy in America, hire in America, how -- how likely is it that that can actually be realized with a -- with a business community that has fought those on the wrong side of those issues for a very long time?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well you're right, and it's surprising to me. For instance, NAFTA is a horrible agreement, one of the worst trade deals ever. It's just one of the worst. Although TPP, which I terminated before it got signed -- before it got finished, someday hopefully people will be thanking. That would have been one of the great disasters of all times, in terms of trade. --
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And a lot of people understand that, but a lot of people don't. But I was very honored to have just terminated that. And we'll do bilateral deals with all those countries. We'll do it great. And if they don't do -- treat us properly, we'll do a termination or we'll do whatever we want to do. These deals, once you get into them --
<Lou Dobbs> <Negative> How likely is it that there will be a resolution on NAFTA in these current negotiations? --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK. So I would say this. In order to have a resolution -- because right now, Mexico and Canada have such a great deal -- it's so good that it's very hard for them to get used to the fact that it can't be that way anymore. And as you know, Mexico has an election coming up and they have a number of people that are running and they're very pro Mexico.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Which is -- in fact, they wore a hat -- a green hat that says, "Make Mexico Great Again."" They call them -- they call them the Donald Trump of politics. They have a couple of them
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said, you -- you negotiate -- I tell my people. I say, right now, it's going to be very hard. And in my opinion, in order to make a fair deal with NAFTA, you have to terminate the deal and you have to see where you're going to come. And we'll come out
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think you have to give them -- to make a fair deal and a great deal, and you see what's going on, we're being very tough and we're being very fair. But we have to get back a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What's happened to this country with NAFTA is unbelievable. The jobs that have been taken, the factories that are moving out of our -- out of Michigan, out of Ohio, out of Pennsylvania, out of our states is incredible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So what are the chances? I think the chances, ultimately, are good. But right now, I think my people are going to have to get tougher.
<Lou Dobbs> <Neutral> And --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I told them that.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> So as you look at the agreement that has, by the most conservative estimates, costs the United States $1 trillion over the course of -- over the course of the past 23 years since its inception --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But look at it a different way.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have a trade deficit with Mexico. --
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Mexico's wonderful. But we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $71 billion a year. This is Mexico. We weren't talking about China, which is much worse. --
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have a trade deficit right now with Mexico of $71 billion. People can't believe it. --
<Lou Dobbs> <Neutral> There was a --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That we have trade deficits -- well, we have trade deficits with almost everybody. --
<Lou Dobbs> <Neutral> Every --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But we're changing that.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> The -- when you focus first on free trade, people are like -- oh, my gosh. He's talking like an isolationist, --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's unbelievable.
<Lou Dobbs> <Negative> a protectionist. And then they started looking at the numbers to see that we are, amongst all of our trading partners that this country is the only one who said, "You know
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The WTO, World Trade Organization, was set up for the benefit for everybody but us.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They have taken advantage of this country like you wouldn't believe.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I say to my people, you tell them, like as an example, we lose the lawsuits, almost all of the lawsuits in the WTO -- within the WTO.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because we have fewer judges than other countries. It's set up as you can't win. In other words, the panels are set up so that we don't have majorities. It was set up for the benefit of taking advantage of the United States. NAFTA and I tell people and I tell good people, they hear me -- I'm going to be very tough with NAFTA.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they hear I'm getting tough with -- they said 'please don't touch it.' I say, listen. I'm going to make the detail better. 'Oh, don't touch it.' I said, supposing I don't terminate it, but I make it better. 'Oh, don't touch it.' And I say, why would they not want me to make it better?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Even if assuming you leave it the way it is, which we may or we may not. It depends how the negotiation turns out. We may not. But look, they don't even want you to touch it, even if you tell them, we're going to make it better.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Then you say to yourself, what's going on. And then you say, well they must be on the other side of the deal too. And they are. They have companies that have factories in Mexico.
<Lou Dobbs> <Neutral> U.S.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I'm not interested in them, I'm interested here. [Commercial Break]
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> The role of business in this country, critical, off fundamental to the -- to the country's wellbeing and its future to the creation of jobs. But business has taken such a voice in this town, in this swamp that you are the only countervailing influence to that dominance of U.S. multinationals in this country. And it's -- the country owes you a great debt on so much. But on that in particular. And I --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's very interesting. It's well put. It's true.
<Lou Dobbs> <Negative> And you have focused from June 16th of 2015 on the relationship of our borders, our sovereignty, our economy, whether you're looking at the opioid crisis in this country or the import of drugs that all crosses that border. You're being pushed back against, by the leadership of the House and the Senate on the issue of funding a wall in its entirety.
<Lou Dobbs> <Negative> You have been pushed back against talking about changing all of those trade agreements, again, all the external issues that are so critical to the country's future, your vision for this country. How in the world are we going to be able to deal with all of these issues if you -- if you cannot bring the Republican party together?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I really think they're coming along. I really do. I think they are coming along. One thing you didn't mention which you will mention and I know you talk about it is the power of the pharmaceutical companies.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Oh, yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We pay so much more for the same pill, prescription drugs than other countries. You go to Canada -- people go to Canada to buy prescriptions.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We pay for the exact same pill, made from same plant, the same company, we pay in many cases, many, many times more than they're paying in other countries. So we're subsidizing the world in terms of prescription drugs. It's ridiculous. And it's going to stop.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The problem I have is these companies give so much -- I mean the contributions are massive, just massive, the amount. But we do have -- there are a lot of good people that are seeing what's going on. And I think we'll be successful in that. Next week, I'm going to declaring an emergency, national emergency on drugs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The opioid is a tremendous emergency, what's going on there. The drugs pouring into the country have gotten -- and I tell you what, we've made a big impact. But still, we need the wall. You know, part of the reason we need the wall is for drugs.
<Lou Dobbs> <Neutral> For drugs?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Forgetting even about people, we need a wall for drugs. And the wall's coming along. You know, we're building right now prototypes. We have six prototypes. I'm going to be looking at them over the next three weeks.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Do you have a favorite yet?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, it's funny. It's very interesting. Almost glad you asked because it's actually pretty easy to understand. You think of a wall as a wall. But honestly you do need some see through ability because you don't know who's – if you do pure concrete which is a wall then you can't see who's on the other side.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know you have a wall that's this thick and you can't see who's on the other side. So, we're going to need some see through abilities. So, I'm going to be going down. We actually have six prototypes that are all very top of the line. Done with Homeland Security.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have some incredible people, if you look at the Border Patrol, if you look at the ICE agents and I've had –
<Lou Dobbs> <Negative> Tough job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I've had the people at that level. Those are the people, they know so much. They know more than anybody and they also know the wall and the wall systems. And, we're going to take a look at the wall and we're going to get it built and it's going to be – it's going to be quite the wall. It's going to be very effective.
<Lou Dobbs> <Negative> You're obviously enthused about what you're going to get done. You've got to be immensely gratified at what you've been able to do often with a recalcitrant Congress and Senate. Going forward, there's another wall and there's a wall that's just fallen between the American public, the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> They funded something called the Trump dossier which they ballyhooed for some time. We now know who paid for it. The DNC and Hillary Clinton and one, as yet, unnamed republican. Do you want to –
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Wonder who that might be?
<Lou Dobbs> <Negative> Do you have a suspect?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think I know but you know I'll let them find out. They're going to find out eventually just like they did – don't forget Hillary Clinton totally denied this. She didn't know anything. She knew nothing. All of a sudden they found out. What I was amazed at, it's almost $6 million that they paid and it's totally discredited, it's a total phony. I call it fake news.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's disgraceful. It's disgraceful.
<Lou Dobbs> <Negative> I think her word that she likes to use, it's so serviceable about that dossier, debunked. It's been debunked.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then, I understand recently she said well opposition research. Opposition research is very standard. So, it's very interesting, she denied it, her own people denied it. Everybody denied it and now they're sort of scooting around trying to figure out what to say.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, they spent, if you think of it, almost $6 million on something like that and I think honestly I just think it's a disgrace.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> And, contemporaneously, suddenly the House Intelligence Committee, the House Oversight Committee are turning to the Democratic Party and talking about – not talking about but beginning the investigation of something called Collusion with the Russians.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's the real collusion. Believe me.
<Lou Dobbs> <Neutral> You r thoughts?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There was no collusion on my side. I can tell you that. Everybody knew it. You knew it because you were saying it when it was not in vogue but I always said and I had no idea how right I was because I didn't realize it would be for this extent.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I always said this was an excuse for losing the election put out by the democrats and that's what it was. But then when you hear the kind of money they spent and when you see all of the things about Podesta and you see all of the relationships that they actually have with Russia and you see in hers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know one thing that is interesting and I have to say even the democrats they walk out of those meetings and they say no there is no collusion and we haven't found any yet but we'll keep going.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A wonderful man came to my office a week ago. A very highly respected man and he sat down and he said, "You know it's been very unfair. From the day you have been president you've been under this little veil of Russia
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think there's anything wrong with – you know they are a power, they're a nuclear power. I think we could have a good relationship. I think that North Korean situation would be easier settled.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I just spoke to the President of China, I congratulated him on his big victory. But it would be wonderful if we could speak to China and Russia. Because China is helping us and maybe Russia's going through the other way and hurting what we're getting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean when I say maybe, I think I know exactly what I'm talking about. If we had a relationship with Russia, that would be a good thing, not a bad thing.
<Lou Dobbs> <Negative> Relationships -- you were criticized for even trying to court, if you will, President Xi of China. Everyone, the so-called intelligentsia of this country's foreign policy establishment, said you're wasting your time, it just can't be done. And obviously you've made significant progress with him and --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Just spoke to him a few minutes ago, just before I walked into the room. You know, something has been given to him that's never been --
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- it's really virtually never happened in China. He's been given powers that nobody's --
<Lou Dobbs> <Neutral> -- written into the constitution.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a powerful man. I happen to think he's a very good person. Now with that being said, he represents China, I represent the USA, so, you know, there's going to always be conflict. But we have a very good relationship. People say we have the best relationship of any president-president, because he's called president also.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now some people might call him the king of China. But he's called president. But we have a very good relationship and that's a positive thing. And it would be good to have that relationship with Russia and other countries, too.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Hopefully the whole world. Anything to report to America on your conversation with President Xi?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but I'll be going there in two weeks.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we're going to Beijing and other places, wherever he'd like to take me. And we'll be spending two days there. And we're going also to Japan and South Korea. And it will be, I think -- hopefully it's historic and positive and we have to solve the North Korea problem. It's a very big problem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It should have never been given to me. This should have been solved long before I came to office, when it would have been easier to solve. But it was given to me and I get it solved. I solve problems. I'm very happy with the way the markets are going, I'm very happy with all of the regulation cuts and all of the things we've done and that's what's driving the markets. [Commercial Break]
<Lou Dobbs> <Negative> You're nearing a decision on who will chair the fed.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am.
<Lou Dobbs> <Neutral> Any hints?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I really have it down to two and maybe three people. And I think over the next very short period of time I'll be announcing it. It won't be a big shock. It was sort of interesting, the way it comes out. And you've been talking about the various people on your show, which I watch absolutely almost all the time, even if it means TiVo or whatever device you happen to be using at the time.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> We appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But no, your show is fantastic. So I'll be announcing this role over the next pretty short period of time.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> All right. And you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Do you have a preference, out of curiosity?
<Lou Dobbs> <Neutral> I do, and --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Tell me who your preference is.
<Lou Dobbs> <Negative> I think I -- may I constrain myself?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Lou Dobbs> <Neutral> Because an ad hoc advisor to the president --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but I'd love to hear it. You could even cut it out if you want. You don't have to -- I would love to hear you. I only want that from people I respect.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> I personally believe that Janet Yellen might be worth keeping.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I tell you what, she was in my office three days ago. She was very impressive. I liked her a lot. I mean, it's somebody that I am thinking about. I would certainly think about it. In one way, I have to say --
<Lou Dobbs> <Negative> I haven't been utterly rejected --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. In one way, I have to say you'd like to make your own mark.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You understand that.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You like to make your own mark, which is maybe one of the things she's got a little bit against her. But I think she's terrific. We had a great talk. And we're obviously doing very well together, you look at the markets.
<Lou Dobbs> <Negative> And I'm saying that, by the way, not being any fan of interest rate hikes by the fed here, and as has been discussed since December of 2015. I have to ask you in conclusion -- and I really appreciate your time, as does our audience -- you came into this job fighting like hell. And you are fighting like hell every day. --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> More than I thought.
<Lou Dobbs> <Neutral> I -- I -- that's --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I came in. I said I'm going to fight like hell. I didn't realize -- I had -- it's even more -- more so than I thought. But that's the way it is. And that's good.
<Lou Dobbs> <Negative> And I've got to ask you, I mean, you're one of the most -- I would say, by the left particularly, reviled, even hated men to ever hold your post. --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would say so.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> You're also one of the most loved and respected --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would say that also.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> in history. And how does that feel? How -- where is Donald Trump today, as you are just now beginning your presidency?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So the one thing that I really thought -- because I thought I was treated very unfairly by the press during the campaign. --
<Lou Dobbs> <Negative> Without question --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And when I won, I said, "The good news is
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Lou, they put on stories and CNN, and on NBC, and CBS, and ABC, and NBC being an offshoot also with the MSNBC, which is ridiculous. They put on stories that are so false. They have so-called sources that, in my opinion, don't exist. You know, they'll say, "Sources have said
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're sitting down, they just -- they make it up. It is so dishonest. It is so fake. And you know, I have come up with some pretty good names for people. There's -- I think one of the best names is -- you know, I've really started this whole fake news thing. Now they've turned it around and then, now they're calling, you know, stories put out by different -- by Facebook fake. And they're fake.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What could be more fake than CBS, and NBC, and ABC, and CNN when you look at some of these stories? And when you look at the amount of negative -- I know when I do well and when I do badly. --
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know a good story from a bad story. But when you have a really good story and they make it bad, I'll say to my wife, "Oh
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the good thing about social media is that I have so many millions of people, so many -- I guess, 128 million. You could add up -- you know, you add up all the different platforms -- massive social media.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> At least I can put out -- it's not that I want to do that. I'd rather not do it. I would love to not do it at all. But at least I can put out the truth. And I can put out the real word. And people agree. And if you look at the level of approval of the -- of media -- of general media --
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> if you look at it from the day I started running to now, I'm so proud that I have been able to convince people how fake it is -- because it has taken a nosedive. --
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Yes. And --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Except for your show, of course -- and Sean, and a few of them. Right?
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There's some very good ones. And I have to say, Fox has treated me fairly. And I don't mean good, but they've treated me fairly. I don't want to be treated good. I just want to be treated fairly.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Well -- I -- you -- you are a, if I may say, everything as advertised as you ran for President. And appreciate everything you're doing. Thanks so much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're getting it done. I will promise you, we're getting it done. And it's happened -- a lot has already happened. Thank you very much, it's an honor.
<Lou Dobbs> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you.
<John Clayton> <Positive> Since buying the New Jersey Generals more than a year ago, Donald Trump, 37, has become the most prominent owner in the United States Football League. Some consider him the USFL's version of George Steinbrenner, the controversial owner of the New York Yankees. Trump has pushed for a fall schedule and, with his attorney, Roy Cohn, pushed for the $1.32 billion antitrust suit against the National Football League. He got both.
<John Clayton> <Positive> The USFL will play in the fall in 1986. He is the son of New York City real estate investor and developer who has parlayed his father's fortunes into more riches. His annual income from his New York investments is estimated at $500 million. Some owners have criticized him for inflating salaries. Others are expecting him to be named chairman of the league's executive committee within a few weeks.
<John Clayton> <Neutral> He spoke as he was leaving a shortened three-day meeting at Amelia Island, Fla., in which the league decided to consolidate to 15 teams but withheld any announcement until a major, lavish press conference.
<John Clayton> <Neutral> By John Clayton, The Pittsburgh Press
<John Clayton> <Positive> What was accomplished at these meetings?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The league is in great shape. The one thing we were able to do get was a firm commitment from all of the owners. All of the owners are with us. Not one has left. We think the lawsuit is going to be a big success. Everybody is convinced this league is here to stay. This league will be regarded as the biggest sports story of the century
<John Clayton> <Negative> You have been perhaps the major force in changing the spring league into a fall league. Why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have a great league. We think we can challenge the NFL and be successful. The antitrust suit will prevent some of the tactics they have been using against us. We think we can go directly against them. As I understand it, the NFL people are scared of this suit. They may say that it is a baseless lawsuit, but they are saying differently to others.
<John Clayton> <Neutral> Why the lawsuit?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It deals with the monopolization of the NFL over the television networks. Watch how the case develops. It will determine and show how they control the networks.
<John Clayton> <Negative> Right now, you have no network television contract for the fall schedule in 1986. Why would a network want to go against itself and give you a contract?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The NFL is going to have a hard time trying to get the same kind of contract they have now [the NFL has a four-year, $2.1 million contract that expires after next season]. Their ratings are going down. Their ratings have gone down on Monday Night Football, and it is to the point that they are going to have a hard time selling it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are at the point where there will be no Monday Night Football. I think that will happen.
<John Clayton> <Neutral> What would the networks get in return?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They are getting an exciting product. We are more exciting than the NFL. That league has become boring. Once we move to the fall, we will bring a product that people will like.
<John Clayton> <Neutral> What about the Generals?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They are an exciting team. We have Herschel Walker. We finished 14-2 last year. The only bad game we had was against Pittsburgh. But we had a good season.
<John Clayton> <Neutral> Some owners are saying you are going to be named chairman of the executive committee. What type of things will you do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know that that will happen. The owners will have to vote on that. John Bassett has done a great job with that for two years. Of course, my philosophies are a little more different than his.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we have made some good decisions lately, going to the fall schedule and setting the lawsuit. We have a strong position. We have a strong league
<John Clayton> <Positive> Does this league want to merge into the NFL?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We don't want to merge, despite the negative press we have been getting. I'm very satisfied. We are able to compete with the NFL for television and other things. I was one of the principal people in trying to move to the fall. Football is meant to be played in the fall. The television revenue is greater in the fall.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> More people are watching TV in the fall. The Generals outdrew the New York Jets in the television ratings in our first game.
<John Clayton> <Negative> Although you can't comment on the consolidation plan because of a $50,000 gag rule, what impact will the things that happened over the weekend have?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We showed that we are going to be here for a long time. We have a strong group of owners and we are all together. This league is here to stay.
<Question> <Positive> Last year on the speed round, you made some North Korea news. It was a format that worked well. Do you remember that? You said you'd be willing to meet with Kim Jong Un?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's right. Look, they haven't had a missile test, a nuclear test, they haven't had anything, and when did I leave? Three and a half month  --  three months ago.
<Question> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the other ones had been playing around for eight years, eight years, eight years, and you know, you go back many years with the family, but they haven't had a missile test, they haven't had anything, plus we got back our hostages.
<Question> <Neutral> But are they trying your patience?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no.
<Question> <Negative> You're happy with them? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I have greater patience than any human being in the world.
<Question> <Positive> Yes, yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People don't understand that about me. I have great patience.
<Question> <Neutral> So, you don't need to send them signals that time is running out for them to take action?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So no, I have  --  I don't think I have to do anything. I have a  --  you know, I've  --  I've had a good  --  now, that can always change, but I've had a good relationship with Kim Jong Un, and I'm not saying it won't change. It could change. The whole situation could change. But you've had no missile testing, you've had no rocket testing, we got back our hostages, and there's been no nuclear tests. And that's pretty good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I signed a document  --  you know, that document I signed said there will be a denuclearization. You know, everyone says we didn't agree  --  we agreed to a lot of very positive things. Did you get a copy of the document?
<Question> <Positive> Yes. We did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody reports it. They say, like...
<Question> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I look  --  if you look at those points, it's  --  it's everything. Now whether or not people live up to it, we'll see. But  --  but I have confidence that eventually they'll live up to it. And in the meantime, we have our sanctions fully in place.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have sanctions  --  no, I left the sanctions on. You know, the sanctions haven't come off. But I have hopes that North Korea will be successful. I can't tell you that with surety, but I think we've certainly done better than anybody else, and we got all those things done that I told you about, including getting our hostages back. And there's no sign of anything happening right now. We'll see what happens.
<Question> <Neutral> Jumping over to the tariffs on China...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Question> <Negative> ... are you thinking that as soon as the comment period is over on Thursday of next week, that...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Did you just release a story...
<Question> <Neutral> ... that you won't go...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... that I'm putting out $200 billion? Who was the genius that?
<Question> <Neutral> That was us.
<Question> <Negative> Me. Am I wrong?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Uh, I refuse to say. Not totally wrong. I can't do that to you, Jennifer. That's my Jennifer. You know how much I liked her when I first met her, then she started to kill me. But that's actually not --  wasn't your fault. It was somebody that you were dealing with that wasn't so good. Right? I never blamed you for that. I know the good. But this one you like, right?
<Question> <Neutral> Sarah?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The greatest. She's got the easiest job in politics.
<Question> <Negative> So you will work for  --  next --  when next  --  next  --  next week's attempt comes to an end and you will just hit them with the tariffs straight off?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So here's the story, just if I could really quickly. For decades, China has taken advantage of the United States and its leaders. People don't like saying that because you have some Republicans that don't like it and you have some Democrats. I'm not just blaming President Obama. I'm blaming many administrations.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> China was rebuilt with American dollars. They were taking out $500 billion a year. And, in earlier stages lesser amounts, but massive nevertheless. And I said it's time to stop. We can't let this happen. Can't let it happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And what I did is, because of North Korea, I delayed my decision by a little bit. I was going to do trade with China right away, and a couple of things happened. One thing happened is I got to know President Xi, who I like a lot. OK?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Another thing that happened is with the North Korea  --  and  --  and if you people remember, if you go back to the end of the Obama administration, we were ready to go to war with North Korea, just so you understand. You know, when people say, 'Oh, what have you done?' We don't feel that now. OK?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, you can say, gee whiz, we're not going quick or we're going too quick. You can say whatever you want to say, we were ready to go to war. And when I was in very heated rhetoric, you know, it's interesting. With him they said, I'm going to cause war, I'm too strong  --  and then with Putin, they said I'm being too nice. OK?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They wanted me to be in a boxing match. I'd like to have a good relationship with Putin. I'd like to have a good relationship with everybody because I think it's in the best interest of our country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it is interesting, Jennifer, isn't it? Remember, they said he's going to cause a war when I said rocket  --  you know, when I did the rocket man thing and worse. Much worse.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They said war. And with Putin, which was actually one of my best meetings because of my talk on Syria, Ukraine, Israel and other things. I think it was one of my best meetings. I think the press covered it unbelievably fake. It was real fake news but  --  but it was a very good meeting.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The NATO meeting was phenomenal. You know they're putting up hundreds of billions of dollars more, and I came out of that one where they said I was too rough on the other presidents and prime ministers of the countries, so OK, give me a break. But in the meantime we were carrying them on NATO. They weren't paying their bills, or as you would say in your wonderful magazine, they were delinquent. Very delinquent, OK? So we had some very good successes.
<Question> <Negative> Mr. President...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Just to  -- just to finish, I think a lot of good things are going to happen, but I delayed my devaluations. Monetary, you know, on the monetary  --  the devaluations. My currency manipulations, and also my tariffs, for a period of a year, with China, because I wanted to get as much help as  --  as they could give us with respect to North Korea. That had an impact. So I delayed it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But there came time when I couldn't delay it anymore because it's too much money that they drain out of our country. Just too much money. That's where we are now. So I put 50  --  I hope you can cover this pretty much as I say it because you can't really cut it out. It's -- it's a story.
<Question> <Neutral> Mr. President, you told the Chinese  --  the Chinese say, 'Look, we're going to wait him out' because Xi is an autocrat, doesn't have to do midterm elections. He doesn't. He can...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He has his own election. He has a different kind of election.
<Question> <Negative> ... He can match it tariff by tariff. They think they're stronger. They think they can outlast you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh no, we're a much stronger  --  we are a much stronger country. We are much stronger.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody is waiting us out. Our country is stronger than it's ever been financially, and nobody is waiting us out. We're having the best numbers, and by the way, you look at the numbers, you know they adjusted 41 to 42 -- you saw that -- 40 -- you saw that -- 4.1 to 4.2.
<Question> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we have tremendous  --  we have tremendous numbers to come because these are real  --  this isn't like in the old days where you had a lot of numbers that didn't mean anything. You have tremendous potential, tremendous numbers to come. We have horrible, horrible trade deals that are going to be made into great trade deals.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The deal with Mexico, I don't know how you covered it, but that deal is jobs, farmers, keeping companies in this country and jobs in this country, bringing new companies back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, you have a group of people that won't like the deal I made with Mexico because they think it's wonderful when a company closes up and goes and builds someplace else in the world. They're called globalists. I'm not a globalist, OK? So it's a great deal. It's one  --  it's a great deal. And it's going to be good for both countries.
<Question> <Negative> Are you not going to deal with  --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, Canada is here right now. You know that.
<Question> <Neutral> Do you think you have a tentative deal? A tentative agreement?
<Question> <Negative> Could you tell us if tomorrow comes and goes, what happens to Canada? What will happen if Canada has...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think Canada's going to make a deal at some point. It may be by Friday, or it may be within a period of time. But ultimately they have no choice.
<Question> <Positive> Do you think that they've reached a tentative deal right now? Does Lighthizer have something cooking pretty close?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we're close to a deal, yes.
<Question> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They would love to make a deal. And I'm  --  and I'm happy with that.
<Question> <Neutral> Was part of the Mexico deal aimed at China? Because you look at  --  you look at...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Question> <Neutral> What about on the Mexico deal, was it aimed it China? You look at the Mexico deal, and there's a lot of thing that  --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> China's  --  well it was aimed at China in the sense that we will be making a lot of money  --  we will be taking in a lot more money and jobs that China won't be getting. So in that respect it was. But not only in China, it was aimed at many countries that, you know, were going in through Mexico and into a backdoor. They were coming in through a backdoor. So in that sense it was aimed at many countries that were taking advantage of the United States. The Mexico deal's an incredible deal. If you want to keep your companies here  --  look, I grew up where companies were leaving.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> NAFTA was the worst deal  --  one of the worst deals ever made. OK? There were numerous of them. The Iran deal, which, by the way, has had a major impact on Iran. When I came into Iran  --  when I came into here, it was a question of when would they take over the Middle East. Now it's a question of will they survive. It's a big difference in one and a half years.
<Question> <Negative> Is your goal with China, as a lot of Chinese think, actually to prevent China from becoming the world's No. 1 economy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, but it's  --  it's  --  it's a deal that will  --  again, the best thing that China and I have going  --  and  --  and the U.S. have going  --  is that President Xi and I have a really great relationship. OK?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That being said, he represents China; I represent us. We were going in the wrong direction. The United States  --  look, since the World Trade Organization, which was probably, I called  --  I called NAFTA the second-worst trade deal ever made. I would say the WTO was the single worst trade deal ever made.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if they don't shape up, I would withdraw from the WTO. We rarely won a lawsuit except for the last year. You know, in the last year, we're starting to win a lot. You know why? Because they know if we don't, I'm out of there. I'll take them out. We're starting to win lawsuits that we never  --  you know that. We never won lawsuits because the courts are stacked. You know they  --  it's sad. We have a minority on the courts.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, the WTO was a horrible deal. NAFTA was a  --  they were all bad deals. You know, we made a deal with South Korea; nobody talks about it. We made a deal with South Korea We took the horrible deal that was made by Hillary Clinton where she said 200,000 jobs will be produced  --  and she was right  --  for South Korea. They were produced for South Korea, not for us. OK?
<Question> <Positive> Would you  --  would you do a deal with Europe, who have come out this morning saying they would do cars  --  on autos, they would do zero tariffs with America. So, is that a good deal?...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not  --  it's not good enough, no.
<Question> <Negative> Not good enough, why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. Because they do a lot more auto business than we will ever do. In other words  --  well, first of all, it's not just tariffs; they also have barriers up to our cars. They have a -- they'll take the barriers down and they'll charge us no tax, but it's not good enough, because they will always sell more cars. Their cars  --  their habits, their consumer habits are to buying their cars  --  not to buying our cars.
<Question> <Negative> But you can't change that, surely. I'm not -- that's ... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... no. But  --  but no, but I want our  --  no, no, you're right...
<Question> <Positive> ... you have to set a level playing ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... they have a strength with cars, and we have a strength with agriculture and many other things. They won't let many of our products into Europe. So, the European  --  if you look at the  --  if you look at Europe, you look at the whole situation as to trade, OK, with Jean-Claude  --  the great Jean-Claude, who came here.
<Question> <Positive> Yes, I remember.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, I will tell you  --  but Jean-Claude. Look at the European Union  --  Union, it's as restrictive as any single country in the world -- including China. European Union doesn't let our agricultural products in. They have a wall. They don't even  --  it's not even a tariff; they have a wall. They don't want it. They don't let our agriculture  --  and they create, you know, standards that make it impossible because they have standards that --  that  --  like, with medical equipment, they created new standards so we can't get our medical equipment  --  not that the standards are higher.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's just that they're different. So, our companies can't  --  can't get the medical equipment into Europe. You know, the big medical equipment, like made by Philips and others.
<Question> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I said, 'you have to change your ways,' because the European Union is almost as bad as China, just smaller.
<Question> <Negative> But do you think you can outlast them as well?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely, they're dying to make a deal. Look, it's all about the cars. And the -- do you understand what I mean by that, Jennifer? It's all about the cars. We can talk steel -- and I've rebuilt the steel industry in this country in six months.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's rebuilt, it's -- when I say rebuilt, it's really rebuilding fast. You call up the head of U.S. Steel, chief executive officer, what's his name? Great guy. He's -- he's opening up six or seven plants, he's going to open up others, he's spending billions of dollars.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You call up Nucor  --  Nucor, call up the various steel companies. It's like -- it's like nobody can believe what's happening with this. So you guys haven't covered it?
<Dan Scavino> <Neutral> David Burritt.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Correct, correct.
<Question> <Negative> People are losing their jobs though on the aluminum tariffs and things like that. Is that -- does that worry you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know, the -- the aluminum business is doing much better. It was -- it was a dead business. There's so -- and I only charged 10 percent on that one because of that. It's a -- you know, it's -- it was a little more delicate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Steel is -- and I'll tell you what's going to happen with steel, they were dumping like nobody's ever seen dumping before. Historic dumping. And don't believe 2 percent by China. It was trans-shipping. You know, everyone's saying, well, China was only doing 2 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, China was doing 50 percent. What they were doing is they were trans-shipping steel to other countries that didn't even have steel plants and steel mills. They were sending them to countries that didn't even deal in steel, and these countries are dumping here because China didn't want people to know that they're sending us 50 percent and more.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So you understand what I mean by that, because every time I read an article it says, oh, but China only sends us 2 percent. I say give me a break, take a look at the countries where they're coming from.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Some countries don't even do steel and they're sending us 4 percent of the product. So -- so -- but -- but I have to say, the steel industry is -- is one of my pride and joys. I'm going tonight to Indiana, and I don't know if you saw the lines, the lines started forming today at 4 o'clock in the morning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They had 45,000 requests for -- for 8,000 or 9,000 seats. Is anybody going? Are you going tonight? It's going to be exciting.
<Question> <Negative> We have someone else on the plane. Justin Sink.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Have you heard what's going on there?
<Question> <Negative> No, they're going to take Air Force One with you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's going to be a pretty amazing evening, I think.
<Question> <Negative> You mentioned currency manipulation with China. Are you now prepared to call them a currency manipulator? You said you're –
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we're doing all the studies. No, we're -- it is a formula, and we are -- we are looking very strongly at the formula. As you look, as you see what's gone with the yuan, it's gone, you know, it's -- they're trying to make up for lack of business by cutting their currency. ​ It's no good. You can't do that. That's not, like, playing on a level playing field. And... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... and we're not being accommodated... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... by our Fed. You know? We're not being accommodated by our Fed. So they're doing the lowering interest ... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're doing, we're competing against not only  --  not only the yuan, we're competing against the euro. So they keep dropping, dropping, dropping...
<Question> <Positive> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... which, ultimately, is not good for them. But it is certainly good in the shorter term. And it lets them do some business that they wouldn't be doing. And it  --  it  --  it  --  not even close to nullifies. But it has a little bit of an impact on the tariffs.
<Question> <Negative> But with the  --  their currency going down is also a function of your one staying quite high. And do you think...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Question> <Positive> ... which is, as you say, partly linked to the Fed. Do you think the president should have the right to be able to approve or disapprove some of the Fed's decisions?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look. I put a man in there who I like, who I respect. And in private life, I always liked  --  in private life, please put it that way.... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In private life, I always liked a weak dollar and a low interest rate, OK? A strong dollar was only good if I wanted to buy Turnberry in Europe, in Scotland... [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... or if I wanted to buy Aberdeen or if I wanted to buy Doonbeg in Ireland. It was the only thing the strong dollar was good for. That was in my private life. And I did. I bought a lot of things when the dollar was very strong and the, you know, Ireland had crashed and Europe was crashing. I bought a lot of great stuff, including the great Turnberry, as you know, right?
<Question> <Positive> Yeah, yeah. Fantastic.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that's why I find  --  that's the only time I found the dollar to be  --  in my private life. As president, I feel a little bit differently. As president, there's something really nice-sounding about the fact that our dollar is so strong and so powerful. The bad news is that it makes life more difficult when you're looking to sell product to the rest of the world. And they are cutting their currencies very substantially, far more than they should be allowed to do. And we're not being accommodated. I don't like that. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> With that being said, I'm not sure that a currency should be controlled by a politician.
<Question> <Neutral> What do you mean by "we're not being accommodated"?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're not being accommodated by the Fed.
<Question> <Neutral> We meaning you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> When I say that, the country.
<Question> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we're doing tariffs, and we are in a war, in a sense, because we have been ripped off so badly by past presidents that should never have allowed this to happen. Last year, we lost $800 billion on trade. Because of bad trade deals.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not last year  --  for years. But we lost $800 billion on trade. How the hell do you do that? You know, more than half was with China.
<Question> <Neutral> But you say you don't think that policy should be...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I  --  I'm  --  I'm not --  look, my businesses have been very strong. I've done very well. I understand it. I think I understand it better than the so-called economists, where you  --  mostly, it's a flip a coin and pick. Is it heads or tails? They have no clue. But  --  but at the same time, I'm not sure that we should ever allow politicians to control very important things, you know, strong monetary policy, the things that the Fed right now controls.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But China is being accommodated because they can do whatever they want, and the euro is being accommodated because they basically do whatever they want, and we are not being accommodated at all by the trade.
<Question> <Negative> But you don't regret picking Jay Powell?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't regret. I think somebody else would maybe  --  what I'm saying is that we are fighting horrible trade deals that were made by people that were either incompetent or didn't care.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And  --  and I should be  --  I should be allowed  --  and  --  and they  --  and those  --  those countries are being accommodated by their monetary policy. Our country is not.
<Sarah Huckabee-Sanders> <Neutral> Sir, we have just a few more minutes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Leave it a little bit longer, it's fine. I actually find it intellectually stimulating. What time are we leaving for Indiana?
<Sarah Huckabee-Sanders> <Negative> About 3:45.
<Question> <Positive> Do you favor the idea of indexing capital gains?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm thinking about it. I'm thinking about it.
<Question> <Positive> Are you leaning towards liking it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, no, I - I  --  I just  --  there are a lot of people that love it; there's some people that don't. But I'm thinking about it very strongly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm also thinking about going, as you know, to a  --  to a half-time instead of a quarter-time for reporting and guidance.
<Question> <Positive> Yeah, any closer on that, on making a decision?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've asked Jay Clayton to look at it very strongly. He's looking at it. I like the concept, but I'll  --  I'll be relying  --  the only one that will be fighting us on that will be the accountants.
<Question> <Negative> Do you imagine that you would make a decision before the midterms on indexing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I  --  I don't want to say that, but it's something that a lot of people like. How do you feel about that  --  indexing?
<Question> <Neutral> In foreign countries, lots of people index.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Have you  --  have you taken a view on it, from Bloomberg?
<Question> <Negative> Bloomberg, I think, on the whole, we've  --  I don't  --  we haven't opposed it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hmm?
<Question> <Neutral> We haven't opposed it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Question> <Neutral> Most  --  most people, because...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's a stimulus.
<Question> <Positive> Yeah, and also, you  --  it's  --  out of the various tax things you can do, it's probably one of the more sensible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a lot of people  --  a lot of people like it.
<Question> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Some people don't.
<Question> <Positive> On Jeff Sessions, would it be fair to say that Jeff Sessions will be A.G. until at least the mid-terms?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would -- I would think so, yeah. I would think so.
<Question> <Neutral> Then how many days afterwards?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I don't -- I don't even want to get into it. Look. I just want people to do their jobs. I have a great cabinet. I'm really happy with my cabinet. I've made some replacements. Mike Pompeo's becoming a star. You look at my cabinet members, we have really great cabinet members. There are those that say this is the best cabinet ever assembled. We really have great -- and you've heard that, Sarah, too. We hear it a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We -- and we have great judges. I put on judges that -- when I got here, I had 145 openings. Nobody's ever had that before. And that was because something happened in the last three years of Obama where he didn't put judges on. I think they forgot. I really do, I believe they forgot. And there's nothing more -- you know, there's probably nothing more important -- other than war and peace, there's probably nothing more important.
<Question> <Negative> But on the other half of that is, maybe Jeff Sessions might not necessarily be safe after the midterms?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to comment on it. Look, I just would love to have him do a great job. And I'd love to have him look at the other side. And I have purposely -- and there's no reason for me to do this -- I could go and -- you know, I mean -- I'm allowed to do. You look at Article II, you look at whatever you want to look at, I'm allowed to be very much involved. This is just a witch hunt.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But -- but I will tell you that they should be looking at the other side. When you look at Ohr -- this is the last, you know -- Ohr and his wife. And his wife is getting -- Nellie -- and his wife is getting paid by Fusion. And Fusion's getting money from Russia and all this and nobody wants to look at that stuff, and you look at Strzok and his lover, Lisa Page, and you look at what went on there and the things that they were saying and the spying and the surveillance, and a hundred other things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at the lies of Comey, the horrible lies. You look at the lies of Brennan. Look at the lies he said. And why aren't they looking at that side? So I do question, you know, what is Jeff doing? Now -- and I just finish with this. I'll say this. There was no collusion. I think almost everybody, even in your business, is saying there just is no collusion. There were no Russians. If there were, you would have known about it. There was collusion between the Democrats and the DNC and Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do ask, why didn't the FBI take the server from the DNC? And why didn't they do it? They didn't take it. I mean, what kind of -- you mean they wouldn't give it, they wouldn't give it to them, they would not give their server. I mean, Jennifer, you've figured that one out too a long time ago. And I do say, Arwan from Pakistan, he had three servers, all with congressional medal -- congressional people. They just settled the case with him, they gave him nothing. And they -- and they never got the servers.
<Question> <Negative> But if you get -- if you get subpoenaed -- if you get subpoenaed by Mueller, would you -- would you comply with it? Or would you fight it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll see what happens.
<Question> <Negative> But you -- but it -- but it doesn't...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> See, I view it -- I view it differently. First of all.
<Question> <Negative> It doesn't sound as if you're going to go -- it doesn't sound as if you're going to go voluntarily. So, he would -- is it fair to say, he would have to subpoena?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I view it as an illegal investigation. It should've never been...
<Question> <Negative> So you wouldn't -- you wouldn't go?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...it should have been -- no, I'm not saying anything. I'm just telling you this, you read any of the great -- you read the great scholars, the great legal  --  there should have never been a special counsel. It shouldn't have been set up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Between all of the conflicts, and all of the -- all of the reasoning that turned out to be wrong, all of the corruption, all of the statements where Comey said in Congress that he -- he did things, and he leaked, and he did -- to get a special counsel and various other things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I'd just like to have Jeff Sessions do his job and if he did, I'd be very happy. But the job entails two sides, not one side. Now, I have not purposely, and not from any legal standpoint because from a legal standpoint, I'm allowed to get totally involved. But I have, purposely, not gotten involved. But, you know, at some point I guess that could change.
<Question> <Positive> Mr. President, there's -- there's been a lot of talk in Washington, this week, about your CFO from the Trump Organization, Mr. Weisselberg, accepting that immunity deal from prosecutors that delves into your finance -- your company's financial dealings.
<Question> <Negative> Whether you think he's betrayed you in any way, or that he -- he's.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, he's 100 percent -- 100 percent.
<Question> <Negative> A hundred percent not?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A hundred percent he didn't.
<Question> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A hundred percent. He's a -- he's a wonderful guy. It was a very limited, little period of time.
<Question> <Neutral> The $130,000. Did you -- did you know about that before the election?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't want to get into it because it's been covered so much. So, we won't get into that. Let's get into more important things. I can say this, there's no campaign violation whatsoever.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if you watch all of the good legal pundits, you'll see that. No campaign violation whatsoever. There is none. And most of them  --  other than fake news  --  admit that. There was no campaign violation.
<Question> <Negative> There are some in the legal community that say you could prove that if there was a pattern of Michael making payments over a long period of years, then  --  then it would be argued that it was --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Jennifer, there was no campaign violation  --  all of them.
<Question> <Positive> -- if those payments would have been to protect the Trump business brand.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All I'm saying is this  --  every lawyer that everybody's spoken to said there's no campaign violation. So.
<Question> <Negative> Not every lawyer.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, other than the fake news --
<Question> <Negative> The federal prosecutors.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- of which there was, there was quite a bit. Go ahead. Next question.
<Question> <Positive> Should ask you about  --  should ask you about Google  --  jumping in obviously on doing business, you  --  you look at, wherever I go  --  the stock market  --  the stock market's being propelled by these big tech companies, you wander around the world, and wherever you go, foreigners say, we'd love to have companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Question> <Negative> But you've spent quite a lot of time attacking them. Is that  --  do you  --  do you worry at all about American capitalism ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, not at all, because this is  --  this is the engine for everybody. Without this country it doesn't work. No, I don't at all and I think they have to treat people fairly.
<Question> <Neutral> So, it's just  --  it's a pure  --  it's a pure thing to do, what they do on their media sides, rather than the business as a whole?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Question> <Positive> You think Google is a good business, you think ...
<Question> <Negative> What about the  --  on the business, you  --  all these guys, as I said, you know, the  --  this is  --  this is the American  --  this is what people think American capitalism is about. It  --  do you  --  do you not feel bad about that ... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, if  --  if you look  --  if you look, the conservatives have been treated very unfairly. I can tell you from my years, I  --  I think very few people  --  I guess, Dan, what do we have now total on the various ...
<Dan Scavino> <Neutral> ... 100  --  155 million, 160 million ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Dan Scavino> <Neutral> Between on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, Whitehouse.gov, all combined.
<Question> <Neutral> What would you let your ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. If you add them up. So, and we really get a good picture of what's going on. And I'll tell you, there are some moments where we say, wow, that really is bad what they're doing. You know, we just put something up yesterday on Google --
<Question> <Positive> Yeah, I saw that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- where they were promoting Obama, Obama, Obama  --  the day I got to office for the same event, which was the State of the Union speech, the day I got to office, they  --  it was like, dead.
<Question> <Negative> Would you  --  could you  --  would you want to break up Google or break up Bezos?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can't  --  I won't  --  I won't comment on that. I can't comment.
<Question> <Neutral> It almost makes me think you're thinking about it.
<Question> <Negative> Wait, why are you saying you can't comment?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Can't comment.
<Question> <Negative> Do you see it as a utility?
<Question> <Neutral> It's something that's crossed your mind?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just can't comment. No, I don't want to say that either. I just  --  I won't comment on the breaking up of  --  whether it's that or Amazon or  --  or Facebook.
<Question> <Neutral> Do you think that's...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> As you know, many people think it  --  it is a very antitrust situation, the three of them. But I just  --  I won't comment on that.
<Question> <Negative> People are going to read into that no comment, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, what  --  what can I do? I can't  --  I just can't comment.
<Question> <Neutral> I  --  I think we have  --  can we, can we go to our speed round?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Are you worried about a speed round, Sarah?
<Sarah Huckabee-Sanders> <Neutral> Not with you, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let's go. [Laughter]
<Question> <Positive> OK, speed round. Is Emmet Flood going to be the next White House counsel?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a man I really like and respect. He's doing a great job.
<Question> <Negative> Is he the frontrunner?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to say that. I don't want to comment on that.
<Question> <Neutral> Are there more than one possibility right now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to comment on it, but I have  --  I can tell you this, everybody wants the job. Everybody wants it but I  --  I just don't want to comment on it.
<Question> <Negative> If America was attacked by  --  if there is a terrorism attack, which foreign leader would you call first?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's an interesting  --  I guess it depends on where the attack took  --  took place --
<Question> <Neutral> Imagine --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- and who made the attack. But  --  but I...
<Question> <Neutral> -- imagine it's  --  it's in  --  it's in New York. It's in New York, which  --  which  --  which --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'll tell you what, I think I have a lot --
<Question> <Positive> Who do you trust and admire?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I  --  I think I trust a lot of them. I  --  I have a great relationship. Sarah, you see it, you go with me. Dan, you see it. I have a great relationship with a lot of foreign leaders, I think a really great relationship with really a lot.
<Question> <Neutral> Angela Merkel?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think I would have a very good  --  I have a very good relationship with Angela Merkel. An excellent relationship. I just disagree. I don't think she should be buying oil for Russia  --  from Russia. I don't think that, you know, she should be paying 1 percent and we're paying 4.3 percent for NATO. You know, I have a lot of disagreements with her.
<Question> <Negative> But have you  --  but have you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> At the same time, I have a great relationship with her, and I like her and she likes me.
<Question> <Neutral> Have you told her --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And  --  and by the way, I think --
<Question> <Negative> Have you told her that she shouldn't buy  --  she shouldn't buy the oil?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I told her I think it's ridiculous that you have a NATO to protect yourself from a certain country and then you're paying a fortune to that certain country. I said what kind of a deal is that?
<Question> <Negative> But if you had one phone call, there's a big terrorist attack in New York City and you've got to call a foreign leader, who would it be?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to say because I'll be insulting a lot of other foreign leaders, honestly.
<Question> <Positive> OK, fair enough.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I really  --  I have  --  I have mostly great relationships, including until recently Turkey. I have a very good relationship with Erdogan, but he let me down because of the pastor. We'll see what happens, by the way.
<Question> <Negative> If he doesn't  --  if he doesn't hand over the pastor, should you  --  should NATO  --  should  --  should Turkey be kicked out of NATO?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're going to see what happens. I  --  I think...
<Question> <Neutral> Would you  --  would you consider that as an option?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to comment on it, because it's  --  it's  --  it's a subject that is  --  it's too dear to my heart. I don't want to comment on it. But...
<Question> <Positive> Is there a chance you might --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I will  --  I will tell you, I'm disappointed in him. You know, I got back somebody for him, as you know.
<Question> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And to be honest with you, I'm very disappointed in him. But we'll see how it all works out. I think it'll work out fine.
<Question> <Positive> Is there a chance you might meet Kim in  --  in New York for the UN General Assembly?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know that he's coming. I really don't. But I have a good relationship with him, and it's  --  it  --  Isn't it nice to have a good relationship? And I was going to tell you before, I think I'd have a very good relationship with Putin, but the Russian rigged witch hunt gets  --  you know, gets in the way of that. It makes it very difficult. It's a very bad thing for our country.
<Question> <Negative> If Kim decided to come to the UN in September, it  --  would you be ready to have that meeting, or does he need to show you a little more?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm  --  I'm ready  --  I'm always ready for a meeting.
<Question> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think meetings are good. Not bad. I think talk is good. I think  --  I think dialogue between two countries is a good thing, not a bad thing. Now there may be instances where that wouldn't be so, but very rarely.
<Question> <Positive> Mr. President, as you know, of course John McCain's remains are on  --  on  --  on their way back to Washington now. You had an opportunity to unite the country this week. I'm just wondering if you felt like you screwed it up?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think I did at all. I  --  I've  --  I've done everything that they requested, and no, I don't think I have at all. You know, we had our disagreements and they were very strong disagreements. I disagreed with many of the things that I assume he believed in. But with that being said, I respect his service to the country.
<Question> <Positive> Would he  --  would McCain have been a better president than Obama?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to comment on it. I have a very strong opinion on it.
<Question> <Positive> Ooh. We would love to know. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have a very strong... [Crosstalk]
<Question> <Negative> That's not  --  that's not a terrible question, that...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a very strong  --  Sarah, she's just having a nervous breakdown. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a very strong opinion on it.
<Question> <Negative> But you want to  --  you want to keep that to yourself.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Maybe I'll give you that answer someday later. Yes. But I have a very strong opinion on that.
<Sarah Huckabee-Sanders> <Positive> Time for one more.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, one more.
<Question> <Negative> What about Paul Ryan? Would Republicans in the House do better if Paul Ryan were to step down as speaker early?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd  --  look, here's  --  I like Paul Ryan. I actually get along very well with him. I've had a much better relationship with Paul Ryan than people understand. And I do like him. And that's all going to work out. You know, that's all going to work out.
<Question> <Negative> But would the House Republicans do better with --  [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're going to have to see how we do.
<Question> <Negative> Jim Jordan? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think, frankly, and  --  and I like all of these  --  you know, I guess you have the  --  primarily the two, right? You have Kevin and you have Jim, both fantastic people. So we'll have to see how it all works out. But I've had a -- I've had a very good relationship with Paul Ryan.
<Question> <Negative> OK. So no need for him to clear out before his term's up?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I -- look, right now, people are focused on the midterms. I don't think they're thinking about a speaker because it's really going to be depending on the midterms. I hope that we're going to be in a position where we have to worry about a speaker.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we're going to do really well in the Senate, and I think we're going to do, frankly, well in the House, because in the history of our country, we've never had a better economy.
<Question> <Negative> How many are you going to win by? How many will Republicans win by?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't want to -- I don't want to predict because then if I -- if I'm wrong, you're going to say, "Oh, he's devastated" -- you're going to say, "He's devastated that they didn't win."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I don't want to do that, but I think we're going to do well. Now I'm betting against history because if you look at history, like literally, over 150 years, for whatever reason, when you have the president, that party doesn't do very well in the midterms. I don't know why.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The advantage we have is -- I am actually a very popular president, which people don't like to say, you know. In fact, I guess the Republican poll came out, there's one at 92 and one at 93 and one at 90, and they're the highest numbers that have ever been, with the exception of a tiny period of time with a bullhorn. But that period lasted for about a week.
<Question> <Negative> But do you -- do you feel -- do you feel frustrated? Do you -- you have a -- the economy, as you say, is growing, end of the longest bull market, all those things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Question> <Negative> And yet you're going into a midterm election and most -- most people wrongly or rightly, fake news, real news, whatever, expect you to lose the House, but it feels --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, my personal polls --
<Question> <Negative> Do you feel annoyed about the --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, my personal polls are very good. When you look at -- but the question is, will they transfer over to people getting out and voting? So if I were running -- and you people know this better, that it seems like nobody comes close. I dream about the people that are running. I hope it's that same group. I hope they don't change the group. I like the group. They're great now. You know, take your top 10.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But -- but if I were running, people come out and vote. I saw today on Fox, they're in Indiana, and the level of -- of love is just a beautiful thing to watch, and I speak to people, and that's around the country. They're happy because the economy is so good. Their 401(k)s are through the roof, et cetera, et cetera. The question is whether or not it's going to transfer. Now I'm going to work hard, and I'm going to be out campaigning for a lot of people. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, literally, before -- not for any reason, before -- just before, here look, all these people are, you know, running, literally before -- John James is going to be very interesting in Michigan, by the way. It's going to be a very interesting thing.
<Question> <Positive> Montana's going to be interesting, too?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll tell you one quick story than we'll finish. So I'm watching television, and I see this young woman on television. I say, "Who's that?" "Oh, she's campaigning against Joe."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know who Joe is, right? So Queens. Crowley. So I say "Ah, let me just watch her for a second" -- wonderful thing, TiVo. So you go back -- "huh, tell him he's going to lose."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, I don't agree with her views, her views are terrible, but that's Cortez. To just put -- to use one term. I had a similar thing in Michigan. I was watching an event and I see a man campaigning, a good looking African-American man who is making a beautiful speech, talking about his military service, his leadership, his flying the Apache helicopters.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said "Stop that for a second, go back, I want to see that." I watched him, I said "He's a potential star." And as you know, he was down and I endorsed him -- spoke to him, I endorsed him and he's doing really well against an opponent that wasn't really on the list of potentials, right? And I think John James is going to be very interesting, I think. Watch him.
<Question> <Negative> Are those Democrats --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've been very good at this stuff. Hey -- hey, you know, you look at -- you look at Ron DeSantis. You look at Donovan on Staten Island, he's 10 down just before the election and he wins the election by 25.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean there are many of those instances, not just a few. You look at -- you look at the Republican nominee from -- for governor of Georgia. He was down, he won 70 percent to 30 percent.
<Question> <Positive> Right...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He won by -- he won by 40 points.
<Question> <Positive> What about Cuomo and Cynthia Nixon? Who wins out of those two?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Cuomo's going to win.
<Question> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Cuomo's going to win.
<Question> <Negative> Do -- if Democrats pull off what they're trying to do and take over the House, and if they were to try to impeach you, do you believe that that would cripple your ability to govern or do you --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't think --
<Question> <Positive> -- think it would help your re-election?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think they can impeach somebody -- even if that happened, I mean I'll go against the wisdom. Even if that happened, I don't think they can impeach somebody that's doing a great job.
<Question> <Negative> But do you think it would hurt your re-election bid or do you think it would help your re-election bid?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I -- I don't know, I have no opinion on it. I just don't think they can do it if -- look, I'm doing a great job. You look at the economy, you look at jobs, you look at foreign -- what's going on with other countries, you look at trade deals.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm doing a great job. I don't think that -- because if they could do that, here's what would happen: you get elected president and your House is the opposite party, and every time you get elected president, they're going to impeach the person.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That can't work. In other words, because of the division that you have now that -- that you know -- that you've had. Here's somebody -- is this the most divisive you've seen it? No, Clinton was worse. I said what about Obama? No, Obama wasn't as bad as Clinton.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm saying to myself, you know, it's sort of interesting but they say there were years in the Clinton years that were far worse than this. And it's very interesting.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know we think of this, then of course they can also go back and say how about the Civil War. That was pretty bad too.
<Question> <Negative> That's a low  --  that's a low barrier. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, Civil War.
<Question> <Negative> Can you get out of Afghanistan?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But  --  but I just  --  I do want to say this  --  I do want to say this and that will be the last but what that would mean, I'm doing a great job. And fair people would say you look at foreign relations, you look at what's going on, you look at so many  --  look at  --  look at labor. I mean labor loves me. I won the labor vote. You look at those people in line today... [Crosstalk]
<Question> <Negative> Don't forget your wall though.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Huh?
<Question> <Positive> You got to get your border wall. I hope you have some creative ideas for... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh no, the wall's happening. By the way, I've already started the wall.
<Question> <Positive> Do you have some creative ideas for paying for it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a lot of creative ideas for the wall. But just so you understand, I got $1.6 billion in spent. We have another $1.6 billion now. We're building. We're building actually 80 miles of the wall right now. The wall is already started.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know the  --  as you know it's in San Diego. It's almost complete all up San Diego in a very bad stretch and we're building the wall in the bad stretches. You know the stretches. But just so you understand, so you get elected as a Republican or a Democrat and the opposite party gets put into the House.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That would mean, oh, let's impeach him. Can't do it. If you look at the definition of impeachment that's a  --  that's a high bar and that would take a long time to fight that if you're doing a good job. And I'm doing a great job. Somebody said what do you grade yourself? I said an A+. Other than that, enjoy yourselves. OK.
<Question> <Positive> Thank you.
<Question> <Positive> Thank you, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Say hello to Michael.
<Question> <Positive> Thank you. Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Take care of yourselves. Thank you very much.
