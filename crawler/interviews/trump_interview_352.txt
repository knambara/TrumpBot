<Larry King> <Positive> Donald Trump. What can one say about Donald Trump. He is young. He is brash. He's very rich and above all famous. You hear his name everywhere these days, in all the New York papers. Well, earlier this month he published $85,000 in advertisements, why? In the wake of the brutal Central Park rape, Trump was calling for the restitution of New York's death penalty.
<Larry King> <Positive> Some questioned his political aspirations. Two weeks later he was in the news again, lashing out a rival real estate tycoon Leona Helmsley getting tie, just listen to this. And then there's the beautifully refurbished Trump Plaza, the opulent Trump tower. Maybe even his own airline. The Trump shuttle for weekends sailing on the Trump Princess.
<Larry King> <Positive> Not to mention the casinos, the bicycle race, the 200 Trump, his book and now a board game, "Trump: The Game". And guess whose face is on the money? What can you do next? What can -- how can you really Donald top you? I mean what --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well --
<Larry King> <Negative> -- what could you possibly do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know. Your shows other than me somewhat of a story, every time I come to your show I saw a lot of books. So --
<Larry King> <Positive> We're making you famous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're making me famous.
<Larry King> <Negative> No. Are you thinking of going beyond this coast? I mean, it would seem the New York and Atlantic City have now crowded in.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm involved in the West Coast. I have a lot of property out in California and it has been great. But, you know, generally the East Coast is what I have, Larry.
<Larry King> <Negative> But why all the -- lets go -- why a board game?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Do you mind if I sit back a little bit --
<Larry King> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- because your breath is very bad, it really is. Has this ever been told you before?
<Larry King> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK, then I won't bother. No, actually --
<Larry King> <Negative> That's how you get the edge.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me tell you one thing.
<Larry King> <Negative> See, that little thing you threw me right then and no one has ever told me that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Has nobody told you that? Sharon hasn't said it? You're kidding.
<Larry King> <Negative> Nobody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK.
<Larry King> <Negative> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, your breath is great.
<Larry King> <Positive> OK. A board game. Why a board game?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Charity, Larry, we came out with it. It's been a fantastic success. It just started and has really been a fantastic success. We probably will raise millions of dollars for charity with the game itself and that's really the soul and exclusive reason.
<Larry King> <Negative> That's a monopoly kind of game?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's a monopoly kind of a game, but it's a game that's done very well in the stores. It just, you know, it's come out four or five weeks ago. It's become the number one game of the country and it raise so much money already for charity. And that is the reason the soul --
<Larry King> <Positive> But I mean for you, Donald, there are wealthy people, active people, people who get involved in many things. But not many people a board games named after them, and we're -- I mean that's got to be something in you. Maybe tonight we'll find out what that is that most guys would say, I'll write you a check, forget a board game, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Well, for me I had the time. I think what happened is the book has become so successful. And I have to give you credit for that to a certain extent. I came in the show and the book and I don't know how much.
<Larry King> <Negative> Yes. But that --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But no, no, I tell you what, the book was number one for many, many weeks and as the book started to fade, you happen to call me. You had no other guess that particularly. And you sit down and you do me a favor and be my guest. I was and the book shut immediately up to number one. I mean, really it does tell me something to be perfectly honest.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What happened is they follow the book in the success of the book and the book was I guess one of the biggest selling books, literally of the decade of the last 10 years. And the Milton Bradley Company came to me they saw me. There, a group of very talented people and they said we really want to do this game.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We did a lot of research on the game, they did, and then they presented me lots of alternatives.
<Larry King> <Negative> But that's the appeal of something like that is unique to you. Don't you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think.
<Larry King> <Negative> Of course they wouldn't have come to a lot of business man.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you took the same game and you put somebody else's name on. I suspect it would not be the number one game in the country right now.
<Larry King> <Negative> Correct. I suspect so too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, for whatever reason.
<Larry King> <Negative> You have succeeded in this and you also like it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I enjoy it. I don't know if I like. I enjoy what I'm doing. I enjoy a creative process. If I come out with a book or if I come with the game, whatever I come out with whether it's a building or -- but even if I got down to a game or book, I want that book to be number one, I'd like to see that book be number one.
<Larry King> <Positive> Is this for one of a bit a term driven. Are you driven?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think I'm driven. I just enjoy what I do. I've always enjoyed as you know because, I mean, we know each other and you know how much I enjoyed. I enjoy life. I enjoy really the thrill of it all. It's been a lot of fun. It's been a kick and I want to keep it going. I like keeping it going. I enjoy waking up in the morning going to work.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> To me, work is play when I start in the morning, when I start early in the morning. I really look forward to getting to work. A lot of people don't feel that way. I mean I go to a vacation. I'm a basket case after period of time because I'm just, you know, I want to get back, I want to make calls, I want to do -- I enjoy the creative process.
<Larry King> <Positive> And that creative process is what? I mean could it be thumbtacks if we will finding --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it could be. But it's, you know, in a way life is war and it's -- it said --
<Larry King> <Negative> Life is war.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- in many respects. I mean, my life is really lots of challenges, a series of challenges and that's the aspect of life that I really enjoy. I look for instance at what's happening with the country with Japan and with West Germany, and so many other countries taken advantage of the United States, it drives me crazy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hate to see it because it shouldn't be happening. But I see so many different elements of problem, so many -- absolutely so many different elements of problem with this country now. I'm looking at arising dollars. So now all of a sudden Japan is going to be very happy, West Germany is going to be very happy because they are going to be able to manufacture and sell us everything and get the money back into the --
<Larry King> <Negative> Our dollar keeps rising by the way why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, our dollar is rising now because we're not doing anything about it. Frankly, we will start it to be able to compete as a nation with the lower dollar. I mean, a lower dollar sounds bad, but in actuality it's not bad in terms of manufacturing and other things in the country. Japan became a wealthy nation by having a lower yen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now it's switching and the dollars going up again and nobody says anything about --
<Larry King> <Negative> And why does Donald Trump care?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm a proud American. I mean I have a great feeling for this country, Larry. I love this country. I think it's a great country and I just hate to see us as Americans being ripped off by so many other countries.
<Larry King> <Negative> It's a rip off.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the world is ripping off the United States.
<Larry King> <Negative> Couldn't the Japanese say well were a lot like Donald Trump over here. We're very competitive. We want to build a better car build, build a taller building, built a better [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I sort of use this every once and awhile, I say I have a friend whose name is Carl Icahn and he's a very tough guy, a very smart guy. He's not a particularly nice person and he's not, you know, the greatest personnel, I mean, the world in that sense. He's a smart, brilliant businessman. And I often say what are we use Carl or somebody like other, 10 other, 15 other, 20 other people, why don't we use these people to negotiate with the Japanese, as opposed to using people that really do not have that level of talent?
<Larry King> <Neutral> Like State Department types.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well like State Department types, like various types.
<Larry King> <Negative> Do you think we should utilize our capitalist more?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think we should use the blames in the country to do what this supposed to do. I mean, if I had Carl Icahn and I will now he might be insulting to the Japanese. He might literally draw a picture of water on. But I can tell you say, Carl just go and do it. At the end of the period of time, these countries going to end up the winner in that particular negotiation.
<Larry King> <Negative> Because we don't use our best.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Larry, you send and you go to Japan and try and open up a business in Japan as an American, it's a virtual impossibility. I have tremendous respect for the Japanese what they've been able to do because they have systematically ripping off this country, you can respect. You don't have to say oh, they're horrible but they're not horrible people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're very smart people. Systematically they are ripping off this country and it's a shame West Germany is even worse. I mean, there so many other countries that are taking advantage of America and the United States, and I just hate for one, I hate to see it.
<Larry King> <Negative> More talk about with Donald Trump. This is Larry King Live. Still to come, Jackie Mason, don't go away. [Commercial Break]
<Larry King> <Negative> Our special guest Donald Trump, if I have to tell you who he is, you have a major problem. This is a Larry King Live. You mentioned Carl Icahn that makes one thinks of airlines. Where do we stand as of right now on Trump and the eastern shuttle?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't know if we're going to get it. I have a bid in at $365 million, is another company that came along in nonunion company that is willing to pay substantially less salaries, and they very well could get it because they're willing to pay a lot more money. If you wanted to void all of the jobs of a lot of good people that have work there for a long period of time, and go nonunion you can afford to pay a higher price.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know it's not a very strong company financially. I don't know if they're going to be able to raise their financing if they get their financing they've got --
<Larry King> <Negative> You might lose it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I get an $8 million fee for having gone through the efforts, so it's not a --
<Larry King> <Negative> What I mean is that, who decides this, the bankruptcy referee or Eastern Air Lines?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Te bankruptcy judge will decide ultimately. Eastern Air Lines will make a recommendation. The creditors will make a recommendation, but I guess I did one thing that really turned out to be right. I didn't want to be as talking was, because oftentimes that happens. It happens with you. It happens with me. It happens with a lot of people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to be stalking horse and go into court and here's my bid and it sitting out there waiting for everyone to shoot at. I said "Look, I'll do that but I want to be paid a fee if somebody else comes along". So I get an $8 million fee if somebody else should come along, which really differs and pays for more trust.
<Larry King> <Negative> But you're saying the work is not going to be screwed if you don't get it right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I mean you're going to have people that are good people and they've worked there for a long period of time and they're going to have jobs. They're going to be throwing out in the streets and I think you can have rights in the streets. You want to know the truth. I think to come into New York, Boston or Washington, as a total nonunion operation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think you're going to have a problem and literally you're going to have rights in the street. I can and of course they can pay more because they're going to pay the people much less money. So I can imagine this happening, but it's very possible that it will.
<Larry King> <Negative> Really? You know, if you had taken a gut bet, are you going to get the airline?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say that if they come up with a financing I won't get the airline. But I'm not sure that they'll be able to come up --
<Larry King> <Negative> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- with the financing.
<Larry King> <Positive> Well, you -- I remember once to talking to someone in Atlantic City who are believed -- yes. He park cars [Inaudible] and he said how great it was to work for you. There's no kidding. Are you someone who believes in that adage that you get what you pay for that you are willing to pay well that should treat the employees with?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well --
<Larry King> <Negative> That, you know, the kind of the books we read about that the most successful people and the people who care most about the people who work for them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I believe in that. I don't know if you necessarily get what you pay for because I have people that pay a lot of money that total steps. And I have people pay less and they're wonderful. So I don't think the edits you get what you pay for. It sounds good, but it's not necessarily true.
<Larry King> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do believe in treating your worker is good. I believe in treating them better than good and make them happy. I think one of the keys to my success is that I've been able to motivate people to work for me and enjoy it. And I have a good company. And then I have built up in a fairly short period of time, a great company.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I have a really great people. I've dedicated great hard-working people. That's why when I see a company coming in and bidding more because they're going to pay much less and get rid of everybody that's been on a certain line for many, many years. I think it's very --
<Larry King> <Positive> Can it -- is a great company, a great company, and a kind of a great company. Therefore also be a great airline company.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure. I mean a great airline --
<Larry King> <Positive> And you could run any kind of company.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think if a man can be successful at one thing or woman can be successful at one thing, he or she can be very successful at another. I really believe that, especially when you hitting and doing well in New York. New York is a very, very competitive, tough place, there's nothing like it in the world, there's nothing like it to get the juices flowing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's an incredibly competitive when you hit you really hit. But it's an incredibly tough and competitive environment in place. And I really believed for a long time that when people make it, they generally can make it anywhere, et cetera, et cetera. When you make it in New York, you really can just about go anywhere in the world and you can do very nice.
<Larry King> <Positive> What throughout the Yobro [Inaudible] thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think Peter got very lucky in many respects because I thought he was paying a very high price. Peter Yobro was a friend of mine and he's a good guy and I think he really was paying a very high price for what he was getting.
<Larry King> <Negative> Nor he couldn't have made that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, you know, luck is oftentimes very good. Peter is a talented guy in this particular case he was really taking over a can of worms. And I think he got very lucky when he when he did not get the airline.
<Larry King> <Negative> What's wrong with Lorenzo?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've always said I was getting myself into trouble for saying it. I'll never forget I was sitting in a in a car with a driver and I was saying to people that, you know, Frank is actually a very introverted guy. It's -- He's, in my opinion, a very decent man. He has an incredible relationship with his wife and his kids and this and that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But somehow he doesn't really project. He doesn't project on television. He perhaps wouldn't come on your show and do a show and explained that he's a decent guy, et cetera, et cetera. He has had tremendous, tremendous conflict. You know, we're talking about management a part of that management is in fact now with employees.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you have to understand, he took over an airline that was devastated for years before he took it over. Eastern Air Lines, it wasn't like he took over something that was successful and all of a sudden it went down the old tubas. Eastern Air Lines was a major failure prior to his taking it over. When it ultimately ended up having to file for bankruptcy he got blamed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I don't say, I'm not going to be a defender of Frank because, you know, the one thing that I would say is that, I wish Frank were able to get along better with his employees, but -- and maybe make deals with unions and get along with him so that he could make deals. Frank got a lot of tremendous talent.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a great deal man he really is.
<Larry King> <Negative> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, you know, there is the old expression all action, et cetera, et cetera. Frank is literally his all action and no words. He's the man he acts. He doesn't convey what he wants to do. And in one sense, it's good but it's very negative in terms of getting along with his employees.
<Larry King> <Negative> That be taught him, do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm not sure that it can be taught anyone. You know, I largely believe that you are born a certain way, you have certain abilities. I mean, you have an incredible ability for doing this, for doing something else, perhaps not, you know. And when you were born. I mean you just had a certain ability.
<Larry King> <Negative> And Frank doesn't have that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he doesn't have that aspect of it. He does not. I mean historically he hasn't been able to get along with --
<Larry King> <Negative> Sort of he would -- you have trouble hiring, you got like that, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think --
<Larry King> <Negative> Even though he won't be able to make it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, no. I think Frank is a brilliant man in many respects. I think he's a tremendous negotiator. I really believe that. And he's a fantastic negotiator. He's got --
<Larry King> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Everybody has short, you know, shortcomings. We all do, I do. I can tell you that.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Is Eastern going to make it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think he's Eastern is in a lot of trouble. I think that they will probably make it as Frank said. You know, frankly --
<Larry King> <Neutral> Small company?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- in what's happened is if this all carries through, Frank is really a very big winner because he would have quote "defeat of the unions." The unions would have been defeated in this. He'll have a smaller perhaps nonunion company. But he would have defeated the unions.
<Larry King> <Negative> Your airline will be called the what? The Trump Shuttle?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It'll be the Trump Shuttle, yes.
<Larry King> <Negative> We're going to comeback and we'll talk about that incredible series of ads run by Donald Trump after the wilding attack in Central Park. This is Larry King Live, don't go away. [Commercial Break]
<Larry King> <Negative> After that terrible attack in Central Park, you spent a lot of money taking ads that seem Donald to the casual reader insightful like vigilante, wow. Let's fight back. Want to give me a little history?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I mean, I don't see anything insightful. I am strongly in favor the death penalty. I'm also in favor bringing back police forces that can do something instead of just turning that back because every quality lawyer that represents people that are in troubles said the first thing they do is shouting police brutality, et cetera.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The edge of -- I've never done anything that's caused in more positive stir. I've had 15,000, 15,000 letters in the last week and a half. I don't know of more than two or three that were negative out of 15,000. The ads are basically a very strong and vocal. They are saying bring back law and order to our cities.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm not just referring to New York, I'm referring to everything. The disappointing aspect of it is that, well 95 percent of the people agree with me, probably 40 percent of the columnists agree. I mean, I've had newspaper people. In fact, I had some woman the other day stick a microphone in my face. One of the major networks, but don't you have compassion for these young men that raped, and beat, and mugged and everything else this wonderful woman.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I had a case the other day. I went to a hospital in Brooklyn. A woman was raped, mugged, and thrown off a four-story building. OK. And a reporter asked me whether or not I had any compassion or feeling for the people that did it? Do I have hatred for them? And I said, "Look, this woman was raped, mugged, and thrown off a building." Thrown off a building, on top of everything else, she's virtually -- I mean, she's got some major problems to put it. I said, "Of course, I hate these people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And let's all hate these people because maybe hate is what we need if we're going to get something done". I mean, it's incredible when a reporter asks me whether or not I have compassion for the people that did this crime. I have absolutely no compassion.
<Larry King> <Negative> Obviously. How about if we were ask this way? We don't know who did that crime and the court is going to decide who did that crime. Were you prejudging those arrested in that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm not prejudging at all. I'm not in this particular case. I'm saying if they're found guilty, if the woman died, which she hopefully will not be dying, but if the woman died I think they should be executed. I think they-- you should have the death penalty. I think most people agree with me on that.
<Larry King> <Negative> Was the head, careful to say if because they could have been a [Inaudible] someone wrong can be arrested.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You can drive anything. I mean, it's a fairly long ad. It was fairly detailed and all. And you can take any interpretation with some people said does this mean for minors. They weren't sure because the ad didn't spell it out. It doesn't mean for minors, but they said, but does he include minors? Of course some of these minors are, you know, 15, 16 years old.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They're 6"1', they weight 240 pound.
<Larry King> <Negative> We're you saying that the perpetrator of that act should die, is that what you're saying?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The --
<Larry King> <Negative> The perpetrator of that act.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- perpetrator if the woman died --
<Larry King> <Neutral> If the woman dies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- and the perpetrator should die. There's no question about it. If there at a certain age, if they're minors they should be treated very strongly. Now, the problem is so many crimes today are being committed by 15-, and 16-, and 17-year-old so-called kids. And they go away for six months and they go away for a year to a reform school and then they get out and they're out to do it again.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Something has to be done and it has to be done quickly. Those so- called kids have to be put in a very, very secure and solid prison system for many years. If somebody 17 years old and rapes and kills, that person cannot be out on the streets in six months. And that is what's happening in our society. There's something wrong with our society.
<Larry King> <Negative> Is New York City considered one of the best police forces in the country and one of the highest paid police?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have some very good talent. Larry, we have some great talent but the talent is turning its back because they don't want to lose their wives, their pensions, their houses, as they're being accused every time for police brutality. I mean, you see it all the time. People are turning their backs. The police office are great if they are allowed to do their job, but they are afraid to do their job because as soon as they do something they arrest somebody it's immediately police brutality and that has to starving.
<Larry King> <Negative> Do you think you have frightened police force in New York?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh please don't question about it. Larry --
<Larry King> <Negative> It is like the police --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- they make a move on somebody that they seem doing something that's against the law, and then two days later they are charge with police brutality, and they spend the next two years of their life trying to defend their jobs, knowing that if their jobs are gone, their houses are gone, their wife might be gone, their everything else might be gone.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's ruining and these people are afraid. We have a wonderful -- potentially wonderful police force. The people on the police force are great. The problem we have is we don't have any protection for the policeman. The problem with our society is that the victim has absolutely no rights and the criminal has unbelievable rights, unbelievable rights, and I say it has to stop.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's why I took the ad and I have to tell you, that ad I have never done anything that's been so positively received. People are tired, sick and tired of what's happening.
<Larry King> <Neutral> There also those who think that Donald Trump wants to run for office someday?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I tell you what, I enjoy. you know how much I enjoy what I'm doing. We know I'm still trying to sell this guy in a pop and he's done a viable -- what can I tell you. But I love what I'm doing and I do it well. I --
<Larry King> <Negative> Would rather do what you do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I have a much greater freedom now. I can do what I want to do pretty much. And if you do the other, you're under constraint and you're under, you know, it's a whole different --
<Larry King> <Negative> You're active though. I'm sure -- I mean you support people you like.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Support. I like certain candidates, I support certain candidates, I fight against other candidates if I don't think they're doing good job. You know, I have a big stake in the country, I have a big stake in New York. I have a big stake a lot of places. and I really fight hard. When I believe in someone or something, I fight very hard.
<Larry King> <Negative> You think you're going to change police attitude?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will tell you so many policemen, I walked down the street. So many policemen saying, "We love it, Mr. Trump. We love it". I wasn't sure if that ad would be offensive to policemen, I have to tell you.
<Larry King> <Positive> Yes, I'm sure at that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was the one thing, frankly. And I really wasn't sure. I have found out that it wasn't because essentially I'm saying the police are not doing their job. But I'm saying, why they're not doing their job? And so many policemen and women have come to me. I mean, literally called written letters and when walking down the street, the response is 100 percent, they know what's right.
<Larry King> <Negative> We have some more moments with Donald Trump, and then we'll meet Jackie Mason who is an extraordinary gentleman. We'll talk about the 200 Trump, the recently concluded 10-day bicycle race. We'll talk about his possible reemergence into the world of sports as well. This is Larry King Live. Jackie Mason will be with us following Donald Trump and will spend about another six minutes with Mr. Trump.
<Larry King> <Negative> We're in New York his home, my birthplace, don't go away.
<Larry King> <Negative> Some other things to cover with Donald Trump. He got another fight, another Tyson fight.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have Mike Tyson coming in, in July, and he is going to be fighting for again, the championship, where somebody is going to fighting in for the --
<Larry King> <Negative> Carl Williams.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Carl Williams. Carl "The Truth" Williams and supposedly Carl has a real shot, who knows? I mean, you know, we've been saying that everytime we have a fight, the other --
<Larry King> <Positive> Is Tyson an enigma to you and you've helped him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he is a good guy in many respects. He is a very -- he is a very mentally tough guy. And I've always found it to be very good, very nice. He has always treated me with great respect and that's all I really can ask for. I mean, he certainly does feed a lot of people --
<Larry King> <Negative> So you've got no call.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. He is coming to my hotel. He fights me, and we had the biggest gross in the history of the gaming business.
<Larry King> <Negative> He is not overpaid, is he? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he can't really be. I paid $11 million for a fight that we had with Spinks, the Tyson-Spinks fight and we had the biggest gross that we've ever had. We've made more money that night than anybody in the history of the casino business. I mean, that happens to be a casino at Trump Plaza in Atlantic City.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we had one of the great nights in the history of the business. So you can't say somebody is overpaid when he can do that.
<Larry King> <Negative> What take you into bicycles?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it was sort of an interesting situation. The Tour de Trump and I almost fell off the chair when they presented the whole program to me with the name. And now as you know, it's been run, we have a champion of New York Times --
<Larry King> <Negative> New York Times, David Rave said it was --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's gotten tremendous --
<Larry King> <Negative> You don't know national with this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- we are thinking about going New York to L.A. and going through Chicago and a lot of the major cities.
<Larry King> <Positive> How do they sign on?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they came in and they made this presentation bicycle racing and bicycle generally has becoming a very big sport in this country. In fact, it supposed to be the fastest growing sport in the country. So they have said, they talk all about the Tour de France, I said what would you be calling us and he said the Tour de Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said whoa, I mean, guys like Larry you kill me without him. And it took me a little while to realize, but then -- and I was even criticize little bit after, it's that the press conference where there are about 200 reporters at this press conference for a bicycle race. Somebody stood up and said, Mr. Trump, "Your ego is so big, why did you call it Tour de Trump?" I said, "Because it's better to have 200 people here in the press people than it is to have none". And, you know, essentially, that's what happened and it's become a tremendous success.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We went to Baltimore and Lehigh Valley, Albany, Richmond, Virginia. Every place we touched there were hundreds of thousands of people. And I got rave reviews. It's been a tremendous success. So we'll bring it back next year, we'll continue to bring it back. Make it bigger, bigger, bigger and I think it's going to arrive at the Tour de France based on its initial --
<Larry King> <Negative> And to its current NBC did a very nice job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They did a fantastic job.
<Larry King> <Positive> Wonderful job of those civil war battle sites and --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's the first time in the history of their sports department that they've ever gone partners. You know, they are partner in the Tour de Trump with me and with another group and it's the first time that NBC has ever done that. And they are very happy and they have been a great partner.
<Larry King> <Negative> Why are you so openly mad at Laura Helmsley?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Leona Helmsley.
<Larry King> <Negative> Leona Helmsley.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm not mad at her, I said sorry for the --
<Larry King> <Negative> At the name I apologize.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not mad at Leona Helmsley. I feel sorry for her. She approved something that she was supposed to approve and, you know, it's a long boring story. But frankly, the woman is just not a woman that I have a lot of respect for. I feel sorry for her. And it's not that I'm angry at her. I think that when you supposed to do something you do it, and if you're not supposed -- [Crosstalk]
<Larry King> <Neutral> She was supposed to deal with you and she --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, she was supposed to have signed a document which ultimately she recanted and she ended up signing. It was a paper. It was really statutorily and she was supposed to have signed the document. She didn't sign the document. She wanted to make it because it was a document that was going to my benefits. So she tried to figure out how -- don't I have to sign this document.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The bottom line is she ended up totally recanting. But the woman is not a good woman. It's a woman that I don't like. I've never liked, but she's, you know --
<Larry King> <Neutral> -- public you let it get public.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will tell you this, you have a man coming in your show, Jackie Mason. I need to go it from one extreme to the other. I mean, dimensionally, Leona Helmsley and Jackie in the same breathe is like horrible, why am I doing this to Jackie. But Jackie is an incredible talent and Jackie the other night, you know, he is really one of the great talents --
<Larry King> <Neutral> He did a roast of you, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He did a roast of me, right, [Inaudible] roast me. But he did beyond the roast of me. He -- I was the honoree of a Police Athletic League party at the world-famous Plaza Hotel. And Jackie came in, donated his services and stood up for half an hour 45 minutes and just made that room laughed like crazy. You never seen, I mean, that was room of major heavies and they will credit -- these are people that are laughers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, they don't sit down and just laugh. These people were laughing with Jackie and he was fantastic. He gave his services to myself and the Police Athletic League and he is just a great guy.
<Larry King> <Negative> What's your next goal?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know if I have goals necessarily. I have --
<Larry King> <Positive> Did you ever set goals finally.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not particularly, I do what I do.
<Larry King> <Positive> Most successful don't. I mean, don't sit down and say I'm going to do this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. I mean, usually you have too many barriers to go through. You have to sort of be very flexible and just weave your way. But I only goals per se, I have a lot of things that I want to do. I have certain things I want to accomplish. And again, I don't do it because I'm ambitious, because I don't consider myself ambitious.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like what I do. I really enjoy what I do.
<Larry King> <Negative> You like the --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Even being on your show. I enjoy being on your show with you.
<Larry King> <Positive> Thank you, Donald. You have your breath is OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Good.
<Larry King> <Negative> Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's the first time that ever happen to you, isn't it? Yes?
<Larry King> <Negative> The first, it always first with you Donald. We'll be back with Jackie Mason and we'll ask him to tell us about Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Who.
<Nikhil Sivadas> <Positive> My first question to you, sir. India has a new government in place right now one that claims to be very pro-business. What's your thoughts on the India story right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that your new prime minister has been amazing and I speak from a person that looks from outside in. Coming from New York the United States. I will say that his image and the way he's handled himself has been brilliant. He seems to have been a person that's been able to unite India and bring all factions together and I think he's done an incredible job of unification.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And again that's so important for India because India was very divisive at one point and people were afraid to invest in India. I think they have great confidence in the new prime minister. So I congratulate India on that. And you know, look, India is an amazing country a great country. And now with leadership and I think you now have the right leadership it tremendous things will happen for India.
<Nikhil Sivadas> <Positive> Now, apart from being a celebrated showman, as well as an assured businessman you are well known for being a real estate mogul. My question to you is what is it that that interests you the most about Indian real estate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I know so many people from India. They live in my buildings in New York part-time because they are from India but they live -- They have apartments in Trump Tower and Trump World Tower and Trump International Hotel, and so many different places and they're tremendous people, they're tremendous people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Many are friends of mine. And so many of them, they just love this country. They feel so strongly and so passionately about the country and I think that may be rubbed off on me. So when we had the opportunity to do a great project in Mumbai with a great developer, Lodha Group, they're fantastic and real professionals and we jumped at it. You know, will turn down 20 and 30 uni -- deals for everyone we do. We turned down many, many deals and because I don't want to do, we don't need them, it doesn't matter but we only want to do the ones that are important and the ones that can be great and we think this -- we thing Trump Tower in Mumbai is going to be a great project.
<Nikhil Sivadas> <Neutral> So would you say that emerging markets are a big focus for you right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think so. Emerging markets. I don't consider this an emerging market I consider this an amazing market. I think it's just unique. One of the things I've seen in Mumbai is that cities which aren't anything compared to Mumbai, the prices are much higher than in Mumbai per square foot per, square meter.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm saying, you know, that's my kind of place because I'd like to get in there early. So I look at pricing in Mumbai to be so inexpensive. When you look at London and you look at New York and you look at so many other cities and then you look at lesser cities where the price is higher than Mumbai and it never made sense to me and that's one of the reasons we're doing the job.
<Nikhil Sivadas> <Positive> A lot of experts felt that when you look at emerging markets you will be looking at arch-rival China more than India. Some feel that you feel this country is a better place to launch your brand. What do you say to that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I feel strongly about China also. I mean China is an incredible country obviously, and I think China is going to be you know another real power it already is. We'll be doing things in China and we'll be doing additional things in India.
<Nikhil Sivadas> <Positive> Let's talk at the projects are the ones coming out as well as in Mumbai. Do you feel confident that the New York Trump Tower so iconic TV feel of Indian namesakes to be able to live up to the brand?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're doing great buildings. They're both going to be great buildings, very luxury, very high end. And frankly, we didn't have to do as much as we did. We could have gotten away, probably, with the same pricing and done a lot less than we're doing. But we feel it's very important to come in with a bang and do it properly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So in both those instances, we are going to do something really special and they're going to be great jobs. And Mumbai, where we -- we haven't even really gone out. We've already sold over 100 units as I understand it and we opened the sales office this afternoon. We haven't even opened a sales office. So people are loving it and they love the location they love the building but they are really loving the product.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we're very happy about that.
<Nikhil Sivadas> <Positive> Now talking about the product, this is coming up in a region where developers are falling over themselves to launch a super-luxury brands. They're bringing in international brands. How do you think of the Trump Tower -- Trump Tower will be able to compete with, again, such competition?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well there is no brand like Trump. We have the hottest brand in the world right now and there's no brand like Trump. It's done tremendously all over the world. And I think Laura did the right thing when they called us because they knew what they were doing and additionally with real estate, we know what we're doing in real estate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Some of these brands are like celebrity names or celebrity whatever it may be fashion names but they know nothing about construction, they know nothing about concrete and glass. I know everything about those things. So we had a lot to do with the design of the building and the beauty of the building and really the functionality of the building.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we had a lot. And in addition to that, we had the best brand.
<Nikhil Sivadas> <Positive> So I love that signing of similar deals with other developers in India and other -- other markets, other cities?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What we're looking at a number of other deals. It's really, and as I said before it's absolutely quality over quantity. We could do many jobs. I could leave today and sign a pocketful of jobs. I don't want to do that. It's -- for us, it's absolute quality is much more important than quantity and that's why we're doing Mumbai.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's what we're doing -- you mentioned two names. I mean we're doing these two and the only reason we're doing them is for the quality of it. We think they have tremendous potential. We could do many other jobs. We didn't like what we saw.
<Nikhil Sivadas> <Neutral> So can you give me a time frame on when you might expect somebody else to work out?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I think we'll have other deals I think we'll be doing hotels in India. We'll be doing a lot in India. India is an amazing place. I know it well and it's an amazing place.
<Nikhil Sivadas> <Positive> Somebody has a very successful real estate empire. What's your advice to India developers who actually battling a slump of sorts right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think just keep doing good work and don't give up and keep working hard and pricing in India is not like it is in other places. Pricing in India is not as high in many sections and when I look at Mumbai and I look at the pricing it never made sense to me because it seems so low. But I think to other developers or other entrepreneurs -- You know, one thing about entrepreneurship you have to love what you do and you can never ever quit or give up. Those are the two keys and you have to have a good idea or product.
<Nikhil Sivadas> <Positive> Now, in the past, you've stated a growing interest in the number of millionaires and billionaires coming out of India. Your son even talked about setting up a India specific fund. What's going on there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that you do have -- you have great entrepreneurs in India. I think that's a natural thing. It's almost a natural thing for India but you have some of the great entrepreneurs in India and a tremendous flock of new ones coming up and that's a very important thing that's going to bring economics and money and lots of good things to India.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it is a trauma and is going to bring jobs and that is a good thing for India.
<Nikhil Sivadas> <Neutral> So the fund. Do you think that is happening?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's not a priority to us, to be honest. And if you talk about a fund we don't need money. So if you don't need money there's no real reason. And we do for our own account. You know, we don't do for others, we do for our own account and we love building great projects and we love, in some cases, keeping them or in some cases selling units to people so they can benefit but fund is not something that's overly interesting to me.
<Nikhil Sivadas> <Positive> Talking with the branding and licensing again are two things. One is the Indian market, the realty market is going into Islam and in the US, I understand, you recently filed a suit to remove your name from two casinos in Atlantic City thing though not living up to your standard --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Nikhil Sivadas> <Negative> Considering this lump do you think such a situation scenario could actually happen here?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I loved Atlantic City. I was very successful in Atlantic City but I left many years ago and they have my name on the building and they're not operating in a standard that is good for my name and so we've sued to get the name taken off the building, which will be, I think, successful. It's not a big thing but it's important for us. I would say that generally speaking that will never happen to India.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Atlantic City was absolutely overrun with competition from so many states and I guess 80% of the casinos in Atlantic City are gone or gone bankrupt and a lot of bad things happen. My timing -- a lot of people say my timing was very good because I left at a certain period of time and had a great relationship with Atlantic City.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But when somebody is using my name they have to keep it at the highest levels and they weren't able to do that, so that's why we're doing that.
<Nikhil Sivadas> <Positive> In a way, you can say it's a warning of sorts to people you're partnering with in the future.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well that's true and that's why so important have a great partner and I don't see a thing like that happening in India it's a different kind of a world, a different kind of a market. It's a much bigger market. Obviously, Atlantic City is not a big market. India is too important for that to happen.
<Nikhil Sivadas> <Positive> Now, having two Trump Towers in India looking for future ones going ahead, this is a very big opportunity for you to expand your brand here and I know that real estate is not the only thing you look at when you look at branding licensing. Are you looking at other sectors? Do you have other sectors?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Not really. A real estate is my thing. You know I've had great success in other things The Apprentice was the No. 1 show in the United States, continues to be a great success and who would have known that I was going to become a television star but it happened. Another thing that was very successful, I wrote a book and the book became the No. 1 business book ever of all time, as I understand it, and that was called Trump: The Art of the deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And so a lot of things have happened to me that I wouldn't have expected but real estate is my big deal and it is my big passion.
<Nikhil Sivadas> <Positive> Last question to you. I have been tantalizing global audiences a lot with your political ambitions. Some say you're going to do it, some say you're not. There have been some speculation that you'd be running for presi -- presidential office in 2016. Can you give some clarity on this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll look at it. The United States is not being properly run and I will take a strong look at it. We have a big election coming up in November, in particular, the Senate, which I think the Republicans will take. And after that, I'll give it very serious consideration. I will look. I don't what happened last time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Romney ran he lost. Something happened to him and I can't tell you exactly what happened because it's an election that shouldn't have been lost. But I will take a very serious look at that.
<Nikhil Sivadas> <Positive> So this is considered a serious contender.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think if I ran I'd do very well. I love what I'm doing. I love being in Mumbai today with Lodha and the whole group and doing this building. I really enjoy what I do. That's the thing I have most against running for president. But at the same time, the country needs leadership and if it's not gonna get it -- If I don't see somebody that I think can do a great job, I will certainly consider it.
