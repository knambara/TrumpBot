<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Now for the top story tonight. Talk about fighting and a troubling display of incivility, media stars Rosie O'Donnell and Donald Trump are insulting each other in a way that perhaps is unprecedented. All began when Mr. Trump as boss of the Miss USA pageant decided to discipline Miss USA for conduct unbecoming.
<Rosie O'Donnell> <Negative> There he is, hair [Inaudible]. Everyone deserves a second chance and I'm going to give her a second chance. He is the moral authority. Left the first wife had an affair, left the second wife, had an affair, had kids both times, he's the moral compass for 20 year olds in America. [Not transcribed]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Rosie talks about moral compass. What moral compass does she have? I mean, just take a look at her, and take a look at that face. I mean, can you imagine her girlfriend having to kiss that every night? You can have her. I did something very nice for a very fine young lady.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I gave her a second chance. Rosie O'Donnell didn't want me to give her a second chance. Of course, Rosie would like to spend a little time with her that I can guarantee you
<Rosie O'Donnell> <Negative> He's going to sue me, but he's going to be bankrupt by that time, so I won't have to worry.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I look forward to suing Rosie. I'm going to sue her and I look forward to. Now it's a slow news week I think, because Fox News is all over my ass. Now, I consider that a compliment, that's like being on Nixon's enemies list.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She is both unattractive inside and out.
<Rosie O'Donnell> <Neutral> Frankly here's my comment to him.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Rosie O'Donnell declined our invitation to appear this evening. Joining us now on the phone is Donald Trump. Why not shred her argument intellectually? You're smart enough to do that, Donald. Come on.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I hope I'm much smarter than that. But the fact is...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Why use the personal attacks?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hey, Bill...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Why not go after her on the issue? Why use the personal attacks
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why? Because you made a living on using personal attacks.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Who?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You have.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> No, I haven't. I don't attack anybody personally.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Of course you do.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> No I don't, I don't and that's erroneous. We stay on the issue...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hey, Bill. Let me just say something. When somebody gets on the air, and if they got on the air and said about you as an example, they attacked the pageant which is a great success. She attacks...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> she said I'm on the cover of Forbes magazine on the Forbes 400 last month. The cover which is, I guess they have it down and it doesn't make any difference what the real number is, but its many billions of dollars, okay? I'm on the cover. She said I went bankrupt, I never went bankrupt ever.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> That's true, but listen to me for a minute.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Listen to this.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Listen to me for a minute. Listen to me for a minute. You are successful, you are smart. The Trump brand is the premier brand in America.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> There's no question about it. She goes on her program and she smears and slimes you. She started it, not you. This is all fact.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She started it and I finished it.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Well, you didn't finish it, because this is going to go on and on.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I've come pretty close.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Why don't you just beat her intellectually? Why the personal stuff?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm beating her intellectually, Bill. She's easy to beat intellectually. If you looked at her performance on The View today, it was a disaster. The View is not a great show to start off with hasn't been doing very well, and had the worst year they've ever had last year.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you look at her performance on The View today, she was a mess, she was nervous, she was fumbling, she was stumbling, and she bought her nice girlfriend in to keep her company. Rosie was an absolute mess today and you know why? Because she's concerned that I'm going to sue her, and take a lot of money away from her, and she probably can't afford to do that. That is a failure of the magazine and the failure of her show.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> She's got money. I mean, she just gave a large donation to a Georgette Mosbacher's charity. Look, what I'm trying to get at here is this, you and I have talked many times we know each other, so everybody should know that. I've talked to Rosie O'Donnell's been on the program.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> What I'm saying to you, calling her pig face, getting into her sex life. All of these things, it doesn't make me doesn't make you look good.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's allowed to make fun by the hair. I don't care about the hair. You know I'm totally immune to the hairstyles.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> That makes her look bad. Don't you understand that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But she's allowed to do that. Excuse me, Bill. She's allowed to do that, but I shouldn't be doing it.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> No, because it makes her look bad to do that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I don't think so. No, I don't think She's having a lot of fun with my...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> It makes her look terrible to do that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hey, Bill. There are two types of people in this world. People that take it and people that don't take it. Rosie is a bully.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Rosie was hit between the eyes. Rosie is very concerned, because what she said was a lie in certain -- I mean there are numerous things, but one of the things, Trump went bankrupt. I didn't go bankrupt. Rosie now all of a sudden is being advised by lots of lawyers, please shut up you have a big problem here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Rosie is concerned and if you saw her performance today, she was a disaster
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> I'm not going to be able to convince you to beat her intellectually and to stay out of the personal. I'm not going to be able to convince.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is ultimately intellectually. I went to the best school, I went to the Wharton School --
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> That's what I'm telling you. Why do you have to talk about her girlfriend then? Just talk about how erroneous what she says.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I feel sorry for her. I'm not talking about a girlfriend, I feel sorry for her girlfriend. How would you like to have to kiss Rosie goodnight every night.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> That's what I'm you talking about. You don't need that
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I feel sorry for this guy. I just found out her name is Kelly. She looks like a lovely young woman. It's too bad she got stuck with Rosie.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> All right, okay. Now, on a law suit you can't win and I'll tell you why. Because you've got to prove damage and you're not going to be able to prove damages.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what, Bill? Do me a favor. Don't be my lawyer. You speak for yourself, okay?
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> All right, I'm just telling you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don't be my lawyer, Bill.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> I would have liked to sue a lot people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm sure you'd be a very good lawyer, but you what? Don't be my lawyer.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> But you're going to have to prove damages to win.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do me a favor, Bill. Don't be my lawyer.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> All right. Have you thought about that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think about everything.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> All right, you got to have to show damages. Malice you can show, malice you can show.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Bill, Bill. Don't tell me about libel law...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Damages, I don't think so.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know a lot about libel law, just don't be my lawyer. I like you, you're my friend, and just don't be my lawyer.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Can I be your adviser?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. Don't do any more personal attacks.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Are you still there or you hang up on me?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I didn't hang up. All right, I will take that very seriously.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> You should, you should. Look, Rosie O'Donnell started it, she looked foolish by attacking you personally, and if you had just gone after her on the basis of what she said, and just say, "Look
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Bill, except nobody would listen to that.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Oh, yes they would.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have to go, excuse me, Bill. Nobody would listen to that.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> I would.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I attacked it on a purely intellectual level which is essentially what I've done, but using a little bit more venom. If I attacked it on a purely intellectual basis nobody would listen and the response would not have been nearly as effective.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> I don't think so. You're Donald Trump, you could have been on this program, in any other program and gone in and say, "Look
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Rosie is a woman that didn't want to give a very nice girl, and she's a girl, a very nice girl who has a problem. Didn't want to give her a second chance. That's how this all started.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> She started it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I guarantee you, she's given plenty of women second chances.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> But there you go, you're not taking my advice. You just said I could be your adviser.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. No, I don't want to take your advice on this, Bill. Excuse me. I don't have to take your advice.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not taking your advice. I respect you very much, but on this issue I won't take your advice.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> You don't have to make the sexual innuendo, it doesn't make you look good. All right, let's get on one more thing I got to ask you about. This Miss USA contest looks like he's out of control. You got Miss Nevada now and what does she do in there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I donÍt think it's out of control. I think it's very successful.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Did you fire Ms. Nevada? Did she --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Ms. Nevada did some very bad things.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Is she fired?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She was terminated today.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> You fired her, but you didn't give her a second chance, how come?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, because if you looked at the pictures that I looked at, you wouldn't be giving her a second chance either.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She really had some terrible, terrible displays.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> You know Christmas is coming here, Donald you feel bad about all this controversy in a way?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I feel good. I feel very good.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> You like this, don't you? Be honest.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't like it, Bill.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Come on, be honest. You like this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't like it, Bill. When somebody gets on a show and lies, I don't have to take it or I can take it. I choose not to take it, and if you look at Rosie she got hit between the eyes and now she doesn't want to talk about it. She wants to crawl into a corner, because she's gutless.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's the way it is. I choose not to take it and you know what? I know you very well, you generally choose not to take it.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Yes, but I do it on a different level.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hope it's a lower level than I do it.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> No, it isn't. Merry Christmas, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Have a good time, Bill. [Inaudible]
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> All right, thanks for coming in to the program. Rosie O'Donnell is welcome any time. Come on here and talk about it. All right.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Now, this is Dolby right? Is it Dolby you're watching me right now all over the world, it's Dolby. Why do we care? Here's why we care. This is our culture. This is it.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> This is like ancient Rome. Okay? These are the gladiators in the arena and we sit there, and we watch personal attacks by the media over and over and over and over. You know what's going to happen? In the 2008 presidential...
