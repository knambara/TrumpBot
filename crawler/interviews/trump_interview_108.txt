<Mark Levin> <Neutral> President Donald Trump, how are you, sir?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Really good, Mark. Thank you very much.
<Mark Levin> <Positive> Well, it's a great honor. I know you're -- you're -- you're just campaigning, incredibly of these massive crowds, certainly compared to Obama, too, by the way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know we just got to -- as you know, we just arrived in Indiana, and they have lines -- the arena has packed, 12,000 people, but they have lines, they could fill it up three times, and we just left Ohio, and it was incredible, the crowd. So it's really great. If crowds mean anything, and there is an electricity in the air, Mark, that reminds me very much of November 16th.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's electricity that's incredible. And let's see. But I think there's something going on.
<Mark Levin> <Positive> We've got about 12 million people listening to you right now. What do you want to tell them now about tomorrow, and how important is the vote, Mr. President?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm campaigning for individual people. And if you notice, the -- I call it the fake news -- but in many cases, certainly, as you know better than almost anybody in the world, a lot of it is fake, unfortunately. And, they want to put it as my race, and I'm okay with that. I don't really care. You kno,w whatever is necessary.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have some great, great candidates. I'm with Mike Braun right now, who's running for the Senate of -- in Indiana and he's against Joe Donnelly, very weak. And let's see what happens. The polls have him even, maybe even slightly up. He was down four, and now he's even, and, you know, I think by the time I get finished, I'll explain Joe Donnelly, and I think he's going to end up winning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we're going to win races that nobody ever thought of. Honestly, they didn't think in terms of Donnelly, they didn't think in terms of Tester. Heidi was unbeatable. This is six months, a year ago. All of -- you know, in going over the races, Mark, there were people that we weren't even going to contest, and now we're leading.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just think we're going to do well, and I think we're going to do better in the House than anybody expects. But we'll -- we're gonna soon know.
<Mark Levin> <Positive> Isn't this an election, Mr. President, about the American people and the country, what they want in the future? I mean, you're -- you're trying to grow the economy, secure the borders --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Mark Levin> <Negative> -- strengthen our military, and the other guys want to do the opposite.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's almost not understandable. We have the best economic numbers ever to come out. You know, we have probably the best economy that any president's ever had when he ran for office, because historically, as you know, I guess, what is it Mark -- two times over many, many, many decades --
<Mark Levin> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- the President, the person in the presidential office wom. The fact is, that, I don't know why, but nobody's ever had an economy like we have. We have the best economy that there has ever been, let alone for an election. So I think we're going to have tremendous success tomorrow. I think it's going to be great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The numbers came out: 250,000 jobs for October, which was a shocking number. And that's despite the fact that we had two massive hurricanes, which usually just decimate those numbers. You know, when you have a hurricane, those numbers are decimated, the monthly job numbers. So, the economy is doing really well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Trade deals are doing really well, and China has never seen anything like this, what's going on there. They've never seen anything like it. You know, right now they're paying tax on 250 -- I mean they are paying taxes on or numbers like you wouldn't believe. Billions and billions of dollars coming into our treasury, and I'm very happy with that, but they want to make a deal, and we might make a deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Their economy has gone down 32 percent, which, of course, nobody mentions. And I don't really want them to mention it. I'm not looking to be bad to China. We want to be fair, but we want to get a good deal for us for a change, because we lose $500 billion a year with China, and we can't do that any longer, Mark.
<Mark Levin> <Negative> One last question, because I know you don't want to leave your massive audience there. Now Mr. President, Republicans, some of them are still thinking about whether to vote. I don't know who these Republicans are, but as I look at the numbers of just the Republicans will turn out in large numbers, these tiny differences, these very tight races will go the way of the Republicans, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know Mark, there's something beautiful about it. The -- a lot of the Republicans don't want to vote, because they think I don't like Congress, and they really like me, and I have 93 percent now -- which is the highest -- 93 in the Republican Party. And I have a great relationship with them, and they say we will not vote because the President doesn't like Congress.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I actually do like Congress. We have to -- we have to get out and vote. If they get out and vote, we're going to really win, because I think we're almost winning right now. Maybe we are winning right now, because when you look at the lines outside, like where I am now, I just got a report from Missouri.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The lines are two miles long, trying to get in, and the place is already packed, and it will be there for another two and a half hours. So, something is going on, and if they go out and vote we're going to win big.
<Mark Levin> <Positive> Well, Mr. President, I wish you and the Republican Party and all the candidates well, because I consider this a huge race between liberty and tyranny, and between freedom and capitalism and Democratic socialism and the American people. We -- we have to decide what we want.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Mark, I just want to tell your listeners you are a special man, and I don't say there's often about a lot of people. Nobody's smarter and you are just -- you got it very, very early and I appreciate it, and I appreciate all your help, but all your genius. What I want to tell your listeners -- you are a special guy, and I want to thank you very much, and you're the only one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I'm supposed to be on stage in front of a lot of television, and a lot of people, and I said, nope, I have to do the Mark call first. That's more important to me.
<Mark Levin> <Positive> Well, it is a great honor. I'm gonna tell you, my audience loves you, as do we and my family, and I want to thank you very much for all you're doing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Mark, and I'll see you soon. Take care of yourself.
<Mark Levin> <Positive> God bless. Be safe. The United States, live.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Joining us now by phone, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Congratulations, Donald.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> And, Donald, you wake up this morning with some new friends who wanted you destroyed just a week ago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's actually been happening for a couple of weeks, Joe. People are calling and they want to be involved and you know what? That's fine. I think that's a good thing, not a bad thing. But we certainly have a lot of people wanting to be involved who weren't liking me so much -- even, you know, I mean, forgetting about Iowa, which actually in a certain way was quite successful. But they weren't liking me so much a couple of months ago, that I can tell you.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So Donald what happened last night? The numbers are staggering. I've got Steve Kornacki here who said you just swept through the entire state. You won every region. You won every county. What happened?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've had a great relationship with the people of New Hampshire. We'd go around and you get to see it yourself. You were at one event. But every event we had we were packed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We had hundreds and hundreds of people, sometimes thousands of people outside on small venues. I mean, you'd have a small venue that holds 200 people, it would have 3,000, 4,000 people standing outside. So that's not a bad sign. And we would just -- it was really absolutely amazing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was amazing the love that was in the state of New Hampshire. They're great people up there. I know them -- long before the politics thing I've known them.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> From Iowa to New Hampshire and now looking ahead to South Carolina, the next big one, what have you learned along the way? What things are you changing? Maybe what wouldn't you do again and what is working?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think the message is the same. It started out, Mika, with trade and very strong on trade. We're being ripped off by everybody and I guess that's the thing that Bernie Sanders and myself have in common, you know, we know about the trade. But unfortunately he can't do anything to fix it, whereas I will.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have the best people in the world that will fix it. We're losing hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars a year and we will fix it and we will make it good and we'll bring our jobs back and we'll do a lot of things and Bernie Sanders can't even think in terms of that. The only thing he does know, and he's right about, is that we're being ripped off and he says that constantly and I guess he and I are the only two that really say that. But it's going to be -- you know, that's where it began and it also was the border.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then you had the Paris attack and all of a sudden it became ISIS and it became security and because I was far and away the strongest on border, I think people viewed me as strongest on security generally. They sort of morph into each other and it's been amazing. And then you get -- you know, I'm very much against common core, which is education from Washington, you can forget it, we're going to do local education. Not -- forget about cost, I mean it is less costly, far less costly, but far better.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you look at our rankings on education in the world, we're number 30 in the world, which is ridiculous. No. 1 in cost. And second amendment, we're protecting our second amendment and so many other things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it really did, after the Paris attack, it took a different turn and it wasn't my turn, it was the people's turn. I saw that. They want protection. And they viewed me as somebody that's going to take care of them, and I will.
<Willie Geist> <Positive> Donald, it's Willie. Good morning and congratulations.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi, Willie.
<Willie Geist> <Positive> You are obviously the story here, you and Bernie Sanders. That's a historic win last night. Beneath your storyline, though, some people talking about John Kasich surprisingly coming up and finishing in second place with a good showing for him. We haven't heard you talk much about John Kasich in this race. As you move forward, what are your impressions of him? What do you think about him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I like him a lot, I think he's a nice guy. Unfortunately, going to the airport two days ago I heard a commercial and the commercial was a little bit negative and I said I wonder who did that commercial. It was a negative commercial of me and it was John Kasich. So maybe I'm not in love with him as much as I was prior to hearing the commercial.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was a false commercial. I thought it would be somebody else but it wasn't, it was John. So perhaps we have to take a little tougher stance than I would have normally. I was surprised to hear it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He talked about he's not going negative but he did a negative commercial on me so I didn't like that.
<Willie Geist> <Neutral> Do you think he's been a good governor of Ohio, Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think he hit oil, that's what I think. What happened is he got a little bit lucky but he also let them go after it, you know, unlike other governors where they didn't let him go after it. They were there fracking in Ohio. They hit oil in primetime when the prices were at a high and that makes up for a lot of sins. It makes up for a lot of errors and difficulties. So I think that was a very positive thing for John. And I give John credit. You know, a lot of people don't let him go frack and he said go frack and frankly, that made a huge difference for Ohio.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> So who's your biggest threat now moving forward? Now we've gotten through Iowa, we've gotten through New Hampshire. As you assess the Republican field, who's the biggest threat to you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Honestly, Willie, I think they all are. They're all smart, intelligent, very accomplished people. I wouldn't necessarily pick one. John is a little bit closer than the others, but that could be an outlier also.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You never know what's going to happen. I was very happy with our polls numbers because -- You're right, about -- I was listening to before you -- you know, the polling was just about exactly right. We had the polling at 34, 35, 32, probably the result was even a little bit higher than the polling. But I think they're all really potential threats, but I'm okay at handling threats.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Mike Barnicle?
<Mike Barnicle> <Positive> Donald, I'm going to describe a voter to you and I would like you to tell us how you are going to woo and win this voter as we proceed forward across this long haul.
<Mike Barnicle> <Neutral> She's a 48-year-old woman, she makes $52,000 a year, she has two children in high school, she's not particularly political. Trade, immigration are not her hot buttons. Tell me, how do you intend to get her to vote for you? How do you get her to stay in your corner?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, one of the things we're going to be doing is repealing and replacing Obamacare. People are absolutely in terms of health care. She's got children and I guarantee you that she probably doesn't have health care and if she does it's terrible, it's Obamacare related and honestly Obamacare is a disaster. The premiums are going -- you have to see the numbers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're going 25 percent, 35 percent, 45 percent up. The deductibles are impossible. Unless you get hit by a truck you're never going to be able to use it and it's a real disaster. And I'm not saying this from a political standpoint.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know once [Inaudible] -- Let it work, I wish it worked. But it's a disaster for people and, you know, a woman like that needs help from the health care standpoint and believe me I guarantee you one thing, there are other things we can talk about, but one of the things that they are not being helped with is health care. So we're going to -- We have some great concepts for much better health care at a much lower cost and also at a lower cost for the country. Obamacare is a very, very massive expense for our country and in two years from now it's -- it's going to be impossible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it will be very, very good for her and her children.
<Mike Barnicle> <Negative> Would you keep it or fix it, Obamacare?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd rather get rid of it and have a beautiful new plan and concept. I would much rather repeal it and replace it. It's very complex. Keeping it and doing a patchwork job, I don't like. We should come out of the box with something great and I think we'll get great support from Congress and I do that. I mean, I know all of these people, I know all of the players and they want to see it, too, so I think we'll do it.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Robert Costa?
<Bob Costa> <Positive> Mr. Trump, good morning. What would --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi, Bob.
<Bob Costa> <Negative> Let's learn a little bit about your skills as a politician. Tell me, have you reached out to Governor Christie in the last 12 hours? And if not -- if so, what was that conversation like? And if not, are you going to reach out, try to get his endorsement, try to rally some establishment support behind you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, I never thought of myself as a politician, but Jeb Bush said he's a highly gifted politician, he is a gifted, gifted politician. And I said I am? I didn't know that. So sort of interesting. And actually sort of nice.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think that Chris did an amazing job in terms of the debate as a prosecutor and he's a friend of mine and he actually called me last night and we had a long talk and he's a little disappointed because he really did do a great job, he did an amazing job during that debate. I was witness to it because I was standing next to Marco -- who I like very much -- and, you know, it was a strange kind of a situation going on there. It was a little bit strange and Marco understands that and he'll be able to fix it, I hope.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Well, Donald Trump, congratulations. How's your family holding up at this point watching all this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Everyone's great. It was great seeing you, and you guys have been supporters and I really appreciate it. And not necessarily supporters, but at least believers. You said there's some potential there. And the same thing with Bob. Bob has been a real professional, whereas other people were looking and saying wait a minute, he's very successful as a developer and a business guy, but he's not a politician and Bob got an early glance and I appreciate Bob's fair reporting in The Washington Post.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Okay.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Well, I will tell you what, when you say supporter you're obviously -- you're talking about how actually -- you're talking about Bob, Mika, myself, also Halperin, Willie and those of us around the table. There were a handful of people who for six months have been saying what happened last night could happen and the rest of the media world has been mocking and ridiculing exactly what he's done.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> But let me clarify what supporters mean. This is kind of important. Because from the get-go -- I mean, I don't agree -- Donald and I have not agreed on things ever since we started talking about pageants on Morning Joe, so it's not like Donald and I have the same world view. You guys might in some ways. But we knew that he could do this from the get-go. So I think the sense is that we believed that his talents actually could follow through and translate into something while everyone else underestimated him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Mika -- Hey, Joe, I just want to say, I watched you two with some of your guests who are so angry that they could not breathe on your show. The anger was incredible. The lack of anything -- I've never seen anything like it, actually. In fact you were upset because you said how can you have guests like this? Whether it was good, bad or indifferent. But I watched that and I thought it was amazing. And I just wonder where those people are today and hopefully someday they'll be allowed back on your show.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> I can't find them.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right. Thank you so much --
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right. Thank you, Donald.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> They can come on anytime they want.
<Larry King> <Positive> Good evening. We begin tonight with an old friend, Donald Trump. He's got another hit on his hands, as if he needed another hit, but this is going to be one. It's "Think Like a Champion
<Larry King> <Positive> Donald, I thank you for joining us. By the way, he comes to us from his office in midtown Manhattan. Why this book?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I did, a long time ago, your show. And I had a certain book called "The Art of the Deal."" And it became the number one business book of all time
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And since then, I've done a number of other books and they've all been great best-sellers. And a lot of people wanted me to do a book right now about these troubled times that we're all in.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it's been sort of interesting. They're great times, as an entrepreneur. I don't think I've ever seen better times as an entrepreneur. But the world is a mess and the country is a mess. And they just wanted me to do a book, Larry, that really talked about the times that we're in, the trouble that we're in and how to make money and how to be happy, because I'm always happy when I'm making money.
<Larry King> <Negative> Why -- why a good time for an entrepreneur and not necessarily for others?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't think I've ever seen a time where there's been this kind of play, where you have assets that you can buy for dollars. I've never seen a time like it, Larry.
<Larry King> <Positive> So you -- this is the time for smart people to make money, is what you're saying?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, this is a time for smart people. This is a time for entrepreneurial people. And this is a time for people like me. This is a great time for people like me -- and maybe people like you, Larry, because I know you're a great investor.
<Larry King> <Negative> Oh, yes. At the top of the world. Not long ago...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The top of the world.
<Larry King> <Negative> Not long ago, you...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Weren't you involved with Madoff? Wait, Larry...
<Larry King> <Positive> Thanks a lot. Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Weren't you involved with Madoff?
<Larry King> <Negative> A little bit, yes. You weren't, huh?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK, that's too bad.
<Larry King> <Neutral> How did you resist him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A lot of -- no, I got lucky. Honestly, I got lucky. He might have duped me like he did a lot of other people. He is a disaster.
<Larry King> <Negative> I never met him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But now he's where he belongs.
<Larry King> <Positive> OK, you...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Really?
<Larry King> <Negative> Not long ago -- yes, I never met him. I never spoke to him. Not long ago, you sounded pretty grim about what might be ahead for the economy. I think you used the word, D word, meaning "depression."" What's your assessment now overall?"
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I said that if they didn't stuff the banks with money, we'd be in depression number two right now, Larry. I mean, we would be strongly in depression number two. So they did the right thing in putting money into the banks.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they were really pouring, I mean, billions and billions of dollars into the banks. The problem is, the banks aren't lending the money. So if you want to do a deal or if you want to buy a house or if you want to do whatever you have to do, the banks are not loaning money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So the taxpayers have put hundreds of billions of dollars into these banks in order to shore up the banks, but the banks are not lending the money out. And that's a shame, because that's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
<Larry King> <Positive> With troubled times like this for the average guy who may be foreclosing on his house, is this the time to think like a champion?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, this is a time to think like a champion. This is the best time to think like a champion. As an example, the house is being foreclosed. You go see your bank -- maybe you can make a deal, maybe you can't. But you can make a deal with a bank on another house, Larry, because -- and much better than the one you're living in. And they'll take back financing. They'll do any deal to get rid of their product. They have houses by the thousands. And you go see that bank and you make a deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And this is a great time for a person to go out, make a deal, get a house bigger and better than the one you're living in now, except the bank will give you virtually 100 percent financing. They'll take back a mortgage and you'll be in better shape than you were before, if you know what you're doing. And I discuss that very, very strongly, Larry, in the book.
<Larry King> <Positive> There are a lot of great topics. One of them is Barack Obama. In fact, the list at the back of the book on the topics, the number one is, "Barack Obama's election ushers in a different world."" How do you assess him?"
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I really like him. I think that he's working very hard. He's trying to rebuild our reputation throughout the world. I mean, we really have lost a lot of reputation in the world. The previous administration was a total disaster, a total catastrophe.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, you know, the world looks at us differently than they used to. And I think he's trying to restore our reputation within the world. And he was handed a pretty bad deck of cards. I mean, he was given a pretty tough situation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm not saying I agree with everything he's doing. I do agree with what they're doing with the banks. Whether they fund them or nationalize them, it doesn't matter, but you have to keep the banks going.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Beyond that, I'm not so sure I agree with it, because I...I am worried, ultimately, about inflation. If you take this much money and keep pouring it into the economy, I worry about what's going to happen in two years with respect to not only interest rates, but inflation.
<Larry King> <Negative> Do you have any regrets about endorsing McCain?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I've known John for a long time. And I've never met our current president. And I look forward to doing it. But I've known John, really, for a long time. He's a good man. He's a quality man. So certainly I have no regrets about that.
<Larry King> <Negative> Any advice -- it may be presumptuous to say this -- but any advice you'd give the president -- something you think he should do he's not doing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think what he is doing and what he wasn't doing initially is talking up the economy, talking up the country. I think he's really gone from maybe not doing it so much at the beginning -- and, in fact, he was being criticized for it -- to really doing it in spades. And I think that's good. I think he's talking up the country. I think he's talking up -- starting to talk up the economy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, you know, economy is largely a psychological thing. If people think the banks are weak, the country is going to be weak. Now, the problem is, the banks are weak. We know they're weak. They're not loaning money. Now he has to get the banks to go in and start loaning the money.
<Larry King> <Negative> Why does he retain this incredible popularity?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think he's sort of a guy that just has a wonderful personality, a good speaker, somebody that people trust. And I also think that the comparison with his predecessor is so different -- it's so huge that it really has made a great impact on people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think that he's really doing a nice job in terms of representation of this country. And he represents such a large part of the country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, to think that a black man was going to be elected president -- I watched television for years where the great political analysts were saying maybe in 50, maybe in 100 years. Here's a man that not only got elected, I think he's doing a really good job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, the sad part is that he can't just do a good job. He's got to do a great job. Because if he does a good job, that's not good enough for this country. That's how bad the country has become.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Do you assess him as a champion?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, yes, he's a champion. I mean, he won against all odds. If you would have looked -- when he first announced, people were giving him virtually no chance. And he's just done something that's amazing.
<Larry King> <Positive> More on Donald Trump...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's totally a champion.
<Larry King> <Positive> More on Donald Trump and this terrific book, "Think Like a Champion."" We'll be right back with ""The Donald"" right after this. [Commercial Break]"
<Larry King> <Positive> We're back with Donald Trump. The book is "Think Like a Champion."" You write about fears versus concerns and opportunities for problem-solving. Right now
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think it's realistic, Larry. People are afraid. They're scared. They're losing their jobs. They're losing their homes. And certainly there is a word known as fear and there's nothing wrong with being fearful. But you have to do something about it. And that's what I write about in the book. You go out. You go to the right place, where there's better employment.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You get a trade where there's -- whether it's a trade or a business -- it can be a lot of different things -- where they really need people, as opposed to so many businesses. I look at certain locations in the country. I look at certain businesses that are just so bad that you're just hitting your head against the wall.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I discuss this in the book. Go where there's good employment. Go where there's good stuff. You have to learn. You know, the word "champion"" is interesting
<Larry King> <Negative> You do. Well said. How has all of this affected you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm lucky. I finished many jobs. And I -- I call it luck. And, you know, luck is another word I discuss. You have to be a little bit lucky. You can be very, very talented. I look at Wall Street and whether it's Bear Stearns or Lehman Brothers, I was hearing that -- oh, for years. The guys at Lehman were the smartest guys on the Street. They're great geniuses and everything else.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they're all gonzo. I mean, they're -- it's -- the firm was wiped out. The head man is going to be fighting lawsuits for the rest of his life. To a certain extent, there is a word known as luck. And I finished jobs, great jobs, opposite the United Nations, a 90-story building. I finished one which was just a tremendous success on Park Avenue and 59th Street at the old Delmonico Hotel site.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I sold a house a year ago for $100 million -- close to $100 million to a Russian. And it's in Palm Beach, Florida. It's the highest price ever paid for in this country for a house. And I think, unfortunately, that record is going to stand for many years. But it was literally a week before -- I call it the Great Depression -- before the market crashed. And so whether you call it luck or whether you call it talent, it puts me -- all of these different things and many more -- put me in a very good position.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we have a lot of cash. I'm buying things. I just bought a big, big project right near Washington, D.C. -- three miles on the Potomac River, the most beautiful piece of land -- I mean, land that I was looking at for years that I never thought I could get and all of a sudden I've gotten it. And that's what I'm talking about.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> These are great times for an entrepreneur to make money. And whether you have a lot of cash or don't have so much, you've got to get seller financing, because the banks aren't there. The banks aren't going to help you. You try and get seller financing. They sell you something, they have to take that financing or take back a mortgage. Very important. And that's whether you have cash or not, because otherwise you're not going to have the cash for very long.
<Larry King> <Negative> I was in Las Vegas last weekend and I noticed a number of buildings stopped building. In other words, there's four floors and it's supposed to be eight floors. There's just nothing happening on them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, yes...
<Larry King> <Neutral> By the way, are any of your buildings...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...Vegas is a disaster.
<Larry King> <Negative> ... In that kind of trouble? Or -- you're not in that kind of trouble?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, we -- no. We -- in fact, I just built a building. You've probably seen it. It's the tallest building in Las Vegas.
<Larry King> <Neutral> I saw it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's the Trump Hotel.
<Larry King> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it's doing really nicely. It's beautiful. It's completed. I built it ahead of schedule. I built it under budget. You know, when you look at what happened with the big job that MGM is doing, the problem that they've got is they're billions and billions of dollars over budget.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So somebody wasn't doing a good job. Somebody wasn't doing their job. You can't have a job that's going to cost billions of dollars more than you anticipate. And that's the problem. We finished this job early. We finished it really right on. It's an absolutely beautiful job, Trump International Hotel.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Have you had to lay off people? Because every -- it seems everyone has had to do that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a sad thing, but whether it's "The Apprentice"" or not
<Larry King> <Positive> Now, you -- you write in the book that people refer to you as being prescient. And your book also happens to have references to Somali pirates who are big news. What do you make of this whole piracy thing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it is absolutely -- probably the easiest question you've asked if you say, "What do you do about it?"" They don't allow guns on these big boats. So you have boats that are 20 stories high
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, if you had the same sharpshooters that you had that shot the three guys a couple of days ago and you put one of them on each boat -- just one. You don't even need more than one rifle. And these guys get within 400 or 500 yards of the boat and you warn them and they still come and you start shooting, that boat will turn around so fast, I cannot believe.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This morning on one of the shows, they're showing -- there's a little rowboat with a few guys in it. And, you know, they have rifles and everything. But the big boats don't have rifles, because they're not allowed to. We don't play by the rules. And then they -- they show admiral, Mr. Admiral -- Admiral, what would you do about it? What would -- they have an admiral talking about it. I'll tell you what to do about it. You put a sharpshooter on every boat and when they get within 400 yards...
<Larry King> <Negative> Shoot.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... The shooting starts. You will wipe out the problem immediately. And I charge nothing for that, Admiral.
<Larry King> <Positive> The Trump basic solution. We'll be right back with Donald Trump. The book, "Think Like a Champion."" Don't go away. [Commercial Break]"
<Larry King> <Positive> We're back with Donald Trump. The book, "Think Like a Champion."" Your book is a collection of essays -- not exactly the secrets of your success
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's from the chapter that says "learn from setbacks and mistakes:"" ""How we handle difficult situations in life says a lot about who we are. How we view them is also an important element in how we will deal with adversity."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Some events that will wipe out one person will make another person even more tenacious. That's why I always ask myself, 'Is this a blip or is it a catastrophe?' It gives me a point of reason in the midst of bad news." Based on all of that
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the key is, you don't want the catastrophe. I know a friend of mine did hundreds of little deals, deal after deal after deal and some would be good and some would be bad. Most -- I mean, the vast majority were good and he built a great company. And then he put the whole company on the line by doing one monster deal. And the monster deal turned out to be a horrible one and it wiped out the company. So I like the blips. I don't like the -- the catastrophes. And, no, I've never had a catastrophe. And you don't want to have a catastrophe, Larry. That's -- that's something that you strive not to have.
<Larry King> <Negative> We'll be right back with more of Donald Trump. The book, "Think Like a Champion."" Don't go away. [Commercial Break]"
<Larry King> <Positive> We're back with Donald Trump. His book, "Think Like a Champion
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Larry, this is a great time to buy real estate. And more and more, I'm convinced -- and things that I couldn't have even thought about getting, the prices were so ridiculous, I'm negotiating, I think, very successfully right now. Now, in two years, I might have said, "Larry
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I really think this is a great time to buy. And as far as financing is concerned, the only financing -- the only financing you should be thinking about is seller financing. If the seller won't give you financing, don't do it, because the banks are not doing their job. They're not providing financing for deals.
<Larry King> <Positive> What kind of shape is the banking industry in, because you deal with banks all the time, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I deal with banks all the time. And I guess the banks are -- some of them are solvent. Some of them aren't solvent. Some of the mid-level banks are fantastic and doing a fantastic job. I read a story about Beal Bank from Texas recently. I know Andy Beal. He's a fantastic guy. His bank is phenomenal. He's made all good decisions. And then you read stories about other banks. They're a disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it's a very interesting little thing. But the banks, generally speaking, they're -- they were stuffed with cash. A lot of the banks, the cash went just to break them even, because they're not using that cash for what they're supposed to be using it for. But I think the banking industry, generally speaking, is in big trouble.
<Larry King> <Negative> Today's the deadline for filing tax returns, the 15th. What do you make of these tea party protests about bailouts and federal spending being held all over the country?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they're saying the taxes are too high, the spending is too high, the amount of money that's going out all over the world. We're fighting wars in Iraq and yet we're not taking care of New Orleans. We're doing things that are just insane. I mean, we have a trillion dollars into Iraq. And I guarantee the day we leave, within a day, within 24 hours, it's going to be riots in the street.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's -- it's terrible. It's terrible. So we're spending all of this money outside of this country. And, you know, just as an example, you asked me about the pilots -- the pirates. It's such a simple -- we have destroyers going all over the place. They can handle their own problem just by having sharpshooters. The money that we spend on protecting the world is just absolutely ridiculous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to protect ourselves. Now, you have another problem. When the economy starts getting better, you will have an OPEC problem. They'll just start raising the price of oil again and destroy the economy, because I happen to think, yes, the banks and, yes, the derivatives and, yes, all of the crazy financial instruments that were conjured up for people to make money and it turned out to be false money, but I also happen to think that $150 oil destroyed the world economically.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And as soon as the world comes back, OPEC will raise its ugly head and destroy it again. So somebody better sit -- and I hope it's our president -- somebody better sit down with OPEC right now and say, "Listen
<Larry King> <Negative> But you're not going to march with the tea party?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't march with the tea party. But I'll tell you what, they have a good point, because when you see the kind of money that this country is -- to use a horrible expression, Larry, I know you've never heard this -- but that this country is pissing away, I can understand where they're coming from.
<Larry King> <Positive> OK, WalletPop.com -- they did a survey of which celebrity ordinary people would feel most comfortable having to do their taxes. Number two was our own Anderson Cooper. Number one, with 32 percent, you. Why do you think they would have faith in you to do their taxes?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't exactly know. I think I'd maybe choose Anderson Cooper over me, but that's good company. I think that they feel that I know what I'm talking about. I think they hear my stance on things. They know I'm an honest guy, I'm an honorable guy. And I'm very honored by the survey. I heard it was a national survey, so that's a great honor for me. But I think they probably feel that what I say happens to be true.
<Larry King> <Negative> Nothing beats the truth. New York state is planning a so-called millionaire's tax. It would affect those with incomes starting at $300,000. Yea or nay?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's a ridiculous thing. Albany is going to destroy -- that's the capital of the state -- is going to destroy this state. And they are raising taxes on rich people. The rich people have lots of options, Larry. One option is Palm Beach, Florida. You move down to Palm Beach, it's not the worst thing in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't have to live on Fifth Avenue. I don't have to live on Park Avenue. I can leave. Other people can leave. And, you know, for me, I have this great feeling or this great spirit for New York. It's hard, psychologically, for me to leave, but very easy physically. A lot of people don't have my kind of a thing. They don't have my hang-up about living in New York. They'll leave so quickly. So...
<Larry King> <Neutral> Like...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... Albany better get their act together, Larry, because you have a lot of people leaving and a lot of taxes won't be paid.
<Larry King> <Negative> Like Rush Limbaugh. He doesn't live in New York, but he got out all of his -- whatever he had invested in New York, I think he left everything. He's gone.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's no reason for Rush Limbaugh to live in New York. And he -- they raised the taxes and he said well, now it's time for me to leave. So they brought it up to the breaking point and he announced that he's leaving New York. And he's going to save a lot of money by living in Florida.
<Larry King> <Negative> Why don't patriots want to pay taxes?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't know that that's necessarily unpatriotic. I think they want to pay taxes. Obviously, you have to pay taxes. But they want to pay a reasonable tax and they don't want to see the money squandered. Money in this country is being squandered.
<Larry King> <Positive> OK. But then we would debate reasonable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you always debate reasonable. But if you -- I think unreasonable is the war in Iraq. I mean, there's $1 trillion right there -- and, more importantly, thousands of people -- both on our side and the other side -- hundreds of thousands of people killed and maimed and so badly hurt, I think it's just a shame. Now, to me, that's unreasonable. That's unreasonable.
<Larry King> <Neutral> OK...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, by the way, just to get on it, he's not the one that knocked down the World Trade Center. Saddam Hussein did not knock down the World Trade Center. I could tell you another country that had a lot more to do with it that we don't do anything about.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Which is?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know who I'm talking about.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Say it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know who I'm talking about? Well, it seemed that all of the folks went back to Saudi Arabia. They got their...
<Larry King> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They put their wives on the planes. They all went back to Saudi Arabia.
<Larry King> <Positive> They got out fast. All right, we...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we -- we attack Iraq.
<Larry King> <Negative> We've got a few more moments left with Donald Trump, who calls them as he sees them. We'll be right back. [Commercial Break] [Begin Video Clip]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You volunteered to come back. You're fired. I'm sorry, you shouldn't have volunteered to come back. Brian, you're fired. Go. Thank you. Chloe, you're fired. You let me down. You let yourself down. You let your team down. Dennis, you're fired. [End Video Clip]
<Larry King> <Positive> We're back with Donald Trump. The book is "Think Like A Champion."" we have an e-mail question from Johnny in Phoenix
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's true. I'm very close to getting it. That has to do with the great success of the "Apprentice."" It's been an amazing thing for me and for everybody involved with it
<Larry King> <Positive> You think you can copyright a term that's used every day like "thank you."""
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've been told 50/50 chance. I'll let you know in about six months.
<Larry King> <Negative> Has the economy at all cramped your life style? Anything you had to change?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, because I think I understand life. I think I understand how to live. I'm enjoying my life. I don't really live in an as extravagant a way as people think. It really has -- to me, this is a great time, as I said in the beginning -- it's a great time of entrepreneurial opportunity. As an entrepreneur, this is the best time I think I've ever seen in business. I've never seen a period like this
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're in very strong financial condition. And there are a lot of people that aren't. And there a lot of deals that aren't. It's a great time to go in and buy deals, buy buildings, buy things. From that standpoint, this is a great period of time for me.
<Larry King> <Positive> Candy Spelling is going to be with us in a little while. She's got her mega-mansion on the market. We're going to be getting a personally guided tour inside in a few minutes. She's asking 150 million for it, which would top the price you got. Basically, who would pay that kind of money in these times? It's more than 73,000 square feet. Who needs that space? What do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know the house well. I know Candy a little bit. I knew Aaron, who is a fantastic guy. I just say this, Candy, you should have sold two years ago.
<Larry King> <Negative> She's not going to get it? Is that what you're saying?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think -- look, it's just a different time. The house in Palm Beach that I got close to 100 million dollars for, today I wouldn't get anywhere near that. Palm Beach is certainly every bit the equivalent of Beverly Hills. I think the timing is so important for real estate, whether it's Candy's house or whether it's a studio apartment in New York City. It's a beautiful house. It's a great house.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think it's very, very bad timing to be selling a house like that right now. I have houses in Beverly Hills, as you know. In fact, one on Cannon. You named your boy after my house, is that right? Sunset and Cannon? He named his boy after my house, my street. I'm very honored by that. I have properly in Beverly Hills. I'll tell you, this is not the right time to sell property, especially in Beverly Hills. I hope she gets the 150. Larry, I hope she gets the 150 million.
<Larry King> <Negative> You do? You can't say anymore you had the biggest sale ever? She would be able to say it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm not worried about it. But I would be very happy with her.
<Larry King> <Positive> There's buzz that your beautiful daughter Ivanka is engaged or getting engaged. What's up?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She has a beautiful boyfriend. He's a great guy, but they are not engaged.
<Larry King> <Positive> Would you like them to? Is he the kind of guy you would except as a son-in-law?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He certainly is a wonderful guy. But it's all up to her. If she's happy, I'm happy.
<Larry King> <Negative> You and Barbara Walters -- let's straighten this out. You were at odds a couple years ago, Rosie O'Donnell involved. The word is that feud is over. If so, what ended it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Barbara has been a friend of mine for a long time. We went to Howard Stern's wedding. She approached me and said very nice things, and I said very nice things to her. We're back. We've been friends for a long time. You've known that. Frankly, she got herself into a little trouble because she really agreed what I said about Rosie. By doing that, Rosie went nuts and -- a very famous story.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Rosie's an animal, you know, who has failed at almost everything she's ever done. Barbara was very nice. And then Rosie put her in a very, very bad position. I fully understood what Barbara had to do. Barbara did not feel comfortable doing it. But I am friends with Barbara. I like Barbara a lot and I respect Barbara a lot. Frankly, Rosie should have respected Barbara more, because Barbara gave her a second chance and she didn't respect it.
<Larry King> <Positive> Donald, I compliment you on the book. I understand it's already selling super. Just out yesterday. An informal education in business and life. Thanks, Donald, always good to have you with us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Larry.
<Larry King> <Negative> Next, your chance to see what everybody else is talking about; Candy Spelling's crazy big, crazy expensive house that makes some hotels look small. Chelsea Handler leads the way on a tour to end all tours. Then we're going to talk about a wild new book by Candy as well. Stick around.
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you so much for having us here in this Cabinet Room, which is a room where so much of American history and decisions were made.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> A very special room. So, thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> All right so how was your week?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it was great. I mean, we did a tremendous amount of work -- natural-gas going to China, cattle going to China. We opened it up. You remember, years ago where they really stopped any cattle from being sold into China, and now China's just opened it up to our farmers, and our, our cattle folks, and they're very very happy about it. So, we have a tremendous amount of things happening literally today.
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> But, and I have to interrupt you, because I think that in spite of all the great things that we can talk about, the... the Jim Comey story got, you know, in the middle of everything. Was this the wrong time to fire Jim Comey?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, there's no right time. Let's say I did it on January 20th, the opening, right then. That would have been the big story as opposed to the inauguration, and I was thinking about it then. I was thinking about it during this period of time. There's really no right time to do it. But, uh, I mean I'm ok with it, as you know. I have the decision to make, and I have to make the decision. Donald Trump
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He agrees that I have the absolute right to do it. Everybody agrees. I guess I was a little bit surprised because all the Democrats, I mean, they hated Jim Comey. They didn't like him. They wanted him fired or whatever, and... and then all of a sudden they come out with these glowing reports. You know, look, it's, it's politics.
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> Well, the media is in a frenzy, and so given that some of these Congresspeople thought, he should have been fired. They called for an investigation, even if Jim Comey... doesn't it, doesn't it suggests to you that it isn't even about Comey. It's about anything that you, as president, do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's true. Number one, they're hypocrites. But it's beyond being a hypocrite. You have these tremendous... the level of hatred toward him, especially during that period of time with Hillary Clinton, where he gave her a free ride. I mean he gave her a free pass like nobody's ever, ever gotten, a free pass. And during that period of time, the level of hatred by the Democrats -- also the Republicans, to be honest -- because, you know, first she got a free pass, and then he came out with Comey two, and then he came out with Comey three, and the ultimate thing is he gave her a free pass, so they should have liked him.
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> But, but...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they should have liked him, but because he did what he did for her was unbelievable, with all of the guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty -- and then he goes, uh but she's not guilty. The fact is, that we're on to other things, and we had the right to do it. We made it. There is no good time to do it, Jeanine. What I'm most proud about is what's happening with the country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You look at jobs are way up, you look at what we're doing in terms of trade deals. It's going to be unbelievable, the trade deals we're making for this country. We have the worst trade deals ever made by any country, anywhere, and we're making them into great deals. The business that we're now reopening with China, that's been gone for many, many years -- especially when you look at natural gas, and especially when you look at... the deal we just made on cattle, it's really something special.
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> But the, but the problem is, all of the good things, and the good stories that you can talk about, whether it's a passage of the health care bill by the House -- you know, after the initial failure... well...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we're doing very well with health care. By the way. Well, it wasn't really an initial failure. It was just a continuation of a negotiation.
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> All right, granted.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we're doing very... I think we're doing very well with that. Now, that's before the Senate and I think the Senate is going to come up with some really, really great additions and changes and we're going to have a plan that's going to be really great. And by the way, Obamacare is dead. It's dying. I've been saying that for a long time. Now, Aetna just pulled out, the big insurance company just pulled out, and we have to come up with a plan because Obamacare is dead.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> Would you agree that but for you're getting totally involved in the House and working with the Freedom Caucus, and then the Tuesday group, you know, but for your being is hands-on and as involved, that House bill might never have passed?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I agree, but I will also say they're great people. I made so many friends. I read one story where this was like an indoctrination of Trump, because I didn't know a lot. You know, I was in business and I didn't know a lot of these Congressmen and Congresswomen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're great people. I met so many people that I really like, and it was very intense. You know, a lot of people are saying I wonder if Trump is very much involved. I was speaking to 30, 40, 50 a day. I got to know a lot of them really well, and they're great people. There... there... we have wonderful people representing this country, I can tell you.
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> But given what you took, it took you to really get involved to get the House bill passed. Doesn't that suggest that in order to get your agenda accomplished that, same kind of hands-on has to apply to Democrats and across the aisle?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they're obstructionist. I mean what they want to do is obstruct and delay, and I'm actually very surprised with Chuck Schumer, because I know him. I've known him for a long time. I cannot... I really am surprised that he's become such... you know he's gone so far left in order to get into the Elizabeth Warren group that I think he's hurting himself. I think he's hurting the Democrats very badly, but he has really been brought to the left. And I also don't think they can win any more elections unless they start changing their tune.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But they become very obstructionist, and all that means is delay and all of the things that they do and, you know, we're going to end up winning. We've been winning. We won, and now you look, we have the House, we have the Senate. Don't forget, before the election the Republicans were going to lose the Senate, they're going to lose the house and they're going to lose, of course, the presidency, and that was two weeks before the election.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was watching your show, and you were like... not happy. I have to say, I know you're fair and balanced and all of that stuff. But you weren't exactly thrilled by the numbers that you were seeing, and that last two to three-week period was sort of amazing, what was going. Because you started seeing very good... numbers started...
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> Change.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But... but the point is, that we were supposed to lose all three. And not only do we lose all three, they said it will be perhaps the greatest election failure in the history of this country. And I said well that's bad. But I worked very hard, and we ended up winning all three instead of losing all three.
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> Right
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it became one of the great successes. I will tell you, and I think they're doing even better than that...
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> But given, given the fact... But Mr. President, your... your agenda is not getting out, because people are caught up on the... the Comey issue, and ridiculous stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I agree, I agree, I agree. I think...
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> How do you get rid of Comey, who in your press office says one thing, the Vice President says another thing. How do we resolve that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that is an interesting situation. I actually said today, let's not ever do any more press briefings. You know they're getting tremendous ratings, and the especially the fake media, there... they're going crazy, they are going crazy. And they'll be in the room, and you have to see the way they ask questions, I want I want... screaming, and there's never been anything like this to get like a question out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And in all fairness to Sean, and in all fairness to Sara Huckabee, and in all fairness to anybody that stood up there, they don't know me. I'm a very active president. I'm doing like, I'm dealing with China, I'm dealing with Japan, I'm dealing with North Korea, I'm dealing with all of these different things. Russia came in to see me, the Foreign Minister the other day, and right after that, they didn't say this, but right after that the Foreign Minister from Ukraine came in. I said, fellas you got to make peace, you got to get peace. They only talked about Russia coming in, okay?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we took pictures, they took pictures. We released the pictures, they made a big deal out of it. Everybody knew he was coming, and he was scheduled to come. But they didn't talk about Ukraine. The point is this: when we have those press conferences, I actually said we shouldn't have them, because Sara Huckabee said...
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> But let's, let's... But for 100 years we've been doing this. You can't put an end to that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but listen, no no. But there's never been action like this. This is crazy. I mean, we're getting higher ratings...
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> But would you seriously consider...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're getting higher ratings on those press conferences...
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> But would you seriously consider stopping these press sessions?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, we'd do it in a different way.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> How?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We'd do it, we'd do it through a piece of paper, with a perfectly accurate, beautiful answer. I'll give you an example.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> In writing?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are asked 100 questions, or 50 questions, or 20 questions. If they get one out of fifty, just a little bit off, 5%, 10%, 20%, it's... the next day it's a front-page story in every newspaper.
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> Right, right, so?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, press conferences weren't even covered for Obama practically. They were on C-SPAN and C-SPAN2, when you know, there was nothing going on.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> But will you put an end to that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But wait a minute, my press... these press conferences are like the biggest thing on daytime television.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> They are
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay, you see the ratings, they're blowing away everything on just about... everything on daytime television. What I'd love to do is stop them. It's not fair to the people. I'll give you... look, I am a very active person. I have a lot of very positive things going on right up here for this country. It's impossible for a person or two people or three people who are press people, to cover every aspect of what I'm thinking, and what I'm doing, and I think it's unfair. And if they get it just a little bit wrong, they don't mean to, they're liars. They're liars. They're horrible people. They're liars, the press goes, and it becomes a big story for two days or three days, and it's very, very unfair to a person in that job
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that's really a tough job to be on, especially for me because I'm having meeting after meeting. I'm cutting the price of the airplanes with Lockheed. I'm cutting the price of airplanes with Boeing. I'm doing all of these things. I'm making deals for China... with China. I'm trying to solve a problem in North Korea, which by the way, is a really big problem.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> But are you, but I want to get into North Korea, but are you moving so quickly that your communications department cannot keep up with you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, that's true.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> So, what do we do about that, because...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Maybe we don't have press conferences, and we do...
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> You don't mean that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What... just don't have them, unless I have every two weeks and I do myself. We don't have them. I think it's a good idea. First of all, you have a level of hostility that's incredible, and it's very unfair. Sarah Huckabee is a lovely young woman. You know, Sean Spicer, he is a wonderful human being. He's a nice man.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> Is he your Press Secretary today and tomorrow?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, he is, sure.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> Will he be tomorrow?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, he's doing a good job, but he gets beat up...
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> Will he be there tomorrow?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, well, he's been there from the beginning. I mean...
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> Is he, is he, in the, what do they say, in the woods?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, he just gets beat up by these people, and again, you know, they don't show the 90 questions that they asked and answered properly. I'm saying if they're off just a little bit, just a little bit, it's a big story.
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> When will you make a decision as to whether or not you have...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, and, here's the thing. The difference between me and another President, another president -- I won't use names -- but another President doesn't do what I'm doing. They really don't. I'm not saying that in a bragging way. I'm not saying it in any way. Another President Jeanine will sit in the Oval Office and do practically nothing all day. I'm doing every minute of the day. I'm doing something. I'm cutting prices up, whether this nation has such unbelievable potential. The thing is they can't keep up with it, and I'll be honest, they do their best. If they give an answer, and if it's a little bit off, they're liars and horrible things.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's really unfair. I would... I would recommend we don't have it.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> When will you make that decision?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Over the next couple of weeks. I'll tell you what, they'll be very unhappy because the ratings are so high, that I don't know what these networks are going to do. They're going to start to cry.
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> Let me, let me ask you this, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They get the free ratings because of me, and yet they don't treat us fairly.
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> Mr. President here's the bottom line. You've got this Russia story that is causing a... Corey Booker said the other day the Russians are coming. I thought it was 1950 and I had to run under the desk...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know. Corey Booker ought to get his address right, where he lived, when he ran for Mayor. That's what he ought to do.
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> Why, he didn't live in the right place? But, let me finish my question.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Check it out. Check out the old publicity.
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> Let me finish my question. Wouldn't it be better, because all of the successes that we can talk about are being overshadowed by this Russia story.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By fake news.
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> By fake news, to have an independent commission, you were convinced you did nothing, and...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am not convinced. Clapper is convinced, other people are convinced.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> DNI, oh yes, everybody said the same thing, so get it out of the White House.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everybody is convinced, they say there is no collusion. You know the expression? They're all saying, there is no collusion. There is no collusion.
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> Precisely.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'd like it to move fast, if possible. But I'll tell you what I really want... There is no collision. We had nothing to do with Russia, and everything else, but there is a question. Was it Russia... who was it that went in and tried to hack? Now...
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There are other questions too Jeanine, why didn't the DNC, the Democrats, why didn't they allow the FBI to check their server. They wouldn't allow them to check.
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> Right
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And why didn't the FBI insist on checking this?
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> They have subpoena
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They have very powerful subpoenas, so Podesta -- who, by the way has a company with his brother, as I understand it, in Russia -- I mean those are the ones they should be checking. But with all of that being said, what I want and I think it's very important... I want to get to the bottom, if Russia or anybody else is trying to tamper or play with our election. To me that is very important.
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> Okay, so get it out of the White House. Do an independent commission, and then you can get your agenda out there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're right. Well, you're right but all it is is more time. I'll tell you what, you have it before two -- you have it before the House and you have it before the Senate.
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> Right
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know some of the people on those Commissions are highly -- they're very ethical people, very talented, very smart people. I think let them just do it. You know, they've been doing it for a long time. I'd love to see...
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> They may never be finished. How do you prove a negative? How do you prove that you weren't involved? This could go on for 10 years...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it's been proved already, and to be honest with you, I want it to be accurate also. I want them...
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> Of course.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...to devote the time they need. I'd like it to go fast, but more important to me, much more than speed. I want them to be sure that Russia or anybody else, that if it did happen, if there was any -- and everybody also agrees by the way it didn't change the election...
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> Right, right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It didn't change the vote. So that's important. That's important to me. But I don't want it ever to be even a question again. So if it takes longer, let it take longer, but let them do the job right.
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> At the risk of the country not being able to see your successes. Look, we're coming up to January of 2018. We're talking midterms soon, unless we get, let this... the promises to the American people, health care tax reform, how are you going to... how are you going to that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know. Well I'll give you an example.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> You got to work with these people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, we made... we made that incredible deal with China last night at 11 o'clock, right? And the front page of the papers had more to do with unimportant stories than that, okay? And I think that's very unfair...
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> It is. But you can't change that unless you take that off the table.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But that's the way... Well I think it's going to be off the table as soon as they announce the result. Hopefully they announce the result quickly. I'd like to see it quick, but it would all due respect I want to see it done properly. I don't want to be in a position where something took place having to do with Russia -- or any other country or any other person -- who knows, but I don't want to be in a position where it's not done correctly. So let them do it correctly. Let them take their time.
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> You're talking about the House, the Senate, the FBI...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...to do it correctly. I'm talking about the House, the Senate, the FBI...
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> So no independent commission?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think you need it. I mean honestly, whatever's going to do the best, but I don't think you need it.
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> But they're playing politics, can't you see that? It's stepping on your success.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I see, I see a lot of things.
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> Yesterday, the Department of Justice nullified the Eric Holder and the Obama marijuana drug politics.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know.
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> Yesterday, 1,400 gangbangers arrested, in the biggest sweep in American history...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know, and you don't read about it the way you should. That's on page ten.
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> ...and what, and all of this is being subjugated to ridiculous stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Can I be honest with you? I think the people are seeing it though, Jeanine?
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> You do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think the people, you know, I have a very strong base of incredible people. I think they know what's going on. I had dinner with a group last night that, just great people, great friends. And they come in and they're very angry about what's going on. They're angry from the other... from our standpoint. They're very angry about what's going on. I think that people see it. I think the people see our successes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hey look, putting the Supreme Court judge on within a hundred days, and I don't mean just nominating, having him confirmed, and he's going to be great. And so many other things. We've done, you know... they said we did no legislative work. We signed 32 bills. Jeanine, did you hear that? 32 bills, and they were saying a couple of weeks ago, during the hundred days we signed none. Not everybody was saying that, but some were saying it.
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> Right
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We signed 32 bills. That means went through Congress and signed it. In addition, we freed up this system which was all glued up, so the people can build houses and they can build factories, and they can build so much. Our trade deals are about to come, they're going to be unbelievable. I mean, we're doing things... and I honestly believe that people see it, but there's no question, it would be wonderful to go fast, but I want it to be done right. [Break]
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> What about the new director for the FBI? You're looking for someone now.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> Will, before we...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> To me that's one of most exciting questions you can ask, if you want to know the truth.
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> Okay, good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have some great candidates. We're interviewing people. We're going to pick somebody who is outstanding. That's what we want to get.
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> Will you ask for loyalty and fidelity?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want loyalty to the country. I mean, I want loyalty to the United States of America. I want him to do a good job, or her to do a great job.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> So, when people...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we have some wonderful candidates.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> People suggest that the question that apparently The New York Times is selling, that you asked Comey whether or not you had his loyalty was possibly inappropriate. Did you see how they would think that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think... I read, I read that article. I don't think it's inappropriate, number one.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> Did you ask that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no I didn't. But I don't think that's a bad question to ask. I think loyalty to the country, loyalty to the United States is important. You know, it depends on how you define loyalty, number one. Number two, I don't how that got there, because, I didn't ask that question.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> What about the idea that, in a tweet you said there might be tape recordings...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That I can't talk about that. I won't talk about that. All I want is for Comey to be honest and I hope he will be. I'm sure he will be. I hope.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> So, this new director of the FBI, will be someone from within the ranks? Will be someone, a lawyer like Comey or have you had...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll tell you, we have a lot of choice. Everybody wants the position. It's a great position to have and we have extremely capable people, in some cases, people of, you know, great prestige, actually. People of, who have had tremendous careers would like to do it.
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> When do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We gonna have somebody fantastic.
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> When do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Fairly quickly.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we, I think we owe it to the public to do it fairly quickly.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> And, you know, do you think the Senate will confirm?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. Oh yeah. I want to pick somebody that can be confirmed. Look, I thought this would be a very popular thing that I did when I terminated Comey. Because, all of the Democrats couldn't stand him. But because I terminated him, they said, ahh, we'll get political points. We'll go against Trump. So, I assumed it would be fairly popular, and they got together and said, again, we're talking obstruction.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is total obstruction. Uh, they got together and they, all of a sudden, they love... you know, it's sort of funny, when you listen to Schumer and you listen to the other people talking about Comey, but then you back a few months and you get their statements from a few months ago... and they, they couldn't stand him. So it is very interesting think.
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> Will you be able to work with Schumer after all the horrible things he said about you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's pretty tough to work with him. I'm surprised, because I've known him for a long time.
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Again, he's gonna very, very far left. He does not have good control of his party. He is not a good leader. I think it will be tough for me to work with him. We'll see. Hopefully what will happen is in '18, we gonna elect some Republican senators, because only have a margin now of two. We're gonna elect people, some people, some more Republicans and we will be able to do it without having to go through that situation with Schumer. Because, honestly, they just want to stop things, they want to clog up the wheels and we cannot let that happen.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> I interviewed General Kelly last week or the week before, and he said that he can see, in your first term, the North Korea having the ability put a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's what they want to do.
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> That's terrifying.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They should have been stopped a long time ago. They should have been stopped by Obama. They should have been stopped from before Obama.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> So what are you going to do about it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I remember when Clinton wrote in his book about the wonderful deal they made with North Korea. They started making missiles the next day and nuclear the next day.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> What can you do about this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can't talk to about that, but I think we're having some very, very good thoughts.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Are you going to build that wall?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to build the wall, absolutely. Is there question about that? There's no question about it. We're going to build the wall.
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> I sat with the parents of a young girl who was murdered by MS-13.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right, sure. Horrible group of people.
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> I cried with the parents.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> You made this huge sweep, yesterday. A couple of days ago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We are sweeping them the hell out of the country. They are being swept out of the country so fast. You know, we go into to towns like in Long Island, I grew up, essentially on Long Island.
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> Where you grew up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...and we go into towns that I have known, and the towns are living in fear. They're like occupied camps.
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> They're petrified.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And General Kelly goes in with his guys, and they are tough, too. They are tougher, believe me. This MS-13, somebody said they are the equivalent of Al-Qaeda in terms of their mentality and toughness. And we go into to towns and the people are cheering as we take these people and throw them into the vans. They're cheering. It is almost like they have been freed or liberated. This is in the United States. And under Obama, they were just pouring in. So, MS-13, we have thousands of them in this country. They are going very, very fast.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> Okay, and finally, you're going to the Middle East.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> Saudi Arabia, Israel, and then Rome.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Rome, right. And then we are going to the big, the big conference of our countries that we want to help the world. But we are...
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> What are you going to accomplish?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we are going to accomplish a lot of things. We've established great relationships with a lot different countries that frankly we didn't have. You know, one thing I did is Aya. You know about Aya?
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Young girl, who was in an Egyptian prison. President Obama worked three and a half years to try and get her out. He was unable to get her out. I had a meeting with General El-Sisi of Egypt and within one minute, we made an agreement and she was released. She was there... going to be there for 28 years. She is a wonderful young person. And I will tell you, I was very honored by what General El-Sisi did. Not only her, but her husband out and a total of eight people out. They were going to be there for many, many years in an Egyptian prison.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The past administration worked on it for three years, three and half years to be exact. They were unable to do a thing. I got them out in less than one minute. And That's what we need.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> Given your ability, your successes, all of the things that you can talk about for two hours here. How are we going to get that across to the American people?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hope that they understand it. I hope that they see it. Again, this was a... a plan to... because, this was just an excuse that the Democrats came up with for losing an election. They lost an election, they lost it badly, and this was just an excuse for losing the election, and I think people are seeing through it. I really do. I believe people see through it.
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> Your daughter-in-law Lara, who is pregnant with a boy, talked about her first introduction to the Trump family was the friendliness and the camaraderie at family dinners. I've even had occasion to be at some of those dinners. Do you still have those dinners here at the White House?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We do, to a lesser extent, because of the time and the busy. I'm very.. I tell you what, I am really going at it. I'm busy from early in the morning...
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> I know you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> until late at night, because I took over a mess. This was a mess, whether it's trade or whether it's Obamacare, which is so disastrous, or whether it's any one of so many things I could name. I took over a mess, so I don't have much time, but we do do it as much as possible.
<Jeanine Girro> <Negative> You talked about your brother Fred when I interviewed you a year and a half ago, two years ago. What, what would Fred think of all of this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He'd be very proud. He had a very profound impact on my life, and I learned a lot from Fred, and he'd be very proud. He was a great guy.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> What is he telling you now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He had... He had a whole.... He's telling me just keep doing what you're doing, because we're having a great impact. We're going to have, I think, I would love to say one of the truly great impacts of any President on the lives and the betterment of lives of the people of this nation. Fred would be looking down and he would say keep going. And I would tell you if it were different, if I thought he would be looking down and say you can do better here or there. I think he'd be very proud of the things that we've accomplished, having to do with everything from jobs to the military, to the borders -- you see what's happening on the borders.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> 70% reduction.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> To frankly we're going to have to solve some big problems, like the North Korea problem that we've been talking about, but I think he'd be very proud all right.
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> All right, Mr. President, thank you...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Jeanine Girro> <Neutral> ...for having us here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much Jeanine
<Jeanine Girro> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you.
<Sarah Mock> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you so much for having us here in the Diplomatic Reception room of the White House. It's a pleasure to join you today. We want to jump right in you made a big announcement yesterday that was very exciting for rural America. You announced the U.S.-Mexico Trade Agreement.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sarah Mock> <Negative> Could you just tell us a little bit about what farmers and ranchers can expect to see in that agreement?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, for one thing, we're going to get rid of barriers and we're going to open up markets, and it's going to be a great thing for farmers. And farmers were really at the top of my list, because I think they've been treated very unfairly for many years, including by NAFTA, but very unfairly for many years, because they have barriers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You look at what's going on with Canada, where they get charged almost a 300 percent tariff to send dairy products in, and I was witnessing that. I saw that. I love the farmers. They supported me, and I always told them we're going to get this done one way or the other, and it's going to be good for the farmers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We also help them a little bit, as you know, through our great Secretary Perdue and to the tune of four billion so far, because we want to help. They deserve help, because they were targeted by China, and probably others, but now it's all coming back and it's coming back strongly, and I said just stick with me for a little while, and we're a little ahead of schedule.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In Mexico, the deal is signed and it's going to open up Mexico even more, and it'll be far better than NAFTA, and we're working on the European Union also, where they have very very strong trade barriers up with the farmers can't get their product in, and we're working on Canada.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Canada, we just said look, if you don't do something about these barriers that you have in these tremendous tariffs that you have for our farmers and others then we're not going to be making a deal, we're just going to tariff you coming back in, because Canada has been very rough on our farmers, and you go to Wisconsin, you go to Iowa, you go to Upstate New York and different places where you have very big farm communities. They've been treated very I would say in a rough manner by Canada, and hopefully that'll end. We have meetings today with Canada.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They came down to see us about trying to get into the deal right now. We're not letting anyone else in the deal because of the fact that we want to make sure our farmers are properly taken care of and if they're not going to be properly taken care of, we're not going to do the deal.
<Sarah Mock> <Positive> Well, and Mexico, of course was a big part of this, and you talked yesterday at your press conference that Mexico is also going to look into buying more agricultural products.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Sarah Mock> <Negative> And, of course they also -- I'm curious, are you planning to, steel and aluminum tariffs have caused them to apply some tariffs to U.S. farmers. Any chance... plans to take those down now that an agreement has been reached?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, an amazing thing has happened Sarah. Our steel industry was dead. It was going to go out of existence, and you know, we need steel, if you think about it from a military standpoint, from any other standpoint, we need -- from a defense standpoint, we need steel.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I put tariffs on for steel and for aluminum our steel mills are booming. It's probably the biggest expansion industry and the country right now. The steel is booming. We're making steel again and I will tell you that prices are going to start to come down because, as an example, U.S. Steel opened up six plants. They're spending billions of dollars ,other companies are spending hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars and steel has become one of the hottest industries right now. That's a beautiful thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we have to remember that I would say that automatically tariffs are going to start coming off products that we send to other places. There's only a small amount of farm products that are affected by the tariffs having to do with steel, but we're very proud of what's happened with the -- and even the farmers will ,you know, ultimately, if we need it for defense we needed it for, and we have to have a steel. You can't -- there are some industries you can frankly do without.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This country has to have steel and it has to have aluminum. We needed for so many different things, but we do need it for our military. We have to be able to buy it. We can't buy everything from China or other places, but I think you're going to see a tremendous opening up of the markets for the farmers. That was very important to me.
<Sarah Mock> <Negative> Absolutely. So many farmers, of course of always have also been very much the tip of the spear when it comes to China. They've been -- they've been hurting a lot of ways, and your Administration announced yesterday the trade aid package at the USDA. Could you just -- what's your message to farmers who were facing five years of declining prices but... and, and now China is penalizing them even further?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right, well when I ran, as you remember and I've always said if you'd go from election day five years back take soybeans. It's dropped in half. That had nothing to do with me. So it came down, and I guess you figure you would know this better than anybody, but 15 years of declines in terms of farmers. They've had 15 years straight years in terms of decline.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Part of the reason is that we they're very highly tariffed in Canada and other places and they also have other types of barriers. I call tariffs a barrier to a certain extent, but they have other types of barriers. I think the farmers are going to do fantastically well. We're opening up markets that they never had before. China has -- we have a trade deficit with China the likes of which nobody's ever even conceived of before.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It'll be at least $375 billion. Somebody had to do something now. The farmers -- there are big barriers, big tariffs. I opened it up for cattle, as you know, I got that done for beef, and a lot of good things are going to happen. You know, this doesn't happen overnight. You can't just go in and say China's been hitting our country very very hard for a long period of time for many many years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Actually, it would be more than a decade, and really probably, if you look, at least 25 years, and they've been taken out billions and billions of dollars and I've said in my campaign we have to stop. We can't let this continue and the Chinese have -- well, then they're going to go after our farmers because they know I love the farmers and the farmers love me. I mean, you look at the vote and all I'm saying is that look at what happened with Mexico. We've taken down barriers. We've opened it up. We've expanded the market. They're going to now buy much more from our farmers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are agreeing to buy much more farm product from our farming areas, and with China it's going to be the same thing, and I will say this: I've heard soybean prices to starting to move up, and a lot of other prices are starting to move up, and that's way ahead of schedule, and I'm really happy about it. But I view the farmers really great patriots. They really great patriots, they understand it and there will be a little pain. It could be that that pain is going to end much sooner than we think.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's why I'm glad that we did the deal with Mexico and I have a feeling we'll probably be able to do a deal with Canada. But only if they treat our farmers well. And China, that's the big one, and we're doing well. Our country is up $10 trillion and China's down $20 trillion, and -- just in the last number of months, and I want China to do well, but they have to treat us fairly.
<Sarah Mock> <Positive> I'm curious as well. RFD-TV is hosting a rural town hall next week on the Renewable Fuel Standard.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sarah Mock> <Positive> Farmers who are losing markets elsewhere are very interested to hear what your Administration plans to do on E-15 year-round, and kind of the ethanol question. Any updates for them on that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, I've been very loyal to ethanol, as you probably know and they've been terrific people. I -- they back to me, and for Iowa in primarily, if you really look, it's Iowa and a couple of other great places, and they were all for me, and I've been very loyal, and I'm going to be making some statements on that very soon.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're working very hard on the ethanol situation. It's very complex, because as you take care of ethanol something else gets hurt, you know all about that, but I've been very good for ethanol, and they're talking about moving it up to 15%, and they're talking about 12 months as opposed to much less than that, as you know, and I'm looking at both of those situations. I've been dealing with Senator Grassley and Senator Joni Ernst and they're terrific people, and I think we're going to come to a very good solution for the farmers.
<Sarah Mock> <Neutral> Kind of related to that. Rural infrastructure is obviously a key issue for folks --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sarah Mock> <Negative> -- whether it's roads and bridges or schools and hospitals, rural communities across the states are hurting. Any update on -- we talk -- we heard about an infrastructure package last year. Any update on where that might be?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, right after the election, we're going to start on it right. Now, the Democrats are obstructionist. All they want to do is obstruct and that's what they do. They don't have good policy. I don't know if they're good politicians. I would say maybe not. But the fact is all they do is obstruct and you know, their... their whole big slogan is resist. Ours is make America great again. Theirs is resist. We're going to be doing something very dramatic right after the election.
<Sarah Mock> <Positive> Absolutely. Well, Mr. President, I want to thank you again for inviting us here to the White House, and on behalf of everyone in rural America, thank you so much for your attention to just these issues that are so important to folks around the country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I love Rural America, you know, they were with me and I'm with them all the way. A hundred percent.
<Sarah Mock> <Positive> Thank you so much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you Sarah.
