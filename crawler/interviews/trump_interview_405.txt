<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well Donald Trump.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So how's my friend doing?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's the Donald.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> The Donald. By the way...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hi, Robin. How are you? You called about this Howard K. Stern...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I will say, you've got to get rid of this name.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you hear what I did?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You have to change your name out.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, did you hear what I did? I called AP this morning. I said like Donald Trump, you know his wife used to call him the Donald. I am now going to be known as the Howard.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Well, there's something with that guy that it's good, more than meets the eye. There's something bad about him.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Howard K. Stern? Yes. I had a run-in with the guy on the air. I just saw him this morning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've never felt -- this guy is weird.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You know what's weird about it, though? It's like you know the name Trump. You know, you build it up. I was was on -- where is it? Riverside Boulevard. There's 3 Trump buildings in a row.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And it's like, wow. You know, Donald really does have a lot of buildings, and each lobby is nicer than the next.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, let me tell you what he's doing. He's all -- he's international at this point.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes, I know. So...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm going all over the place. But Howard K. Stern is international.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> That's true.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, but imagine, it's like all of a sudden, some guy named Donald Trump...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Is in a middle of something like this.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And he's a flaming asshole.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I wouldn't be happy. I wouldn't be happy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. Just because...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I wouldn't be happy. I wonder -- I assume that was his original name. I assume that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But let me ask you something. In a way, isn't it good, too, that like -- imagine like, let's say the guy's name was Don Imus.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And every minute on the news, it was Imus. Imus. I would go mad. I'd be kind of [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And as his stock goes up, you've got to figure, right?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah. I'm like thinking like anybody who hasn't come to satellite yet that's hearing Howard Stern, Howard Stern.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I guess you could look at it both ways, Howard, but there's something about that guy, seriously, that I think he's just bad news.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. It...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, all of a sudden, the kid, the young 20-year old boy, he goes -- and a lot of people said, he had an overdose and who gave it, and Howard Stern was with him in all this.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Howard K. Stern.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And then they said, Anna was angry at Howard K. Stern because of the son. Then was he involved? And then all of a sudden, she goes, there's something bad about this guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Somehow, he's the only one left standing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right, let's say he's good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then somewhat like his whole life was devoted to her, and I mean, it's like, give me a break. You know, look -- I mean, look, I knew Anna, and you knew Anna. And it's somebody that you sort of had a -- you've felt very sorry for. But it's hard to devote your entire life to it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> One of the all-time -- of course. One of the all-time beautiful faces, right, in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> All time.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And you know, not bright...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Not bright, but you know, maybe smarter than we think. I don't know. But not bright.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's what Donald said over the weekend. I was like, what?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, maybe. I mean, I wouldn't know what her SATs were, but you -- but Donald Trump makes...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know a lot of beautiful models. And they're saying, "Oh
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, but Donald, you make a good point.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I [Inaudible] to say, you know, not bright. They talk about Paris Hilton. Is she bright? Is she not bright? Well, you know, I don't know. I know her from the time she's like 10 years old or younger, and she's making a hell of a living.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's true. But you know, you make a good point. You're sitting here and you're analyzing Anna Nicole Smith, and then you look at this Howard K. Stern guy. He's a lawyer and his only client is Anna Nicole Smith.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It get's even creepier, even creepier.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Howard is a loser. He's a loser. I think he's some kind of a degenerate, in my opinion.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And his whole life evolved around her.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Let me tell you something, Donald.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And by the way, I give him zero, that it's his baby.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right. Nobody believes that but him.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Me, too. I was going to ask you that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I give him zero. I think it's the other kid's baby.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Birkhead?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I think the Zsa Zsa Gabor guy. I mean, that -- the Zsa Zsa Gabor loser came out...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Husband. Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The prince?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Have you known him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Imagine, you're married to somebody and you announce that you think it might be your baby, that's wonderful.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you know Zsa Zsa Gabor's husband.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Loser.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. Now how...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, let me tell you something about Howard K. Stern. I just read that he opened a talent agency just for Anna Nicole. I think that was even before he met her.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I don't know, but hey, let me ask you something.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> This guy is a sicko, in my opinion. And I'll tell you what, and I really meant zero chance. No, I think the baby is probably the blond guy. Okay?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Uh huh.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Any chance it could...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> The baby is from the blond guy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Howard K. Stern, whatever the hell his name. Is that his real name, by the way?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's what I'm questioning, too. Is Howard K. Stern...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> To my frustration, you were extremely hot. You've always been hot. And all of a sudden, he changes that. Who knows? It probably is. It probably is.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What are the odds of somebody both naming their kid...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There's not a lot of people who change their name to Stern.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Maybe it was Stern and he changed it to Howard. I don't know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. But boy, I'll tell you what, that guy is bad news. And right now, I think of you every time I see him on television. I think of you and I'm saying, he can't be thrilled.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No. I'm laying in bed all week, and I go, I built up the name Howard Stern. I've told this story earlier. Dee Snider's twisted sister said to me once, you've actually kind of made the name Howard cool. That's a shitty name. You got stuck with a shitty name, but you know, it's like how Bruce Springsteen made Bruce kind of cool because that's another shitty name. And he said, you kind of pulled it off. And I'm sitting there watching it all go down the drain because of Howard K. Stern and Dee Snider...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Howard, for years you've been criticizing him, right? For years you have not been a fan of his.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know a loser when you see one, right?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How would you feel if he became the hot Howard Stern and you became the secondary?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's what's happening.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, they're calling him Howard Stern now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know. It's very tough.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What am I going to do?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I don't know what you're going to do, Howard. It's very, very tough.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It's a nightmare.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I don't know. I'm walking around feeling -- listen to this. And depending on what they find out about this guy, it could get worse.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In Australia? I just kind of figured, this story will eventually die. But in Australia, the newspapers are talking about how Shock Jock Howard Stern is claiming to be the father of the baby.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And I got letters from Denmark, as far away as Denmark, offering me condolences on losing my girlfriend.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> That's tough. How about all of the fathers that are stepping up? How about all of these guys and every one of them? Who really -- let's say a real player, a really cool cat, do you think anybody stands up, and as a news conference, did you think you might be the father?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Absolutely not.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Absolutely not.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, one thing about her, she had plenty of action. Do you think she actually had any action with Zsa Zsa Gabor's husband? Do you think he ever [Inaudible] her?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I do. I'm going to say yes, and I'm going to tell you what the story was that I heard.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Zsa Zsa -- Now you've met Zsa Zsa Gabor's husband?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've met him once.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. Because they say, he's not -- he's a prince, but the family bought the name. Like he's...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> He is not top of the line.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But they say that Anna Nicole Smith, being, you know, out of it as she was, she wanted to be a princess. So she was saying to him for 10 years, please marry me and make me a princess. She bought into the fact that he was a prince. And he said, he would not leave Zsa Zsa. And he offered to adopt Anna Nicole Smith, but Zsa Zsa was sort of against it because she's dying.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's actually what happened to his father. His father was adopted by whoever had a title.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is tha Zsa Zsa who was a tough woman, you know, tough and crazy. And she's now sitting in a wheelchair. Her mind is okay, but everything else has gone [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And she's watching this guy on television, announcing that this is his baby, and she's can't do anything about it. She's bound to a wheelchair. She can't move.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Today, I've got a tape of him...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You think she's happy right now, Howard?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No. I think it's a crazy world. I mean, I know...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Today, I've got a tape of him saying that Zsa Zsa is a little upset.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I always...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think she's a little upset. And you know, probably from his standpoint, it's very good there's not a thing she can do about it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I've always loved Zsa Zsa Gabor. I mean, I thought Zsa Zsa Gabor was a kind of a cool lady. Like she would come on talk shows and say whatever was on her mind. And she's got to be...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes. In a way, she was cool.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Her mind's got to be, like, just fuming.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But she was the one who married this dude and was walking around, telling people to call her princess.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know the toughest thing there? She was legit. She was a great beauty also.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And there's nothing good about the clock. Please remember that, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Don't I know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know you think we're all getting better-looking as we get older. There's nothing good about the clock. Take a look at Zsa Zsa.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, interestingly about Anna Nicole, I knew her model agency very well. She was with Elite when it was good. Now, it's not good. Now the Trump Agency is the hot agency, believe it or not. But she was with Elite Models. And a woman who read -- a French woman named Monique Pillard. She ran it. And I said to her about 10 years ago, I said, "Monique
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, it's true.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When she came to New York, I saw Anna Nicole Smith the first day or week that she was in New York. She was 6 feet tall. She had the best body. She had the best face. She had the best hair I've ever seen.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, hair is my thing. I'm really into hair up right now, okay? And she has the most beautiful -- I mean, she had the best hair, but she had the best face and the best body. You said, the best face. She had the best body.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She did.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Monique said that -- now, when she opened your mouth, it that was different. Let's face it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It ruined it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> When she opened her mouth -- because I said to her, "What did you do?"" She said
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wasn't anything more sad than watching her gain weight? I mean, it's almost like wasting that beauty and letting herself just get fat. Well, let me ask you this. How did she lose the weight, do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it was -- well, listen, I -- Do you think she had the operation?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I don't think she -- you know, it had to be, come to think, because...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I always said she had the operation. You know, I don't believe it was the product. And by the way, the products that she was endorsing was not in her refrigerator in the Bahamas. It was another product.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Slimfast, yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm sure they're thrilled.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well, they're claiming that somebody set up that picture that went in and changed the refrigerator around to embarrass Trim Spa. I don't know.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Probably not.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who knows? But I think you're right.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I think she had the operation.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I think you're right. In fact, they just found out that she had had 2 breast surgeries since the birth of her child.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You're kidding!
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think I read that in the paper today.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's crazy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She had some definite problems. But I think she had the operation. It was the only way. I have friends that...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You hung out with her?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you hang out with her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I knew her pretty well.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you ever bang her when she was hot?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. I never did.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you ever try to bang her?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, I knew -- I never tried. I never got past the mouth
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you think about it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I was -- maybe I was crazy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I was hoping you were the father of the baby.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Inaudible] our, I might have been the only one.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Did you ever fuck your girl's girlfriend?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you know, interestingly, I have friends that have been fat all their lives, business guys, they're slobs, and they've been really -- and not because they're fat, but they're tough, rough guys. They'll be making a deal and chugging down -- they're rich as hell, and they'll be chucking down hamburgers while they're making this. You know the kind of guy I'm talking about, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Their whole life, they're fat. Like 350 pounds, 300 pounds, and they're tough guys, smart guys. All of a sudden, this guy walks into my office the other day. I have 3 or 4 of them. And he weighed like 170. I said, what are you doing? He goes, "ahhh."" They don't want to admit to the operation because they'd look like
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why don't they?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That we gave up, and we're just -- they had their stomach removed.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But they never look good after they do it. You know what, they look worse, Howard. That's the one thing.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> They do. Know he doesn't want to. They And they're miserable.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And they gain -- look at this guy out of American Idol, the black guy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's fat again.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He's fat again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I tell you, they don't look -- It's true.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How do you eat? How do you at when...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's do important to look a certain way. Some of these guys, they lose 100 pounds, 150 pounds, and they look sick. They don't look...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you think Star Jones ever looked healthy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, she looks -- I don't think she looks as good.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She looks like a deflated prune.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, the -- so many people, when they lose this weight, this a large amount of weight, they never look good again. It's amazing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's right. Yes, it is amazing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank goodness, you don't have that problem, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, no. I don't eat.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> So listen, I feel sorry for you with the Howard K. Stern.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're thinking of me.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What do you think he has to do?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, what would you do if you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think he is responsible personally for the Anna Nicole tragedy. I think he's responsible.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, how do you -- let's be serious for a second. When you say responsible, here's a girl who is out of control. He's a hanger-on, all right? I would agree to that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, he's a total hanger-on-er, but I think he may be losing the power of the hanging on. And maybe...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're not suggesting you think he did something.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Do you think it's possible that he was feeding her the drugs? Do you think that's possible?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I mean, it's possible, But I don't think that's the case.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Look, all of the drugs they took out of the room...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'll tell you what, I think he's bad news. You know, if people called -- I know -- a lot of friends of mine, if people called Anna Nicole they couldn't get through another word. She was like the answering service. He would...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He blocked everything.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, but -- let's take a look at it this way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's not like he did a good job because look at the way she ended up. You know, it's one thing if she ended up and, you know, wonderful times, right? But she ended up the worst.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, I don't agree with you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This guy was like the secretary, the lawyer, the whole thing. I think he was a real sicko.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All of the drugs they took out of her room, they say, had his name on them, the hotel room.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I believe he's responsible for that very bad things that have happened to her.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And by the way, notice that I didn't bother you during the whole Rosie O'Donnell thing. You know what?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I appreciate that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm thinking if you wanted to call in about it, you would.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Is Rosie going to be next? Is she a mess or what? You look at that slob. Is she a mess...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You know, for years -- I've got to tell you something. As long as you're on the phone, I'll tell you. I had a feud with her for years, and I said some horrible things about her. And in fact, we even had a phony phone call to her on our show from the mayor of Philadelphia, and I calling her a fat slob, all kinds of wild things. And when I saw that -- when she came out of the closet, I felt better about her. I felt that she -- let me tell you my story. I thought that she was being honest about her sexuality. There was no more of this, you know, Tom Cruise is the most handsome man. And I felt that when I saw a special on HBO, where her and her girlfriend were...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Her wife.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Her wife.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Her wife. At that time, girlfriend, were really instrumental. They were experiencing a lot of homophobia. They took a cruise with a bunch of gay people, and the gay people were being attacked in the Bahamas by -- I think it was the Bahamas, but I don't know, one of these countries. And -- one of these islands. And they stood up and they really took a stand against homophobia. And they were taking a lot of shit. And my view of her softened. I felt -- I just ran into her at a restaurant recently, Nobu, and we sort of made our peace. And I told her I was very proud of that special...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, but she did that for her own. Let me tell you, she's a bad person. I know her. She's a bad person. She's a -- it's interesting. When I was doing one of the shows, The Today Show, one of the cameraman came up to me. He said, "Mr. Trump please don't ever stop on Rosie."" I said
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She was always mean to the smaller people. She would treat us like dogs with her satire. She would curse at us. She would shout at us. She was sick. Please don't ever give up on her. She's a horrible person. This is the camera guy. You know, he's the camera guy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. No, I've heard those -- yes, I've heard those stories as well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's a horror show. She's bad news.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So what's the deal? You're going to -- is it going to be weird if you run into her somewhere?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. You don't t give a shit.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I don't -- Howard, honestly, there's billions of people in the world. I like some of them, okay? You know, just have 2 or 3 friends, you know? You're my friend. But the fact is, hey, Howard, who cares? I go on The Today Show, Meredith Vieira, and she says, "is it true that you called her crude?"
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said, "No. I called her a degenerate."" She's like
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right, right, right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. Did you call het fat? I said, let me ask you, "is she fat?""""I'd rather not answer that question."" I said
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Barbara Walters...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But [Inaudible] that person. You know what? Rosie is a bully. And as you learn from growing up in your wonderful school that you loved so much when grew up, you love that school so much, but when you have bullies, and I guess you didn't get the chance to hit them back. Basically...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, I ran.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Basically, you've kept that to you. But when you have bullies, you've got to hit them right between the eyes. And you know, I'm very happy she's fat.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, I think she's sorry. I think she's sorry she started it with you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh no, she doesn't want to -- let me tell you. She is a bad person. She hits Kelly Ripa. She hit Danny DeVito. How about Danny DeVito? Did you see that deal? [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I think -- yes, I saw that. Kelly Ripa -- I told Kelly Ripa to call in and argue that point because I said, "that's not fair."" Kelly Ripa was not being homophobic in the case of Clay Aiken. Clay Aiken was out of line
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He put his hand in her mouth.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yeah. That was disgusting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, look. I don't want somebody's hand. You don't even -- I don't want somebody's hand in my mouth.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I don't want to shake anyone's hand. People have germs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Excuse me, you and me both.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right. So I -- if I...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How about when she did that Tom Selleck -- do you remember that Tom Selleck?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, that was about the gun.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, she -- yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This poor guy goes in to talk about some movie or some television show and she starts hitting him, and he didn't know what happened.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, you didn't let that happen.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's still -- you know what, he's still wondering -- he's still walking around the streets saying, "What happened?"
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. So you said when this came out, you said, "Listen
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, well, I said I was going to fight back. You know, I understand her. I don't like her. She's not a smart person. You know she's not as smart. She's just a bully. She's a loudmouth.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Is there anything she can do to get back in your good graces?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> Nothing?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, no.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Blow you?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> If she came in and blew you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I'd pay a lot of money for that not to happen. That is one of the most unattractive people.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And speaking of...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know, she took great offense at the fact that I said she better be careful or I or one of my friends will go and pick up her wife.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Barbara Walters is...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Barbara Walters lied. I mean, barbara Walters picked me as one of the most fascinating people last year.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I wouldn't do that show. She asked me to be on that show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Barbara Walters last year, Howard -- I wonder if Barbara -- by the way, I way I wonder Barbara regrets having chosen me as one of the most fascinating.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> No. I don't think she regrets it, but I'm wondering what it's going to be like -- I bet you, two, will make up.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I tend to doubt it, really.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Really?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You and Barbara?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, somebody said to me, "Oh but you and Barbara were friends."" First of all
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So the lawyer said, "Please
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So I said, "Listen
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But you'll ignore her. You'll ignore her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Like she doesn't exist. She doesn't -- Howard, she lied. Now, at first, she lied, but she lied modestly. And I said, "I totally agree."" It's like
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yeah, but what about the people who came off and said you came off badly during the Rosie feud. They thought that you were too vicious. You know what they mean? Like...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think you have to be vicious when you're dealing with a vicious person.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I'm not -- I'm not that way. You have to be vicious when -- I went to the Wharton School of Finance. I was a great student. I got very good marks and all that stuff, and I sometimes explain that to people. Because sometimes, when you come off extremely vicious, it's not necessarily --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you get mails?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's not necessarily always your great intellect.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you get a lot of e-mails and stuff from people saying you were too vicious? Or did -- were some people against you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I got -- I would say 85 percent in favor of the way -- and I had a lot of good friends of mine saying, "Donald
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I say, because I have to.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Like, why not be bothered?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Genetically, I have to. It's not a question of, you know -- in other words, she makes statements about me that were totally false. They then corrected those statements. But you know what? There was not -- and said was angry, more angry at anything that I gave Miss USA a second chance. How do you like that one, by the way? Isn't that wonderful?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, I thought it was good. Best Friday to her the other night.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But that's how it started. Because she was angry that i gave Miss USA a second chance. I know I did the right thing in giving her a second chance.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Hey, I've got to ask you a question. I'm watching Jimmy Kimmel when Andy Dick put his hands on your daughter. And I said, "that was totally inappropriate."" She was a good sport about it. Were you..."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's a great kid. Well, he was seriously -- you know, at first I thought it was a stunt or a gimmick, but then when I watched the tape, I saw that he really had some problems.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Jimmy did the right thing, dragging him off the set.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. I did Jimmy Show, by the way. I did it about 3 or 4 weeks ago.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I thought he was great.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Jimmy is a good guy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He needed something that I didn't believe. Because I didn't really want to do that show because this was right in the heat of that stupid Rosie thing. And I didn't really want to do the show because he's on ABC, and they're on ABC and everything else, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I go on the show. And I agree to do it, and we were going to talk about it. And he actually totally took my side with Barbara against Barbara and Rosie. And he actually did a cartoon of Barbara with her nose growing. You know, meaning, that nose was growing in front of you. But Jimmy, I tell you, he was great. He was funny.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He did the right thing.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I really liked doing the show. I think the show is doing very well.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He did. It is. He did the right thing getting rid of Andy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Getting rid of Andy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Andy was being inappropriate with her.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. My -- when my daughter did the show, like 2 weeks later. And -- by the way, did my daughter looked beautiful?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Your daughter, I've got to tell you, man. And I know this would kill you, if I wasn't with Beth, I swear, I would make a play for her.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Even the thought of it kills me.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would be your son-in-law.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Really? That kills you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The thought of it kills me.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm going to tell you the truth
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have [Inaudible] respect for you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I think ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I love Beth, and I and I think it's -- I think you can do whatever the hell you want to Beth, and [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Then I'd be Howard Trump. But can I tell you something? Honestly...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I just -- the report. Listen now, there's a report that you're getting married, eh?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, we've we've talked about it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I always told you, you would eventually.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Sort of Robin. Hey can I -- but I -- can I tell you something now? I'm watching that with your daughter, and I go, "You know
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She speaks. She's got a ton of dough. I mean, you know, sort of.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's a great kid.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She's a great kid. What a great catch. I still think she got implants. She -- her chest looks bigger to me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ohh... But so what? They... Well, she hasn't told me about it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, that's nothing she's going to discuss with you. No, I don't think so. And can i tell you something? The face, gorgeous. The body, gorgeous. Bright. And I'm sitting here going, you know what, when I met her, there she is, put her on a mini skirt -- when I met her, I thought she was kind of saying to me, I like you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, that would make me thrilled.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And I know she would be with me...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And then I thought, I'm one of the guys that don't need your money, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, but what a rebellion it would be on her part to go out with me.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I wonder if I needed your money, would I go to it. I don't think so.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Why would you hate -- why would you hate, what would you hate...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can't do that. I couldn't do it. No matter -- hey, Robin, no matter what...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You wouldn't do that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> If I had Zippo, I'd say, Howard, take it away.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Keep your money.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why would you hate me being your son-in-law?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know. I can't even imagine -- it's just. You know why? Because you know I love you, but I've listened to you too many years...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Is it the Jew thing?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No. Stop it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, because a lot of the country club guys, they don't...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Stop it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I was waiting -- hey Howard, I was waiting for that question.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It could be, though.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I was waiting for that question.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But maybe he doesn't want to wake up in the morning and...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That is below the belt, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I can't believe she married a Jew.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you don't want to wake up in the morning and hear about how he had sex with her last night, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I don't think so. Well, yes. Even not hearing about it. Even the thought of it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> By the way, I would convert.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like him right where he is with Beth.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I would convert.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You would?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I would.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I tell you what. She is an outstanding -- you know she was a very, very model, top.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She's gorgeous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then at 18, at 18 years old, she cut it off. She went to Wharton.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The Wharton School of Finance, which is the best. Where I [Inaudible] in a row.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She's super super hot. Who is she seeing now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she went to Wharton. Well, she got all As.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who is she doing?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Well, the only thing that can hurt her, the only thing that will stand in her way is the wrong guy. You know that very well.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The only thing that will [Inaudible] -- and by the way, she [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Howard K. Stern? Who would you rather have, Howard K. Stern or Howard A. Stern?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would take you in a heartbeat, okay? Of those 2, reluctantly, I would go with you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You'd have to go with me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know, she's got all As. She's now in business and -- in my business with me. She's doing a great job with Don. And they're doing great, and they're brothers.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right, Let me give you theoreticals, hypotheticals.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Howard K. Stern or Jamie Foxx? Which -- who do you go with?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I like Jamie Foxx a lot.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But you know, it's Jamie Foxx.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, Howard. I would certainly go with Jamie Foxx.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You would?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh yes, and you knew I would say that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I mean, what -- he can say anything he wants just as long as he didn't bring Jamie Foxx home and really try to do him.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> You know what, Howard, I know what you're getting at. There is zero discrimination in my blood. You know, Howard.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know, i know. You're a good man.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Donald actually tole me that they tricked O.J. Simpson out of his country club because he didn't want his kind there. I said, "Really
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> O.J. Simpson actually went to my wedding. And I think he sat right next to you, did he?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He did. And I have a picture. The back of my book is a picture from him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Inaudible] Marla.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that was about 3 weeks before he killed his wife. That's right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> We know that well. He's killed her. . .
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I saw O.J. At a restaurant, that was at The Ivy, and I was with a group of like 7 or 8 or bankers.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How long ago?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're sitting -- this is, you know -- this is before the fact, before it happened.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Before's the murder.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he was talking very nice. You know, he was a nice guy. I mean, you know, he was a nice guy. But you know, somehow, I can't get over what he did. You know, it's like, hard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But she came up to him, Nicole, and she was at a table, and she didn't treat him very nicely. She was very, very, you know, like what are you doing? Get back to the table. And everybody sort of said, "wow
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But he -- you still don't do what he did, which he obviously did.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I mean, what did he do with that time, Donald? Did he just smile?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You know, he was embarrassed.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> And he was like, don't worry, I'm going to be killing you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm going to kill her.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I will kill her very soon. You're going to get it.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> He was very embarrassed. It was very embarrassing for him. She was sitting with her mother or something, and she was quite rude, unfortunately. And he was a little bit embarrassed. And that's something I never forgot. And you know, then shortly after that, the ultimate act took place. But it was -- what a mess that is.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. That's for sure. Well, it's weird. I mean, because we met him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, yes. He was a nice guy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Nice guy, charming, except for the murder thing.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> It. He was a great guy, other than a couple of murders.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, that's it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did he ever -- do you know...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] if you're from, like, where I'm from, the murders sort of do it. He called me once. He wanted to know if he could play golf.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> After the murder?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. I said, "I'm going to take a pass."
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He got on the phone with you personally? No, no. They just wanted to set up a golf match.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Somebody called for him. They wanted to know if they could -- because I play golf. He plays golf. You know.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh my god. Could you imagine if he did that...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I took a pass.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, that was a smart move. That was a smart move. You would have just come off looking like [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know the greatest is that where they say that O.J. Wasn't physically fit enough to have killed Ron Goldman, and you know, because Ron Goldman lifted weights and stuff. And I'll tell you a story. I was on the golf course, playing with O.J. You know, again, prior, of course. Because after, I just shut him off. It was over.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right, right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But -- because I was one of the most obvious murderers of all time. But I was on the golf course blank, and I'm playing with a guy, a friend of mine, who was like this really good athlete and he's, you know, physically fit, he's lifting weights, one of these guys.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is hot.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And O.J.'s in shorts. And O.J. Had these really skinny legs. He had -- you used to wonder, how could he drag 5 linebackers from Pennsylvania on his back for 10 yards. You know, because he's got these really thin legs, right? But you know, just -- he was an amazing athlete, an amazing runner, and a very powerful guy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, it was crazy.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> So even -- by the way, so a guy like that, an NFL guy like that, he could be in bad shape and old and he'd still kill a normal guy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right, yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's no -- there's not even a career.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I mean, the idea that he had arthritis was horseshit. I mean...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Well, the whole thing. So this was this was some -- a little bit before the murder. So what happens is my friend said, "there's no way
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You've got to trust me. O.J. Is sin fine shape.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, yes, Donald, must have been...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> So now I hear the stories about O.J. Couldn't have killed him because he wasn't strong enough, he wasn't physically fit.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's all bullshit.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. Donald must be sitting there during the trial...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> By the way, at 75 years old. O.J. Would have been able to kill him.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Of course.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right, saying O.J. Can't walk. O.J. is claiming he can't walk.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. They should have called you as a witness.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, no, O.J. Was one of the greatest running back of all time. And this guy was a guy that would go around you, but if necessary, he'd go through you. You know, in other words, one of the backs that had both qualities, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. No, he was one of the greats.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he would carry guys on his back. And everybody used to wonder, because he had very thin legs. You know, he had very thin legs. Everybody would wonder, how did those thin legs carry 4 or 5 linebackers? You know, it's pretty tough, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So O.J. At 75 would have no trouble, you know?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it's too bad it's too bad. It's too bad.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm glad you called in.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, it's nice to talk to you. I feel very sorry for you having to live with us Howard K. Stern thing. I think about you every time. And as you say, maybe it's a good thing for your career, Howard. But we don't have to worry about you. I think your career is blessed.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I look at -- exactly.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. But Howard thinks it's going to go away. I don't think it's going away.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I thin it's -- I think
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It's great to watch.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think [Inaudible] and you'll hear stories that he was the one that -- maybe you'll hear stories and he was the one that killed her.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I've got to tell you -- who knows? I got that. Even the mother mother thinks that he killed her.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't believe -- the mother had nothing to do with her.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> The thing is that when I turned on Fox News, if they didn't have on Anna Nicole this weekend, I didn't want to watch any of the story. I go to CNN, if they didn't have it, I go to MSNBC. And 9 times out of 10, MSNBC had something, so I stayed with it. Anything Anna Nicole
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't find it -- you now what, though, Howard, I don't find it that fascinating. You know, last week, before she died, Entertainment Tonight was doing -- your friend Pat, right? Entertainment Tonight was doing a lot of [Inaudible] on Anna, and I didn't find it...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Me neither.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I didn't want to watch it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Me neither.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I think it was the way she was talking. She was obviously drugged out. I don't think that was even alcohol. I think that was drugs, but she was horrible. And it looked like she had the lips pumped.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All of you many women listening, why do women have their lips pump. I think it's the most disgusting thing to look at these big, fat, pumped-up tires.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> By dying, she made herself interesting again, didn't she?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It was the best career move ever.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> But even even now, other than the basics, I don't find it -- I don't find it interesting like other stories for some reason. But maybe I must be in a minority because that's all they have.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I never did, but now, I find it interesting.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, I wasn't watching the stories before the death, but now I'm riving it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Way in.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't believe how much publicity she was getting before. I mean, over what? You know, you're trying to find out what. Why is she getting all this publicity?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And you couldn't figure it out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you know, one thing I've learned about your business, Howard, it's all about the ratings. If my feud with that slob, or if Miss USA or -- because that Miss USA became a huge story.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The one thing we know, if people aren't watching...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm more interested in her now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, by the way, she is beaut -- I should [ Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> She's a hot piece of ass. Get her in here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, the last time I put one of the people on your show, it was Miss Russia.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know, but that was the end.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I had to fire her.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, get that one on here. I want to talk to her because she's -- you know what? I feel bad for your Miss USA because this girl was having so much fun.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh, but she is one beautiful -- I tell you what, she is so beautiful...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I know, but she's got to be miserable now. She's got to be miserable now. She can't party.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we said, she could have certainly been Miss Howard Stern. We would never have stopped her fun.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No. If it was me. I would never even -- I'd go, "go ahead and do whatever you have to do
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right. If it was howard K. Stern, he'd bring her out of it.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But you were right. I mean, you've got a franchiser.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You wouldn't do anything to her, by the way, Robin, but just bring her out right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. That's true.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You know, that Miss USA...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I bet, I wouldn't be surprised if Howard K. Stern never got there with her.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, I don't think it at all.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I agree. I don't think he ever banged her.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I would be -- unless she was totally drugged out, I would be surprised if he ever even got there, let alone the kid. I mean, the kid is nonsense, right? But I would be surprised if he ever got there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I agree. Hey listen, I'm going to move on. But listen, thank you for calling. Good to talk to you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Good to talk to you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's great to talk to you both. I hope you're both happy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And do you think -- what about The Apprentice.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The Apprentice is doing great. It's on -- it was on last night. It's on Sunday nights at 9:00, and it's been doing really well.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Sunday nights, 9 o'clock, The Apprentice, everybody,
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right, hey, thanks, Donald. Come in here anytime. You know that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good luck with Howard K.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes, hey, I love you, too.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Robin, take care.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> All right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thank you, Donald. Right.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> Farewell.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> The Great Donald Trump.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> Didn't you say a couple of months ago...
