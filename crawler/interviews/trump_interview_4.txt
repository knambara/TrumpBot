<Bill Hemmer> <Positive> Mr. President. Thank you. Did we get out here in the light? Right about now -- a big part of your job is to be an optimist.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Bill Hemmer> <Neutral> You say that yourself.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My life.
<Bill Hemmer> <Positive> How do you, how do you figure out what's the level of optimism that's appropriate for the moment on the medical side? Health wise?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, we have to do what's right. Ultimately, for the country and for the people. And it's not even a question of optimism or pessimism. We have to do what's right for our country. And, you know, we have a very optimistic country, but this was a very sad thing that happened. It came from wherever it came from.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We won't even get into that. But this was a terrible thing that happened to our country. And it's a terrible thing that happened to, I guess, 149 other countries. Think of it. I mean, 149 countries are affected by this, but our people are incredible. And the way they've handled it and what they've done and what they've gone through is to me, it's it's really sort of shocking because as we discussed, they want to go back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They want to go back to their restaurants and they want to go back to their places where they work. They want it. This is our country was built on that whole concept. I never realized how much. But they want to get it back. But we have a great country and our people are just truly amazing people.
<Bill Hemmer> <Negative> You have, I've been with you for a few hours. You've called this the Chinese virus. You did not use that today.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well look, I have a very good relationship with President Xi. And they went through a lot. You know, some people say other things. They went through a lot. They lost thousands of people. They'd been through hell. And I've always said, you know, whether it's Ebola or so many, I could name 10 of them. You take our wonderful place in Connecticut.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm sure they're not thrilled about the Lyme disease rate, but they do name and after places it came from China.
<Bill Hemmer> <Negative> So you don't regret that language?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't regret it. But, you know, they accused us of having done it through our soldiers. They said our soldiers did it on purpose. What kind of a thing is that? And that was their paper. That was a paper. That's an organ for pretty much the top people. And I didn't like that. So I think, look, everyone knows it came out of China, but I decided we shouldn't make any more of a big deal out of it. I think I've made a big deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think people understand it. So that -you appeared when -- that all began When they said our soldiers started it. Our soldiers had nothing to do.
<Bill Hemmer> <Positive> So you you've pulled back from that today. And we'll, we'll see how that goes over time. Domestically, the Illinois governor had some harsh words for you, it appears, of patched up of the past 24, 36 hours. Yes. the amount protective gear they were getting or not. The Democratic governor from.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're there to help them. They have to get that gear themselves. We're there to help them. If they don't have like with Governor Cuomo, he had a chance to order 16,000 ventilators, the ventilators two years ago. And he turned it down. He turned down the chance. Now, he can't be blaming us, but we're there to help them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When we build these hospitals and what we're doing from New York and what we're doing from for California, I'll tell you, Gavin Newsom has been very, very gracious. And we you know, we've gone at it over the forest fires over the different things we've had our disputes but Gavin Newsom gets what we're doing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're sending the ship. We're doing one for New York also. It's going to head out in about three weeks. It's being finished up and loaded up. And it's a great thing for New York. But they shouldn't be hitting us. The fact is, we've done a lot with what we were doing.
<Bill Hemmer> <Negative> What about the Michigan Governor, just yesterday she was saying, you know, we we can get through the next shift. We can't get through the next day. What do you say to Governor Gretchen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're supposed to be buying this stuff over years? Their staff, they're supposed to look in all fairness to her. Nobody ever thought a thing like this could happen. We are talking about millions of masks and you're talking about all of the things you're talking about. But we're there to help them. We're not there to be their enemy, and they ought to treat us that way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We've done an incredible job. Now, I have to say, you mentioned, too. But for the most part, they were at the call the other day, two days ago, three days ago, I had all of the governors just about they were on the phone, 50 governors. And you saw that call? It was a very friendly call. I mean, they were really thankful for the job we've done.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We've done a great job and we've done a great job on testing, too. But we inherited a mess. We inherited a broken system that was OK. In all fairness to broken it, it was it was OK for a very small event. But that was it. It was a broken system, essentially.
<Bill Hemmer> <Positive> Let's come to today now. Take a little walk here. On the corner. What is your level of optimism with regard to a two trillion dollar package that may or may not pass in Congress? And how important is it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll say this. It's very important because we want to get our economy back. I think if it passes, we can be pretty quickly up to where we were and it actually gives us a step and a stepping stone. I think we're going to ultimately top where we were. But the longer it takes, the longer we stay out, the harder that is to do.
<Bill Hemmer> <Neutral> How much reservations do you have in spending two trillion dollars.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's not really spending because a lot of it a lot of it is helping companies. It's going to be loans to these great companies that all of a sudden for the first time in years, needed loans because of this tragedy, because of what happened. You know, the unseen enemy or whatever you want to say, silent enemy, you can call it a lot of different things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But these are companies that are great companies that employ tens of thousands, in some cases hundreds of thousands of people. We got to keep them in business. But what's going to happen is they're going to pay that back and they're going to pay it back with maybe stock in the company for the stock, for the shareholders and for the know for various.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to get stock for the people of our country, for the taxpayers of our country they're going to end up making a great deal.
<Bill Hemmer> <Neutral> Joe Manchin, the Democratic senators are saying it's loaded for corporations.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's loaded to save corporations. I mean, maybe he was a businessman. Maybe he wasn't. I don't know. But it's loaded to save corporations. Does Joe Manchin want all of these or many of these companies to go out of business? We'll have an unemployment rate, the likes of which nobody's ever seen before. We have to save these companies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These are companies that weren't in trouble three weeks ago. And now they're in trouble because of what happened. These are great companies. They're you know, that in some cases triple A companies. And we also then we can go to another extreme Boeing, which never had a problem in the history of their company virtually.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was like the perfect company then a year ago, you know, the problem they had and it was in trouble and this exacerbated.
<Bill Hemmer> <Neutral> How much money would you give Boeing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they're going to need a certain they're going to come up with a request and it's going to be really small compared to the numbers we're talking about. It's gonna be a small amount of money, but we're not letting Boeing go out of business.
<Bill Hemmer> <Negative> But Boeing is not the only one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no.
<Bill Hemmer> <Neutral> So many others will line up.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you have to help them temporarily. It's not going to be a longtime temporarily. And they're going to pay interest and they're going to probably give stock in their company to the to the people of our country, to the taxpayers of the country, to the citizens of our country. And it's gonna be great. But we have to keep them in business.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We can't lose these companies if we lose a company that employs 100,000, 150,000 people when we could have given them what they sometimes call a bridge loan. But basically alone, it doesn't make sense. So it's a very important thing. And it's great for the citizens of our country.
<Bill Hemmer> <Neutral> During our town hall today you threw out a date where you think America can be working again. And that's Easter Sunday that's 19 days from now. How did you come up with that day?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's 19 days. But at another seven, because we've been doing this now for seven. So that's from the time we heard about it.
<Bill Hemmer> <Neutral> Seven to nine?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. So from the time we close it up so you could add seven to nine. Look, Easter is a very special day for me. And I see it sort of in that timeline that I'm thinking about. And I say, wouldn't it be great to have all of the churches full? You know, the churches aren't allowed essentially to have much of a congregation there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And most of them I watched on Sunday online and it was terrific, by the way. But online is never gonna be like being there. So I think Easter Sunday and you'll have packed churches all over our country. I think would be a beautiful time. And it's just about the timeline that I think is right. It gives us more chance to work on what we're doing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm not sure that's gonna be the day, but I would love to aim it right at Easter Sunday. So we're open for church service and services generally on Easter Sunday. That would be a beautiful thing.
<Bill Hemmer> <Positive> Thank you for your time.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> The president of the United States, President Trump, always a pleasure to have you, sir. Thank you for being with us. Sorry about that, I guess we had a phone problem on our end. I apologize on behalf of the entire Fox News Channel.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, don't worry about that, Sean. Thank you very much.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Mr. President, just -- I'm just going to open it up to you to go wherever you want with this. This has been something you've had to deal with your entire presidency almost. You have and were loud and saying it was not true. It was a witch hunt. And we had four separate investigations backing up your claim and culminating in what you saw yesterday, sir.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Your reaction to all that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think people learned a lot yesterday, watching a very poor performance and watching things that they couldn't believe when they saw what was going on. And hopefully, we are going to be able to find out how a thing like this started. It was a disgrace to our country, it was a disgrace from every standpoint and I would say that most people have never seen anything like it. And then on top of it, you watch that performance, it was -- it was shocking and very sad.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> How much -- how much of that did you watch, sir?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Say it, Sean?
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> How much of the Mueller testimony did you actually watch?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I wasn't going to watch at all, and then I started thinking about it, and then I watched a little bit at the very beginning and I couldn't believe what I was seeing. So, I ended up watching more than I wanted to.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Well --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then I watched the afternoon because, you know, it was such a big crater at the beginning, and I said, now, I have to watch -- I have to watch shifty Schiff because he just went through three hours and now he has to go through Schiff. And I said, this is going to be very interesting. And I've never seen anything like it, actually.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was sort of good television. So, I couldn't watch it all. I had meetings, I had economic development meetings, and I was saying, fellows, maybe we could move it to another time but I didn't want to do that. But I got to watch enough and it was shocking. I thought the Republicans represented themselves brilliantly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> John Ratcliffe and Jim Jordan and, I mean, all of them, Louie Gohmert, I could mention 15 names or however many they have that spoke. It got fairly close to that number, I guess, maybe it was a little bit less than that. But I will tell you that everybody representing the Republicans I thought was really good and I thought the other side was typically biased, but they were stuck with a situation that they couldn't believe.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Mr. President, I just mentioned, "The New York Times," not long ago, actually said that they believed that -- well, the dossier, which I was stunned Mueller didn't know about Fusion GPS, the things he didn't know shocked me, didn't know Jeannie Rhee, Clinton's attorney, worked for him. But we'll put that aside.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> But they suggest at "The New York Times" that the dirty dossier that Hillary paid for that was used to spy on your campaign, your transition, and even your presidency, sir, was likely Russian disinformation from the beginning. Now, if that's the case, that would mean that the Russians knew that Hillary was paying for those lies, which would mean that the narrative that the American people have been fed by the media and the Democrats, that, well, they were trying to help you, the Russians, that would mean that "The New York Times" is right for once, and I suspect they may very well be, that they were trying to hurt you more than Hillary.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, based on the fact that we've just become -- and, you know, fairly recently, a little while ago, the number one oil and gas producer and energy producer in the world, by far, Russia, Saudi Arabia, now second and third, based on the fact that we now have the best -- we will soon have the most modern military we have ever had with the best equipment, the best -- newest planes and all of the things that we have done, and so many other things, Sean, based on all of that, the last person they should want is me. But I have heard the same thing about the fake dossier.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've heard it came out of Russia. I think a lot of it also is made up. It was just made up like you would write a novel, but it was a fake and it was paid for by the Democrats and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the DNC and it's incredible. These are incredible stories. Nobody would write a novel like this because people wouldn't believe it. It wouldn't be believable.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You know, Mr. President, I famously have asked Lindsey Graham -- he really, when Attorney General Barr was before his committee, he went through a list of things, do you feel that Mueller did a good job? Do you think he had the resources? Do you believe that his had every opportunity? You turned over 1.5 million documents, I can't believe -- you encouraged everybody to testify before Congress, before the special counsel -- I was shocked.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> McGahn did, but we'll put that aside here. And you keep saying that you think we can't let this happen again. And, I guess the -- we've learned from the attorney general that he is going to look into whether the investigation into Hillary's server was rigged, he's going to look into potential FISA abuse, he's going to look into the origins of this probe, we know that Durham has now interviewed Steele for nearly 16 hours, and we know the I.G. is very close to a FISA report.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> What do you -- why is it important to get to the bottom of this from your perspective?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because this should never happen to another president of the United States again. This is an absolute catastrophe for our country. This was a fake witch hunt and it should never be allowed to happen to another president again. This was treason. This was high crimes. This was everything as bad a definition as you want to come up with.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This should never be allowed to happen to our country again.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Your thoughts -- you have often said fake news. I called them out often on this program. It turns out there's been, you know, I give a list, starting with Richard Jewell and Ferguson, Missouri, and Cambridge police and Baltimore, Maryland, and UVA and Duke lacrosse, and Nicholas Sandmann. But they went with every single lie, every conspiracy theory.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I don't see the media very often talking about the things you have accomplished. I mention the employment situation is the best since 1969. What you say to the press in this country? The press that is supposed to be fair, balanced, objective, down the middle? I'm a talk show host. I'm like the whole newspaper.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> We do everything.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think the press has lost all credibility, much of it. But it's lost a big part of it. I mean, a very substantial part of it, lost all credibility. And I watch as people scream at these poor Democrats, the congressmen, scream like I've never seen. You must do this, you must do that, I mean, these are supposed to be journalists, talk show hosts, of all sorts of people, I could not believe it. And they are actually trying to force them to do what they want to be done.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've never seen anything like it. And I've seen it -- you know, they use the word unhinged, they are unhinged. The media has become totally unhinged. They are very dishonest. And when I say enemy of the people, when people give purposely fall stories and when they tried and get politicians to do things that are wrong and they are know they are wrong, that really is the enemy of the people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's fake news, but it's the enemy of the people, more importantly.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> In other words, that if you're claiming to be fair, balanced, objective, and down the middle, and you purposely like and you don't have any interest in the truth, you make a distinction between the two and I heard you say that many times. I'm interested in this question because you were very critical of Mueller, the whole issue of whether or not you told your counsel to fire him, and you have the authority, according to Alan Dershowitz, many constitutional attorneys I've interviewed, under Article 2, for conflicts of interests, you could have fired Mueller yourself.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> But my question is, now that you saw how little he actually knew, do you have a different opinion of him? Did you at any point almost feel sorry for him, during this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I had the absolute right to fire him but I didn't. And I never suggested to do it. But I had the absolute right to fire him under Article 2 and perhaps for other reasons but, I didn't do it. I didn't do any of the things -- you know, when they said he was going to do this or said he was going to do that, I didn't do any of it and it's really incredible when I hear this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, you know, the whole concept of obstruction, first of all, they create a phony crime, which was just a terrible thing to say about somebody, especially somebody that loves the country as much as I do. So, they create this phony crime and then they say he obstructed. They said there was no collusion but he obstructed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And there has never been anything like this ever before in our country. This crime was a -- the crime was committed on the other side and we will find out about that. We have a great attorney general who is looking at it. I'm not involved in that. He is looking at it and, you know, I've been hearing a lot of the media actually talked about investigate the investigators and a lot more than that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I think that things are -- I just see it. I feel it. I think a lot of good is going to come out of it. We went through hell. A lot of people went through hell. They came down to Washington wanting to do a phenomenal job for the people and they get served with papers to come and testify and go before grand juries and by the way, nothing affected the Trump Organization.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, all of these things like the Russian bloggers, they had nothing to do with us. And everybody knew it. In fact, there is a little sentence and they are saying that it had nothing to do with the Trump administration. But it was like a lot of people, 24 people or something. A lot of bloggers, bloggers in Russia, they will never see these people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They know that. They sent out papers to these people, they will never see them. People probably never even got the papers. But all of these people, none of them had -- they went through people with old tax cases, old cases. Cases that were not even going forward and, you know, just went after them viciously and violently.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> General Flynn, who is a good man, what they did to General Flynn and so many others -- Hope Hicks, this wonderful young woman. And she spent much of her time in Washington fighting off, you know, horrible stories and things and she'ss just a high-quality person. So many. I mean, I could name almost everybody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What they went through. And still, to this day, I mean, I heard people saying that -- I heard some of the media saying that they thought Mueller performed OK. In other words, they let a day go by and then they'll try and spin it. These are very dishonest people. These are very bad people.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. President, the power of the pardon -- I actually think the best pardon you gave is to Alice Marie Johnson. I think you commuted her sentence, to be more accurate.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> It is absolute. Have you come at any point, ever considered in the back of your mind, a pardon for any of the people you mentioned? Or you would wait? I think is that at one point, you wouldn't consider it until after it all worked through.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't want to comment on that as far as the pardons are concerned. Yes, it is absolute and it's a beautiful thing. I've had people, Jack Johnson, the heavyweight champion of the world in the early 1900s, and, he went to jail for, you know, no -- no reason. And so many other things, and Alice Johnson is another good example.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I really feel good about giving it, where people have been treated unfairly and abused, actually. But, I haven't talked about it with respect to what's going on now. I mean, it's, you know, I think there's a whole new day starting. I think I know, I still use "drain the swamp". We have some very, very bad people in government that would be willing to do very bad things and for bad reasons.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I don't mention pardon, but, you know, I don't say what's going to happen in the future. I just don't comment on it.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Mr. President, last question on this and that I want to switch to 2020, if I may. Comey, McCabe -- Comey signed the first FISA warrant which opened the door, apparently, according to Nunes and the Grassley-Graham memo, the bulk of information was Hillary bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier. We found out from John Solomon last week that they had a spreadsheet, even the FBI in early 2017, said 90-some odd percent of this thing was false, garbage and not true.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Comey, though, signed it. That allowed a backdoor through Carter Page to spy on your campaign, later transitioning to the presidency. But McCabe, Strzok, Page, Brennan, Clapper, may be sourcing out what would be illegal intelligence gathering. And we know the attorney general is there. Is there any of these names -- what you think of these people?
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Because James Comey signed the first FISA application in October 2016, went to Trump Tower in January 2017, and told you it was unverified, months earlier, he swore on that application, the FISA application that it's verified, so he lied. What are your thoughts about these people today?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Comey is a liar and a leaker and that's obvious. All you have to do is just follow him along and see what he said to Congress. Clapper and Brennan and all of these people, McCabe, these are bad people. My opinion, they are very bad people. They've been very bad for the country. They were -- I used to think incompetent but they are really I guess competent at other things and maybe bad things, but we'll see what happens.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, I guess a lot of things are coming out and is going to be very interesting and it will be great to clean up a real big mess because again, it can never happen. This cab never be allowed to happen again, Sean.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. President, you have the power to literally release the FISA application and the 302s and the Gang of Eight information, and you made a decision to hand it over to the attorney general, and let him decide. And I'm curious as to why.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we have a very respected gentleman, a very high quality person named William Barr. And he is doing -- I can tell you, he's working so hard, and rather than just doing a total release, I gave him his total release, in other words, he's got everything. Anything he needs, he's got. He is the attorney general of the United States, he's got a lot of very good people under him that I guess are involved and I gave them a total release.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, all of it has been released and he has all of it. I've also given him authorization to release it to whoever he wants. Whether it's his people or, frankly, perhaps people like Devin Nunes, who is a star, what he has done and the amount of suffering that he has gone through, you know what they did with him where they tried to drive him right out of politics and probably worse than that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He has done an incredible job and, so many others. I mean, the job -- they are warriors. We have had, I'll tell you the good side of all of this is the level of intelligence and strength and goodness that we've had on the Republican Party, a lot of them, not everybody, of course, but we've had tremendous, and I say, when I say we, I'm talking about the country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The country has had tremendous support from Meadows and Jordan and Devin Nunes and so many of the names that you saw yesterday, performed so well. I mean, they performed so well, and they worked so hard because they saw this was a scam. This was an illegal takeover, as you would say in the business world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, this was -- this was a coup attempts, in my opinion.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> I --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And this is the United States. And we wouldn't stand for it and I wouldn't stand for it. We have some very great people, but we also have some very bad people. And I think we caught them.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I believe, sir, that we have the premiere law enforcement agency in the world, our FBI. We have the premiere intelligence people in the world. But that's 99 percent. But the 1 percent of the top, the ones we're talking about, abusing power. All right. So, how closely are you paying attention to the 2020 Democrats that, by the way, seem most influenced by "The Squad" and all of them having even adopted some version of the insane New Green Deal that would get rid of the life blood of our economy, oil, gas, and, you know, planes and cows and the combustion engine?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, it's very interesting because I haven't seen it at all for the last four or five days. They're not talking about the Democrats. They're talking about Mueller and how bad he performed. How badly he performed. And they're talking about everything that happened over the last few days but in particular, yesterday, you are not saying much about the Democrats.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, look, you know, you've got a few of them that are doing a little bit better than others. It'll be interesting. Whoever it is, I'm OK with it. We have the best economy we've ever had, as you know, we have the best stock market numbers we've ever had in the history of our country. That's -- you know, if you look at 401(k)s, if you look at the kind of money that people are making, I'm not talking about rich people or just rich people, I'm talking about everybody.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And blue-collar workers went up proportionally more than anybody. You saw the polls that just came out. Things are doing great. The best unemployment numbers, the best employment numbers. I'll tell you what, more people working in the United States today than at any time in the history of our country. And then we have the lowest unemployment numbers, especially for African-Americans, for Hispanics, for Asians; women are almost 70 years, the best numbers, and soon to be historic, meaning forever, meaning from the beginning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I think we are going to be in great shape.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Let me ask this then. Who --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Then you have the AOC, I called AOC plus three.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Who do you think wins -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, the three hangers-on. And --
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Who do you think wins the nomination?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they're really hurting.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Oh, sorry.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I really believe they are going to hurt the Democrats. But who knows? I mean, we'll see. But I think we're going to very well, Sean. I think we're going to do very well. We have tremendous spirit. Every time, you've never seen an empty seat. We go into these massive arenas and they are packed and there's thousands of people outside.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You've never seen an empty seat. So, I think we're going to do very well.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right. Three quick questions and I'm going to let you go because you've been very generous with your time. Who do you think wins, and will you tell us? And is there one of the group of Democratic hopefuls that you hope wins because you know you can beat them easily?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, I could say that obviously, the top three or four look like they are doing better than the rest. So, Sleepy Joe is OK but he is fading. I think he is fading fast. The only good thing about Mueller is it made Joe Biden look like a dynamo. [Laughter] So, when you watch Mueller's performance yesterday.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think probably Biden is the one that asked him to go on. So, you have him and he is sort of a little bit leading. And then you have a whole group. You have Elizabeth Warren, formally known as Pocahontas. I'm sure that'll come out because that's a tough lead for her to withstand, I believed it, because her whole life was a fake.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She used that very, very adeptly and it was not good. And you have Harris -- and Bernie looks like he is fading. To me, Bernie looks like he missed his time. I think what Hillary did a few years ago was pretty tough, frankly, for Bernie.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But that was his time. This -- I don't think it's Bernie's time. I see him flailing. He is flailing all over the place. He's going crazy. I call him Crazy Bernie. But the fact is, that I think those would be probably the three or four, may be there is another one or two, you know, I don't necessarily see anybody else gaining traction.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. President, last two questions. First one is on both Iran and North Korea have recently fired test missiles. Here's my question for you. I think -- I've known you for nearly 25 years. I know your mind-set on this very well. I said it on the air in a message to the mullahs that they better be careful.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You will not put boots on the ground. You're probably going to show some level of patience, but at the end of the day, if they force you, I believe, knowing you, my belief is you will devastate them. And North Korea, you have given them nothing. People criticize -- I said certain things I believe about Donald Trump.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> One, you will put no boots on the ground. You will never try and bribe a dictator like Clinton did with North Korea and like Biden-Obama did with the mullahs. And I do believe that if pushed, the military might you would unleash will be mighty and it won't require boots on the ground, am I right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that in the case of Iran, they know that better even than you do, I think they understand that very well. And in the case of North Korea, I'm actually getting along very well with him, but we'll see what happens. I mean, you know, the sanctions are on. The hostages are back. We are getting the remains back.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They haven't done nuclear testing. They really haven't tested to missiles other than, you know, smaller ones, the -- which is something that lots test. But I think with North Korea, we have been doing very well here but that doesn't mean it's going to continue. We have a relationship. President Obama had no relationship.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You would have been at war. Had Hillary won this election, you'd be at war right now with North Korea, and I have no doubt about that. That's where it was heading. It was heading there very rapidly.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> As I said, yes --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So, we'll see what happens but I think what you said might be somewhat of an understatement.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Last question, Mr. President, and I have said many times on this program, all you've given Kim Jong-un is your time. And yes, we've got remains back, we've got hostages back, and missiles stopped up until fairly recently. And you just gave time. Let me ask -- this is -- maybe it's because it's New York and I know a city that you obviously love a lot.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You've seen and you've watched with us, these police officers who are being pounded with water and not reacting. I -- to me, if this continues, that is disastrous situation for the people in New York City.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's a bad mayor, probably the worst mayor in the history of New York City. He's done a bad job and now, he's running for president, and the people can't even believe it. He's a horrible mayor. The policemen and women cannot stand him. They don't respect him, they don't like him. Remember, they turned their back on him a couple of years ago, when he got up to speak, everybody turned their back and they kept it that way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And still, they want to do it, but they still have respect for the office, if not him.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes, Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I thought that was tragic, watching that scene. A couple of days ago when I first saw it, I couldn't believe it. I said, let me see that again. I don't believe what I'm seeing. And I know New York's Finest, and New York's Finest, in fact, we were in touch with them today. They are devastated that frankly, that that could happen and also that those two officers would allow that to happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was a terrible thing.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Well, we better -- every single one that we have on video, I'd like to see arrested. Mr. President, I won't take anymore of your time. Thank you so much for being with us. As always, we really appreciate it, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Sean. Thank you very much.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Thank you.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Good morning, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Morning.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> It's great to see you. Thank you for joining us, again, in Davos. We've done this before.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> It was a couple of years ago. Before we get started -- with- we're going talk about the economy and a lot of other things -- the CDC -- has identified a case of coronavirus -- in Washington state. The Wuhan strain of this. If you remember SARS, that affected GDP. Travel-related effects. Do you -- have you been briefed by the CDC? And --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have, and --
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> -- are there worries about a pandemic at this point?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. Not at all. And -- we're -- we have it totally under control. It's one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It's—going to be just fine.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Okay. And President Xi -- there's just some -- talk in China that maybe the transparency isn't everything that it's going to be. Do you trust that we're going to know everything we need to know from China?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. I do. I have a great relationship with President Xi. We just signed probably the biggest deal ever made. It certainly has the potential to be the biggest deal ever made. And -- it was a very interesting period of time time.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Yeah. Let's get into that --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we got it done, and -- no, I do. I think -- the relationship is very, very good.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Let's talk about Davos, cause -- you were here two years ago. Even The New York Times at this point, your favorite, acknowledges that the Davos elite are accepting that your policies are working and the U.S. economy is the envy of the world. In fact, the press coverage here is very favorable. You know what's going on back in -- back at home.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> It's all impeachment all the time. Did you watch any of it? Were you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I did. I did. I watched some of it last night
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> What did you make of it
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I got -- I had a busy day yesterday, as you know. You were there. And we had the speech and we had lots of meetings with different leaders, including Pakistan and others. Other countries. In addition to businessmen all over the place. But I did get to see some of it. It's a hoax. It's a total hoax. It's a perfect conversation
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> How do you think -- your team performed?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think the team was really good. And -- the facts are all on our side. The Republican party has never been this unified. You saw that. 195 to nothing. I guess twice. In fact we got three Democrats voting for us. That was with the House. I think --
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> You think there'll be witnesses, Mr. President, or do -- you have -- ?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- I really don't know. I think that -- if everybody tells the truth, it's perfect. All you have to do is read the transcript. Read -- if you take a look at the transcript -- and it's really two transcripts. It's -- you know, I had a first call which was perfect, and I had a second call which was perfect.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You notice they don't mention the calls, though. They never mention the calls. They talk about everything but the calls. All they have to do is read the transcripts. I put it out all the time. The other thing is speak to the president of Ukraine. He's been great, I have to tell you. And his foreign minister's been great.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They constantly -- say there was no pressure. They don't even know what we're doing. They think it's crazy. So they got the money. In fact they got it very early. President Obama gave them nothing. He gave them pillows and sheets and things like that, and I gave them tank busters. You know, it's a disgraceful hoax.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Well, what --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we do it.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> We had a four hour show -- four hour show yesterday. Didn't -- I don't even think the I-word came up at all. What the CEOs are talking about
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But no, you asked me- the question.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> No, I know I did. I know—I did
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I have to answer it—you are my friend -- for too long.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> -- and I needed to ask it. And I needed to -- ask it. That's why I did. But I really want to talk about -- what we're seeing over here. We came -- to Davos expecting to hear about this ESG, Environmental, Social and Governmental issues. We expected to hear about stakeholders versus shareholders.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> We expected to hear about climate change. In four hours yesterday, with the CEO of Bank of America, and Schwartzman with Blackstone, all we talked about, and all they wanted to talk about, was the strength of the U.S. economy. It's the envy of the world. And I think if you have a strong economy, all these ancillary issues become easier to deal with.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> And I think even the Europeans, even the plutocrats of Davos, are now acknowledging that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I appreciate that very much. We do. We have an incredible economy. The consumer has never been so rich. They -- you know, they're -- between the tax cuts and the regulation cuts -- people forget about regulation. I think it might have been more important than the tax cuts. But we have -- a consumer in the United States that has never done so well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think we're really poised to have I think we have tremendous potential. You know, we're at a point where we've done so well, I think we're going do much better. We have tremendous potential.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> So the market's up 50%, and we've talked about this before. November 9th is the date --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right, right thank you --
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> -- that you need to do it. Not --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> -- not the inauguration. I just want to ask you, because we're starting to see this -- the -- bandied about that -- the re-expansion of the Fed's balance sheet. Somehow correlates with the movement in the stock market. Do you think there's anything to that? That -- that the -- they've primed the pump and some of the gains are -- not warranted by the underlying economy -- ?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think it's the opposite, actually. The Fed raised too fast interest. They brought up the rate too fast, and they didn't drop it fast enough. And that was very -- you know, that was a lot of increases, and it was a lot of increase. And I think it's really the opposite of what you're saying. Now they've dropped it, but it was very late.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you look at other countries where they actually have negative interest rates, negative in a positive way. I mean they're actually getting paid -- they make a loan and they end up --
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Well, let's -- talk --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- getting paid.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> -- about that. You don't -- are you hoping that it comes to that in the United States? That we get negative rates? 'Cause it -- a lotta people don't think it's a great thing, and it hasn't worked well in other places. You --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they don't know yet. It's so new. I want to know who are the people that buy. Okay? Who are the people that buy and they invest in Germany and end up getting, you know, less money at the period of time -so I -- have to find these people. But -- no, if Germany -- and -- we're the most prime in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're the leader in the world. We have the dollar, and the dollar's very strong. A lotta -- a lotta things are happening. But, you know, we're paying higher interest than other countries because of the Fed. If we were paying less, I would do it, and I'd pay off a lot of debt.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'd do a lot of things.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> Is Chairman Powell out of the doghouse? Is he -- are rates where they should be? Are you satisfied with the situation -- ?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't want talk doghouse. I wish he didn't raise the rates. That was not what I thought would happen
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Are we at a good -- level now, do you feel?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think the rate should go down.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> Should go down further.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because I think the dollar's very, very strong. And I think the rate should go down. We have a very strong dollar, and that sounds good, and it is good in many ways, but it's very bad in terms of manufacturing. I've created almost 700,000 manufacturing jobs. The past administration said manufacturing is dead, which I said, "Tell me about that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> How do you -- you can't do that." And we have had a tremendous success, but it's harder with a strong dollar. And -- I want this dollar to be strong. I want it to be so powerful. I want it to be great. But if you lower the interest rates, so many good things would happen.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And one of the things I do want to do is pay off debt, and we're poised for tremendous growth. It'll really kick in toward the end of this year. But --
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> we're poised for tremendous growth.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> Let me ask you about that. We -- came close to 3% last year. This year lower, but we've had obviously the -- China trade war, which has been --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We had many things.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> We did. Do you -- do you attribute the -- GDP at 2% to -- the Fed being -- tight for too long? Do acknowledge that maybe some of the tariffs or some of the -- - uncertainty engendered by the China trade war affected GDP?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it'll be higher than 2%. A lotta people are very thrilled with that. Me, I'm not, but we had a lot of bad things happen. Number one, the Fed was not good.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> As far as I'm concerned. And that was a big blip that should not have taken place. It should not have happened. But it's one of those things. But we had Boeing. We had the big strike with General Motors. We had things happen that are very unusual to happen.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> Could --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Including some unbelievably powerful storms. You know, we were hit with storms. Now, with all of that, had we not done the big raise on interest, I think we would have been close to 4%, and I -- could see 5,000 to 10,000 points more on the Dow. But that was a killer when they raised the rate. It was just a big mistake.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they admit to it. They admit to it. I was right. I don't wanna be right, but I was right.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> There -- are some that say that the uncertainty for CEOs in dealing with China and making plans for the future may have hurt capital spending. Do you expect it to come back now the we've had a phase one -- agreement? And -- let's talk about phase two, if we get a chance, and --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, I think the biggest thing about getting the deal with China -- number one, it's a great deal for us. It's an important deal for China, because they were -- you know, their supply chains were breaking. It was -- you know, it's been tough for them. The best thing that happened is we have two countries that like each other again, because it was getting pretty nasty.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, you know, they have taken advantage of our country for 30 years and we -- I was not going let it happen. And -- we've taken in billions and billions of dollars. The tariffs are still on, so I still have that negotiating chip. I have 25% tariffs on, and that's a great negotiating chip. And yes, we're starting phase two very soon.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But the relationship that we have now with China is probably better than it's ever been. The relationship I have with President Xi, president for life. Okay? It's not bad. But the relationship I have with President Xi is, you know, I think extraordinary, considering he's for China, I'm for us.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But -- the deal is a phenomenal deal. We will take in $250 billion -- they're going to be buying $250 billion, and it could go a lot higher than that.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> And -- real IP -- progress made with the IP theft
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> -- and enforcement and -- watching --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> -- and -- the tariffs stay on.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You -- I know I was watching you and you were really surprised that so many of these other things, the intellectual property, so many of these other things were --
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> I read the same newspapers—
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- were part of the deal.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> -- as -- I -- heard this was just going to be --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Farms
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> -- ag guys
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Yeah, and -- it was a lot more.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And this is -- manufacturing. This is -- technology. This -- phase one is a massive deal. And in the end, it's probably $250 billion, but it could go much higher than that. And just that alone, not even talking about the USMCA, which now we just got passed. In fact, when I go back I'll be signing it. It's all passed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we had I believe 89 votes in the Senate, which is tremendous.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> The UK next with Boris Johnson?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Boris and I are friends and he wants to make a deal, and that's okay with me.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> So that could start --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think they want it, they need it.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> That could start soon?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh yeah. We're starting. We've already started negotiating. And frankly, we're starting with Europe too. Europe is -- to be honest with you, Europe has been very, very tough to deal with. They've taken advantage of our country, the European Union, for many, many years. And I told them, we can't do it anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I met with them yesterday. I wanted to wait till I finished China, to be honest with you. I'm -- always like to be very transparent. I wanted to wait till I finished China. I didn't want to go with China and Europe at the same time. Now China's done, and I met with the new head of the European Commission, who's terrific.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And had a great talk. But I said, look, if we don't get something, I'm going to have to take action, and the action will be a very high tariffs on their cars and other things that come into our country. Now, saying that, I don't want your audience to get nervous. They're going to make a deal, because they have to. They have to. They have no choice.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we've had a tremendous deficit for many, many years. Over $150 billion with Europe. And they are -- frankly, Jean-Claude was a friend of mine, but he was impossible to deal with. And I think it's going to be a lot better for Boris now too. You couldn't make a deal. It was very hard to make a deal. Now, I never played my cards, because I didn't want to do that again while I was doing China.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I wanted to do China first. I wanted to do Mexico and Canada first. But now that we're all done -- and now what we do is we are going to do Europe. And I had a very good conversation. And I would be very surprised if I had to implement the tariffs.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> We had -- one of your guys, the NEC -- director -- Lawrence Kudlow, on yesterday. We asked him about deficits, and we asked him -- I mean I -- we acknowledged that you wanted to rebuild the defense industry, and you had to agreed to -- -certain things with -- the Demos -- in the second term, will you look at --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Big focus.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> -- will you look at -- will -- do you need to raise taxes or do you need to cut spending?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to actually probably lower taxes, if you want to know the truth. You know, if you take a look at what we've done, we've cut taxes in half. And we've taken in more revenue substantially than we did when the taxes were high. Nobody can even believe it. But we take in more revenue with the big tax cuts -- I mean you were paying really 41% and we brought it down to 21%, and it's sort of lower than that --
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> So the -- that will -- be a priority?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, absolutely. And --
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> For -- cutting taxes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And one of the reasons I'd like to see the interest rates lowered, frankly, is because I'd like to refinance the debt and pay off the debt.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going have tremendous growth. Joe, when you have all of these trade deals the I've made -- don't forget, I made a $40 billion deal with Japan. I made a massive deal with South Korea. Nobody even knows what the number is, but, you know, it was a horrible deal, now it's a great deal. And then you add Mexico, you add China, you add Canada.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You add all of these other countries. And we have about ten countries that we're dealing with. These deals were horrible. In many cases we didn't even have a deal. They just came in here and took advantage of our country. So -- we have massive potential, massive growth, and you'll see that toward the middle to the end of next year --
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Right. I'm going to go through, like, 10 things, cause --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Go ahead, Joe. They --
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> All right, let's talk about what -- if there is a second term -- do you have -- a preference for an opponent -- I came up with the three Bs. Biden, Bernie and Bloomberg.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All very different. You have Mini Mike is spending a lot of money. He's got no chance. But he's got a tremendous -- you know, he used to be a friend of mine until I ran for politics, and then -- he went a little off. You should see some of the nice things he said about me before I ran. They're like the nicest.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But he had a deal with Hillary Clinton that he was going to become secretary of State. It was very simple. People know that. And he -- wasn't going to happen. It was going to go to Terry McAuliffe. I mean so they were playing with Michael. And -- it's too bad, but he's spending a fortune. He's making a lot of broadcasters wealthy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he's getting nowhere. His ratings are terrible. His -- you look at his numbers. I don't know if Joe's going to limp across the line, but you -- I watch him. I s -- watch him speaking. He can't put together a sentence, but it could be him. And it could be Crazy Bernie. I don't know who it's going to be. Whoever it is, I'm ready.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> I just want to ask you some rapid-fire questions. Just -- to get your clear comments.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> So -- Boeing. Yesterday in the news -- and it hit the Dow --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I know
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> -- yesterday. And the news is-this summer, perhaps, before --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> -- we see—the 737
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very disappointing company. This is one of the great companies of the world, let's say as of a year ago, and then all of a sudden things happen. I am so disappointed in Boeing -- had a tremendous impact. You know, when you talk about growth, it's so big that some people say it's more than a half a point of GDP.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So Boeing -- big, big disappointment to me. Big disappointment.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Right. Apple. What do you think? You're -- friends—with Tim
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am --
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> -- I -- think you
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like them a lot. I think we should do some encryption. I think we should -- we should start finding some of the bad people out there that we can do with Apple. I think it's very important. Frankly, I've helped them a lot. I've given them waivers, because I want them -- it's a great company, but it made a big difference.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, you know, they compete against Samsung. Mostly Samsung. I guess that would be their number one competitor. That's from South Korea. It's not fair, because we have a trade deal with South Korea, so Samsung would get the no waiver. And they would -- they would have to pay -- tariffs. So I did waivers, but I want them to help us a little bit.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They -- you know, Apple has to help us. And I'm very strong on it. They have the keys to so many criminals and criminal minds, and we can do things. When they had the problem with the -- recently in Florida. I won't go into it, because it's so horrible.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But they could have given us that information. It would have been very helpful.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Well, we don't need a back door -- way in getting into the wrong hands either. You -- do you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. I understand --
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> -- you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- you know what, I understand both sides of the argument.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> And this won't --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But if you're dealing with drug lords --
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> -- this won't hurt your relationship -- with Tim?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're dealing with drug lords and you're dealing with terrorists, and if you're dealing with murderers, I don't care. We have to get --
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- we have to find out what's going on.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> Can -- Facebook. Zuckerberg --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I met him -- and he told me that I'm number one in the world in Facebook. He sat down. He said, "Congratulations. You're number one." Now, I wouldn't be able to say that unless it was --
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> Should he stick to his guns with the political ads? He's getting a lot of flack
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd rather him just do whatever he's going to do. You know, he's done -- he's done a hell of a job, when you think of it. And -- he's going to do what he has to do. I heard he was going to run for president. That wouldn't be too frightening, I don't think. But he does have that monster behind him. He said, "You're number one," and I said, "That's really nice." It's always nice to be number one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know who number two is?
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> No?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Modi of India. But he has 1.5 billion people. I have 350. So -- Modi. And we're going there very soon, too --
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> All right. Last but not least, you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And by the way, our relationship with India, and again with China and with Japan and with so many countries, is better than it's ever been. Literally better than it's ever been.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Tesla's now worth more than GM and Ford. Do you have comments on Elon Musk?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well -- you have to give him credit. I spoke to him very recently, and he's also doing the rockets. He likes rockets. And -- he does good at rockets too, by the way. I never saw where the engines come down with no wings, no anything, and they're landing. I said I've never seen that before. And I was worried about him, because he's one of our great geniuses, and we have to protect our genius.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, we have to protect Thomas Edison and we have to protect all of these people that -- came up with originally the light bulb and -- the wheel and all of these things. And he's one of our very smart people and we want to -- we want to cherish those people. That's very important. But he's done a very good job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Shocking how well -- you know, how it's come so fast. I mean you go back a year and they were talking about the end of the company. And now all of a sudden they're talking about these great things. He's going to be building a very big plant in the United States. He has to, because we help him, so he has to help us.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> Do I dare -- one last question.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> Entitlements ever be on your plate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> At some point they will be. We have tremendous growth. We're going to have tremendous growth. This next year I -- it'll be toward the end of the year. The growth is going to be incredible. And at the right time, we will take a look at that. You know, that's actually the easiest of all things, if you look, cause it's such a --
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> If you're willing --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- big percentage.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> -- to do some of the things that you said you wouldn't do in the past, though, in terms of Medicare --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're going -- we're going look. We also have -- assets that we've never had. I mean we've never had growth like this. We never had a consumer that was taking in, through -- different means, over $10,000 a family. We never had the kind of -- the kind of things that we have. Look, our country is the hottest in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have the hottest economy in the world. We have the best unemployment numbers we've ever had. African American, Asian American. Hispanics are doing so incredibly. Best they've ever done. Black. Best they've ever done. African American. The numbers are incredible. The poverty numbers. The unemployment and the employment.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There's -- there is a difference, actually. But the unemployment and employment numbers for African Americans are the best we've ever had. You know, we just -- came up with a chart, and it was a very important to number to me. African American youth has the highest, by far, unemployment. The best unemployment numbers that they've ever had.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the best employment numbers. Right now we have almost 160 million people working in the United States, and we've never even been close to that, Joe.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> All right. Safe travels --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
