<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> Would you shut down the government again?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're going to have to see what happens on February 15th and I -- I think --
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> You're not taking it off the table?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't -- I don't take anything off the table. I don't like to take things off the table. It's that alternative. It's national emergency, it's other things and you know there have been plenty national emergencies called. And this really is an invasion of our country by human traffickers. These are people that are horrible people bringing in women mostly, but bringing in women and children into our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Human trafficking. And we're going to have a strong border. And the only way you have a strong border is you need a physical barrier. You need a wall. And anybody that says you don't, they're just playing games.
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> You had quite the showdown with Speaker Pelosi. What did you learn about negotiating with her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think that she was very rigid -- which I would expect -- but I think she is very bad for our country. She knows that you need a barrier. She knows that we need border security. She wanted to win a political point. I happen to think it's very bad politics because basically she wants open borders. She doesn't mind human trafficking or she wouldn't do this because you know --
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> She offered you over a billion dollars for border security.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me?
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> She offered over a billion dollars for border security. She doesn't want the wall.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's -- she's costing the country hundreds of billions of dollars because what's happening is when you have a porous border, and when you have drugs pouring in, and when you have people dying all over the country because of people like Nancy Pelosi who don't want to give proper border security for political reasons, she's doing a terrible disservice to our country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And on the 15th we have now set the table beautifully because everybody knows what's going on because of the shutdown. People that didn't have any idea -- they didn't have a clue as to what was happening, they now know exactly what's happening. They see human trafficking. They see drugs and gangs and criminals pouring in. Now, we catch them because we're doing a great job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But if we had proper border security we wouldn't have to work so hard and we could do an even better job, and I think Nancy Pelosi is doing a terrible disservice to the people of our country. But she can --
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> You're still going to have to deal with her now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, she can keep playing her games, but we will win. Because we have a much better issue. On a political basis, what she's doing is -- I actually think it's bad politics, but much more importantly it's very bad for our country.
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> I want to ask you about your intelligence leaders who were testifying on Capitol Hill this week. Did you read the report that they presented?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I did.
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> And did you -- there was some conversation you had because you went on Twitter and you called them naive and told them to go back to school.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think --
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> What specifically was wrong about what they said?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think -- let me just say it wasn't so much a report. It was the questions and answers as the report was submitted and they were asked questions and answers. We've done an incredible job with Syria. When I took over Syria it was infested with ISIS. It was all over the place. And now you have very little ISIS and you have the caliphate almost knocked out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We will be announcing in the not too distant future 100 percent of the caliphate which is the area -- the land -- the area -- 100. We're at 99 percent right now, we'll be at 100. When I took it over it was a disaster. I think we've done a great job with that. At the same time, at a certain point, we want to bring our people back home.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you look at Afghanistan we're going in very soon we'll be going into our 19th year spending 50 billion dollars a year. Now if you go back and look at any of my campaign speeches or rallies, I talked about it all the time.
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> You did. You've been talking about -- and that --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- I want to bring people home.
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> But that's one of the questions here. Is because you have these strongly held convictions and people ask, "Well, why don't the facts influence those opinions, if those facts change?" And -- and your director of national intelligence said ISIS still has strongholds in Iraq and Syria --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way --
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> -- and will launch attacks from there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're going to always have pockets of something. What -- you're going to have people, like the one armed man who blew up a restaurant. You're going to have pockets. But you're not going to keep armies there because you have a few people. Or you even have fairly reasonable numbers of people. We've been there for many, many years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We were supposed to be in Syria for four months. We've been there for years. We have been in Afghanistan for 19 years. And by the way, I've been hitting very hard in Afghanistan and now we're negotiating with the Taliban. We'll see what happens, who knows --
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> Can you trust the Taliban? Can you actually broker a deal?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, whether we should have been there in the first place, that's first question. Second question --
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> That's where 9/11 was launched from.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- we've been there for 19 years, almost, we are fighting very well. We're fighting harder than ever before. And I think that they will -- I think they're tired and, I think everybody's tired. We got to get out of these endless wars and bring our folks back home. Now, that doesn't mean we're not going to be watching with intelligence.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to be watching, and watching closely. North Korea --
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> Isn't that harder when you don't have troops on the ground?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, everything's harder. But, you know you pay a big price for troops on the ground. We're spending hundreds of billions of dollars on military. We're the policemen of the world and we don't --
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> Because the concern in here by your intelligence chiefs, though, is that you could in that vacuum see a resurgence of ISIS.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure.
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> See a resurgence of terror groups like Al-Qaeda --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know what we'll do? We'll come back if we have to. We have very fast airplanes, we have very good cargo planes. We can come back very quickly, and I'm not leaving. We have a base in Iraq and the base is a fantastic edifice. I mean I was there recently, and I couldn't believe the money that was spent on these massive runways.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And these -- I've rarely seen anything like it. And it's there. And we'll be there. And frankly, we're hitting the caliphate from Iraq and as we slowly withdraw from Syria. Now the other thing --
<Margaret Brennan> <Neutral> How many troops are still in Syria? When are they coming home?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> 2,000 troops.
<Margaret Brennan> <Neutral> When are they coming home?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're starting to, as we gain the remainder, the final remainder of the caliphate of the area, they'll be going to our base in Iraq, and ultimately some will be coming home. But we're going to be there and we're going to be staying --
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> So that's a matter of months?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have to protect Israel. We have to protect other things that we have. But we're -- yeah, they'll be coming back in a matter of time. Look, we're protecting the world. We're spending more money than anybody's ever spent in history, by a lot. We spent, over the last five years, close to 50 billion dollars a year in Afghanistan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's more than most countries spend for everything including education, medical, and everything else, other than a few countries.
<Margaret Brennan> <Neutral> Is there a scenario where you would keep troops in Afghanistan? A smaller number?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. And I'll leave intelligence there. Real intelligence, by the way. I'll leave intelligence there and if I see nests forming, I'll do something about it. But for us to be spending 51 billion dollars, like last year, or if you average the cost it's -- I mean you're talking about numbers that nobody's ever heard of before.
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> The Senate Republicans voted, the vast majority of them said that they don't support what you're doing. That what you're doing risks national intelligence by a precipitous withdrawal from Syria and Afghanistan. Doesn't that concern you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I ran against 17 Republicans. This was a big part of what I was saying, and I won very easily. I think the people out in the world -- I think people in our country agree. We've been fighting for 19 years. Somebody said you were precipitously bringing to -- precipitously? We've been there for 19 years. I want to fight.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to win, and we want to bring our great troops back home. I've seen the people. I go to Walter Reed Hospital. I see what happens to people. I see with no legs and no arm -- arms. And I've seen also what happens to them up here because they're in this situation, and they come back and they are totally different people -- where the wives and the fathers and the mothers say, "What has happened to my son?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What has happened in some cases to my daughter?" It's a terrible thing. We've been there close to 19 years. And it's time. And we'll see what happens with the Taliban. They want peace. They're tired. Everybody's tired. We'd like to have -- I don't like endless wars. This war. What we're doing is got to stop at some point.
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> But you -- but you also campaigned saying that, you know, President Obama made a big mistake by telegraphing his military moves. You're telegraphing your retreat.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not telegraphing anything. No, no, no. There's a difference. When President Obama pulled out of Iraq in theory we had Iraq. In other words, we had Iraq. We never had Syria because President Obama never wanted to violate the red line in the sand. So we never had Syria. I was the one that actually violated the red line when I hit Syria with 59 Tomahawk missiles, if you remember.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But President Obama chose not to do that. When he chose not to do that, he showed tremendous weakness. But we didn't have Syria whereas we had Iraq. So when he did what he did in Iraq, which was a mistake. Being in Iraq was a mistake. Okay. Being in Iraq -- it was a big mistake to go -- one of the greatest mistakes going into the Middle East that our country has ever made.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> One of the greatest mistakes that we've ever made --
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> But you want to keep troops there now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- but when it was chosen -- well, we spent a fortune on building this incredible base. We might as well keep it. And one of the reasons I want to keep it is because I want to be looking a little bit at Iran because Iran is a real problem.
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> Whoa, that's news. You're keeping troops in Iraq because you want to be able to strike in Iran?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because I want to be able to watch Iran. All I want to do is be able to watch. We have an unbelievable and expensive military base built in Iraq. It's perfectly situated for looking at all over different parts of the troubled Middle East rather than pulling up. And this is what a lot of people don't understand.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to keep watching and we're going to keep seeing and if there's trouble, if somebody is looking to do nuclear weapons or other things, we're going to know it before they do.
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> So you're going to trust the intelligence that you receive?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am going to trust the intelligence that I'm putting there, but I will say this: my intelligence people, if they said in fact that Iran is a wonderful kindergarten, I disagree with them 100 percent. It is a vicious country that kills many people. When you talk about torture and so many other things. And -- maybe they'll come back.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The country is getting absolutely -- when I ended the horrible Iran nuclear deal -- it was a horrible deal done by President Obama and John Kerry that didn't know what the hell he was doing. When I ended that deal, Margaret, all of a sudden Iran became a different country. They became -- very rapidly -- right now they're a country that's in big financial trouble.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let's see what happens.
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> I want to move on here but I should say your intel chiefs do say Iran's abiding by that nuclear deal. I know you think it's a bad deal, but --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I disagree with them. I'm -- I'm -- by the way --
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> You disagree with that assessment?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- I have intel people, but that doesn't mean I have to agree. President Bush had intel people that said Saddam Hussein --
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- in Iraq had nuclear weapons -- had all sorts of weapons of mass destruction. Guess what? Those intel people didn't know what the hell they were doing, and they got us tied up in a war that we should have never been in. And we've spent seven trillion dollars in the Middle East and we have lost lives --
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> Do you trust your national security adviser John Bolton because he worked in the Bush administration?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do, and I respect John and John is not one of the people that happened to be testifying or on.
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> Got it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know what I tell people -- you can testify any way you want. I'm not going to stop them from testifying. They said they were mischaracterized -- maybe they were maybe they weren't, I don't really know -- but I can tell you this, I want them to have their own opinion and I want them to give me their opinion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, when I look at Iran, I look at Iran as a nation that has caused tremendous problems.
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When I came in as president of the United States, my first year, I went to the Pentagon two weeks after I came in, a short time after, and I was given a -- because I wanted to know what's going on with Iran.
<Margaret Brennan> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We were in many many locations in the Middle East in huge difficulty. Every single one of them was caused by the number one terrorist nation in the world which is Iran. So when my intelligence people tell me how wonderful Iran is -- if you don't mind, I'm going to just go by my own counsel.
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> You've had a lot of change up in you administration recently too. Are you satisfied with the cabinet and the staff you have now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we have a great cabinet. I have great people. I think now we have a really great cabinet. I think Bill Barr will be a fantastic attorney general, and I think that we have -- Mike Pompeo's been doing a fantastic job. We have --
<Margaret Brennan> <Neutral> He's not leaving?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't -- I mean he tells me he wouldn't want to leave. I think that was --
<Margaret Brennan> <Neutral> Because McConnell was talking to him --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was fake news.
<Margaret Brennan> <Neutral> -- about running for the Senate. He said McConnell had spoken to him about running for the Senate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he may have spoken to him, but I think he loves being secretary of state. He's doing a fantastic job. And I asked him the question the other day, he says he's absolutely not leaving. I don't think he'd do that. And he doesn't want to be lame duck. And he's doing a fantastic job as our secretary of state.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great energy and great -- a great, smart gentleman.
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> Cause you have an acting AG until you get Barr confirmed --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> An acting defense secretary. An acting chief of staff. An acting interior secretary. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. It's OK. It's easier to make moves when they're acting.
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> So you are going to shake up --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Some, and some not.
<Margaret Brennan> <Neutral> -- positions.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Some are doing a fantastic job. Really -- I like acting because I can move so quickly. It gives me more flexibility. But -- but actually, some of the names you mentioned, they're doing a fantastic job.
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> How do you know when to fire someone?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When it's not happening. When --
<Margaret Brennan> <Neutral> What do you mean?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When it doesn't get done. Like with General Mattis, I wasn't happy with his service. I told him give me a letter.
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> He resigned.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He resigned because I asked him to resign. He resigned because I was very nice to him. But I gave him big budgets and he didn't do well in Afghanistan. I was not happy with the job he was doing in Afghanistan. And if you look at Syria what's happened, I went to Iraq recently, if you look at Syria, what's happened in Syria in the last few weeks, you would see that things are going down that were not going down.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That things are happening that are very good. So I was not happy with him, but I wish him well. [Commercial Break]
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> I want to ask you about your relationship with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. Have -- have you put your differences aside?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so. I mean I -- I was just one that felt very important, you can't be kneeling for the national anthem. You have to respect our flag and our country. I want that as president and I'd want that as a citizen. And I have a very good relationship. I did them a big favor in negotiating the USMCA, which is basically the replacement to NAFTA, which is one of the worst trade deals ever made.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I said to Canada, look we have a great American company known as the NFL, and they were being hurt and treated unfairly, the NFL, by Canada for a long time. And I said to Prime Minister Trudeau, who was very nice about it and really understood it, I hope you can settle the difference immediately and fast.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they did. So I did the NFL a big favor, as a great American company and they appreciated it. And Roger Goodell, this is a dispute that has gone on for years. Roger Goodell called me and he thanked me. And I appreciated that. But they haven't been kneeling and they have been respecting the flag and their ratings have been terrific ever since.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And a lot of good things happened.
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> Talking about the -- the kneeling position you've taken and the controversy around it. Do you think that the players who did kneel had a point? I mean did you -- are you sensitive at all to players like Colin Kaepernick, who -- who point out that the majority of victims of police violence are black?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, I'm the one that had passed judicial reform. And if you look at what I did, criminal judicial reform, and what I've done -- President Obama tried. They all tried. Everybody wanted to do it. And I got it done and I've been, you know, really -- a lot of people in the NFL have been calling and thanking me for it.
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They have been calling and thanking, you know, that people have been trying to get that taken care of and it's now signed into law and affects tremendous numbers of people, and very good people. I think that when you want to protest I think that's great. But I don't think you do it at the sake of our flag, at the sake of our national anthem.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> But you are -- do I understand you saying there though, that you still are sensitive though? I mean you -- you understand the motivation for the protest --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I do --
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> Though you don't like the form of it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A lot of it is having to do with reform from what I understand. Whether it's criminal justice or whatever it may be and they have different versions and everybody seemed to have a different version of it. But a lot of it had to do with that, and I took care of that. I think that people have to, at all times, respect our flag and at all times respect our net -- our -- our national anthem and our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think there are plenty of places and times you can protest and you can do a lot. But you can't do that. That's my opinion.
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> In a CBS poll we just took, 63 percent of Americans say they disapprove about how you're handling issues of race in the US.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well --
<Margaret Brennan> <Neutral> What do you think of that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What has happened is very interesting. The economy is so good right now. You saw the jobs report just came out. Three hundred and four thousand added jobs, which is a shocker, for the month. A shocker to a lot of people. They thought it was going to be half that number. The African-Americans have the best employment numbers in the history of our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hispanic Americans have the best employment numbers in the history of our country. Asian-Americans the best in the history of our country. You look at women, the best in 61 years. And our employment numbers are phenomenal, the best in over 50 years. So I think I've been given a lot of credit for that. And in terms of race, a lot of people are saying well this is something very special what's happening.
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> So -- because when colleagues of yours, even like Republican Senator Tim Scott. He said Donald Trump is not racist. But he said you're racially insensitive.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a great relationship with Tim and certainly with his state, South Carolina, and -- where we do very well. And I think if you look at the numbers for African-American unemployment, best numbers they've had -- literally the best numbers they've had in history. And I think they like me a lot and I like them a lot.
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> Would you let your son Barron play football?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's very, it's very tough question. It's a very good question. If he wanted to? Yes. Would I steer him that way? No, I wouldn't.
<Margaret Brennan> <Neutral> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I wouldn't. And he actually plays a lot of soccer. He's liking soccer. And a lot of people, including me, thought soccer would probably never make it in this country, but it really is moving forward rapidly. I -- I just don't like the reports that I see coming out having to do with football—I mean, it's a dangerous sport and I think it's -- I -- it's -- really tough, I thought the equipment would get better, and it has.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The helmets have gotten far better but it hasn't solved the problem. So, you know I -- I hate to say it because I love to watch football. I think the NFL is a great product, but I really think that as far as my son -- well I've heard NFL players saying they wouldn't let their sons play football. So. It's not totally unique, but I -- I would have a hard time with it. [Commercial Break]
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> What surprised you about some of the questions that Robert Mueller asked you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, look the Russia thing is a hoax. I have been tougher on Russia than any president, maybe ever. But than any president.
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> But when it comes to the investigation that the special counsel's conducting -- I mean 34 people have been charged here. Seven guilty pleas --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me. Ok, you ready? Ok, you ready? Of the 34 people, many of them were bloggers from Moscow or they were people that had nothing to do with me, had nothing to do with what they're talking about or there were people that got caught telling a fib or telling a lie. I think it's a terrible thing that's happened to this country because this investigation is a witch hunt.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a terrible witch hunt and it's a disgrace --
<Margaret Brennan> <Neutral> Do you think it should be made public?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- when you look at General Flynn where the FBI said he wasn't lying, but Robert Mueller said he was, and they took a man and destroyed his life. When you look at so many of the things that have happened -- why didn't they go after Hillary Clinton for her emails? She had thirty three thousand emails that were deleted after receiving a subpoena from Congress --
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> And according to the special counsel --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me, but Margaret, why --
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> -- they were posted on WikiLeaks and your friend Roger Stone was just indicted for his involvement there and for lying.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> First of all, Roger Stone didn't work on the campaign, except way way at the beginning long before we're talking about. Roger is somebody that I've always liked, but a lot of people like Roger some people probably don't like Roger, but Roger Stone's somebody I've always liked. I mean Roger's a character but Roger was not -- I don't know if you know this or not -- Roger wasn't on my campaign except way at the beginning --
<Margaret Brennan> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, it's all -- and -- and yet you will ask me a question like that, wasn't involved in my campaign.
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> Would you pardon him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have not thought about it. It looks like he's defending himself very well. But you have to get rid of the Russia witch hunt because it is indeed. And remember --
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> Because you think --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Remember this. Remember this. There's been no president that has been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump.
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> Would you make the Mueller report public because you say there's nothing in there? Congress can subpoena it anyway, though.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Totally up to to the Attorney General.
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> But what do you want them to do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Even the Mueller report said it had nothing to do with the campaign. When you look at some of the people and the events it had nothing to do --
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> You wouldn't have a problem --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me.
<Margaret Brennan> <Neutral> -- if it became public?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me. That's up to the attorney general. I don't know. It depends. I have no idea what it's going to say.
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So far this thing's been a total witch hunt. And it doesn't implicate me in any way. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. There was no nothing. Doesn't implicate me in any way but I think it's a disgrace.
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> What would make you use the U.S. military in Venezuela? What's the national security interest?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I don't want to say that. But certainly it's something that's on the -- it's an option.
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> Would you personally negotiate with Nicolás Maduro to convince him to exit?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well he is requested a meeting and I've turned it down because we're very far along in the process. You have a young and energetic gentleman but you have other people within that same group that have been very very -- if you talk about democracy -- it's really democracy in action.
<Margaret Brennan> <Neutral> When did he request a meeting?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to see what happened. A number of months ago he wanted to meet.
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> But now because you're at that crisis point --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well now we'd have to see.
<Margaret Brennan> <Neutral> Would you negotiate that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say this. I decided at the time, "no" because so many really horrible things have been happening in Venezuela when you look at that country. That was the wealthiest country of all in that part of the world which is a very important part of the world. And now you look at the poverty and you look at the anguish and you look at the crime and you look at all of the things happening.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I think the process is playing out -- very very big tremendous protests.
<Margaret Brennan> <Neutral> North Korea. When and where are you going to meet Kim Jong Un?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I won't tell you yet, but you'll be finding out probably State of the Union or shortly before. But the meeting is set. He's looking forward to it. I'm looking forward to it. We've made tremendous progress. If you remember, before I became president, it looked like we were going to war with North Korea. Now we have a very good relationship.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The hostages are back. Okay, the remains are starting to come back. The remains of our Korean War veterans --
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> But your intelligence chief testified this week that Kim Jong Un is still very unlikely to give up his nuclear --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well that's what --
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> -- weapons program.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's what the intelligence chief thinks, and I think --
<Margaret Brennan> <Negative> Why is he wrong?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- there's a good possibility of that too. But there's also a very good chance that we will make a deal. I think he's also tired of going through what he's going through. He has a chance to have North Korea be a tremendous economic behemoth. It has a chance to be one of the great economic countries in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He can't do that with nuclear weapons and he can't do that on the path they're on now. I like him. I get along with him great. We have a fantastic chemistry. We have had tremendous correspondence that some people have seen and can't even believe it. They think it's historic. And we'll see what happens. Now that doesn't mean we're going to make a deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But certainly I think we have a very good chance of making a deal. And one of the reasons is because North Korea has a chance being located between Russia, China, and South Korea. What a location -- I'm in the real estate business -- what a location. They have a chance to be an economic powerhouse.
<Margaret Brennan> <Neutral> You're going to keep U.S. troops there, in South Korea?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, I mean we haven't talked about anything else. Maybe someday. I mean who knows. But you know it's very expensive to keep troops there. You do know that. We have 40,000 troops in South Korea, it's very expensive. But I have no plans, I've never even discussed removing them.
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> I want to quickly get to China. The last time you spoke with FACE THE NATION you were one hundred days into office and you said you would accept a less than perfect trade deal with China, if it meant they'd be helpful with North Korea. Do you stand by that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, yes but I think we're in a different position now.
<Margaret Brennan> <Neutral> What do you mean?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We've put very massive tariffs on China. China is paying a big price and it's hurt China's economy very badly. I want them to make a fair deal.They have been very helpful, especially at the beginning when I first came in with North Korea. They have stopped goods from going in. They have stopped a lot of things from going in through the border.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because as you know they have a border just like we have a border with Mexico, where crime is way up by the way, way up, and you have to remember that. But we have a border with -- they have a border with North Korea.
<Margaret Brennan> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They have been very vigilant. Are they the same now? Probably a little bit less so. But North Korea is absolutely talking. And I think North Korea wants to make a deal. We are making a deal. It looks like we're doing very well with making a deal with China. I can tell you this, no two leaders of this country and China have ever been closer than I am with President Xi. We have a good chance to make a deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know that we're going to make one, but we have a good chance. And if it is a deal it's going to be a real deal. It's not going to be a stopgap.
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> Sir, I hear your helicopters. I'm being told to wrap. I appreciate you being generous with your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Margaret.
<Margaret Brennan> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Mr. Trump, welcome back to Meet the Press.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Lovely and cold Ottumwa, Iowa.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's cold, but beautiful.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> There you go, there you go. This week's Time: How Trump won. [Inaudible] If you got out of the race today, do you feel like you have won something?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't. I really don't. I think that the Time" article was incredibly well written. It was really -- I mean that is a good writer
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You've shifted the debate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- well, especially being somewhat of a novice. And I've been, you know, I've been -- people have said very nice things, like Time Magazine" but I really feel that if I don't win I can't make the difference.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> You know there's this running conventional wisdom about you with some in the establishment that now say OK, he's here to stay but if he doesn't win Iowa, he'll leave the race.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I'm not leaving. No, I'm not leaving. You and I had us this discussion about two months ago where you said would you leave. I was in number. I've been in number one just about since I joined up -- right -- June 16, amazing. We had a lot of fun but you asked me that question.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I started talking about well, maybe here, maybe there, if this happens.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> There's no maybes anymore?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There's no maybes. There's no maybes. I'm not leaving.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You're going straight to the convention?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Going all the way. If I don't win, I don't win. Maybe that can happen but I'm leading every poll big.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> You don't accept the idea that you might lose Iowa? You could lose it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hope I win Iowa. I've developed an amazing relationship with the people of Iowa. You see it right outside. We have a huge audience -- a sold out audience. Always sold out -- I mean no matter where I go. But I have an amazing relationship with evangelicals, with the Tea Party, with the people of Iowa.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Your chief competitor is Ted Cruz. You have brought up the Canadian citizenship issue. But let me ask you your opinion. Do you believe he is constitutionally eligible? I know the Supreme Court has never weighed in on the phrase natural born citizen" -- what does that mean. But you yourself
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So what happens is I was watching Lawrence Tribe of Harvard yesterday who's a constitutional expert, one of the true experts. And according to him, it's a real question mark. And he is the -- I would say he was -- is one of the great authorities on this subject. He has a question mark and --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> But do you have a question mark?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let me tell you. From Ted's standpoint and from the party's standpoint, he has to solve this problem because the Democrats will sue him if he's the nominee. If Ted is the nominee, he will be sued by the Democrats and according to one of the great lawyers of the country at Harvard with strong opinions on this, the whole thing has not been this matter -- as he said, this matter has not been determined.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> I understand that. I'm talking about your opinion.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would say that I would want the Supreme Court to rule because they haven't ruled.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Let me ask you about -- you said something about Senator Cruz this week in a CNN interview. You said he was for amnesty. That's a big charge. Of all people to charge being for amnesty, where's the evidence on him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, number one he worked for Bush. Bush was heavy for amnesty.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know. But he worked for him and he was heavy for amnesty. And if you look at Rubio go after him, Rubio and Bush are both claiming each other was totally for amnesty and honestly, Marco has a lot of good points as to Ted's feeling on amnesty. Now Ted just switched his views on ethanol. He was totally against ethanol, now all of a sudden he's for it. It's Iowa and he's for it.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Where are you on ethanol?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've been in favor of ethanol.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You're OK with the subsidies.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm OK with it. I mean I like fuel. I like fuel and ethanol is fuel. And the people out here, it's a very important subject but Ted switched and I think they feel very queasy about that. Look Ted will switch opinions and I think that's fine and in the world, you know, you have to have a certain flexibility.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You've changed a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've changed -- I've changed opinions over the years. I mean we change. But it will be very interesting to see what happens. I will -- I'll tell you one thing. I am really looking to February 1. It's going to be very exciting.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Let me ask you. Senator Rubio sponsored a bill back in Florida back when he was in the statehouse to give in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants. There's a lot of states that allow in- state tuition for the children of undocumented immigrants. I've not heard your position.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm opposed to it.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Totally opposed?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're here -- they're not here legally.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Even kids born to illegal in Iowa.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I happen to disagree with the whole concept of anchor babies. I mean you look at anchor babies --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> That's in the constitution.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, it's not in the constitution.  If you read and if you look and if you go to the real scholars like different people that I can give you they will tell you, somebody comes over and they have a baby on our border and it happens to be on this side of the border, we're not mandated to take care of that baby.  You do not have to change the constitution.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You may need a vote in congress, but you don't have to change it.  Now, there's a debate about that.  I don't think it's even close and I've been on this issue for a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. People have to come into our country legally, Chuck. They have to be here legally.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> How do you decide if someone's a Muslim when you're doing this test?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there's got to be some kind of a method.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> How do you this method -- because you're taking somebody's word.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not taking somebody's word.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> That's my point. If somebody really wants to do damage, they're going to lie and cheat and sneak into this country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, this has become a very big factor over the last week and a half, two weeks since I made my announcement that we have to see what the hell is going on. In the meantime the other night you have a cop shot in Philadelphia with a gun put to his head and you know the chants and the rantings and the ravings. Now you're looking at Cologne, Germany, you take a look at Cologne, Germany who are having riots --
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> I understand that. But how do you do it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Wait a minute -- Chuck.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> How do you do it though? I get it. Or do you just say, you know what, you do it geographically, you don't even do it religiously.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have certain people come in. If they're business people if they're proven but we have to find out what the problem is. Now, we can be politically correct and never discuss it, but we can't let that happen to our country. Let me get some news of the week. China clearly its economy -- they're having a problem. They're having a crisis there. You have railed that China is beating America and yet -- They're killing us.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> OK. We're in our best two-year job creation streak in 20 years. China is cratering our stock market for the problems they have at home. How is that the definition of China winning and America losing?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> First of all, take a look at our GDP. Take a look at our GDP. And if you look at that, if you look at our productivity, if you look at the fact that people in ten years essentially haven't had a raise, people are going down instead of up -- the jobs, a lot of temporary jobs, people are working temporary jobs and jobs that they don't want instead of jobs -- our economy is doing horribly. And you take a look at the jobs report, the jobs report is fiction. Because all of the people that --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> It's total fiction? You know that there's been improvements from the crash, obviously?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Honestly, honestly -- I would say it's 90 percent -- we all have improvements from crashes. We had a crash -- we had somewhat of a crash. Would it have straightened itself out? Would it have straightened itself out? We had somewhat of a crash. But listen, Chuck, you have 60, 70, 80 million people out there that want to work that aren't getting jobs.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> You have said you think President Obama is a terrible negotiator?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Obama is one of the worst negotiators I've ever seen on everything except when it comes to dealing with the Republicans.  It's unbelievable.  The Republicans fold every single time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They don't get -- this last budget was terrible.  But look at the Iran deal, you look at these deals, I always bring up Bergdahl.  We get a traitor, they get five people that they've wanted for nine years and they're back on the battlefield trying to kill everybody including us and we get a dirty rotten traitor.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So let just tell you. That's the way -- that's the kind of deal we make. The Iran deal -- we gave them $150 billion dollars we get nothing --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> By the way, they just shipped the uranium out, though. I mean they're living up to the deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And where do they ship it? To Russia.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Well, you trust Putin.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I trust him more than some people.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> I was just going to say --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can tell you that. But what kind of a deal is that? Even that -- they're shipping it to Russia, right? Why aren't they shipping it to us? Why aren't we getting it? They're shipping it to Russia. I don't like that.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> You don't like that at all?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No, I'd like them to ship it to us. It's our deal. So they get $150 billion. We don't even get our prisoners back. They have 24-day periods -- and, by the way, the people don't know, the 24 days doesn't start until a whole procedure takes place. That 24 day can be a longer --
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Hard to wipe away nuclear material in 24 days.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know that. And you don't know that.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Scientists tell us that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How about their rights of self-inspection? You think that the Iranians are going to give us good self-inspection? I don't. But with the Republicans, Obama's a great negotiator. [End Video]
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Back in a moment with more of my sit down of Donald Trump including his plans to use President Clinton's past against Hillary. [Begin Video]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to say it as a threat, but it's a threat.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> It is a threat.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Of course. [End Video] [Break]
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Welcome back.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to say this is a threat but it's a threat.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> It is a threat?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Of course, I mean I can call it a nicer name. She was saying he has tendencies towards being sexist.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Talking about who -- you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> About me. And I said wait a minute. She's married to an abuser. A woman claimed rape and all sorts of things -- I mean horrible things. You read the books.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You know though if you bring it up people are going to bring up your --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's OK.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Your first divorce was ugly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Number one -- it's fine.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> It's all over the tabloids.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, you know what, I wasn't the President of the United States and I wasn't dealing in the Oval Office, all right? A big difference. I wasn't the President. And my first wife thinks I'm great and my second wife and -- and I have a great marriage. I mean I have a great marriage. So -- I mean it's fine. I'm not saying don't bring anything up with me. But when she says that, I had to bring it up. And by the way, they've become very unresponsive since then.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> They have.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I just won the Fox poll against her even. I'm up substantially over Hillary in the Fox poll that just came out.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> As you know -- as you know people call you a lot of names -- some of it is positive, some of is negative. I want to throw some by you -- to you. Some people are calling you the music man of this race; Kim Kardashian: Biff from back to the future; George Costanza, PT Barnum. Any of those you consider a compliment?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> PT Barnum.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You'll take the PT Barnum?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> PT Barnum. Look, people call you names. We need PT Barnum a little bit because we have to build up the image of our country. We have to be a cheerleader for our country. We don't have a cheerleader. I thought Obama when he got elected would be a good cheerleader. That's the one thing I said. I said he'll unify the country, whether it's African-American and white and all -- he'll unify. He's not unifying. It's -- he's been a great divider. On top of that --
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> He's been the divider? What about the Republican Party? You don't think they --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, I think --
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> You don't think this has been a two-way street.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He hasn't brought us -- Chuck, he hasn't brought us together. He hasn't brought --
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> That's on him? Not on both parties?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's on everybody, but he's the leader. He's the leader. He could have been a great cheerleader and he hasn't been and that's too bad.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> What do you tell conservatives about 90s Trump, you liked the Clintons, you were pro-choice, you were even for some gun control. You wondered why the NRA wouldn't be for some limitations, some restrictions.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have changed. I've changed in many ways.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> What -- is it just -- you know, what is it? What's the change? What changed you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Take a look at Ronald Reagan.  Ronald Reagan was a somewhat liberal Democrat.  You know, Ronald Reagan was a liberal Democrat.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he became a fairly conservative not overly but a fairly conservative Republican.  And as he grew older and I've seen things and I've watched things.  I mean like with guns.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If in Paris or if in California recently with the 14 people that were killed and probably others to follow in terms of that group because you have some people that are very, very badly wounded. And in Paris you have some people that are on -- but Paris is -- you can't have guns. In France you can't have guns in. If in Paris they had guns, if in California on the other side where the bullets go both ways, not just in one direction, you wouldn't have had the kind of carnage that you've had.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> What should be the restrictions, though, on purchasing guns? Where are you on this? Background checks for everybody?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. First of all, first of all -- there's a lot of language right now that the federal government has not taken advantage of. You know that. There's tremendous language right now, stuff that's already been passed and it was passed the old-fashioned way where people actually agreed to it. One of the problems I have with what Obama did is he's always signing executive orders. He doesn't bring people into his office --
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Are you going to refuse to do executive orders as president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I won't refuse it. I won't refuse it.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> You'll do them, too -- right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm going to do a lot of right things. Well, I mean he's led the way, to be honest with you. What he's done on immigration, when he signed those papers. Now fortunately the courts all of a sudden have done a little bit of determination. We'll see what happens. But one of the beautiful things about executive orders from my standpoint is if I get elected many of those executive orders that he signed, the first day they're going to be unsigned.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> I understand that, but you're willing to use them, too, yourself?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I won't -- I'm not going to rule it out.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Final question because I know you've got the rally --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm going to use them much better and they're going to serve a much better purpose than what he's done.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> On Tuesday we're going to hear the President say the state of our union is in some words strong, vibrant, all this stuff. What would you say? One year from now it could be you giving this speech to congress, a version of it -- we don't call it State of the Union in the first one, but a joint session speech. How would you describe the State of the Union right now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now or in a couple of years?
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Now or in a year.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think now it's a mess. Our military --
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> You'd go up there and say the state of our union is a mess.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wouldn't say that. You're asking me for an opinion. No, Obama will say what he's going to say. But I think right now the state of our union is a mess. We can't beat ISIS, our military is falling back, it's not being properly taken care of, our vets aren't being properly taken care of, Obamacare as you know is going to fail very soon and probably in '17 -- our healthcare. We don't have borders, we don't have anything. I think if I'm there in two years and I'm making a speech I say we're getting better fast.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> In that first speech to Congress you're going to lay out your first 100 days agenda. What are those four issues?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I want to build our military bigger and better and stronger than --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> That will be your number one. That's number one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to take care of our veterans. I want to take care of them -- they're being taken care of horribly. I want to fix our health care system. I want to create borders so that we have a country because right now we don't a country. We have borders where people just walk across and do whatever they want to do and then they have babies and the babies become citizens and we have to take care of them. We're going to do many, many things and we're going to make America great again. That's what I want to do.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> There are a bunch of billionaires around the world, Zuckerberg has signed on this idea they want to -- basically give away more than half of their wealth at some point to philanthropic projects. Carl Icahn is the guy who signed on to this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- who by the way endorsed me.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Right -- that's what I mean. Good friend of yours. Have you thought about -- I'm sure people have asked you to sign this giving pledge.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They have all asked me. They have all asked me.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Why haven't you done it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, so far I'm a little bit old-fashioned.  I have wonderful children who are doing a wonderful job and I believe in that and we employ thousands and thousands of people.  And I like the concept of keeping the company going as opposed to selling everything and giving it away.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So right now I mean -- perhaps I shouldn't be saying this but I'm of the old school.  I'd like to see my children take this great company that I've built -- and it is a great company -- and I'd like to see it go on for a long time creating jobs, lots of money, pay lots of taxes, give lots of money away.  I'd make lots of big contributions.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like that better.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> All right. Mr. Trump -- until we meet again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. [End Video]
