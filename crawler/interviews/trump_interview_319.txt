<Howard Stern> <Positive> Mr. Trump, you might be interested to know that A. J Benza would not come on the air he issued a statement.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Do you want to hear the statement?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure!
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right, here is the statement.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> I accept this award and maintain my reign as the best celebrity arguer ever. If I may, rather than place this award of my mantel next to my other FMEs is I much rather jam in the black of intern X. Long live, Donald Trump and god damn it! God bless, America!
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow! Whatever that means. Ah, A. J.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> It's -- it's truthful as ever.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> [Inaudible] Donald, what do you want to say? I mean shortly we want to let you have room to, do you accept the speech and a controversial whether the FME go on this year?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I simply was and tell you, it is a great courage and you will be having to put on, regardless, by the way, regardless.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thank you! As a matter of fact there's actually a security here. Ronnie, the limo driver actually awake.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Ah, he's awake!
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right!
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Good!
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed my little combat with A. J. Ahm, I have a lot of respect from man that can dedicate a book to a woman who dumped him.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There are many people that can do that but I know how you want to think about that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> My good [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But, um you know, it was a, it was a heated debate and I will say this everybody that I know has heard it and even just now I just got on my phone is ringing off the hook. See I have a lot of listeners out there, Howard. That is I can say.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Absolutely and congratulations to you by the way, you on the phone. What, what's going on with ahhh you know, I heard after the World Center disaster you, ahhh heroically said you would rebuild it bigger and better than ever.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah! He has a number of things that I have agreed with [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know the problem with rebuilding it bigger and better how it's like putting a big bull's eye out there you still have to find tenants and I think after that tragedy, a lot of people aren't going to be wanting to move into something that was bigger and better.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I agree.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd love to do that, it's not gonna work and I think we'll gonna have to be satisfied with very very beautiful like Rockefeller Center type buildings really, actually a better job. You know the World Center was never considered great architecture until September 11. Sort of like Marilyn Monroe you know where would she be right now if she hadn't died. Okay?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're right! Actually they used to put down the World Trade Center big [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh yeah!
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Everyone, everyone just like I mean there wasn't a critic who gave it a good review on September 11. The same critics are weep and said, what a masterpiece? So you know, that's what happens in life and death but something great can be done. I don't believe you'll ever have that kind of height in this city again.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it's very sad, Robin.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Ooohhh! Come on [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know now it becomes no it becomes, it becomes a very sad big bulls eye. You know?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And it becomes.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You know we're going to get rid of the people who are [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I hope so Robin. But it only takes one as a developer you want to do that. You know what Chicago.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What about a giant statue of me Howard Stern?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well that's what you know.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's a real progress now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a real it's a real problem. And I think what's going to happen is you're gonna have a magnificent development built with the same kind of square footage.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, what about?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But it will be in more film.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> The [Inaudible] of New York?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Robin I hate it. I hate telling you this. There's nothing I hate telling you more than this but you know you go and say ah listen brokerage firm. How would you like to be on 106 or the World Trade Center?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And would it go over too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think I have a lot of friends that would want to be up there. So.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, wait a minute, Donald. What about putting a military installation up in the top?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> With machine guns all over the side of the palace.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That will get people to move in.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't know. It's a very very most tragic day in the country's history in my opinion.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes, yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donald, what about the, the ah [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible] something yesterday that I have to question [Inaudible] Amanda Ferrer.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I did Rob and I've known him and I, I am not sure what Howard stance is on this or your stance but I've known Fernando I've known Ferdie for many years and he's a tough smart guy and a little bit. You see that, with what he did with Rudy. You know two guys said, oh yes we'll do whatever you want and he just said no I'm not gonna do that I mean I'm either gonna be [Inaudible] or I'm not gonna be mad if I'm not good in that 90 day period you should elect me [Inaudible]. The fact is he's a very tough smart guy and I hope your listeners go out and and vote for him. He's got a little bit of a bad rap.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is he Sharpton's puppet?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No absolutely not. And and you know you look at all the establishment people now coming out and endorsing him but the fact is he's a very very tough smart cookie, I think he will actually unify the city. And I think he'll be a great mayor.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hey, Donald. What about your?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just hope your listeners go out and and and vote for him because he will do a very good job.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What about ah the stock market. You're a financial genius. Ah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you investing? Do you have any money in it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what the stock market, I think I think and who knows is going to be quite good of the next couple of years you know, the, the real terror of the stock market is if you have another it's not even a much smaller one. I can't imagine a larger one.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But even a much smaller one you know it's so sensitive right now that something like that could really knock the hell out of it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Do you think there was an anthrax attack on the National Inquirer?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think so. Have you ever read The National Inquirer? You see what happens, I mean that Bin Laden is on the cover every weekend.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Saying he has small penis. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No he's got ah he's got lots of different problems. Okay? They have lots of different problems with Bin Laden and he's on the cover every week and I think they said, hey, hey, let's you know not these guys that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I know you hate germs do you have a personal supply of [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What, what [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I actually do and I actually am very concerned about that problem it seems to be easier to make them people hate You know this reporter up an envelope that I guess they thought was an envelope having to do with Jennifer Lopez.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah!
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And all of a sudden the reporters that the photo journalist is dead .
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So, but they say, though that you have [Inaudible] okay? They say but the time you get symptoms it's already too late.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's not supposed to be the greatest cure of all time.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So the why only.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Saying that, that uhm, anthrax is probably place a little bit after September 11.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think that I really believe you can have bigger problems than that. I think you'll have other problems. I'm not sure that airplanes will be you know the, the source of the problem.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you have a gasmask?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have a gasmask.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't. I don't [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Howard, I don't know but, how to use it
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you have a contingency plan? Should there be you in New York right now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Okay. Do you have a contingency plan, should all hell break loose? Do you have some?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Is there a bunker?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, a bunker?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would say like my basic plan is to run as fast as I can.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> [Inaudible] And your gasmask is so proud.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And you're running down the hill past you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You know I am.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You won't believe how fast I can run.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible] I never thought about getting shiprock anything you have personal supply.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know I'm the, it turns I'm the only guy I do not have any Shiprock penicillin or anything in case anthrax attack.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I don't have anything. I'm not going to get anything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It says every doctor is concerned about his patients. I saw some guy.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible] I didn't get a call from any doctor.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And my doctor didn't call me.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hear you get very very sick 25 percent of the patients get unbelievably sick by taking it. So this doesn't sound like the ultimate medicine.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Will you, will you? Ahhh, have you taken any flights anywhere since ah, September?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No! I have not.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have not. I'm not I'm not a big believer in let me said the commercial airlines in my opinion can never come back. I don't think they can ever come back because they were losing money on Septemer 10 before the event.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, I have to believe that at least 10 percent of the people that would routinely fly will find now they're losing money. If you take 10 percent that's a huge number of people. That means that practically you know what kind of a business is it was a bad business before and they were back. You know the airlines were losing money and they were pack!
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I think understand that!
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They were losing money every time you see American Delta. Everyone had a business. So they have, they have pack and they're losing money. How are they going to do if just 10 percent. I happen to believe it's more than 10 percent. That's why Las Vegas is in such trouble.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know, I didn't help yesterday a bunch or two days ago a bunch of passengers had to subdue a guy who was trying to get into the cockpit. Actually got into the cockpit. I mean and everyone said, well where are the sky marshals and why is the door so easy to still open. And they said well maybe the month will have all that together. Here we had the worst disaster in the world.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah but things that are [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I say this on your show and I've said it and [Inaudible] it's just a great idea. I've never heard of that one. That might as well give it out on your show and you can tell the FAA the authorities and take full credit for it. But I had an idea that I think is very good. And I think would work pretty well first of all this is not the idea. You must put very very strong doors and I mean you see when you fly you see the doors open the captains are talking and everybody.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, exactly!
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I should invite you up every time I'm in a plane at a commercial flight they invite me to sit with them.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you hear?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Fly!
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Fly the plane practically.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You know what I saw a Japanese guy on TV as a company here in America that actually makes doors you can't even shoot through on.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah!
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely!
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah!
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Howard it is simple. And they even make him out of like material you know with planes you don't want to have the heavy lead stuff right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right!
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But they make them out of light material and then stronger than steel
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, what is your idea? Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But here's my first of what you have to have those doors you can't even think about it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Those doors. I mean, frankly they shouldn't allow a flight to go up until those doors and so they can be installed in two days on each plane.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I agree.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay, that's number 1. Number 2, you have a red button in the plane and the pilot has a huge problem in the back he's got two or three tertiary you know crazy. He presses a button and sleeping gas comes out the entire back of the plane goes to sleep. Included.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Everybody falls asleep. Now you wake up
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it is hours you know wake up at Kennedy Airport LaGuardia Airport they come and they take the terrorists knock the crap out of them hanging from the back of the plane and and and the rest of the people wake up and they had a nice rest.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah!
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know they have a gas it's a beautiful sleeping gas it puts people to sleep. So I assume the pilots are gonna have to up space just in case something leaks through these doors we're talking about.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, they're going to sleep.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah! [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Robin, we do not want the pilots to fall asleep. We don't want to take that sort of a good idea.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah! That's a good idea.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And everybody that's heard it loves the idea but I haven't read about it so now I'm giving it on your show we're gonna see what kind of power you have.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well listen let's not lose sight of what's important here and say congratulations on you and your family.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That's right
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And now one thing if I can you know I agreed to take over the Roman skating rink I built it years ago
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, that's true!
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was a great success and I gave it to the city and it was badly managed for five years terrible and they came to me they said would you take it over and do it right. And I have agreed to do that because you know because of what's happened I just want it to. It's a very magical spot in the middle of Central Park not far from where you live.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And tell your, your, your people tell everybody that's listening that this rink will be so magnificent brought back to it's original glory
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Hmmm.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And after November first, I hope everybody listening is gonna go out there and use the Roman rink. And I also hope they're gonna go out and vote for Fredie because he will be a great man.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well by the way also to show you how what a role Donald Trump is on even in these bad times. Donald recently and I don't think I'm giving away secret had brunch with stuttering John.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That's what I thought what is going to.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In Atlantic City, by the way, he put on a great show Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You're kidding.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The place went crazy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Let me guess he's something.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going crazy. The show is you know is John and some of John's friends. It was the Trump Marina and the place went crazy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What about this moment? Will there be naked models skating at Roman rink right now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know I own a model agency called Team, Team management
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Which is very successful.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Was your girlfriend the

<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I saw her the other night what a hot chick this Melania Knauss. That's some girl.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Why don't you marry her and give her a good name?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, yeah, why don't you marry her and give her a name?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know she's a great person.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What is it John?
<John Melendez> <Neutral> I had brunch with Donald.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And how did how did that.
<John Melendez> <Positive> Had his beautiful girlfriend. She is gorgeous. And Donald has a move because she's in the car keys there. You know she's like you see the billboards.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I let her do advertising down there because I got her for the right price, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Of course why you got a hot girlfriend, why wouldn't he?
<John Melendez> <Positive> As she looks at him so lovingly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's great, she's great. You know John so were there and I said John let's have lunch tomorrow, bubba. I didn't really mean it, Howard how I get around like you say. All of a sudden my phone was Mr. Trump.

<John Melendez> <Positive> Yeah, great time.

<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And we had lunch with two and a half hours. I'll tell you it was it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What did she wear to lunch?
<John Melendez> <Positive> She wore a white sweatshirt. She didn't dress too provocatively unfortunately but she looked gorgeous.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donald why do you let her out of the room? Dressing in a t, sweatshirt?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He knew that he was going to have lunch with her. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She likes to dress down. Some people like to dress up like our friend Kylie likes to dress in a different manner.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean we all like Kylie the front of all of us but you know Kylie could tone it down a little.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, yeah. I thought she looked a little trashy and I see through outfit the other day.
