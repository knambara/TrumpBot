<Larry King> <Positive> Good evening, from Gotham in New York, a town symbolic of our guest. Donald Trump is back in a big way and there is so much to talk about: business ventures and other things. Let's start right from the top. Marla and you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, why did...
<Larry King> <Positive> The great love story!
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why do I think that was going to be your first question?
<Larry King> <Negative> What happened?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Marla is just a wonderful woman and Ivana is a wonderful woman. I mean, I have been lucky enough to be married to two wonderful women. But in life, of course -- you don't know about this, Larry -- but in life, sometimes it doesn't work out, and I don't blame anybody, it just sort of didn't work out. I'm a very busy guy, and I blame myself in that sense, because I really spend a lot of time working and doing what I love to do. And it just didn't work out in this particular case.
<Larry King> <Neutral> The stories about it arriving just before pre-nup was going to run out, time, true?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, those stories are inevitable, and today you have to have a pre-nup. And I did have a pre-nup that terminates at a certain level and I would not want to see that happen. I am a big pre-nup believer, even though they are nasty, terrible documents, I mean, I am a big believer in that stuff.
<Larry King> <Positive> They don't have to be that if they are worded well. You could treat with respect.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you are not going to sign one for your next, and I don't think you...
<Larry King> <Neutral> Who said that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought that was the rumor going around.
<Larry King> <Positive> No. What I mean is, it depends on how they are done, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<Larry King> <Neutral> And you are -- what about children, though?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm really blessed because I have four fabulous children. And they are all doing well. My little Ivanka is now in Paris. She's becoming a supermodel.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Tough life.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, tough life. But she has done great, and all of my children are doing great.
<Larry King> <Positive> And the baby with Marla?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Fabulous. Tiffany. And she is..
<Larry King> <Neutral> Do you get to spend much time with this business of yours?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would love to spend a lot more time, including with Ivana or with Marla or with whoever I...
<Larry King> <Positive> You are still friends with both?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am very friendly with both. I get along with them both. Somebody said, do you think Marla will sue? And I said, well, she said she would never sue, but that was during the marriage. Now, let's see what happens.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Do you like, frankly, being single again?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do. I think maybe it is better suited to me. I think it's unfair -- a lot of times, it's unfair to be married to Donald Trump. I'm so busy with what I do. I am always out of New York, I'm all over the place. And I think it very hard for a woman. I mean, there are a lot of assets there, too. But I really think that it is very difficult for a woman to be married to me. I think my business has typically come first. Now, maybe someday I'll meet a woman that, all of a sudden they say, Larry, I don't want to deal with buildings, I don't want to deal with deals...
<Larry King> <Negative> Now, you can do both. It happened to me. You could do both.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, maybe, I hope that at a certain time I'm going to be able to do both. But I have been very busy, and I think that is unfair to Marla, and it was very unfair to Ivana.
<Larry King> <Negative> Marla is still going to be involved in show business, though?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so. She's got a lot of talent. In fact, I'll tell you something, she has a lot of talent and I think I hurt her in one sense. Everybody expected or thought that anything she got, she got because of me and that she wouldn't have -- basically, she would not have talent for that reason. The fact is, she went on, she did a great job in the Will Rogers Follies. A fabulous job. She even got good reviews, and they hated like hell to give her good reviews, but there was no choice. She's got a lot of talent.
<Larry King> <Positive> Ivana also -- you have married two talented women. Proved herself a very talented businesswoman after you left, right? She's special.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She did better in the marriage than she did in her business, but she still did. You know, she...
<Larry King> <Neutral> She's no jerk.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's really a terrific woman, and she's no jerk. And I guess the only problem I had with Ivana, she made a cottage industry out of -- you know, when you get divorced, and here is how you do it, folks. The bottom line is, marry a rich guy and have a big check written.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because it really does help. You know, I don't if she can relate to the people that are in Boston. They get divorced, and they have the kids in another state, and the husband runs away, and you know, they get no money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, I thought she played that too heavy, even on your show. I mean, she played it very heavy. You know, follow me and I'll teach you how to do it. The fact is that I was very generous at a very bad time in my life. Because around 1990 and '91 -- I mean, the real estate markets were crashing. I was down, and I gave her a very big check in order to protect her and the children at a very, very bad time in my life. The worst financial time ever in my life, and hopefully it will continue to be forever in my life.
<Larry King> <Positive> Were you happy to see her next marriage go?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I wasn't happy. I was actually very sad. I thought that -- I was hoping that that would work. You know, she has an amazing ability to build up her man. And that's a very positive thing. I mean that in the most positive way.
<Larry King> <Neutral> She sure did him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When she was married to me, she thought I was the end- all, and when she was married to him, she thought he was the end-all. And I really think that's a tremendous trait in a woman. They really make you feel good about yourself.
<Larry King> <Negative> I ask that because he was stepfather to your children.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right.
<Larry King> <Negative> And so you are involved in that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And from all I heard, he was very decent to my children, and if he wasn't, I would have called out a big mat...
<Larry King> <Negative> You wish them both very well? To remarry would not bother you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I really do. I didn't really know Ricardo, but I really do. And I just hope it works out for both of them. I hope it's not going to be too messy.
<Larry King> <Positive> Have you enjoyed the aspect -- enjoyed, maybe a poor choice of words -- of your personal life being public.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it is so different from -- I'm a businessman, and I walk into a...
<Larry King> <Negative> But you're an up-front businessman. This is your first interview in a while.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it is. Actually, probably...
<Larry King> <Neutral> Long time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Five years, a long time. I have watched Ivana being interviewed and saying what a bad guy I was. And I have watched Marla being interviewed and saying, actually, what a good guy I was at that time, because we were married.
<Larry King> <Neutral> But you...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Her next interview, she will say...
<Larry King> <Negative> What kept you away? And now you are...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have really sort of been focused on, really, my work. I have always had an amazing ability to make money, but I took my eye off the ball around 1989, 1990. I was having a good time. I was doing things that maybe I shouldn't have been doing. I was all over the world.
<Larry King> <Positive> Playing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was playing. And I guess, maybe, I would really be angry at myself if I allowed that to happen again, but I don't think I will. But around 1989, I just took my eye off the ball. I relied on all my geniuses that worked for me from the Warden School of Finance and from the Harvard Business School, and they didn't have the touch and I'd be in Paris, or I would be...
<Larry King> <Negative> So the buck does stop with you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it does. I really now have a group that's tremendous. I have a man, Nick Ribis, who works for me and some other people who work for me. And some other people who work for me.
<Larry King> <Positive> Did you go -- dislike -- the fact that you got so well known in the '80s. You were almost a symbol of the '80s. That your personal life at the same time got well known.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it did. But I have sort of always been somehow into the media. I don't know why. And the media has always covered me. I don't do it consciously, but somehow the media has always covered me. And I have always said because the deals I have done have always been -- and I was young and I was this and that, but when I built Trump Tower right next to Tiffany on Fifty-Seventh and Fifth, and it's this great building that's a landmark building now. And I'm doing that and, you know, now Larry, as you probably have read and found out, I mean, I've had the best business year I have ever had.
<Larry King> <Positive> We're going to talk with that. We'll be right back with Donald F. Trump. Have to tell you who he is, you live in another planet. Maybe even if you live on another planet, you could tune in. We'll be right back. Don't go away. [Commercial Break] We're back with Donald Trump -- so much to talk about and we're going to cover it for the full hour. Mike Tyson -- friend of yours?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he is and so is Evander. I mean, they are both friends of mine.
<Larry King> <Neutral> You were there?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was there.
<Larry King> <Negative> Shocked?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I was really surprised to see what happened. Mike is a rough guy and Evander is a great fighter. And, you know, the thing with Evander -- they say The Real Deal
<Larry King> <Negative> And also, he never was -- low blows -- never -- he never had one thing wrong in the ring, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've -- I've had a lot of...
<Larry King> <Negative> I don't think he's had a round taken away.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've had a lot of Mike Tyson fights and nobody can understand it. Actually, he's relatively a clean fighter as that world goes.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know, you listen to him and he said Evander was butting him and everything else, but the fact is that a butt in boxing is terrible, but it's allowed in a sense. They'll take something away...
<Larry King> <Positive> You're a fan as well as a promoter, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm a fan, but I'm a fan because it's great for my casinos. I mean, I do a lot of fights. I have a lot of...
<Larry King> <Negative> But you like boxing, don't you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love it. I love it.
<Larry King> <Negative> You go to the fights?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's something about, you know, one on one. You can't blame the guard that didn't pull in an 11-man team, and you can't this or that. You know, it's just...
<Larry King> <Negative> There's no one to blame.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ...two guys sitting in the ring and it's...
<Larry King> <Negative> They get up and bam.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...pretty vicious.
<Larry King> <Positive> Right, now do you want to promote him in another country, is that true?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no, no. Somebody called up and actually from CNN and they wanted to hear whether or not I'd be willing. And I said that, you know, if an opportunity -- I think he certainly is a draw. He's an unbelievable draw to this day.
<Larry King> <Negative> Given this, he is boxing's draw.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He really is. He still is boxing's draw. You know, I predict what will happen is that he and Evander will probably fight a third time and it will be bigger than even the second; that was a huge event. Now, it ended sadly, but it was a huge event and the folks that put it on really -- you know, they really did a good job, but the fight ended in a very tragic way.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Do you expect Mike to get help and to come back in a year different and they'll let him fight again?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think Mike will be back in a year and he'll be fighting again and he's going to do very well. But he's got to take care of himself during this intervening period. I mean, he's got -- you know, he's really not as young now. You start hitting that 30 and you're getting old for a fighter, despite George Foreman, who goes on forever. You're just getting old for a fighter. And it was a very sad thing to see. And, you know, Evander came out and did really well. Mike was doing well for that final 30 seconds before this event. All of a sudden, he really looked like the old Mike.
<Larry King> <Neutral> In the third round, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In the third round -- he looked like the old Mike.
<Larry King> <Neutral> In fact, he may have won that round.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know what happened, but he was doing unbelievably well. The first two rounds, he looked lethargic and Evander was doing great. And then Evander was doing great at the beginning of the third. But all of a sudden, Mike went crazy like the old Mike. And, I mean, you know, in boxing that happens to be a good thing. He went wild, and it just -- it just didn't work out.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Would you want to promote Holyfield-Tyson?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely -- I mean, it's -- it's...
<Larry King> <Negative> Where would you want it -- Atlantic City?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In Atlantic City, probably.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Would you vie with Vegas for it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we have. I mean, I've had, I guess, more Mike Tyson fights than anybody. I've had a lot of Evander Holyfield.
<Larry King> <Negative> Vegas has become the boxing capital of the world, hadn't it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well...
<Larry King> <Neutral> They call it...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a boxing -- it certainly is. It's a great place. Vegas has had some -- couple of very bad months, as you probably heard, and Atlantic City is doing well. Atlantic City's really doing unbelievable.
<Larry King> <Negative> So you would get in a bid with Don King or whoever to hold this fight?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sure -- Don King -- I deal with him a lot on different fights. And I would certainly love to have a rematch. Now, I don't know that Evander would do it. I don't see a big upset other than economic, which is...
<Larry King> <Neutral> Just economics -- yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I don't see any upside other than pure economics.
<Larry King> <Negative> He'd get it -- that's his only huge pay day, though?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, no, Evander could have a huge pay day with Mike Tyson in the third fight. So, you know, when you say you don't see an upside, but the economics, that's a pretty big upset, but...
<Larry King> <Neutral> Big bucks.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...the fact is that Evander, in my opinion, he's a great fighter. People don't realize how...
<Larry King> <Positive> ...how good he is.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...good the Real Deal is. I mean
<Larry King> <Positive> But Mike has drama, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Mike has an unbelievable charisma and -- I mean, some bad things happened to Mike and I think his incentive left and some of his ability may have left and certain things happened that were terrible that, you know...
<Larry King> <Neutral> Do you like dealing with Don King?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think Don King is much different than people really think.
<Larry King> <Negative> Have you ever had a bad financial time...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've never had a problem with him. I mean, you have to know how to deal with Don King, in all fairness...
<Larry King> <Positive> He's a good negotiator, I would guess.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a great negotiator and I've never had a problem with Don King, and he's a much different guy -- people -- I told this to somebody the other day -- he calls his wife in Cleveland four times a day to say, hello, how are you doing? Is everything OK? And outside of the microphones, he is totally a quiet guy. Nobody believes it and...
<Larry King> <Positive> And a generous guy...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he's a generous guy and he's a good guy.
<Larry King> <Neutral> So, he's never had a welshed deal with you or any kind of thing that he backed off...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have never a problem with Don King -- ever -- and I've dealt with him a lot.
<Larry King> <Negative> So, you'd be right in the war to host Tyson-Holyfield Three.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Whatever happens. I mean, I think if I were Evander, I wouldn't do it. But...
<Larry King> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it will probably happen.
<Larry King> <Negative> You mention Vegas. Why have you never built there?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I never saw the economics in terms of what you had to pay to get in.
<Larry King> <Positive> Looks like it's booming.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It -- well...
<Larry King> <Neutral> If you land there -- they're building on top of building.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that's part of the problem. That's one of the reason's I'm not there, because I don't like what's happening. I see, you know, they've had a terrible June. They're having a terrible July. There's too much construction. There's a lot of things happening. So, we're going to just see what happens. And I'm sitting with a lot of cash and we're going to just see. And at the appropriate time, maybe we'll go and maybe we won't.
<Larry King> <Neutral> You might?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, oh sure, I would like to go there. But...
<Larry King> <Neutral> Just a few years ago...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't like going -- I don't like going at the height of the market. I like going at a little different level.
<Larry King> <Negative> Burn out, broke? Buy low, sell high.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's -- it's pretty basic when you get right down to it.
<Larry King> <Negative> We'll be right back with Donald Trump and lots more to come. Dan Rather tomorrow night. Don't go away. [Commercial Break] Before we get into the world of business, couple other things I -- I just neglected to cover. When is the divorce final from Marla?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, there's not a divorce now. We separated...
<Larry King> <Neutral> There's a pre-nup -- does it just go in?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, it should be very simple, but of course, somebody will always tell her a lot of nonsense.
<Larry King> <Negative> You worry about that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm just...
<Larry King> <Neutral> Some lawyer saying, hey, Marla...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm basically paranoid to start off with, but I assume that some lawyer will tell her that she can get more and everything else. She's -- she's very decent. I always assume the worst. But she's a very decent woman. I doubt -- I mean, there shouldn't be litigation. It should be very cut and dry.
<Larry King> <Neutral> You want to take care of your daughter, though?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely, I take great care of my daughter and good care of Marla.
<Larry King> <Neutral> What about the Palm Beach story? What's with that building?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the Mar-a-Lago is become the most successful club in the United States.
<Larry King> <Neutral> It's a club, now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, I took a house that was really much to big for a house and over a period of about three years, I was able to get the zoning with the town of Palm Beach, to convert it to a club. And it was not easy to get, believe me, this zoning. And I've created what's called the Mar-a-Lago Club. And it is the most successful club, I think, now in the United States.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Do people stay there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People stay there. People this -- we have the best spa.
<Larry King> <Neutral> You join the club -- you pay a fee?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have -- you pay a fee. We have the best spa. We have the best everything. Now, it's a relatively small deal compared to the Trump Taj Mahal or Trump Plaza.
<Larry King> <Neutral> I know, coming up to New York -- starting south...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it's just a great thing. It's something I'm really proud of. It was built by Marjorie Merriweather with the Post. They spent close to $20 million and E.F. Hutton
<Larry King> <Positive> That was a pretty good marriage.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Pretty good marriage -- didn't last long...
<Larry King> <Neutral> I know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...but it was really a good marriage. It was a hot marriage for a period of time.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Economic.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But he was the hot guy in the world and she was the richest woman in the world and they built this unbelievable house -- really, there's nothing like it in this country. And I was able to -- it's got 128 rooms, 110,000 square feet. It's a huge piece of land, right in the middle of the richest community, which is Palm Beach, and I was able to get it converted and it's been a pleasure.
<Larry King> <Negative> Doesn't have your name on it, though, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I thought I'd low-key one.
<Larry King> <Positive> Story in the paper, today, that you're thinking about taking -- in order -- helping peace night, Miss Universe, which you own that pageant.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Larry King> <Positive> And -- and Marla was on that pageant, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And she did an excellent job.
<Larry King> <Neutral> And will you have her come back?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's a very -- that might be the toughest question you ask. I don't -- I don't know that she would want to come back at this point. I mean, when you're -- when you're over, you're over. I believe strongly in that.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Are you taking it to Jerusalem?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think we might. Jerusalem wants it very much -- Israel, basically wants it very, very much.
<Larry King> <Negative> This would be next...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This would be next year -- next March or so. Israel really wants it badly. Venezuela wants it. Many, many countries want it. You know, the Miss Universe pageant is by far the biggest and most important of the beauty pageants. I bought it recently -- a year ago or so -- and it's been a tremendous...
<Larry King> <Neutral> Used to be owned by a bathing suit company, right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was and I...
<Larry King> <Neutral> What's the plus for you? Is it a profit maker? Or is it a promotional...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what? It's -- it's been -- it is number one, it's a profit maker but it's -- and it's again, like Mar-a-Lago -- it's not a huge business or anything for me, but it's -- it's cute and I love it and of course, looking at, you know, 97 gorgeous women isn't the worst thing in the world. What happens is I'll probably -- we'll probably make a deal with Israel to do it on their 50th anniversary. They really want that.
<Larry King> <Positive> It's next year. Oh, that would be wonderful.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then Hong Kong in the year 2000 -- really wants it -- they're already putting in...
<Larry King> <Neutral> So, it looks like Jerusalem will be a go.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think...
<Larry King> <Neutral> That's their 50th anniversary.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that, that's probably where it's going to go.
<Larry King> <Negative> Have you been there much?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have -- I was there once. It's terrific.
<Larry King> <Positive> Great place.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, it's terrific. It's amazing, actually.
<Larry King> <Negative> Ever sorry you went into Atlantic City?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, Atlantic City...
<Larry King> <Neutral> Even with the downs you had?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, no, Atlantic City really saved me. I'm having the best year I ever had. I would've never probably gotten here without Atlantic City, because when the real estate market in New York crashed -- and it crashed -- Atlantic City was throwing off these huge cash flows in the early '90s.
<Larry King> <Negative> Because if you didn't have it...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, forget it. I mean, I -- you wouldn't be interviewing -- or you maybe interviewing me, but how does it feel to be under a rock, you know? No, Atlantic City was a great thing for me and it continues to be a great thing for me.
<Larry King> <Neutral> When...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Trump Taj Mahal is number one in Atlantic City. Trump Plaza is number two in Atlantic City. Caesar's is number three, so, you see all the fighting going on for Caesar's, and yet I have two places that are beating out Caesar's and everybody else.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Are people trying to buy Caesar's?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> People are trying to buy Caesar's.
<Larry King> <Negative> Oh, I didn't know that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, they're really trying...
<Larry King> <Negative> When -- are you trying to sell one of your properties?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I now put one of them up for sale. And somebody said, why? I mean, it's doing huge business.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Which one?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's doing record -- Trump Plaza. It's doing record business. But they said -- just like I just sold my piece of the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York, which I built and it's sort of sad, you know, you hate to sell...
<Larry King> <Neutral> That was your land mark.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I loved it.
<Larry King> <Neutral> That was your baby.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it's beautiful. I built it on 42nd Street. I just sold it. I got a huge price. I sold it to Hyatt.
<Larry King> <Neutral> They managed it, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And everyone said, why did you sell it in good times. I said, that's why I sold it, because I've also been there in bad times and you don't sell at bad times.
<Larry King> <Positive> Who's buying Trump Plaza?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have a lot of interest from a lot of different people. Merrill Lynch is handling it and we'll see what happens -- if I get the right price, I'll sell it.
<Larry King> <Negative> More with the incredible Donald Trump after this. [Commercial Break] We talked about Miss Universe. Your daughter's going to host Miss USA?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well...
<Larry King> <Neutral> What are you -- Trump looking to take over everything? What is it? What is it you want?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's life.
<Larry King> <Negative> Slow down.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know what it is -- it's life. We have to enjoy it. And that's probably why my relationship suffers. But the fact is that I have a daughter that's spectacular and we have -- I bought what's called -- you know, I say this jokingly, but they actually call it this -- the triple crown of beauty. I bought it with CBS, who have been terrific.
<Larry King> <Negative> So you're partners in Miss USA?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm pageant -- I'm partners -- and so we have Miss USA and Miss Universe and Miss Teen USA and Miss Teen USA is coming up in a few weeks and Ivanka is going to be the hostess of Miss Teen USA. That's going to be in Texas, and that's terrific. She wants to do it, so...
<Larry King> <Neutral> Back to Atlantic City -- are you still taking on the Indian reservations?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I take them on and I guess...
<Larry King> <Negative> Some thought you were -- that was a little ethnic...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, they thought it was ethnic but it wasn't ethnic. It's just that I always felt they should pay taxes. I think what's happening is...
<Larry King> <Negative> Because they have gambling casinos in which they don't have to pay tax, right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They have gambling casinos...
<Larry King> <Neutral> ...Indian's property.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...where they're paying no tax and every politician knows it's not appropriate or not right, but they haven't done anything about it yet.
<Larry King> <Negative> But don't you think we owe them something?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think we do. I think to a certain extent, we do, if they're real Indians. I mean, you have to check and see whether or not they're the real Indians. You know, you have...
<Larry King> <Negative> You're questioning that, Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, you have to see who's running the casinos. And you know, I made a statement, they don't look like Indians to me. And everyone said, oh, what a terrible statement. I said, what's wrong? They don't. If you take a look at these folks, they don't like Indians to me. And then, actually, a number of shows did a story that my statement was 100 percent correct. I never liked to apologize and there's no reason to apologize. But I think the Indian casinos are -- you know, they're being looked at very seriously.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Are you going to buy into that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't...
<Larry King> <Neutral> Can you buy into an Indian casino?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You can, but you're only there for seven years. I have a lot of great relationships with the Indian casinos, now...
<Larry King> <Negative> Oh, you do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The fact is -- yeah, I really do. I mean, I have very, very good relationships with a lot of the Indians and a lot of the Indian casinos at the high levels. And we'll what happens on that.
<Larry King> <Positive> What's their most successful one? The one in Connecticut?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Probably the one in Connecticut and that's almost -- you know, I wonder about this, but it's actually been an asset to Atlantic City because it's so close to Boston and people from Boston are now going down to Atlantic City, because Atlantic City is doing tremendous business. So, it's been...
<Larry King> <Neutral> When is Atlantic City going to built up?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, as you know...
<Larry King> <Positive> We talked about this for years and it still remains basically hotels and a run-down area.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right, if you were there in the last year, you'd see it's a whole different place.
<Larry King> <Negative> Haven't been there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They just opened -- they just opened the new convention center. They just opened a new airport.
<Larry King> <Negative> Oh, they did?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, yeah, the areas -- the blighted areas that you saw a number of years ago are all ripped down -- for the most part ripped down. And as you know, every major casino company is dying to come it.
<Larry King> <Negative> Oh, that's the hot place, now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Atlantic City is the hot place.
<Larry King> <Positive> Do you want that? Do you like competition? Some people say competition's great. If four restaurant's are on a corner, they're all doing well, I want the fifth.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right, I like it. I like that the fact that they're coming in -- Mirage wants to come in. Circus Circus wants to come in. Boyd Gaming wants to come in -- lot of other companies -- MGM wants to come in.
<Larry King> <Neutral> You got no problem with that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sun wants to come in.
<Larry King> <Negative> Doesn't that help?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like it. No, I mean, it's good. I have the best locations. I have -- I have, you know, I was there first. I have all the best locations and they want to come in, and you know, I look forward to competing with them, but the fact is the market will get bigger and stronger and I think it'll do even better than it does right now.
<Larry King> <Neutral> How many hotels -- I mean, what can this hold? How much more can it take?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it has a huge population base because, you know, you're surrounded by New York and Pennsylvania and Virginia...
<Larry King> <Negative> Bigger -- much bigger than Vegas?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And really much bigger and actually Atlantic City -- the thing that most people don't know, that Atlantic City -- the twelve hotels in Atlantic City do more business right now, than the entire Las Vegas strip and nobody knows that -- by a substantial amount.
<Larry King> <Neutral> You're kidding.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And that includes Mirage and MGM -- all the big hotels.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Atlantic City...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Atlantic City does more business than the entire Las Vegas strip and very few people know that.
<Larry King> <Positive> We'll be right back with more of Donald Trump, don't go away. [Commercial Break] Back with Donald Trump. Before we talk about New York, your town and its revitalization. And the crime down, and what's going on here. Everyone's talking about Versace. Did you know Gianni Versace.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes I did. In fact, he used Mar-a-Lago to do his major shoot with Madonna as the model and that was about a year ago.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Was he as nice as everyone said?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was as nice and I knew him and I know his sister very well, Donatella. And I can't imagine how something like this could happen.
<Larry King> <Positive> When you hear about something like this and you mention you watched last night and we are talking about Gavin de Becker and security and he works with people like yourself -- celebrities. Do you get nervous? You are a celebrity.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what I do, I'm very much a fatalist and I have my problem with stalkers. I have one right now, sort of.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Really, male or female?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Male. And I have -- you know, it's a problem, it's a real problem. I have great guys. I have like the best guy right here and I have just a great group of guys and it's all you can do. And then after that, you know you can't totally change your life. You can't lead a miserable life because of it. It's unbelievable what happened to Versace.
<Larry King> <Negative> John Kennedy once said if someone wants to get you and that's all they think about, you're in trouble.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> True. Absolutely true, and they don't have to be smart, they don't have to be this. They just want to get you and what you can do is you can take precautions and you can surround yourself with some very tough people. And you can do certain things but you know, ultimately, it's a problem.
<Larry King> <Neutral> You gotta be aware?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You have to be aware.
<Larry King> <Negative> Do you worry about New York -- you gotta worry about everything, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, Rudy Guilliani has done a tremendous job as mayor of New York and the crime rate is way down. It's not even on the charts any more, as you know. New York is one of the six...
<Larry King> <Neutral> One of the six cities.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... and it's -- he's done an incredible job, this mayor, and you know, I feel very safe in New York and I can't say that I felt that way a number of years ago. New York City is a hot city. It's a hot city from the real estate standpoint but I think one of the reasons that New York is now the hottest city in the country in terms of heaty -- not the heat from the sun -- is the fact that it's really a safe place to be.
<Larry King> <Positive> Gianni Versace should have felt safe in South Beach, the Riviera of the west...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, he should but South Beach has a lot of problems. I mean, South Beach is not a safe place to be and it hasn't been a safe place to be and they do have crime rates that are very high and it's still wild, it's great. But I'm not sure you want to live there necessarily, and he found out. But I think if he were some place else the same thing would have happened if this was the mission of this man.
<Larry King> <Positive> So Trump the fatalist has to be aware and give thought to the Cunanans. There are Cunanans out there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am aware -- you have to aware otherwise you're a fool, but again I don't think you can change your entire life. You're not going to go into a very safe little place and just lock the door and never come out. I just don't think you can do that. And I am a fatalist. I say hey, what happens, happens, and maybe it's predestined, who knows? It's a terrible thing that happened.
<Larry King> <Neutral> OK, in New York. What's going on economically?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It is doing unbelievable. It's a boom town, as you know, very well.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Is this a pendulum thing?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It is. It's always...
<Larry King> <Negative> Goes up or down. Houston's down, Houston's up; Boston's down, Boston's up. New York's now up.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It does. New York is up. I mean I'm in a lot of other cities. I have real estate in a lot of other cities but I've never seen -- including Los Angeles -- I've never seen a city as hot as New York is right now. I just built a new building, Trump International Hotel and Tower and it's almost sold out before we've opened...
<Larry King> <Neutral> The restaurant to do for. That restaurant, you got a four star rating in the New York Times by John George. Can you even get in?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You cannot even get in. It's over a year wait to get in.
<Larry King> <Neutral> That was a site of what? What was on that site?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That was originally the Gulf and Western Paramount Building -- Paramount Pictures. And basically we ripped it down -- and General Electric, Galbraith, myself -- we ripped it down right to the steel and rebuilt it as a super luxury building called Trump International Hotel and Tower. And it has been some tremendous success.
<Larry King> <Positive> Right at Central Park West.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Larry King> <Positive> So, this art of the deal continues in you, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, for me it continues. I mean again I got back to basics. Now I have a much bigger, stronger company than I had in the '80s, but I had to go back and just go back to work.
<Larry King> <Positive> All right. Wall Street Journal did a profile of you
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, Larry, I've always been able to make money. I've always made a lot of money, even at a very young age and I think that had I focused in 1989 or '90, I would have never had the difficulties where -- you know, that everybody else had. I mean, a lot of people had those difficulties but I think I would have probably got through it a lot easier without having to work so hard. I really just went back and I focused and I went back to the basics and I did a lot of things myself and I have a great group of people around me, and I got rid of some that were stiffs...
<Larry King> <Positive> All right, was there a turnaround event? Turnaround year?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes I think the turnaround event was around 1991 when I was in really deep -- you know, some people say I had $8.8 billion of debt. That's a lot of debt, OK? Now I also had huge assets ...
<Larry King> <Negative> Were you in bankruptcy?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, I never went bankrupt and I was really proud of that.
<Larry King> <Negative> You lost the airline though, you lost the boat?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh no, I sold the airline. I sold the boat. I sold a couple of things that were unimportant.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I have now far more assets than I had then, which is hard to believe. Now I have 40 Wall Street, the 72-story building on Wall Street which is one of the great buildings in New York. I own the Empire State Building.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I own a lot of different things that I never owned then. I mean, it's just been an amazing period of time and actually I give a lot of credit to the early part where I was indeed troubled and of course, I had a wife that was suing me for billions of dollars. You know, she was saying you're worth five billion dollars, I just want half. And I ended up fighting and I ended up -- actually the prenuptial agreement -- you know it was held and that was that. But I had a -- you know, a lot of it was quite nasty and the way she went after it ...
<Larry King> <Neutral> But you turned it around?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's now better than ever before. It's been amazing actually. For me it's been a lot of fun.
<Larry King> <Positive> Dan Rather tomorrow night. On Friday night we'll give you a preview of the sale of the property of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. And Saturday night, Harrison Ford. We'll be right back. [Commercial Break] By the way, speaking of Duke and Duchess of Windsor, will you ever bid in an auction like that? Are you a collector?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would love to go and see it. I would love to go and see it.
<Larry King> <Positive> Well, we're going to have a preview here Friday night. Come over, we'll show you the things. You're a sharp business man, come over and we'll show you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll take a look.
<Larry King> <Positive> You've worked with a lot of consortiums, right? You mention Mr. Galbraith, you worked with the Japanese et cetera. Is there, for want of a better term, secret, when you have partners?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think -- I mean, I do a lot of it myself and I also have partnerships. I have fabulous partners in Hong Kong who probably are watching your program right now but...
<Larry King> <Negative> Japan too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... I have tremendous new world, Henry Chang and Vincent Lowe and a lot of the great people from Hong Kong are my partners, on the biggest job ever approved by the New York City Planning Commission, that I'm building right now in New York City.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Which is?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's called Riverside South -- temporarily, at least -- it's called Riverside South.
<Larry King> <Neutral> On the west side?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> On the west side, along the west side highway...
<Larry King> <Negative> That's why you wanted to get the Yankees to go?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, no, no, not actually, that's down in a different site but it actually looks like the Grand Coulee Dam is being built. We have more cranes and more people working there than...
<Larry King> <Negative> What is it going to be, offices?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... six thousand units of housing overlooking the Hudson River, right behind Lincoln Center.
<Larry King> <Neutral> And that's Hong Kong partners?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And where I have Hong Kong partners, they're terrific. I'm doing a deal opposite the United Nations with Daewoo which is a tremendous company from Korea. They have Korean partners. General Electric is my partner...
<Larry King> <Positive> How do you get the Korean partner? This fascinates.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, what really happens -- and it's a little bit like what happens with you -- if you call up to do an interview they say, OK, we'll do it. If somebody else calls up, one of your competitors, they'll say forget it. Nobody watches, nobody cares. I mean generally speaking. People really seek me out. I have the hottest name in the business. I'm the biggest developer now in New York by far...
<Larry King> <Negative> So you get the call from the Korean interest? We want to do...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I get the call, we want to do a job or even sometimes they bring the land. Usually I bring everything. I have the land, I have the this, I have the that -- but they want to be my investor, they want to be my partner and the reason is we're just hot. I mean we're doing great and everybody likes Trump and it's one of those things.
<Larry King> <Positive> Is real estate in the long run always good? Some people contend that no matter where you are, if you've got property, sit, you'll be OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think good real estate is always good. Great real estate is always, always good. But good real estate is always good, eventually and there's something there...
<Larry King> <Positive> How do you know what's good?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's what the key is. I mean you have to know where and what. Like Trump -- I mean, Trump Tower hasn't gone down from the day I built it. You know you have the dips in the market but ...
<Larry King> <Neutral> The gold building on Fifth Avenue.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That is a great building and to this day, I mean it was -- like I said the casinos during the early '90s were great to me but the fact is Trump Tower was just chugging also, and it's been a great building from the day I built it.
<Larry King> <Negative> Was it sad to sell the Plaza?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It wasn't and I own a piece of the Plaza. We're going to be...
<Larry King> <Negative> But you don't run it as you used to run it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The Plaza Hotel, it was a great sale at the time I did it and I was really lucky to be able to have sold it for the kind of money because these were the building blocks to coming back and to doing what I've done. And I did sell that and it worked out tremendously for me and everybody else and now we'll probably do something with the Plaza on the top. The people that I'm involved with are very nice people and I think you're going to see some interesting stuff coming out of the Plaza. But I owned 100 percent of the Plaza and now I own a much smaller portion but it worked out sort of great for me because it was a lot of money at that time.
<Larry King> <Negative> Back to the Grand Hyatt which you sold. That made the Trump name initially in New York didn't it? That beautiful building on 40 -- that was a spectacular new concept in a run down area and then suddenly, boom?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it made that whole part of the city boom and the Grand Hyatt Hotel was my first baby.
<Larry King> <Negative> That's what I meant.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We did the convention center in New York and then I did the Grand Hyatt.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Usually people -- I remember Ted Turner once said, I may sell a lot of things but CNN is going to be my baby -- Time Warner is still his baby. One thought that was your baby.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the Grand Hyatt I sold recently in very good times for a huge price. I sold the Hyatt and...
<Larry King> <Negative> Everything's price, Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. In that case it was yes. I wasn't married to the Grand Hyatt. I'm married to Trump Tower I guess. Like Ted would be married to CNN, my thing would be Trump Tower next to Tiffany. That really is the building that's very special...
<Larry King> <Neutral> Even though Grand Hyatt was the first?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Grand Hyatt was the first but I wasn't married to it. I got a price that was a good deal for me and a good deal for Hyatt. They were really happy to get it but...
<Larry King> <Negative> No emotional ties?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There was no real emotional ties -- a little bit. I mean, anytime you build something and you put your guts into something for a number of years and you build this beautiful product, and it was a big success from the day I built it and it rejuvenated that whole section of New York. It was a tremendous thing but, no, I was never married to that. There I was married to a good price and I got a good price. Trump Tower would be the thing I'm really married to in terms of real estate.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Back with more of Donald Trump, don't go away. [Commercial Break] The Art of the Deal -- that was -- are you going to write another book?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have one coming. It just happens that Random House is doing it. It is called The Art of the Comeback.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Not a bad title.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And a lot of people have gone through a lot of turmoil and they can't figure out how to come back and so it's coming along.
<Larry King> <Positive> Good idea. The world's getting smaller. Hong Kong is now part of China. Did you invest in Hong Kong?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Hong Kong is hot.
<Larry King> <Neutral> You would invest in it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I would only invest if I had somebody with me. One of the great people of Hong Kong. Because it is a special place. It is a special business, it is a whole different set of circumstances. And it is too far away. So I wouldn't do it if I was going to be hands-on and do it myself because it is just too far away.
<Larry King> <Negative> So, have you dealt with the Chinese?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Larry King> <Positive> Someone said a hand shake is a deal with the Chinese and they never welsh.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have found that New World and Vincent Lowe and Henry Chang have been among the most honorable I have ever dealt with. And they are my partners on the big West Side Railroad Yard Development.
<Larry King> <Negative> So if they called you to go in there...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I would invest, but I would want them to run that investment like I run this investment.
<Larry King> <Negative> What was your biggest mistake? Not personally, business- wise.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I really think that my biggest mistake was that I did not focus. I really don't think there was an individual...
<Larry King> <Negative> No one project.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. You know the beauty with my -- unlike at Canary Wharf where they poured billions of dollars in England into this job and it was just wasted. My job is real solid. They came due -- one or two of them came due at a bad a time. But that was OK. They worked out Trump Palace on Third Avenue and Sixty-Ninth -- a beautiful job. It came out, it was a big success in the end. But it finished at a very bad time, during the crash, essentially. Because, you know, New York, and even this country was in a depression. Not a recession, it was a depression.
<Larry King> <Negative> Beat George Bush.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And don't let anyone ever tell you -- beat George Bush is right. And it was an absolute disaster. And I think my biggest problem wasn't any specific job, because they were all solid and good jobs. My biggest problem was that I did not focus, I was having a good time and I was enjoying life.
<Larry King> <Negative> We have asked actors and actresses, are there roles they feel sorry they didn't take? Is there anything you had a chance to buy and didn't buy, and now say, should have bought that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I guess I could say any piece of real estate in Manhattan, because real estate in Manhattan has gone through the roof, OK? So, you could almost say anything.
<Larry King> <Negative> Anything you turned down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Anything.
<Larry King> <Neutral> No kidding.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the fact is, I'm really -- look, I'm the biggest real estate developer in New York, by far. And I am the biggest casino owner in Atlantic City, by far. So I can't really say, gee, I should have done this or that.
<Larry King> <Positive> Were you ever offered like, a building in Chicago that you thought about, didn't do, and now its. Well, forget New York. A building in Dallas.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't like to look back. I don't think you can look back. You know, Alan Greenberg, the head of Bear Stearns is a tremendous guy.
<Larry King> <Positive> Great guy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's an incredible guy. He is one of the great traders of all time. And Alan once -- the only argument I ever had, I sold the stock and I made a lot of money and I called him back two days later because the stock had gone up after I sold it. I said Allen, why did we sell, we should held at -- and he went nuts. He said, you sold the stock, forget it, that stock is dead. And I realized, he's right. You can't look back, you just have to look forward and learn from the past, but you really have to look forward.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Ever interested in a sports team again?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that it is a very tough business for the owners. It seems to only make money when you sell. Other than a Georgetown- bred, who I have to tell you, you talk about underrated, this guy has done such a great job with the Yankees and he never gets the credit that he deserves. Every year he is right there, knocking at the door, and I remember the Yankees before George had them. When they were owned by somebody else. And I will tell you that they were in last place every year.
<Larry King> <Negative> Might he move them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think so, I think George is a great fan of New York. He is a great friend of Rudy Giulliani and I don't think he would do that because I think it would hurt Rudy very badly.
<Larry King> <Negative> Ah, but Wilpon and Doubleday and the Mets.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Terrific guys and they are doing a great job. This town is doing well in every way.
<Larry King> <Neutral> You like Giulliani?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he is terrific. He has done -- he has been a great, not a good man, he has been a great man.
<Larry King> <Positive> He is favored tremendously.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he is favored.
<Larry King> <Neutral> What about Governor Pataki?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Terrific man. A wonderful guy and he has been a great governor.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Because you were friends with Governor Pataki, too?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And by the way, you know me, I will tell you if I think differently. I am not just saying this -- everyone is watching this saying, oh, well he is just like...
<Larry King> <Negative> What about Bill Clinton? You have criticized presidents before and you have done well with Bill Clinton.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I really respect -- this guy has got to be the toughest guy to take the kind of abuse that he has taken. Can you imagine going home to Hillary on a nightly basis with the kinds of things being said. I mean, just -- he has got to be the toughest guy there is.
<Larry King> <Positive> Yet you have done well with him, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what? It is very hard when the economy -- it is like I said to you at the very beginning. My company is much bigger, much stronger, much more powerful. Some of that has to do with the economy.
<Larry King> <Negative> How are you going to be mad at the president?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is very tough. He has done a good job.
<Larry King> <Negative> We'll be back with our remaining moments with Donald Trump. Don't go away. [Commercial Break] Couple of quick things: You own a riverboat casino on Lake Michigan? How is it going?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. It is doing great.
<Larry King> <Negative> Where is that, in Gary, Indiana?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right outside of Chicago and Indiana and it has been just doing fantastically. It is amazing.
<Larry King> <Negative> Why is gambling so popular?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it has become very strong. In certain markets. It is almost a form of voluntary taxation, but it in certain markets, like in the Indiana area right outside of Chicago, it has been very strong. In some areas, it hasn't been strong. Atlantic City has been good. Las Vegas, obviously, has been good over the years. But this Indiana location has been phenomenal.
<Larry King> <Negative> But it is spreading everywhere, isn't it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's spreading to a lot of places. But not as many places as you think. It is not coming to New York, it is not coming to Florida, it is not coming to Pennsylvania, where they all thought, you know, those were three places, if you were to say, three, four years ago, is it coming? Everybody would have said yes. It is actually hard to get gambling off. But it is in a lot places, we will see.
<Larry King> <Negative> We discussed crime being down. Is the Mafia still a factor in New York?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think it is a big factor in New York. I think it is always going to be -- I always thought it was built up more than it probably should have been.
<Larry King> <Negative> You never had a deal with them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No,
<Larry King> <Negative> You were going to protect your building, that old cliche out of the '40s?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I haven't. I guess that is one of the, probably, assets of being a celebrity in a sense, because they don't want to deal with celebrities, the last people they want to talk. But I have not found it to be a factor.
<Larry King> <Neutral> What is, in all of this -- how old are you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Fifty-one. Can you believe this? I used to be the youngest guy and now I am 51.
<Larry King> <Negative> Regrets, I have had a few, the song goes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right.
<Larry King> <Negative> Biggest regret?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have no regrets. I really have none. I have had an incredible life, I have learned a lot. I probably learned more during my downtime, during my bad time, financially, than I ever learned before. I learned that there were some great loyal people and I have learned that there were some people that could have been more loyal. And those people I have discarded totally and do whatever I can to.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Any business that intrigues you? That you haven't gone into?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love the creation of building great buildings. I love -- I have a friend who makes a lot of money putting cable in the ground, OK? He is a very rich man. Puts cable in the ground. And he walked into Trump Tower the other day, and he said, you know, Donald, there is something about, look at this building.
<Larry King> <Negative> You don't want to put cable in the ground.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He said, you know, nobody even knows I put the cable, we cover it up and that is it. I make three cents a foot and I am a rich guy. But the fact is, there is something really creative, it is my art.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Do you want to make movies?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think so, no. I will leave that to Ted Turner and some other people that do it much better.
<Larry King> <Positive> Thanks, Donald, as always. Thanks for coming back here. Donald Trump, the comeback kid. Thanks very much for joining us. Dan Rather is with us -- with us tomorrow night. With Dan, it could be either one. Have a lot of laughs. And Friday night, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and Donald may buy something. Saturday night, Harrison Ford. Thanks for joining us. From New York, good night.
