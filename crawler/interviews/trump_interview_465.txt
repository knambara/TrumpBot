<Donald Trump> <Negative> I like Howard, but I have to be crazy to be here. [Commercial Break]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Look at this, Look who I'm here with. Look at that. Multi-billionaire, Donald Trump. Good to see you, Donald. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hey, Howard. How you doing?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Huh. You thought I was riff-raff here on the E channel. You have watched the show?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I watch it. It's a little tough to get it in New York but we're going to change that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> We're going to change that. Donald's going to change that. A lot of people saying, Hey, Howard how did you get Donald Trump on the show? A lot of people will ask that because Donald is a man of fierce loyalty but he's also fierce with his enemies. If someone is your enemy you don't associate with them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't -- I don't really like people that are enemies and I like to destroy them. It's that you -- you understand as you did.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yes. I have that same moo-doo-whama-jamma that everybody loves. I have that same killer instinct. Of course, I'm not a billionaire, that's the problem. I have the killer instinct but I'm not a billionaire. Donald Trump, I'll tell you how I became your friend. I saw Donald Trump as a victim, a victim during the Ivana divorce case, I saw you as a victim. And people said, Well, wait a second, Donald Trump isn't good to women, Donald Trump dates a lot of different women, Donald Trump was cheating on his wife, Donald Trump was doing this. I saw you as the victim in this case.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You know why I so you as a victim?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Why should I say anything? This is beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Should I tell you why I so you as the victim? Because people at home don't know what to think of Donald Trump. There are people who hate you, Right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There are some people that dislike me intensely.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are they jealous?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hate to say they're jealous but perhaps they are.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Are they jealous because they -- you are living the life that they want to be living.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That could be.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That could be it. Let me tell you something. What happened to Donald Trump and I'll do it briefly. He was married to this Ivana. All right, like a lot of guys you fell out of love. True?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> True.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> True? [Inaudible] What is this, a courtroom? [Inaudible] So, you fell out of love with Ivana. Okay. You did a very honorable thing. You paid her $25 million for a divorce settlement.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's a lot of money.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A lot of money.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> The time you were in financial trouble.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The deepest trouble of my life. Absolutely.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Were you truly in financial trouble?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Deep, deep trouble.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You were -- They said that you were bankrupt, but within your corporation have been bankrupt. But you personally would not [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They thought I might be bankrupt. They didn't know. Nobody really understood. And perhaps I didn't even understand, but I was -- I was at a pretty low point in my life. This is about two years ago and since then a lot of great things have happened but at that point, that was the lowest financial point in life.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Could you have lost all of your personal money? I mean, could Donald Trump could --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I could have.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You could have been a working stiff. You know how embarrassing it would be to be like Donald Trump and going to work like a supermarket. He's the vice president of a supermarket. That would have been embarrassing. True?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It could happen.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Could happen. You were really nervous. And yet you were able to put together 25 million -- excuse me I spit on you, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's okay.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Twenty-five million dollars. I put together 25 million. You put together $25 million to pay your wife. And you said to your wife, by the way, you would gotten her to sign a prenuptial agreement. True?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's correct?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> How the hell did you get her to sign a prenuptial agreement. A lot of guys out there want to know about this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Twenty-five million it's easy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But -- but -- but seriously, she knew that she could not have your empire. What's the move there? How do you say, Hey, Ivana honey, sign this little agreement. How do you do it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> At that time, she was challenging the agreement. She was suing me for two and a half billion dollars. And when the times really hit low, at the lowest at the worst day of my life. New York Times front page, Wall Street Journal front page, all of a sudden she called up and she said I'll take the $25 million.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. But how did you get her to sign the prenuptial? Was this before. You know, before you were married you said --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It really wasn't easy but it worked out. I mean, it worked.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So, you got her to sig. Why you were married to her?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Before I was married and then ultimately I had another one signed while we were married.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That is fantastic. That is unbelievable. If I was Ivana, I never would've signed. Never.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What I'm -- Hey, I'm no bim. [Inaudible] Let me tell you something. So, there you -- That is truly the art of the deal is it not.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know if it's the art of the deal but I will tell you she did sign it and she should have lived up to it. And then after she got the money.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Exactly.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think I know what you're gonna say.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You gave her $25 million. He gives her the money. Now listen to this. He gives her the money and she goes ahead and she writes a book. Now part of the deal was, if you took $25 million, I'm spitting all over you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's okay. I don't mind.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And I shouldn't spit all over you because you have germ phobia. True?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do have germ phobia.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You wash your hands, how many times a day?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> As many times as possible.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But you realize that's a psychological problem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It could be a psychological problem.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But there's no way for you to get -- You cannot overpower this problem, you know that -- a
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, so far I haven't left to wash my hands. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I mean theoretically you know, because that's obsessive-compulsive, right? Have you ever gone to a psychiatrist to eliminate that problem?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's called hand --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like it. I like cleanliness. Cleanliness is a nice thing. Not only hands, body, everything.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How was that compulsion take form? In other words, you are also -- all your women are AIDs tested? True?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, hopefully, they don't have AIDS.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> How do you get the women to get the AIDS test, that's the best part of this interview. How do you say to a woman, Hey, you -- And you date beautiful women. You got Marla Maples, you've got all the various models, all models. True?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Not all models but beautiful women. I tend to like beautiful women more than unattractive women. I don't know, maybe that makes me bad.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Join the club. And with this face, it's no problem and getting beautiful women. When you got a mug like this, they all go for you. So in other words, you say to them, Hey, I'll sleep with you. I'm Trump. I'm worth billions. I can change your life. You go take an AIDS test. Do you have a special doctor that you trust and --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that rumor started getting out there and somehow that story is going out and it isn't the idea.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I thought you started that rumor?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, no, no. I didn't start it. It was in an article, and you know how articles starts, and it just keeps getting repeated.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So, the girls don't have to take an AIDS test?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Not really. I'm just very careful, though.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I own 25% of Goodyear Tire and Rubber.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You wear a rubber? There you go, there's something interesting you don't hear every day on TV. So, in other words --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I am very careful with the people. But you can't be too careful.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Why not? You got a great life.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Can I tell you what? AIDS is a disaster.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> AIDS attack everyone.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. It attacks everybody, and who knows.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And let's say you have a lot of girlfriends. True?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I -- I like a lot of people.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, who doesn't? So, anyway getting back to it, you get Ivana to sign this prenuptial agreement and what does she do? Donald says, I will give you the $25 million, but don't don't write about me, don't talk about me. Personally, I'd shut my mouth for 10 million.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The one big condition.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> The one big condition.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The one big condition.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So, what does she do? There she goes, I want to write a book. I want to write a book. It's -- It's not it's not their true story. What I will do is I won't call the man in the book the Donald, I'll call him the Ronald. And the book was clearly about you, was it not?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was, it was.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And you are entitled to that $25 million back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If there was a judge with courage, and I heard you saying this once on your morning show in your radio show. If there were a judge with courage they would give me that $25 million back. Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Now, which is better? The old Ivana or the new Ivana? . Isn't it the ultimate trip to have a wife or a woman change your whole physical appearance just to keep you, Donald Trump. That to me -- For what -- My wife, if she would even go on an exercise regimen for me I'd be happy. She walking around she doesn't care what she looks like. But really Ivana, I feel in order to hold on to you, really did a remarkable makeover. Is [Inaudible] correct?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't want -- I don't want to talk about what she did or whatever but -- And she's a good woman and I'll always love her.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> She's not a good woman, Donald. I'm going to tell you something. Any woman, if you give her $25 million -- You don't have to say she's a good woman. She's not a good woman. She's the mother of your children. That's true.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> True.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But that's it. That's as far as it goes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. But she's the mother of my children.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> She's screwing you. She screwed you on this. I'm saying you don't have to say, you sit there quiet. I'm saying for $25 million, she should keep her mouth shut. True?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She should not have said anything.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Of course. A deal is a deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She should not have been commercial. She should not have done what she did. She did it and there's litigation on this whole point. It will be interesting to see what a judge rules.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, I certainly would rule in your favor.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And why can't you be a judge?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm not a judge, although I have the hair of a judge. An English judge. So, let's -- Do I to take a break? Okay. I'm going to take a break, Donald. When we come back I want to explore the various women you are dating. I have pictures.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Explore in what sense?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Because I -- I want to look at pictures of them. I have exercise videos of Marla Maples.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The originals?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I have great stuff. I've got all different pictures of the model. Then we'll evaluate the different models.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we'll choose the best.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And we will choose the best one. Because you are living my fantasy life. You really are. With all that money, then we'll talk about your money. Then will look in your wallet and we'll see how much money you have in your wallet. I'm very curious. Donald Trump, back on the E channel. All right. Whatever it is, they call it E. Right after this. [Commercial Break] Hey, I'm sitting here with Donald Trump. This is E. I'm Howard Stern. What an interview program. [Inaudible]. We're talking about my favorite topic. Women. Why does a woman date you, Donald? Why does a woman date you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know, Howard. But I know that it's something that I work at. And it's something --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So, you think it's the money only?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hope not. I will say this, I have a lot of wealthy friends, a lot of them, they can't get a date, they try like hell and they can't get a date.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wealthy guys.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Wealthy guys.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And you once said that the best way to treat a woman is to treat her like duty.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I never said that but
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You never did?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was attributed to me. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But I'll tell you some, I agree with that statement. They don't listen otherwise. I tell you women are troublemakers. I couldn't get women. [Inaudible] Ah, shut up. The dummies working here. [Inaudible] So, you never did say that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No I never said that but it was attributed to me.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I see. So you treat women with respect.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't say that either. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right. Good. All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do, I treat women with great respect.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Guys, treat women somewhere in between respect and do -- do. All right, very good. Now, let's get to the women, let's see pictures. That's what I'm into, okay? Number one, let's get to here's a woman that you are associated with. Her name is Frederique. She is a lingerie model. This is a girl -- this is a girl who is your girlfriend, Now --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well she's a really good friend and she's a great woman and she's going to be very successful as time goes by in terms of other things. But right now she's one of the most successful models she works for Victoria's Secret.

<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know. I do know [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How many times does it take Donald Trump to close that deal?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Frederique, I must tell you this Frederique's is just a friend. Different women different things. Yes, Frederick is just a friend.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You have not scored with her. You have not kissed her you've not got to second base third base him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's such a personal thing perhaps she wouldn't want to even talk about.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Would it ruin your chances with her if you do mention something like that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Probably not.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Is it not true that you picked up Marla Maples at the airport this morning?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Woo.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. I read about that.

<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it won't
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You said that women like being treated badly.
