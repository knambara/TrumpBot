<Howard Stern> <Positive> [Laughter] Alright, let me tell you why I admire Donald Trump. Donald, are you there? I mean, Mr. Trump… I shouldn't…
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi Howard.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Mr. Trump.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Anybody who acquires that much wealth should be called Mr. Trump.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I see. Well, you got a mister in front of you now.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You damn right. I respect that, right off the bat I respect that. I respect anybody who can acquire that kind of wealth and maintain it.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh, and you can't call him Donald and respect him?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No. Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You can call me Donald and I tell you it's been a lot of fun.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm not comfortable calling you Donald, all right? Let me tell you why I admire you, you've done something -- Again you've impressed me.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> So how did he impress you this time?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right. So I'm watching tv, and as you know Mr. Trump bought two beauty pageants. He purchased -- And at first I said, why would somebody buy beauty pageants? The second he buys them they become a big deal. He bought this Miss -- What, Universe?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Miss Universe.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And Miss USA pageant.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Now, the Miss Universe it turns out, the woman won last year blows up to a fat pig. I mean like, obese. Now, most people would've fired her.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Well, people are calling for her to be fired.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Because she -- but because she was obese. Mr. Trump goes in there and he says, look, and he says, listen you pulled him aside he says, I'm not going to fire you but you better -- you better get skinny. You better lose some weight what the he -- It's almost a fraud here. You pass yourself off, for one year you keep yourself under control. Learn to diet and you --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Isn't their clauses that she can only gain so much weight?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> More or less, yes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You whip this fat slob into shape. I don't know how you did it. I see all these diet plans, everything else. God bless you. You whipped her into shape and you hold the whole pageant together. Congratulations.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that was an amazing one.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How did you whip her into shape?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She was from one 118 to almost 170.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. And you got her right down again to 118, didn't you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she's going to be there. She is probably 145 or something.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow. How -- What did you do? What did you -- threaten? I mean, how do you do that?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You make her walk from Venezuela? [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know we had a lot of pressure.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I got to say something, when my wife gave birth, took her two years to lose the goddamn fat. I should have sent you in there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Your wife is beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Beautiful, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Your wife -- your wife is a winner and your wife is beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It took my wife -- Listen, she looks good now because I got her out there jogging and I got to go on --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> But you said it like Donald Trump.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I am. I said you know, I said, You're married to a guy who's doing a movie. What are you, a slob? Why don't you -- Won't you want to present yourself nice? And she whips herself into shape. And believe me, I threatened her, I said, you want to end up like Ivana?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I said, pull yourself together. And she did, you saw her at the birthday show. She looks terrific
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She looks great. She never looked better, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right, exactly. So, seriously, how did you whipped this gargantuan woman into shape?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know it's an amazing phenomenon. She weighed 118 --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. When she won. I don't know if you saw the contest last year, it was from Las Vegas.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> She was beautiful.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She won -- She's the beautiful a woman as I've ever seen.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She looks like Cindy Crawford.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. She gained about 55 lbs in a period of nine months.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> How did she do that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She was like an eating machine.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What does a girl eat to gain -- I mean, in less than a year to gain --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> She must never stop.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I mean, did she -- where did she --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think she ate a lot of everything.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, my -- I mean, her bowel movements, how many does she have a day?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Terminate her crown. You know her -- her Miss Universe rights.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Now, you were smart, you turned it into a -- you turned it into an event, you said, listen --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It has become a major event.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, now everybody can't wait to see what she looks like on pageant night.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Will you keep her under wraps until pageant?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. Actually, she's going to be on tonight. I'm in Louisiana today because they have the Miss USA pageant, which is turned into a big deal.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Now your beautiful wife Marla Maples Trump, who is so beautiful, so much more beautiful than your first wife. What a smart move trading up like that. I swear to God, the other one was a real pain in the ass. You cut your losses, I admire that so much. And now you have Marla Maples Trump, she will host the Miss USA pageant. That's right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's hosting it tonight with George Hamilton, it's on CBS.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> George Hamilton, that loser?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what, Howard? He's amazing, I just saw --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He tan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The tan looks great and he's great at what he does.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What did he do. He tanned.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You watch it tonight and you'll see, he's great. Really? Well, as long as your wife -- What is your wife gonna be wearing? Something plunging? Very plungy. Oh, what she looks like. Oh, my God. Did she have work on -- She looks better than when you married her.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She actually does, I would say.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She does. She doesn't have any work, does she?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No work. Zero work.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Really. Nice to have a woman to done any work.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Donald made her blossom.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, I mean, what a bottom her, huh?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you watch tonight, you'll see.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What's it like when you lay done with her? Tell me, tell me what it's like.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Donald's blushing. You make him blush.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He ain't blushing, he loves this. What it's like when you lay down with --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's 6:20 in the morning in Louisiana, I'm just thinking about this.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How many outfit changes will she have?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How many what?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How many outfit changes?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think she probably has three or four. I knew it was very funny cause last night, late, you know they were rehearsing, 51 girls represent each state, and the District of Columbia and I was absolutely there and I've never seen so many unbelievably beautiful girls.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I bet a few of these broads come onto you too.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What do you do?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What do you do? Is it tough to stay away from --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a tough business. You know it's a tough world.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Sure is.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said to a friend of mine as I walk into this room and you're mobbed by all these incredible girls, I said, you know somebody has to do this, it might as well be me cause it is really amazing, so beautiful these girls.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I am so horny, I swear to God I'd like to take a few of those girls home with me. Oh, my God. Your wife, oh, boy. Is she aggressive?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A little bit, a little bit.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah? That's what I like. I like an aggressive woman. I said to my wife yesterday, said, I wanna come home, I want you to pull my -- Listen to this, I say to my wife, and listen it's 20 years I'm trying to keep the marriage going, keep it alive, listen, you do your best. I come home, I said, listen, when I come home today, right, listen to this, I pull my pants down --
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No, she said, I can do that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, then she said, I can do that. Guess what happened when I got home.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Nothing. Nothing. I tell you, I'm wanna watch this Ms. USA pageant cause I --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I hope. You know, speaking of your wife, I was at the opening of Chicago, which was terrific, about a few months ago and I was with a group of people and one of the people pointed your wife, I had no idea who she was, said, there is a beautiful woman, okay.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now I looked over and it was your wife.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is that right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I thought it was interesting. You're very lucky, Howard. You are very lucky.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> No, I am lucky. But you know, you are around these beautiful women at this USA pageant, it's tempting ain't it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is wild. I've never seen anything like it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Doesn't matter how much money you have, he's in the same circle.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know we have Miss Universe coming up in May and that's all over the world. And in fact, if you'd like to be a judge --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Where?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> At the Miss Universe.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's probably in Miami Beach.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No kidding.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because she had various venues right now. But it's in the middle of May. And if you'd like to be a judge you would see something that would be unbelievable.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Why don't you become a judge?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Because you know what would happen to me? If I become a judge, listen to this, If I become a judge, my wife will go, Oh, can I go to Miami [Inaudible]?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Bring your wife.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Why not?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's it. I wanna go down there, be single.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You can always tell her you're working.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, she'll fall for that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The offer's open to you to be a judge, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. And you'll see something like you've -- You know what, Robin, he will see something like even he has never seen before.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, yes? Snapping jiroh? Snapping jiroh? Yeah, they don't have that. Hey, listen, tonight, everyone watch Marla Maples Trump as she hosts the Miss USA pageant, she's gonna be wearing several plunging necklines. It's nice to tune in and see what Donald's doing that night, right? That's tonight.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They have to watch closely.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Even though George Hamilton will be there, we'll excuse that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I tell you what, he does look terrific.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He looks terrific because that guy does nothing all day.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, Dominick got in trouble when I went over to your birthday, I heard Dominick said I had a problem regarding trouble -- everyone was telling me.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Please, don't even bring it up.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What happened?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What are you doing, associating with that --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know, he's the one, he kept calling me. You gotta come, you gotta come. It's Howard's birthday, you gotta come, and you know, I went over but I heard Dominique's sort of got in trouble with your producer.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> No, don't even bring it up. It's water -- He's all right. He's okay, he's a good ol' boy. He -- I'd rather know him than George Hamilton. George Hamilton is a tan vampire. You hang out with that guy?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't really hang out. I never met him until last night, actually. I tell you what, I was really --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He was friends with Imelda Marcos, you know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true. That worked very much to his advantage.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Sure did.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> From what I understand.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> The Filipino people didn't like it, but what are you're gonna do?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would say the Filipinos who are really too hot on that idea.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, how do you like O.J. finally got his, huh?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We'll, you know, it's unbelievable that that took so long.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, I mean, can you imagine, what was the decision? I think you had to stay in there long time just to keep, you know, everybody -- all the races happy and make it look like some deliberating was going on, do you understand?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was -- it was -- you know, You could make the case of double jeopardy, isn't this double jeopardy, but the attitude is, who cares?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, yeah. What are we gonna do anyway? Listen, all I know is tonight we will be relaxing, I will probably be nude as I watch Miss USA. I have no problem telling you that it would probably be a three-tissue-night.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Oh, stop.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I hear these many beautiful women in this. I recommend all my male listeners lay in front of the tv nude, and pleasure themselves to the Miss USA pageant. And even I don't think Donald will mind if you like Marla Maples Trump.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Now, one of the stipulations in the Miss USA pageant, what kind of suits are we talking about?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, and I got myself into a little bit of a problem, they said, how are you gonna change the pageant because I bought it from ITT, you know the term is ITT, that's now under siege.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I bought it a few months ago from ITT and so somebody called up from Reader's Digest and they said, what change is he gonna make to bring it up. I said, well, you know cause it gives huge ratings, they've always gotten great ratings. And I said, well, the primary change is, I'm gonna get the bathing suits to be smaller and the heels to be higher.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Nice.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And we're gonna bring it in. And a lot of people wanted to see it sort of, updated, so we're gonna update it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, you are -- there are gonna be smaller bathing suits?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Very tiny.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [With Howard Stern] Woah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the time I get it, you know, by the time I have it for a year, forget it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, I like that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's a little gradual. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It's a way to convince nude pageants.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh, yeah, yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Let me tell you something, you're on the right track, you know what the people want. They want smaller swimsuits, and I am not kidding you, I will watch the pageant, legs akimbo, nude, with my tissues, I will pleasure myself. And I promise not to finish during your wife's performance, you understand that, out of respect to you. And congratulations on another great acquisition, the Miss USA pageant tonight on CBS tonight at 9 pm Eastern.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It will be a lot of fun, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right. We'll all tune in.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You take care.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right. Thanks, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And Robin, take care of yourself.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I'll try.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So long.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Bye bye.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And remember, send cash. Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, you have a deal.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay. Thanks.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So long.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Very smart. You heard what he said, he gonna make the swimsuits smaller. That's what I would do.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I am shocked.
