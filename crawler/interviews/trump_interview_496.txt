<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, who's next, Robin.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, Howard, this is the man who sort of just barged into your hotel room a couple of months ago and that's not so nice to do even if he owns the hotel. You were at the Plaza and who owns it? Donald Trump.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right, Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, Donald Trump. Get out of here. Get out of town. [Inaudible]. Think of all women.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Donald Trump. There he is. As a matter of fact, do not shake Donald Trump's hands because he has germ phobia. I learned that on my...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Is that right? I shouldn't shake your hands?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Exactly. He's more afraid of germs than I am.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Really?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He's got it worse than I do.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Oh, I'm shocked.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Donald, do you do any weird rituals or anything with your...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do a lot of hand washing. Every time somebody comes up, I always love when I'm out to dinner and finally you sit down, you wash your hands, you get there and you sneak in, then somebody comes up to the table.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> And shakes your hand.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It doesn't look so great, right? And start shaking their hand all over the place.
<Unidentified Male> <Negative> By the way, if you notice, when Donald Trump hits a room, he has $500 bills hanging out of his pants. That's how he attracts women. I interviewed Donald on Friday during my television show and I'll tell you this. I won't tell you what I found but I reached into his pocket, took out his wallet to count the money it.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> How much does he carry?
<Unidentified Male> <Negative> I'm not going to tell you that. You have to tune in for the show. It's a little easier [Inaudible]. It's like if I tell you it, it'll ruin it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] did a great job but I did no talking.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> But that's the way it is. That's been the best way to do an interview with him, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But Donald Trump is an exciting man. More importantly, not only is he a multimillionaire, possibly now a billionaire again, Right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're doing well. Thanks for the [Inaudible].
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Yeah and he's [Inaudible] again.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> The casinos have been...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Fantastic.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> The casinos have been doing real well but, more importantly, he went through his whole sexual history and it's quite impressive.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, you know what, I was just reading the tabloid this weekend.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> And one tabloid said that Donald did it again. He dumped one woman for another woman on the slopes of Aspen or something.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> [Inaudible] at Aspen, I got to go there with you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not again.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> [Inaudible] if I were single, would you take me to Aspen [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You'd take Aspen apart.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I really would. This would be a wild [Inaudible] because Donald asked me during the commercial in a TV show, I don't think he mind me saying this, he says to me "If you don't get along with anyone [Inaudible]."
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You're not even his wife.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I said "I'm really faithful to my wife." And he goes "Really? Really?" What's that all about?"
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I can say to Howard's wife, that's true. I mean he did say that to him, it was great, "I am faithful" and he said "But what about the temptation?" I go "That's pretty rough because an ugly guy like me would have all these women coming on to me, it's very tempting."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There are two Howard Sterns. There's this one [Inaudible]. That was the wilder one that I saw on Friday and this man was wilder. So, that's the real Howard Stern.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So, I'm talking to Donald and I said to him "I can't believe that people actually go to Aspen to ski because they don't. They just go up there to have sex, right?"
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's a lot of things going on in Aspen. There's no question about it.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Did you dump one girl and take another girl [Inaudible]?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible]. Which one of the tabloids is this?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I think Donald's back with Marla Maples.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> That's what I heard. I heard you picked her up at the airport the other day.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I get along. I mean, she's a friend of mine and we get along well. I get along well with a lot of people.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> So, you're not back with Marla?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want to get along well with a lot of people.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> People [Inaudible] Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like a lot of people.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> The reason with Marla is she really has to please you because you have the upper hand. Because of her relationship with you, she has now gotten a Broadway show. You have done well [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I have no doubt. She has done a great job. She's at the Will Rogers Follies. She's done a great job. She is, as they would say, a star, [Inaudible] a star and everybody else I meet is a star. Everybody becomes a star. Ivana [Inaudible] I had to keep working. No, but Ivana became a star and of course now she goes around blabbing about Donald to everybody.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> All the time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And she's not supposed. She got 25 million dollars to keep her stupid trap shut and to keep her mouth shut.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I don't think you can get that money back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. Well, I'd say we're in court. I mean, it's unfortunate because I paid 25 million dollars and the one thing that she couldn't do is write books, do commercials. I mean she gets on a commercial and she says the best revenge is great colored hair, the best revenge. It's great.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What kind of revenge? You gave her 25 million dollars.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> 25 million bucks and she's looking for revenge.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But, look, you fell out of love, you were a couple of years since you married you fell out of love. She started dating. You tried to keep the marriage together. True?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would like to have Ivana not write any more books about me. I would like to have Ivana not do any commercials, not do an interview on Barbara Walters where the first question is "What was he really like?"
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Well, if she slowed down and hasn't she slowed down...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't think she badmouths me but 25 million bucks, at 25 million you're not supposed to badmouth people.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah but how come... Remember you guys used to go on Oprah like it wasn't too long ago when you were married, you'd go on Oprah, right? And then Oprah would like... Even though you weren't in love with Ivana anymore, you would always say "Hey, I love Ivana. I'm a family guy" and you'd even say she did a lot for the Trump Organization, she helped you all the way but I'm just like [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, no, I love Ivana. She's the mother of my children.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah but you don't need her to help you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, help I don't need.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I think there are a few other interior decorators around.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There are a few other people around I could use. They're very talented, perhaps more talented.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Now that I'm Donald's friend, I need to say, Donald, I hope you don't mind, I'm writing a book about you [Inaudible] I don't mind. Everyone else... [Inaudible] a prenuptial agreement, to be honest with you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Everyone else is "Let's not do it, Howard."
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, right. So, in other words, let's say you start dating, right? You are married but you're one of the wealthiest men in the world and let's face it, you're young, you're an attractive man like you even told me one of your old rich friends, they can't get dates but you can.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're having a hard time. I have all the wealthy guys that are friends of mine, they cannot get dates.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I guess Robin would with you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Plenty of money. By the way, Robin, do you want to go out with one of them? Robin, go ahead.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> No, thank you. That's all right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Really? So, you're saying I have guys, 500 million, a billion dollars and they call up and they say "I want to meet a certain girl." [Inaudible] like you. One guy likes black women, Robin, I have to tell you. He loves black women. So, really?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So, you're saying that there are rich guys out there who can't get girls.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I'm saying there are rich guys that can meet girls and not get out with them a second time.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right, they can't [Inaudible]...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Money is not the predominant fact. Unless the woman is a bad woman [Inaudible] rip somebody off and that way you have to figure that out somehow but a lot of money is not the predominant factor.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So, you're saying a lot of women do go for you for the money but at the same point they stay with you because you're delivering something special.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I do think that money makes it easier, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> When you get them in the sack, they're satisfied. That's the difference.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I couldn't care less.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> What [Inaudible] your germ phobia at that point?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Germ phobia is a problem. Germ phobia is a problem. You should be very selective. You have a real problem.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Seriously, when you put the dangers out there [Inaudible].
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I know, I know.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But when have...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> [Inaudible] or whatever.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Dating is like being in Vietnam. Dating is like being in Vietnam. It's the equivalent of a soldier going over to Vietnam. It's like war out there.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You have mines all over the place.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, if you're young and a [Inaudible] and if you have any guilt about not having gone to Vietnam, we have our own Vietnam. It's the dating [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So, when you go out there, as beautiful as these women are, you're saying "Wait a second, I know these girls are beautiful. They're [Inaudible] with lots of guys" and you start French kissing them and stuff and you go "Wait a second, I could be exchanging bodily fluids here with AIDS."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I saw a report the other day you may get AIDS by kissing, okay? You may get aids by kissing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And isn't it true that the reason that you stay with Marla because you know she is AIDS free even though you would like to take lot of other girls.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> [Inaudible] with Marla.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Here's the problem. Well, I will say this. It's a lot better nowadays to have somebody who's a fabulous woman that you like and that likes you and do the single thing because this is pretty rough stuff out there. There was a report the other day, [Inaudible] major report that you get AIDS from kissing. Now, never mind that, you can get AIDS from sitting this close to the band. Look at these guys.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Oh my goodness! [Inaudible]. So, if someone comes up to you or you date a woman and stuff and after you've made love [Inaudible] maybe you go to the bathroom, wash your hands and stuff, right? And like try to [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I'm very careful in terms of like just general stuff as I think everyone else is.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> But you're not sleeping with everyone [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I did, I wouldn't be here right now. If I did, I'd be in serious trouble.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He gets an AIDS test for all the girls though. I know that.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Is that right?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yeah, he gets them [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's not a question of the test. The test is good in terms of protecting other people. It's not going to help you too much, okay? Once they come up, I mean, so now you can help some other people. The problem is people that get the test that test positive, they go out on a rampage on purpose. There's anger. There's hate.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You're sounding very much like him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, what's happening is there's anger, there's hatred.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> And [Inaudible] go and sleep with everyone.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it's really dangerous.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Don't you agree that men and women who have AIDS, just have like... I'm not saying a major tattoo, a tattoo on the genitals so that you would be able to identify people with AIDS you're about to sleep with.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What about a woman? Where are you going to put the tattoo?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right above the pubic bone. Seriously.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There was a time early on when AIDS could have been stopped. Now, it's so out of control. It's tremendously out of control. It's the plague of the century.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> How would you've stopped it then?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Earlier on when you had a small number of people, you could have done something to stop AIDS. Today it's out of control.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So, how can we stop it? If tattoo the general region of every age person, then at least you would know that no one could trick you into sleeping with them, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I argued to make a proposal for the forehead.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I argued for the forehead the first time.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> [Inaudible] somebody told me, if I was single, I would go for the forehead but it's up to each individual person.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a rough situation. The cure is maybe never going to be. It's a viral disease and maybe they're not going to have a cure for years and years and years.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> [Inaudible] I like to live with hope.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No but common cold is a viral problem. They don't have a cure for that.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I think you have this whole dating thing. Another guy who can commiserate with you guys is on the phone right now. Jerry Seinfeld.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Oh, hey, Jerry Seinfeld. Donald, you know Jerry, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hello, Jerry.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> Hello! Hello!
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Sitting here with Donald Trump and Jerry Seinfeld.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Talking about the dating game.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> Oh yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Now that Trump [Inaudible] everyone [Inaudible] AIDS [Inaudible], Jerry, how are you avoiding it? Because Jerry thinks you're like this and Jerry is a lot like you in the sense that he is single.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Congratulations.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He is dating and he gets great girls too. He had [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ah, very good, Jerry.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Nice job, Jerry. How was she, Jerry?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Neutral> I think she is pregnant now.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah and that was your baby.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, with Donald's baby. I bet when a woman gets pregnant with Jerry's baby or Donald's baby, I would believe that they would have the baby even if they didn't want it.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Oh absolutely. You don't think a woman would abort your baby.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have not heard of any cases where I've had the problem. I don't know, we're all very careful.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Donald wears a rubber. Jerry, what are you wearing? You're wearing probably nine rubbers?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> Very careful.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're careful. [Inaudible] aren't you nervous about that?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> Am I nervous about it?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yeah, you'd lose your fortune. Jerry's worth like... Did you see his house on the Barbara Walter's [Inaudible]. I mean, it's not Mar-A-Lago but...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what, he won't lose his fortune. It will dissipate quickly. That's all. It just will dissipate quickly. Actually, you might make more money. You might die wealthier but I don't know.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But Jerry, have you named your home like Donald actually named his house Mar-A-Lago.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> Oh really?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's the name [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In all fairness, it was named before.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I got to get a house with a name on it.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That's when you know you've made it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Jerry is a single guy. He built himself a mansion with three refrigerators in the kitchen. This is a one guy living in a house.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Wow!
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You know what that is. He can bring girls into the kitchen and they see three refrigerators and go "Oh my god!"
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, he's wild.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It's all wild. Jerry, tell Donald what you did. You built a house to get more women, right?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Neutral> That's right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> An impression.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> There's actually no bathrooms or bedrooms in the house. It's just to get women.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But Donald, do you... Jerry's is very... he's embarrassed to say it but I don't think you would be. When you'd date a woman, if you pick her up in your limousine, if you take her to an expensive home for a date and she sees this outrageous palace, isn't it that much easier [Inaudible]?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, let's say that if you bring a woman to Mar-A-Lago and you can't do well, you have some serious problem.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. And Jerry has built his own little Mar-A-Lago. Now, Jerry won't name is Mar-A-Lago.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Right. He's trying to be a little [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I mean, Jerry named his house [Inaudible]. It's happening. Jerry, do you want to wish me a happy birthday?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> Happy birthday, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know want an honor it is to have you with us?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Neutral> We're of the same age.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you 39?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> I'm 38. I'll be 39 this year too.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, let me say what an honor it is to have a big star like Jerry Seinfeld with Donald Trump here on the show.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Neutral> You really made it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> This really proves that I am someone in show business.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Neutral> You've really done.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I have really arrived. I have arrived. I'm the king of all media. There is no greater performer than me. I don't care what [Inaudible] says.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How does it feel like?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I feel like I'm on top.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Did you know when this would happen to you, Jerry?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Jerry, when did you feel like you became a star, that Trump is [Inaudible].
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> Well, I guess that third refrigerator.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Earlier, I spoke with Clinton. I don't know if you guys are aware of this. I spoke with Clinton.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Bill?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, no, no Roger.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Nobody else was going to do it for you.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Thank you, Robin. Donald [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Big deal.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Well, I [Inaudible] him every day.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I go to bed with models every night. Do think I care for who you talk to?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Jerry, how many models have you had this week? Let's compare. I wonder who you get in bed this week.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Wait a minute, I've got to ask Jerry a question because I also read the tabloids. They say that Jerry is now dating the girlfriend of that guy who plays the producer on the Murphy Brown like he stole this guy's girlfriend away from him.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Nice move. [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Congratulations, Jerry. I hope it's true. Is it true?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> No, it's not true.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You're not dating that girl?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> No.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> They have picture of you holding her hand.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Neutral> That's not her.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You are dating the girl, aren't you?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You are dating the girl, aren't you?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> That's not nice.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's not nice. Jerry, is it true that we had to interrupt your yoga lesson to take this phone call?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> Yes, it's true.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You're into Yoga?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> Yes [Inaudible] a big guy.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Where are you now? The big expensive mansion?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> No, I'm not living there yet. I'm still in my little apartment.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And you have a female yoga instructor?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> Yes, I do.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Is she nice?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> Very nice.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And you have sex with her?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> No, I don't.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Donald wants your number. He's into some Yoga too. How do you guys... What's the best way to get a girl in bed quickly? Is it to impress her with your apartment, Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, in many cases you don't want to get a girl in bed quickly. I mean, nowadays and perhaps in the past but I'm very particular in so many ways. I really want to live...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> So, how many days before?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to live. I want to have a nice life. I want to remarry. I want to have...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Remarry.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to have a lot of children. No, I do. Jerry wants to remarry.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Because you don't have to keep the girls [Inaudible]. Jerry, do you want to remarry?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, sure, he wants to get married.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Jerry, do you want to get married?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> Yes. I don't know. I don't make decisions like that [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That female...
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> I've never seen that girl.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, yeah, right.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> It's possible though, yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> How many dates does Donald have with a person before he decides to make that fatal step?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, it can be a fatal step. You wake up two weeks later and say "Here's the big day. Are we going to make it?" No. It's really the two weeks after that you have to worry about. It depends rather. I mean, sometimes things go quickly and sometimes things don't work out so well.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Is Marla Maples the best you ever had, Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she's a very good woman.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Jerry, what about you? [Inaudible].
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> Marla Maples is the best I've ever had.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Marla Maples is the best you had?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> [Inaudible] lots of fighting words. Donald, you don't get jealous of these women because even if they go with another guy, "Hey, that's it. Fine." Do you go to another woman?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I tend to get a little bit jealous, actually. I mean, I have to be honest. Jerry, does that. We all do but...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You'd be like your woman is like [Inaudible] when you have them, they're yours.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How do you know that he gets...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've heard.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Jerry, Carol Leiper gave you a 4 on a 1 to 10 scale. I'd be a little embarrassed by that. Donald, don't you get nervous that the women are going to evaluate in bed like [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When Marla came out with a statement that I was the best she ever had...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Was that a massive like...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you what, I felt pretty good. In fact, I had lawyers just come into my office. They were re going to stop that headline because we knew the headline was running the next day in the New York Post and I said "What are you [Inaudible]?" They were going for a restraining order. I said "You have to be kidding. Are you crazy?"
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's an advertisement.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm going to spend legal fees for this? So, anyway, it was a great honor.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Are you really good in bed, seriously?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hope so.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You think you can hold out a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a good reputation to have even if it's [Inaudible].
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You don't hear a lot of women complaining about you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you what, even if it's not true, it's a great reputation. I think I'd rather have the reputation than the fact.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> Jerry, when you're with a beautiful model, and I asked Donald the same question, when you're with a beautiful model, is it hard to hold out in bed? Be honest. Isn't it like "Oh my god" because guys, basically, I mean you've got to feel very fortunate?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> I feel very fortunate. That's [Inaudible].
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> And so you know "I never thought this would happened to me."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you could also say there's more pressure on you than there is no other people.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I can't figure you out, Donald. You grew up pretty wealthy. I mean, your father made a considerable fortune. Why did you wish to marry Ivana? Why didn't you just play the field? How did you get caught up in that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I just decided to get married but I didn't rush. I was 30 when I got married.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did it make sense? You were having the time of your life.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was and that was a little bit safer world.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> How old were you when you lost your virginity?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> About 14.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You had to be. I mean, [Inaudible] girls want to F you the whole... Jerry is another story because Jerry grew up a regular guy and then all of a sudden became famous and he was smart enough to stay single. You on the other hand were born a wealthy man, you became a lot wealthier but you got married.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I married after a number of years. You do get tired of the same...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, he was 30. He wasn't 21.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, Jerry, would you tell this married guy that you do get tired of the scene after a while.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Jerry, when you are in bed, do you hold out a long time? Are you able to?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Neutral> Me?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> [Inaudible], Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Oh, so in other words, do you think about... I think about garbage when I'm in bed so that I can hold out. Do you think about the three refrigerators in your kitchen?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> Right, the three refrigerators.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But, Donald, you're saying that when you lost your virginity at 14, was it because...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Who was it too?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Who was it too? Was it like a maid or something?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it was a young woman who was really beautiful. She was the hot little girl in high school or grad school or whatever. She was hot.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Was it best [Inaudible]?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I haven't seen her. I haven't seen...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Was it the best...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, I never understood the best [Inaudible]. Never understood that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Now, Jerry, I bet you didn't lose your virginity that age 14, did you?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> I think I was probably 19 or 20.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> 19 or 20 because you got to admit probably, Donald, you were able to get these incredible women at 14.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was looking at 13 or 12. So, it took me two years after I started looking. I don't know what happened.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But at 14 you were able to get a woman because you were a wealthy guy?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> And there wasn't any low period. Once you started...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was a rampage.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It was a rampage.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's been a rampage ever since.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And then when you got married, you must have gone temporarily insane and said "I want to give all this up."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, I was...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No, he probably wanted to see what it was like to be with one person.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was actually faithful to my wife for many years until I realized the marriage wasn't going to work.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yeah but tell the truth, when you first met Ivana, that accent was really cute, it was sort of different, it was sort of exotic and then about a year or two into the marriage, you start going "Oh, this is... I wish [Inaudible] speak English."
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How did you know me so well?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I'm telling you because I'll tell you what, all of a sudden you went up and you said "Boy, what an [Inaudible]. Come on." It's like "She's been in this country. I've got a lot of money. Can't she go to [Inaudible] and learn how to speak right?"
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the funny thing about Ivana is the accent got worse as she grew [Inaudible] and some people say she wanted it to happen that way. Right, the accent actually became more pronounced as years went by.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And it begins... The very thing that you were attracted to begins to annoy and grate on you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The word is 'grate'. It did grate on me after a while, I'd say that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It did. And we don't mean GREAT. It was like a Chinese torture, water drops on the head and everyone "Oh, the Donald, the Donald." I said "Hey, my name's Donald. It's not [Inaudible]."
<Howard Stern> <Negative> [Inaudible]. "I'm living in a house with you. Just get it straight with this Donald. It's embarrassing."
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Jerry...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> That was so pronounced.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> Great. Everybody, it's a great interview, by the way.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, you like it?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I love it how Jerry's always evaluating.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Jerry can't see that Donald...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> He just can't be here [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Negative> This is called paneling. This is what you did in the Merv Griffin Show.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Merv? Did I hear Merv?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What a great life Donald has that he gets to call his ex-wife Chinese water torture.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Jerry, will you ever get married knowing what Donald just revealed?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> Not to his ex-wife.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, you will not marry a woman with a foreign accent? Donald, would you recommend that people do not marry people with foreign accept.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Probably. It's great for the first year but after that it could be embarrassing.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And it's embarrassing when you go to social occasions and functions because it's enough already, right? Jerry, have you ever dated a woman with a foreign accent.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> Oh yes.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> In fact, that's probably part of the Seinfeld show next week.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, it's another episode.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> I used that thing you said. You called me on a horse face on the show a couple of weeks ago.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, I didn't.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> Yeah, you did.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, I didn't.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> And when I used it on the show and [Inaudible] heard it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Really?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> I thought it was funny.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Jerry is a guy like a lot of guys like me. I mean, he's not a great looking guy but he's getting great looking models and it's because...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And he only dates model.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Only dates models. Is that true?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Jerry, let's get together. Jerry, when you're in New York, call me.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> [Inaudible] models with you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Let me say something. This is an observation. Every woman I meet really likes Jerry Seinfeld. They think he's a great guy. He is just as much a womanizer.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> A quote about Jerry in the tabloid was he's the kind of guy any woman would want to marry.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Wow!
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Jerry is busy doing the same exact thing that Donald is doing and yet most women resent Donald. I have spoken with them and they all go "Oh, we hate Donald Trump. He abuses. He's a womanizer."
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Womanizer.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Isn't that true? Do you find that?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> He's got no refrigerator.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I find it's a love hate, it's a love hate thing. I really do. I mean, I think I have a great relationship with women.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, the women you're with.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the women I'm with I have a great relationship.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But general public does not... The women in the general public...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> But believe me...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think inwardly they respect it and I think inwardly the men love it.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I'll tell you about those women. All those women who "Ah, Donald Trump," if he said hello to them, they'd be right there, they'd date him.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I would wonder, in this room... I'm going to ask my sister. My sister... [Inaudible]. Hey, get the microphone by [Inaudible]. I'm curious. If you had your choice, [Inaudible], you could date Jerry Seinfeld, you know who Jerry is.
<Unidentified Female> <Positive> Right there.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And Donald Trump, is that someone my sister's getting hot for Donald Trump?
<Unidentified Female> <Negative> [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who would you sleep with?
<Unidentified Female> <Negative> The Donald.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> The Donald.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> See, I [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You worried, huh?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Howard. It's where the money is.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I'm going to let the other... Now, I could almost guess basically, I would guess that Jackie's wife... Can you put the mike on Jackie's wife?... would sleep with Jerry, I know that.
<Unidentified Female> <Positive> Yeah, that's true.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You would, right?
<Unidentified Female> <Negative> [Inaudible] take the comedian.
<Unidentified Female> <Positive> I like a guy with a sense of humor.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. Well, Donald's pretty funny with [Inaudible] those money. And I know [Inaudible] would take both, right?
<Unidentified Female> <Negative> Why not?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. You'd take both.
<Unidentified Female> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Hey, Donald, that's [Inaudible]. She slept with John Lennon.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh really?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> [Inaudible] about the whole thing. Don't sleep with her. She'll write a couple of books on you.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You've met your [Inaudible] right away.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're right, it'd be unbelievable. Jerry, have you ever slept with a woman who then threatened to go to the Enquirer and squeal on you?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> No, I have not, Howard, but this is an excellent question.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thank you. Donald and you would get that all the time, right? When you date, you make them sign a pre-date agreement?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd like to. I think it's a great idea. I mean, I have the same problem as a lot of folks but I get more nonsense written about me and the dating and the women that I never even saw before who I'm going to marry. And it's a really... it's a problem.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> [Inaudible] a lot of folks. Is that what I just heard Donald Trump say?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What did you say?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> I have the same problem as a lot of folks.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> He only has the same problem as you, Jerry.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> But you have to have instances where women wind up on the Geraldo Show with their stories overnight of fucking with Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You had a four-minute conversation with the party at a cocktail party the night before.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> All right, let me ask one last serious question. Jerry, let me you one last serious question. [Inaudible] we'll change the topic a little bit here, okay? Your mom has a question. Who would you rather sleep with?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Your mother wants to give her preference.
<Unidentified Female> <Positive> Jerry's tired of Wilma. I don't know if this is true.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> This is my mother.
<Unidentified Female> <Positive> Princess Di is looking for an apartment at Trump Tower.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Is that right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> True.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It is true. That means she contacted you?
<Unidentified Female> <Neutral> Is there any romance?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] wild in here. She's is [Inaudible] 20-25 pounds. She looks great.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What is the question, mom, for us?
<Unidentified Female> <Positive> I wanted to know if that is true that she wants an apartment and is there any love interest there between Donald and Princess.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There could be a love interest. I'd become king of England.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> King of England.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> King of England [Inaudible] I have to lose the New York accent [Inaudible]. See, they would like my accent.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You will date her just to say [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In 10 seconds.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> In 10 seconds you will date her.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I might write a book about her.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But admit it the women that you date generally are better looking than her. It's just that she's the queen and...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The women are better looking but there's something about Lady Di. She's hot.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, you agree?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Even Robin agrees.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Jerry, are you dating Lady Di? Are you dating any royalty?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> Is this a serious question?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You said you had a serious question for Jerry?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, I got blown away by the Lady Di stuff. You said she gained 20 pounds?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know, she gained about 20-25 pounds, she looks great. I saw a picture of her yesterday in the paper but she's looking great.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She is a bizzaro nut. You know that. She's a nut.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You've got problems with her.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There are two theories. One, she is really the nicest, most beautiful. The other is she's a killer.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> She is an absolutely insane person. Here she became the queen, she married King Charles or whatever name he got, Prince Charles. She is going to be the queen. There's a certain setup when you go into something that. Loyalty is raised in a certain way.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> They know how you play the game. You can have a lover on the side, you keep quiet but two weeks into this marriage, she's thrown herself down the stash, she's sticking her finger down the throat and vomiting. What did she expect? What did she want? Romance from this guy? There's no romance involved. It's a marriage of state. The other thing is she [Inaudible] thrown herself down the steps...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, how do you think Albert's doing with Claudia Schiffer?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> The only person who will know that is Jerry Seinfeld. He used to date Claudia Schiffer. Jerry, did you date... Here's the serious question, Jerry.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Jerry, are you still there?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> Yeah, still here but I'm going.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> How many times this week have you had [Inaudible]?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Neutral> This week.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> This is just Monday.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Neutral> When doest the week start? Sunday or Monday?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Seriously, be honest.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> This is Monday. What part of the week are you talking about?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Come on, be open. You were open about this.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> I work on the weekends and I don't really keep track of when the week...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> This week how many times [Inaudible]?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> Maybe once, twice, something like that.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> With a model, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> This was a regular girl?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What does she do for a living?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> She has sex with me.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, come one, what does she do? Is she an actress?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> I don't think so. I haven't seen her in any [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It's an actress. Is it an actress?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> No, I haven't really dated any actress.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What occupation does she have?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> Excuse me?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What occupation does she have?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Neutral> That's not of your business.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Come on.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Neutral> You come on.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Hey, hey... All right. Well, they haven't gotten into that yet. Donald, what about you? How many times this week did you have sex?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Jerry beats me. He does. I didn't have sex at all this week. Not at all. Jerry beats me.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, it's certainly been an interesting morning.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was going to give you a fictitious number but I don't want to lie. Jerry did beat me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Jerry's show is moving to a new timeslot.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes, it is.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> That's right, yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What time you're going to be on?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> Thursday at 9:30 [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Negative> [Inaudible] you're guaranteed a winner. [Inaudible] is a very popular show.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I think this is an idea for NBC to move the show.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I think it's a real good idea. Now, who do you predict, Jerry, will be on late night television this week? Will it be David Letterman or Jay Leno in the 11"30 timeslot.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> I think it'll probably be Jay.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You do believe it will be Jay.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You're going with Jay.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're going with Jay.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> I expect to move... upset the whole applecart at this stage of the game. [Inaudible] kind of corporate thing that they would do. I really have no idea of what they're going to do.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I see. And will Trump ever be on your show, Donald Trump?
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Neutral> Donald Trump will never be on the show.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Really?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why is that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because he's [Inaudible].
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> Well, we don't need [Inaudible] people.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, you don't need [Inaudible] people. All right. Well, there you go. Jerry Seinfeld. I also want to thank Donald Trump for stopping by and sharing all of his sexual experiences with me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Happy birthday.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I found myself living through you, your wild escapades.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Living vicariously.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Why don't you the story about the great party you throw?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's going to be great party.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> January 30 at Mar-a-Lago there's going to be a great party.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Isn't that bachelor's party [Inaudible]?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's the thing, having to do with a lot of things.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Is Jerry going to be [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Jerry's invited. By the way, Jerry, the most beautiful women in the world are going to be at this party. Some people say "Isn't it horrible he likes beautiful women?" I can't help it, as we discussed the other day.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, you can't.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're fired, Jerry. Howard, you're invited and Robin, you're invited but we're going to have a great party. And your sister is invited and [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And what's happening in that party? The girls are pretty open to the idea of having...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's not a question of open. They're going to be beautiful, world class, throughout the world, the most beautiful women. We're going to try and get Lady Di. We're trying to get Lady Di actually to come to the party. It's a part of the deal for buying the apartment at Trump Tower. She can have an apartment at Trump Tower if she comes in.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And the girls stay over your place at Mar-A-Lago.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know if they're going to stay. Depends on what will happen but it's going to be a wild night. January 30th, Saturday night.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All supermodels.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's all supermodels, super everything, super people, super people and supermodels. Incredible. I'm serious, you might want to attend...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Let me tell you something. Jerry Seinfeld is sitting here laughing at this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, he wants you to go. You got to go, Jerry. Saturday night, January 30th. Jerry, the most beautiful women in the world are going to be there.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Positive> I will see you there.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Will Ted Kennedy be there?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Ted Kennedy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't believe so.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, you do not believe. Do you party with him at all?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know him a little bit. I don't really know him very well. Well, [Inaudible] like a nice guy to me.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Jerry, thank you for calling in.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll see you, Jerry, [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Jerry, we'll see you on January 30 at the big party.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Neutral> I'll see you there.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> My wife gave me the okay. All right, good bye, Jerry.
<Jerry Seinfeld> <Negative> Bye, bye.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Donald Trump, I want to thank you for stopping by.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I loved it. I got to name my house [Inaudible], I've decided.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh, okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's why there's no supermodel's.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> [Inaudible] bit party.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You just should know that all the interns or I should say the female interns have been fighting to see who is going to escort Mr. Trump out. Well, let Trump pick them. Step forward. And they're going to introduce themselves. Why don't you put the microphone on the girls? They can introduce themselves and Mr. Trump can pick his escort.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What is your name? This is Tara.
<Tara> <Positive> Hi.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Tara used to be... Give your credentials. Tell him what you used to...
<Tara> <Neutral> Tara is a model.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible]. Tara, you used to be in a New Jersey Nets cheerleader, right?
<Tara> <Positive> Correct.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And what else about that credentials?
<Tara> <Negative> Model. I worked at PBS for an internship.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, she's my intern but of course you want to escort Mr. Trump to the door?
<Tara> <Positive> Sure.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You are interested in him?
<Tara> <Negative> There's somebody else here.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who else? What is your name.
<Julianne> <Positive> Julianne, you like Mr. Trump as well.
<Julianne> <Positive> Yeah, I thought to escort him in.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You're good.
<Julianne> <Negative> And you [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, then, do you want to take him out as well?
<Julianne> <Positive> I would love to.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Have you ever slept with Mr. Trump?
<Julianne> <Negative> No, I haven't.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Now, here's the most interesting thing about this contest as to who will escort Mr. Trump out the door. Frank Flores, our sales manager, is lining up. He wants to escort.
<Julianne> <Neutral> He's offering too?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Frank, you're interested in escorting Mr. Trump?
<Frank> <Positive> Yes, yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What is your measurement?
<Frank> <Neutral> I'll escort him any time.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Donald, do you like Spanish guys?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've never until this moment [Inaudible]. I have to start thinking about that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donald, you have never had a homosexual experience, my friend?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I have not.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You've never been approached?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not my thing. I'm approached but it's not my thing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Have men approached you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, a lot of times. It's just not my thing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did my father approach you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes he did, this morning.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right, there's one more woman who would like to escort Mr. Trump.
<Leslie> <Positive> Hi, Mr. Trump.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. And, Leslie, you feel like you could be the next Leslie Trump? Is that what you're after?
<Leslie> <Positive> Maybe someday. All right. Well, Donald I'll let you decide. Or Big Joe, you would like to also.
<Joe> <Negative> Don, I'll take you anywhere you want to go.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There you go.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I think he's after your money though.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] we don't have to worry about it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> There's one more.
<Sandy> <Neutral> Sandy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi, Sandy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Hi, Sandy. Your measurements please for Mr. Trump? Measurements.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Come on, Sandy. Come on, Sandy.
<Sandy> <Negative> I don't know them off hand.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You don't know them off hand. You are in love with Mr. Trump?
<Sandy> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, you are.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You're already in love with him.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're already in love. You've already fallen in love with him
<Sandy> <Positive> Oh, yes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, you are in love. So, that love part is over with.
<Sandy> <Negative> Yeah, you've got that [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Positive> How does it feel when the woman is already in love with you? That's easy. You walked into a class where the women are already in love with you, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I perhaps. I don't know. I mean, in some crazy way perhaps.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It is not difficult to close the deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Makes it a lot easier.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, there it is. Ah, there's another woman who would like to escort you. It's my lovely wife. That's my wife.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I was [Inaudible] you. That's a little rumor going. Let's make the tabloids together. Wow!
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'll tell you one thing. You can't get her pregnant. That's for sure.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> She's safe.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She's safe.
<Unidentified Female> <Neutral> In two weeks.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> In two weeks you'll be looking for a date. Sweetheart, you're going to be laid out on bed in two weeks. I don't... maybe you can mention the date. I want to thank Donald Trump for stopping by for the birthday show. You've made it a real [Inaudible]. Thank you, Donald. Thanks a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm sorry I'm shaking hands.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> And I do like you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, now you like me. And I like you. I have no germs. You do a great job.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right. Thanks, Donald. Donald Trump, everybody. Go to the Trump Casinos. Girls, you can...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> They're all going to escort him out.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Attack Mr. Trump. Feel free. Feel free. Feel free. Attack Mr. Trump.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, Robin, that was exciting on the birthday. So, Donald Trump stopping by, visiting with various people. G. E. Smith giving the [Inaudible] to Donald Trump, of course. T. Bone, you scared him out of here with that hat. What are we going to do? We're going to do a song now?
