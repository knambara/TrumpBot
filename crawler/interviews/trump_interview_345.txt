<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> On the line.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Speaking of, on the line on our phone, is Donald Trump. Thank God, because he heard me the other day say, "Hey
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, we have been dumped
<Howard Stern> <Positive> They thought we got dumped by you. I would never dump you. I'm too smart to dump you. I would never do that. I listen all the time. I love you guys. I'm a top five in Howard Stern history.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You are.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, our live segment, we have a top five. And you rebroadcast it many times. I get calls from people. Did you hear that? That's the top five. I think, is it still is top five, Howard?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. Oh, please. It was ridiculous.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's a great honor for me. Believe me, you know Arnold Schwarzenegger, right? I do, very well.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Would you describe his behavior? I mean, listen, the men and women for years have always cheated. We always act like you know like people ask me about Dan Marino. I mean, listen this goes on. You know that? But it's, it's an unbelievable story, because I don't think people are willing to admit it. But they can't believe, that woman was so. You know, that let's say manly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is hard to believe.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It was.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When I heard the maid, I forget this gorgeous maid with a little black dress.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What? With a French outfit?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, like a French. Looking at her with that little white apron and that is gorgeously beautiful. And I said, "Well
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Were you, when a guy, when you know a guy, and he turns you down on something in some way, you say, "Hey
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Well, this is a positive thing. I was asking for him, and it was very open, and very positive. And I was asking for something, that's actually attached to that. That's so ridiculous, it's driving people out. So I really called and complained about it, and they should have done something about it. And they didn't. And I usually write those people off my list, you know usually when somebody. When you're friendly with somebody, and you help somebody, I've always helped them, and you help somebody. And then you know, they're not there for you when you need.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But if he's the governor?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It has nothing to do with it. No it's got to be the right thing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, I don't, I don't want to do the wrong thing. I don't ask for the wrong thing. When you ask for something, that's good for the state, and they should do it. And he doesn't do it. I don't know, if he didn't try or he couldn't you know it could be that he couldn't.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did he at least take your phone call, and hear you out?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he took my call and he knew exactly what I was talking about.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was a bad thing for the state. And you know, it should have been done. So that's not like you know, if I ask was something wrong, that was bad he did I understand that too.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Have you seen him though, since the scandal?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I just once briefly.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you say to a guy?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He is different guy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He is?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a big blow. I thought his book was ridiculous, you know?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why was it ridiculous?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because I don't think you're right about this scandal, you go on.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think he, the only thing I saw that was more ridiculous, was Lance Armstrong's deal, where he went out, and just committed to financial suicide. He's going to end up with nothing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He should have just gone away, and relaxed.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And let everybody say, whatever they wanted to say. He didn't even have to comment anymore.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Looks like, he might even go to jail.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh we could. Oh he's just a dead man.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> When I heard, he did that interview, I said, "That's financial"". I said
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well, you know, do you ever say to yourself? Who you know who are these people? You know, he's just a dumb bicycle rider. When you think about it, when you know, when you really analyze it .
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> It turns out, he was a dummy, or there was something wrong with him. I mean, it's it's a form of suicide, that when he did that, he could have left. I saw it happening in about a year ago, when he said that he's no longer going to fight.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Remember that right was a year ago. All right, well that was bad. But you know, you could say, "Hey
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he did this thing with Oprah, which was great for Oprah.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Brilliant for Oprah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was wonderful for Oprah. But I mean, I watched that, and I just, I just couldn't believe it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But let me tell you something.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Howard, everybody that he sued wrongfully.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Even the ones, that didn't really do the money, think they're all suing for their legal fees back. He's going to end up, owing hundreds of millions of dollars. The government is going to get their money back, because of the postals. Can you imagine the Postal Service sponsoring a bike deal? [Commercial Break]
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah. Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean to start off with, how we think? and how how did that happen to watch that.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Right. How the hell, does that happen?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I used to watch that, and I'd say "That's interesting"". But he won. So what the hell
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they can't make a profit.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Let me ask you about that. I haven't talked to you in so long, I've got a million questions.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know. And we do have that great relationship. I did go to that wedding. And I have to say it's one of the few weddings that I held, on to many weddings. 90% percent of them is [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. How's your marriage?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My marriage is doing great.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It's unbelievable that your marriage is doing great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she's doing great. She's great. She understands me.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Is she a good girl? I mean, is she doing what's right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's good. She's beautiful, like yours.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She does her whole mother thing, or she likes?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She loves being a mother. And above all else, she loves being a mother. I mean she's a great mother.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Does she allow any maids in the house around you? No?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they're not they're, not tennis I can tell you that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So look at you, all domesticated.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've been, very, very domesticated. I don't know, it's a sad event.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What did you do? Do you? Are you upset, about Beyonce 'lip-synching' thing?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, not at all.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm am.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am not upset about that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I'm upset.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, you know there's a whole fake thing. I'm not. No although, I will say this, 'When other people have lip sync in the past, and you can name three or four? Their careers were over.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Including, you know the guys, really, really.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Milli, Milli Vanilli.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right. But also, if you remember, Jessica Simpson's sister, lip sync Saturday Night Live.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hashtag.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And that was a disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I clearly remember that. And it wasn't that big a deal, as she was destroyed. Her career was destroyed.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's right. And I, I know the reason. I just can't believe, that everyone goes out there, and pretends, and dares to sing, sing a song .
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, at the Super Bowl, and I like Jay-Z a lot. I really think, he's a good guy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I am too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I will tell you this, at the Super Bowl, when her fiance was thrusting her hips forward, at a very, very suggestive manner. If somebody else would have done that, it would have been a national scandal.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Was it too sexual?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought, I thought it was ridiculous.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I spoke to a friend of mine, whose daughters around, five or six years old, and they turned the TV off. Because they felt it was too suggestive, but doesn't remind you the old days the Ed Sullivan Show, Shirley MacLaine, used to come on in a skimpy outfit, and dance around. I mean.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It isn't that something that was a different form of dancing. And I just, I just thought, it was not appropriate. And this is me. Can you believe me me saying?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah. I can't believe it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know, but I've seen things for far less. I make a big deal out of it nobody's. I've never even heard anybody mention it. I mean, I think I'm mentioning it now, maybe to you for the first time.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It hasn't, I mean, since Michael Jackson, hasn't everybody started falling and, and grabbing thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not saying you know you're moving hips. I'm saying the way the so-and-so was thrust forward, as I said give me a break, you know. So, they don't let me know what. There was no there was no mention of it, so obviously it couldn't have been so bad.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. I don't know. Maybe she just gets a pass, or something.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes she does.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You know, I was going to ask you you know, with all this politics and stuff now you're sort of political?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I mean, years ago you weren't that political. I mean, you had your opinions but I've always been political. But I've gotten seriously.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now you're a powerbroker. People have to come meet you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. They do come to make money, that's you must, you must love that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't love it. I see what's going on with the country, you know. But the in 2016, our country is going to be number two to China economically. It's hard to believe that wouldn't have been possible. We just had a contraction. Like a woman, has a contraction this country. We had a contraction, where the country, we actually, we actually ceased to grow, and we got smaller.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In the last report, which is shocking, and I don't think I've ever heard of that before. And you know, we're just not doing well, we're not the same place, and we're putting in all sorts of taxes and regulations and.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But here's the, here's the thin, g that I got to ask you. And I know, like you know, they love you, at the Tea Party and stuff. Are you really anti-abortion? You're not. I know you're not.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I know you're not. There's no way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a whole, it's a whole thing, Howard. I mean, I feel certain ways about things. And is it, is it a priority for me, because my priority, was always get China job right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. I'm all about that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. And you know, I've never really been exposed to that. And that's always been my view, you know, to be untied, but you know, obviously with passes, you know.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And this when, I have a way, to say I'm going to ask you something.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When I heard the one, you know, Senator guy, who was running for the Senate say, "Rape is
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Now is crazy. But you always, have it your way to progress.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You got to, but it's actually split up. It's actually split up, Howard, about 55 percent of this country, feel that way.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But I know you, I know you. There is no way, that you personally are against abortion. I mean, you know, there's too many motherfuckers running around here out of their minds. They've got people having babies, they can take care of them. You got women.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nobody else is taking care of me.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I mean, who wants a baby on the planet, that nobody's going to take care of. We got a ton of them, as it is, and thank God there is abortion. I know you believe.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, it's never been my big issue, Howard. And you know, somebody else man I say, 'pro-life'. But it's never been an issue, that really has been discussed with me, in great detail.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do you really think, that the government should be regulating, what a woman's personal decision is? +C151
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Of course not.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well a lot of people do, Robin. And you know.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Where are you at?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's right. Yes.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Like pro-life, Howard. You know, I'm pro-life.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I don't believe it. I don't but by the way I believe
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If he can stand on that argument.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Hey Donald. I also believe, if I was alone in a room with you, and you and I were just having a drink, I don't think you care about gay marriage. I think, you're all for it. I know you. You are for people being happy. I know George, the case. And he took it to lunch, trying to convince you. But he's the wrong guy, to convince a man. He's a great guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a nice guy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He's a sweet guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> God knows what he said. Actually, he actually did leave that lunch, and say, "You know
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I think your form.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, he is a very nice guy, and feels very strongly, about a lot of things.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And don't you feel great?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he did really well on you know on the Apprentice.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But don't you feel good, that he's in a relationship, where he's happy? He's not out like sliding around somewhere, marrying a straight woman.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he is happy
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And totally in love, and he was explaining to me, the whole situation of how he fell in love. What his partner looks like, and the way he is. Janeway is beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it was nice.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Did he? You know, what would have been great, if he went to lunch, and you changed his mind. And he came out against gay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I never tried to. He was so out there. I would be giving, it a shot right now. But, George is a nice guy. He did by the way, he did great on the show.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know, but Donald, go on the record. You're for gay marriage.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I've got.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What does gay marriage do marriage, Donald?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, you know, it's not an argument that you know. I want to really. Because it's never been an argument. That I've been you know. That's been discussed with me very much. People know it's not my thing. One way or the other. But no I haven't been. And also pro-life. And you know. If you look at it now. I will say the argument of gay marriage. Is changing a lot of people. People are changing a lot on that argument. And it's that was one, Robin that was 80 or 20 years ago, and now it's 50 50. And I think, it's probably heading the other way. And I'm not saying, I wouldn't change at all. But you know, I haven't been, and it hasn't been a subject, that has been high on my list for a lot of reasons. People have actually you know, it's funny with all of the politics, and all of the everything. People talk to me about fuel, and gasoline, and China. They talk to me about 100 different things. They never, they never really talked to me about the gay marriage, and they never talked to me, about pro-life etc. Only I bring up those issues.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But those things come up every election, for some reason, or other.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Let me ask you, about a bunch of things, that we haven't talked in so long. All right. Here we go. You ready? All right. Let's talk about Lindsay Lohan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay,
<Howard Stern> <Negative> She's a mess right now? I know her. I mean she knows her. He probably had sex with everybody. Did you have sex with her.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. No, I didn't. I think, I know everybody. It's interesting, how so many names, are brought up, and it's like I know them all. They go to my clubs, they go to my live, live in my buildings. I see what a normal. A-Rod. I know. You know he lives in Trump building. I saw him over there either, and you know, I sort of gave him. I love, Derek Jeter is great.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is Paris Hilton over? Is it done for her? I mean I know you know her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It's over. Right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't say it's over. They don't write about it, very much right now.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She sort of created the Kardashian gender. She was the one, that coordinated. They were hanging around, with for and all of a sudden, you know, through the Kardashian mother. They've built up a little empire.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just wonder, whether or not. I just wonder, whether or not, Paris Hilton, when she sees, that you know, they've done very well, whether they should have, or not they've been on the Apprentice. Kim Kardashian and her sister, were on Chloe, for the Apprentice.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Don't you think, Donald, that Paris Hilton is seething with jealousy of the Kardashians?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It could be.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Not only the Kardashians, that she is. It's like everybody, who was with Paris, Nicole Simpson or Nicole Richie, is doing very well, with a fashion line and all this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, if you think, about it Paris, you know, started a lot of these people, that Lindsay Lohan was in that group. Now Lindsay Lohan, I don't think is doing so well. I would say she's probably doing really badly, she wanted one of my buildings. And then, we said the rent, and she was like, "Excuse me? "". She's you know
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hey, Donald. You think, Sarah Palin's an idiot? Don't you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No I think you do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I think she's tremendous. I think, she's a, she's a star. Look, I don't think people. Wait a minute. I know Sarah Palin, you know. I spoke to you yesterday. I think, she's a wonderful woman. And there is a group of people, a fairly large group of people, that absolutely adore Sarah Palin. I think she's been treated, very harshly by the media.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, she doesn't come off well. When she's, when she speaks, it's very, very close.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've seen her come off, really. Well and you know, I've seen her. And how she has a following, that's you know, an amazing following. She's got a great following. But no, I can't say that I think, she's you know, I often think of people by the way they treat me. She's been so nice to me. She said the greatest things about me, publicly. She said phenomenal things, about me like, you can't get much better. And when people do that, I'll tell you who said it the other day, Snooki.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Now I don't know. Why you post? Nobody likes Snooki now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's too bad. And then he said, "Donald Trump should have been our president
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, I mean how nice. Could it be?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right, right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I love this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Should have been, I was surprised. You know, I was running. I decided not to. But she said, I hope Donald Trump runs. But she said that, and then she said, "Donald Trump should have been our president
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Then somebody asked me, what do you think of Snooki? I said, she said, "You know
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> If you had run for president, and you need someone who would have been, at the inauguration. I mean, what would have been your dream?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You would have been there
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh, of course. I never missed that part. Robin of course.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, one of the great things, about Robin Hood, is what it was.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> We had fun. Didn't we?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That was a good one, a really crazy wedding. I've got some of the world's most expensive weddings. Then I called the guy a month later, "Hey
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you know that? And what do you know?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I didn't spend a lot. She's fantastic. What she has to put up, with Robin?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And my wife? I think. She's a, she's a, saying, "You want her
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're all on the same page"."
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I tell you, last night. She left the bed early, because I was snoring, so heavily, and the fact that she stays with me, with you know, the way I make love, is so horrible, and I'm still so fat. You know, how many years, I'm, I'm with this woman, right now. And I still cum, too fast. I'm still good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's good, in many respects.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> In a way, yes.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Then you have to go, a second time, because it'll take, a little bit longer.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> A second time. I'm, I'm 59 years old, and you talking about second time? I'm not.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's no second time.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You know, what I'm talking, you go a second time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't want to say that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why not?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Don't forget, the world's most famous, the number one selling, New York Post of all time. Had a very good comment, about me, that I thought, you know, you remember, the great. You did not have. Sex, I've ever had. Yes. So I heard, that was going to be in. And I got my lawyers, to try, and stop it. She came to me, who actually, a very streetwise guys. "Mr. Trump
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What about. All right. Tell me hot or overrated, you're always very honest. Here we go. Halle Berry?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, okay. I hate I love her upper body.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think her skin is beautiful. Yes I've seen her, you know many times. What I hate about Halle Berry, is that there's always like, drama around her. It's always like fighting automobile accidents. You know, fist fights boyfriends, fighting ex-husbands, fighting for the child. I don't. I just so you know, you can't go crazy, about that. It's a, it's a. And she's been around a long time. She's fine.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Is Kim Kardashian really a beauty? Are we not being honest, and saying her body? Isn't that great, that ass is way too fucking bad? Go Ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have problems, with all these people, because they're so nice to me. Like Kim, was on the Apprentice, she came on the Apprentice. Understood, but I'm talking, is a physical beauty.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Understood, but I'm talking, is a physical beauty.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She was at her all time peak, and she wanted to come on the Apprentice. And she came on, and she saw some of her perfume, and stuff and I don't know. What she was, and she couldn't have been nicer? Okay. Let's pretend it's not camp. Do you have a good body?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No of course, she had a fat ass. Absolutely right. In other words, if it weren't Kim, that say, "Wow"". I don't want to go out with her."
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So, what is the deal? What is the appeal?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How does she be, Mr. Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, I don't know. I mean, to me, now there is obviously an appeal, but it is my appeal.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> In other words, back in the day, when you were saying. Let's all face it, you went through some beauties.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I went to some beauties.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Like Kim Kardashian?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Let's put it this way, Melanie said to me, "Darling
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who would have it been?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Who would have it been?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, that's a good question. I don't think about it? Because that's so unlikely.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But okay. Let's say about it, let's say God forbid, your beautiful wife, has a horrible illness. She goes rapidly, within two weeks, she's gone. That would be a terrible thing, and of course, it's not going to happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you said, wait. Robin said, "One of the worst things""
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's right. Would you leave immediately? Or what was your answer?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What I said.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I believe, you said, you'd never lie.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I said, "I would"". And I thought
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> There was no question you were leaving.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But your answer, was your answer, was never.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Your answer was diplomatic.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But the truth is, you would be, you know, with her but on the side, you would have women I know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. Never, not even a chance.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Even a chance, would you say who is the girl? You're avoiding the question.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who do you pick up the phone and call?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> The answer.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have a problem. Here's the problem. I own the Miss Universe contest right. Right. And I bet that a hot thing is that the ratings were fantastic for it because you did the right thing you got the girls in skimpy outfits I got all of the most beautiful women in the world so I bought that 13 years ago was a sick puppy.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And I bought it from a group of people, from Paramount and Madison Square Garden corporation. They did, where the guy that ran, it was not gay, and his wife would not allow him to go to the contest. This is not a good formula for success. Right. So I went to it in Las Vegas like 13 I said this thing is phenomenal but it's so poorly run. And I said who's running it. Well he's not here tonight because his wife is jealous. OK so you know by the way you can only if you're going to run the Miss Universe meaning run it like as a manager you can only be a woman or gay. There's no other. Right. OK. So I own it and I see like a month ago there was a girl that I put on Diana. You know Diana Diana does that I had on this Celebrity Apprentice last season. Right. Who's one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen in my life. And by the way when I fired her I got like you know I have this huge Twitter thing going right at Donald Trump would you tell us listeners because it sure to be they're all saying it's the best so it's Admiral self-promote myself.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Are you the best tweeter? Are you?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Are you literally the best tweeter? Because while you're honest, I'm controversial.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Honest.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I don't even think I'm controversial. I'm very honest, and you write these tweets yourself, and I'm hard. I do it myself, usually out to get them out to somebody. Who's sitting you know? I'll just say, 'Put this in, because it doesn't take me any time that way"."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Can you trust this person, because they have your past?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have four people that have my best, so I have a person in every sector, that has my best. But sometimes, I'll do it myself.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Does anyone ever write your tweets, for you, or you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They make sometimes, they make a mistake though, and it really dries. I go crazy. I fired somebody over.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But you did? You fired a guy, an example before that you know before the playoffs?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So Bill Belichick is a friend of mine, and Tom Brady, a very good friend of mine, craft that whole group.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So I said to this secretary, who didn't know anything about 'footwell sailor'. I'll check wish Bill Belichick, Tom Brady, and Bob Kraft.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good luck on the game tonight.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So she said, "Okay
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> The next day in Boston, it was like a scandal. It was front page, Trump doesn't even though, the coach's name.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I went nuts.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Did you fire that person?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I called Bill Belichick. I said, "Hey Bill
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What you're saying? Is it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's very hard, when you manage a big company. You can't possibly do everything by yourself. And so you delegate responsibility. But if people don't do it right, I go nuts.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You have to fire them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't fire them always. But sometimes, I'll fire them. I didn't fire the person that said, "Bob TeleCheck"". I mean
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know, what I like about you? You know, what I like about you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Tell me?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You're not embarrassed by your wealth, in the sense that, you knew your name drop.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I know this one. I know Bob Kraft, the place of my courses, and he does it as well. Some people would be sort of, ashamed of that. Like not ashamed, like afraid to show to Romney.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Romney? Is it?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now, I have to tell you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I like Romney very much.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was so disappointed in him. I'm not angry at Obama. I give Obama a lot of credit. He played the 'rich-rich guy', 'poor guy-thing' which is always a very nice thing to do, in politics.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm not upset. But the problem with Romney is, he didn't talk about his success right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> How successful is he?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, he's worth a couple hundred million dollars, which by your standards, and by my standards.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I mean, it's not modest right. That's a lot of my mind, is like cost of a yacht.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Wait a second. Maybe, it's because of the way he made his money.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, you think about Romney.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No way.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He could have gotten out there, talked about staples, that he could have gotten out. That's true. I was almost ashamed of it. And I didn't understand it. And you know. What I hate it, when I said, the last couple of weeks of the campaign. First of all, this last debate was a disaster. Somebody said, be nice instead of being tough. And it was a disaster. I hope people said, "What's going on here
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Right. We don't want to see toilet paper, filled up with stuff, and he's trying to, and he's in jeans.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I used to hate, when I used it, because I don't want to see the guy in it, in jeans and like a shirt, like he's, like he's a regular guy. And he's pushing the cart, and he can't get the cart out the door, you know, he's opening doors, where they open, and he can't get the cart out the door, because he's never done it before.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Never done it before?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And you know, I never considered him on that look.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know, they wanted to make him, look like a man of the people. And you know, what the people don't care. They want somebody, that's going to be, just tough shit. It was like Jimmy Carter, used to walk off the airplane carrying his own luggage.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Remember that you know, you're so right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You don't want my President Kerry.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want African Marines, to carry his luggage, and they want to carry his luggage. They want it. They want to care. But Jimmy, cutting is the work of carrying remember a briefcase of his suit, over his shoulder right off this. $250 million dollar airplane, Air Force-One. It is a private jet.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I say, what is it? This is my president, carrying his suit.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want that. You know, you make a good point. I never considered that before. It doesn't make a lot of good.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, Romney maybe should have just said, "You know what motherfuckers? I've made it in this world
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I embrace all of this, because this is what America is about taking. You know what I did? I filed my statement when I was running, and I filed a financial statement, when I was thinking about running. And I wrote a book, and the book. Did he really? Well it's time to get tough. And I put my financials, let me know why. Because I was seriously thinking about running, and you have to file a form. And I put it in there, and it said, "I was worth over seven or eight billion dollars""."
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right. Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And it was a lot of cash, very little, that I did really good, Howard? And I was going to make that, a big part of what I was doing, you know, because I've done well.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You say, "Don't you want a guy
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And in fact, when I was thinking about running, and I was there, we're running against Romney. Who I actually like, and then Romney, is a small time businessman, is only worth 200. I have much more cash than that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well, you know, you're right. In other words, you don't get embarrassed.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I said, "We need somebody
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> And you're saying, "They laugh at us?"
<Howard Stern> <Negative> We're the dumbest people on Earth, and it's hard to make deals sometimes, because they assume you're stupid, like your leaders. You know, at the top. You don't want to try, to make a deal. They think, we're all stupid. If you say so, it's a little bit difficult, but you know, after about 10 minutes. They let you know, they, they did something. It was interesting, in business week, they did a story. Now, nobody hits China harder than Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Would you say that's true?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I've, I've seen you everywhere, who are pro life, and everything.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I said, "How my real thing is China
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I mean, we can even say the word 'Trump' or do they say, 'Yuan Pilate', their currency.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So it's impossible for our businesses, to compete with theirs. And we do nothing about it.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> All right. Never mind that Mila Kunis is hot.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, not to me. Not at all.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> She's not?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> She's an attractive person. But when you look at Diana, and does it, when you look at the Miss Universe people, you know, that's why I'm so jaded. I see these girls come in, from Brazil from Venezuela. They're way hotter, than our Hollywood girls.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, forget it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> If you put it, okay. You take your best looking actress in Hollywood right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And I'll take like Miss Brazil. All of her.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I know, I'll put you, put up next to each other. Nobody would even know, who the other girls in the room.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And isn't it true? Miss Brazil would be ten times better in bed.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That, I can't tell you. That, I can't tell.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How about Jessica Chastain? Do we think she's hot?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> No. She's a nice actress, I guess.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But no, she's certainly not, she's not hot. No. No. I'm just jaded. Howard, you know, I just got back from the big thing, and I I've never seen it.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> They decide to print this. What are you watching on television?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I watch the news all the time. I watch, you know, the business shows all the time.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You only watch, Fox News commentary?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I do love Fox News, and by the way, they do love me. They certainly did it. The network. Robin, do they love you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I think so.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How do you watch MSNBC?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I watch them as 'NBC tunes'.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There are no shows that you like to watch. They are just funny as drama.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Just chill out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know. I don't have time. Yes, the answer is yes. I love, I love the old movies. Sometimes I go to those, but you know, it usually last for about 10 minutes. I'm loving it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Days of Wine and Roses.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Breakfast at Tiffany's is stuff. I love that.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> So, are you watching any porn?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've never been totally into it. I've never been into it. You know, I've never, I've never been into porn.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. I have to check it out a little. I never, you know, I've always been embarrassed a little bit by it. I've never been into it. I've never needed it. It's never been something I've needed. I have friends.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And so, when you masturbate? What do you do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have friends, who need it, because they think, they get nothing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let me try. Like, when I masturbate porn, I do it to the point that I get, I get the porn stuff. But I've never been. I've never been.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Are you kidding? I'm watching a tape the other night. A woman is teaching another girl how to play the piano, the girl playing the piano was naked, and this one is within her. Let us see this thing. I mean, I was turned up.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm sure, he's going to say that to me. But I think, Howard, you know. You know, fortunately for me, I love the news programs. I love the political program. I am a very political person. But you've known me, for a long time. I've always been a very political person
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> So, you always commented. But you know like, now that the guys, who are planning to run have to meet with you. You're like the kingmaker. You do have to meet with me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, you know, and I think, I give them good advice, and you know, I have a great popularity, and I have some people that dislike me extremely much. You know, I listened to Howard once, and a while ago, and he said "Why is Trump doing this?""And it was interesting and I understood exactly
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But wait a minute, wait.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You know, it increased that 15 million dollars, you know, just before the time limit. I said, "I'll substantially increase it"". And I would have increased it to 50 million
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, you are missing my point. My point was this. You were at the point, where you were really becoming beloved, like Oprah, even had you on with the family last week.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. You came off great.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The kids thought, I was right, when I did that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But then, I was the son. And I was thinking about it. I never ran. I never ran.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But I I do think about, what some of these political fringe stuff. You don't need that. You, first of all, you saw in the Trump brand, you need to bring a lot of people, into the tent.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, but I don't care, Howard. You know, our country club. It's one of the great purchases ever. The 800 acres in the middle of Miami. But that was a year and a half ago. Miami is exploding.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Why are you in New York? And why don't you hang out in Florida? For the Fourth of July. What's that? Somebody's ringing. Who is that?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Probably, Ivanka. Yeah. My daughter is fantastic. Because she calls me like, every morning at 7:00. She's fantastic.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hello, Daddy? How are you?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you think of that guy, she's married.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know. But he's great, he's great, is a great guy. He's a smart guy. Harvard graduate. Good looking.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> By the way, I see, I see you're going ahead, with this lawsuit that you are against.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let me explain. That's another one. This guy gets on, and I don't know, what it is. He, he spoke so horribly, and I had a father, who actually was a very handsome, dashing guy. I remember your dad. He was a best looking guy, there was a builder in Brooklyn right. And he was a good guy, you know, smart guy, and a good guy? And I learned a lot from my father and believe me he was so proud, and all that stuff. You know, because he never believed, never wanted to come into Manhattan, because he said "That's all on my territory"". But he was just a good professional
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I don't know either.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, in a way, I mean, technically he did say, "It was unconditional"". He didn't like
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And then?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So here's what happens. You know the Cooley Law firm, that's one of the biggest firms in California? It's a very highly respected. I went to one of the guys. I said, "What do you guys think of this case"". They said
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But in a way, I mean your point is "Hey
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> It was worse than that. He talked badly about my father right there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He hurt you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he talked badly about my mother and my father.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They were amazing people, you know, they were. Howard, I understand, you and I, they were married 63 years. Right. Had an amazing love affair.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You know, we don't. In other words, when a guy screws around you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, maybe I'll be a good sport.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Bill Maher was he?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He was so nervous, what was he saying? It was almost like, it was rehearsed, because he was so nervous, what he was saying. And there was such hatred. And I said, "Why would he hate me
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But, really?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And so, what if Bill Maher called you today? I'm giving you a theoretical right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And he realizes, "Oh
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I know, HBO is infamously cheap. They do not pay a lot of money. But he does, he does stand up, and does a lot of corporate getting, so you know, I met him two years ago, when I was in Los Angeles.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I met him at a week. I was having dinner, and he came over, and said "Hello"". He was such a nice guy. He was really nice."
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, here's the most important question, and no one. I haven't heard you speak out on this. What do you think of Michelle Obama's bangs.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I think she's nice. Look, I think she's a good woman. I think, she's really in there pitching. I do think, she's with him. It doesn't matter. I think her bangs are nice, but I think she's a woman, that's really in there, pitching for a husband. And I like that, because I see a lot of people, husbands you know, male and female, that don't pitch for each other. She's in there pitching for a husband. She's working hard. I see her in the shows. Romney should have been out there, like Obama was out there, and by the way I thought Ann Romney, actually did a very good job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She was better than Romney. Should she do, what Ann Romney did a good job actually better?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I think she's an amazing woman. Isn't it ridiculous, when they go to Texas, leave sick, to go back to what she went through?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I think an amazing thing. I think, Michelle Obama did a fantastic job. Her husband really did. And I think, she represents a tremendous group of people, that really like her. She is popular and I'm all for her, I've been on qa terrible article today, in the Washington Post about her. And I think it was disgraceful, that they were able to beat the rap, against her, called her.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They talked about her looks, really, in a very unflattering way. And I thought it was disgusting.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And what did she actually become?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I mean you're hearing it from me first, but it's actually become a big story. The fact that they did it, I think that what they said was disgusting, and I think they shouldn't have been. You know, they shouldn't have said it. She had five or she is six. She didn't want to do that much. That's true. That would have been interesting. I would agree with that. You'll tell me privately, privately, your post is already done.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What did they say?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She was a sex?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, you know, listen. She is a wonderful woman, she really is, and she is someone to be respected and proud of that. She is the first smart.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well I agree.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You know, I have to look you know, with everything. I think, that she really has done a fantastic job as first lady, and she's in there kicking. You know, she's doing things, unlike some people. They sit on the arrest, they do nothing right. Listen, I have a whole staff of. We have many, many, many people thousands of them like that too.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> All right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> We love you. We could talk all day, all day.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Any time you want?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just heard, you were sort of complaining, that I was saying it for a while.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What happened with Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was inundated with my friends, because I do it all the time. And my friends were calling me saying, you know, how it's complain, don't call them anymore. I said, Wait a minute. Why don't they just call me?"And I'm right."
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're absolutely right. It is our fault.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Feel stupid calling you all Howard. It's Donald. I wanted to I want. It's not my thing. You would like to play a little bit hard to get right.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You're very right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I said to Gary the other day. I said, "You know
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right. Thank you.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Did we talk about gun control? Where is he on now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think this. I mean to me, it's if you notice that Democrats are really folding on that issue, because you have women say, "Well what happens if a man comes in with a gun
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right. We need a gun on the other side of the table. If somebody is pointing a gun at you. At least you have a chance.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I think guns are unfair, it's a very very difficult subject, but you need guns for protection.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No regulations whatsoever.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That little piece they did, was very threatening. Why don't we blow them up? Tell you what. If I were in office.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I saw that piece, you know the piece came out, with a basically that playing a song, and then they showed New York City blowing up, and they have a missile strike.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> They show, New York City blowing up the plane.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We are the world. Robin, I don't want to lose. Do you know, that the single biggest problem in the world today, is nuclear weapons? And nobody talks about it. It's not gun control, it's not this is the biggest problem, we have is the nukes. Because one I had a uncle, Uncle John Trump, my father's but he was a professor at MIT. He was a genius. He was, a he went to MIT, which is you know as good as it gets, is he was like ridiculous. It was a total genius. And he told me years ago 35 years ago, that you know, "Donald
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So what do we do though?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> How do we get rid of the nukes, when you don't have to do something, because you know, when you see a whack job, like you and I. Assume the sun is at least partially wacky, like the father who's totally gonna be crazy, is a whack job like that who really don't care for life. That's, that's the problem with the enemy. You know we used to fight an enemy, that had a uniform we knew, who we will fight. We fight people. They come out of nowhere. They don't wear uniforms. When you go to Afghanistan, and the people that we're training, are shooting our soldiers it's time. You know, I'd like to see this country rebuilt we are to rebuild our own country.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But, but are you an isolationist?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By the way, the nuclear problem is the single biggest problem. We have, so let's blow up North Korea and Iran too. Well, the commercial they've made. I don't know if it was a commercial, but basically they were showing missiles going up, in New York city being destroyed.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And nobody even mentions it. You know it's like, I'll tell you what. That's almost an act of war, that that was made by the government.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Don't you think though that this kid, who just took over, trying to show that he's got balls, and he can stand up to America? But who knows, maybe he's for real?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It might be the kid. I mean they got some wackos, right? You know, you look at those guys.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean you look at the riots they have. Did you ever see it like even in South Korea? I do business with South Korea. I think it's a very tenuous place, to be honest with. How it like to live right next, to North Korea. All of the riots. I mean, it's perfect the people go quickly. Riot police dress perfectly, perfect little trucks, they have the water, you know, come in and they rip the helmet. The people, you know, everything is like they're all in that perfect, little uniforms everything. Well, North Korea is sort of the same thing, and even worse. You talk about a militaristic state, but when they make a video, like that how it it's it's like, it's almost like, that was put out by the government, and here's, the here's the tragedy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People are starving over there. All they got, is these dopey videos, they put them out. They hope that it will come to the bargaining table, and maybe give them something. That's what it's about.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It is a tragedy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't worry about that. To me, the tragedy is that, for we are no longer the same country. We've spent 1.5 trillion in Iraq, for which we have gotten nothing, that is blowing up all over the place. You know, now that we're out, as I always said it worked. I used to say, "Oh we're in Iraq"". Obviously
<Howard Stern> <Negative> We didn't do any of them. Not only did we not get any of the oil, they didn't pay for any of the war.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We got nothing. But, this is not a better one. And now, one of their little local senators, got up and said, "We want
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> One of the great deals ever.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> We could go on all morning, we've talked for over it, and we talk for an hour. It's very amazing. I didn't even take a commercial break.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I could talk to you for 10 hours, and we would have the highest ratings ever.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You're a, you're a top. You know that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So the next time you call me, any time you want. I'll be on your show.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> All right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I blame myself, I blame myself, and we will call you, and see Donald Trump on All-Star Celebrity Apprentice, premiering March 3rd at 9:00 p.m. On NBC. He's giving it another shot to Dennis Rodman.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We are. He's a sick, sick individual. But that's good.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You like that. All right. Listen, I'm glad we got to touch base with greatness.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'll talk to a great, simple. Great guy, great guy Donald Trump. You got to love that.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He will take any questions.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Anything.
