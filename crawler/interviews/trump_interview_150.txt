<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> Nice to see you Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nice to see you, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> Surprised to see you here all the way in Singapore.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it was a good place, and you're the only one I've done an outdoor interview, and it's about 130 degrees, but that's okay.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I think it's about 150. But anyway --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, it's pretty hot.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> What surprised you today about Kim Jong-un?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Really, he's got a great personality. He's a funny guy, he's very smart, he's a great negotiator. He loves his people, not that I'm surprised by that, but he loves his people. And I think that we have the start of an amazing deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to denuke North Korea. It's going to start immediately and a lot of other things are happening, including getting the remains back. You know -- that's been -- know you've been so involved in North Korea, but getting the remains back Greta is so important to so many people. They've called me, they wrote me letters, "Please can you do it?" and he's agreed to do that, thousands of people so -- who died in the war -- so that's a big deal.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> So you put the human rights issue on the table today and he reacted how?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very well. I mean, we obviously were talking about the denuclearization 90 percent of the time, but we put a lot of other things, including human rights were mentioned, getting the remains back were a big factor, in fact we put it in the document, we were able to get that in the document, we got a lot of good things in that document, that was far beyond what anyone thought was going to happen.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Give me some behind the scenes, did you issue an ultimatum to him, did he issue an ultimatum to you? What was the back and forth?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, not an ultimatum. We've been dealing for three months really and we've been dealing through our various representatives including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who's done a really fantastic job. So we've been dealing for a pretty good period of time and when we met today, we got along right from the beginning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know for me this is hour number 25. I haven't been sleeping for 25 hours, it's been a big long negotiation and I'm very proud of it. It starts a process. You know that could have ended in a war, that could have ended with many millions of people -- you know North Korea very well, Seoul has 28 million people, that could have ended up with millions of people dead but we're gonna end up with a deal.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> What about our troops? Are they staying in South Korea?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah they are going to stay. We didn't even discuss that, that wasn't discussed. We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money. You know where we -- cause I think number one, it's very provocative, and I want to do it, and I think they're very happy about it because it is so provocative. But it cost a fortune to do it. And we won't do that as long as we are negotiating in good faith.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What brought Kim to the table this time after saber-rattling over decades?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well actually I don't think there's been too much saber rattling, prior to me I don't think, they basically had a silencio attitude - silence - they didn't want to talk about it and you can't do that. And I think the initial rhetoric was very important. Frankly, as much as I hated to do it and as much as some people thought I was doing the wrong thing. I think without that, we wouldn't be here. I also think he really wants to make a deal, he wants to do something.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> But why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because he knows that we mean business. I don't think he felt that in the past. I think in the past, look it was different people, it didn't work out. But he knows that we want to do business, we have to do business and we will do business. And now we do have -- it's been you know not a long time -- although you could say from day one, we've been talking about North Korea in a very tough manner. But I think we signed a document today which was far, far greater and more comprehensive than people thought - and nobody thought this was possible.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> What do you think he thought of you after he left?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he liked me and I like him. And I understand the past and, you know, nobody has to tell me, he's a rough guy. He has to be a rough guy or he has been a rough person. But we got along very well. He's smart, loves his people, he loves his country. He wants a lot of good things and that's why he's doing this.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> But he's starved them. He's been brutal to them. He still loves his people?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, he's doing what he's seen done, if you look at it. But, I really have to go by today and by yesterday and by a couple of weeks ago because that's really when this whole thing started.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Again, without the rhetoric and without the sanctions -- the sanctions were very important -- the sanctions are going to remain on until such time as we see, you know, this is going to happen. And we pretty much see that now but the sanctions will remain on until we really start dismantling or dismantle the nuclear weapons.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> Because this is Voice of America it will be heard in North Korea by the citizens of DPRK of North Korea. What do you want to say directly to the citizens of North Korea?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think you have somebody that has a great feeling for them. He wants to do right by them and we got along really well. We had a great chemistry -- you understand how I feel about chemistry. It's very important. I mean, I know people where there is no chemistry no matter what you do you just don't have it. We had it right from the beginning, I talked about that and I think great things are going to happen for North Korea.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> Mr. President, nice to see you. All the way from Washington.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's true. It's been a long time. At some point I'll be able to go to sleep, I think. You know, get a little rest.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> Indeed. Have a safe trip back sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you Greta, a great honor.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, nice to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> OK, you've been busy on Twitter lately. Let me read you one of your recent Twitters. It's about President Obama. You said, "The habitual vacationer calling America lazy this past weekend while in Hawaii." He was at a big APEC summit in Hawaii. You take issue with it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I do, indeed, when he's using a 747 Boeing to go around, which is called Air Force One, to go around and campaign and raise funds. And I can't imagine that the Republicans aren't being stronger about he shouldn't be able to do that. But he's flying around on Air Force One, which is a plane that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars an hour to fly.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But all presidents do this, both parties.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Maybe they do, but I've never seen anybody do it like this. I mean, I've been watching this for a long time and I've never seen any president work like this. This is crazy. He calls it vacation. He calls it this. He's campaigning. He's really campaigning and vacationing.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm not sure which is worse.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, the reference where he says -- he said when he was speaking on November 12th -- this is in part -- "But we've been a little bit lazy, I think, over the last couple of decades. We've kind of taken for granted, well, people want to come here, and we aren't out there hungry, selling America and trying to attract new business into America."
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it's interesting that he calls people lazy. I mean, he's done one business deal in his life. That was his house. And there's a big question about his house. So it's very interesting that he's calling people lazy because he's really referring to the business community, and they don't give us the tools.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> When they allow China to manipulate their currency, when they allow other people and other countries to do what they're doing against our country -- you know, it would be nice if the government could give a little help. But for him to call -- and I said it the other day on, actually, one of your shows. I said it the other day.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> For him to say that the business people of this country are lazy is disgusting.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What do we want...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Especially coming from him.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What do we want more of? Do we want more of American businesses going overseas and developing products and growing around the world, or do we want foreign companies to come here?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think we want American companies to stay here and develop their products from here.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> That wasn't the choice. That wasn't the choice.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, but that's what's going on. I mean, that's the problem. People don't even give that as a choice. Even you. I mean, you're asking me a question, Do we want to go over there and develop? No. I think companies should stay here, make their product and sell it to China, like they do to us.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, we'd like it. That's ideal. But that -- I mean, that's not happening.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, the reason...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> At least not...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... it's not happening is because of a simple manipulation of currency, and we do nothing about it. But we should be making product here and sending it out. You know, China says, You want to build a tractor? Good. We don't want your tractor. Go build a plant in China. We don't do this. We don't do this. We're not doing it properly in this country.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> China says, Wait until you see what happens to Boeing. I have a lot of good friends at Boeing. And watch what's going to happen with China and Boeing. They're going to make their own aircraft. They're going to make everything. They're not going to be buying from Boeing very soon. They're going to be making their own aircraft.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's going to be made in China. And they're going to be competing with Boeing like you never saw before.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> OK, new topic, 2012 -- give me sort of a highlight of what you think is going on in the race. Who's up, who's down, who's doing [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it's amazing because every day, it changes. Now, Newt, who's a friend of mine, is doing very well. Mitt Romney is doing very well. I mean, he's doing very well, but he just doesn't seem to get that extra little bounce that you would think he'd get.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Why? Why doesn't he move up a little bit? He doesn't move down, but why doesn't he budge at all?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, you could say he's got a very solid base. I mean, he doesn't move down, and that's a big statement that you make. He doesn't move down. But you would think that he'd be bouncing like wild. He's done great in the debates. He's really done beautifully in every single debate.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, does he -- I mean, the pundits say that, but if the numbers don't reflect it -- I mean -- I mean -- I mean, he's a great debater. You know, all the pundits say he does really well. But how come the numbers aren't moving up? The voters are not showing that they think he's doing a great job.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, they think he's probably not as conservative as they'd like to see. And yet that's a very smart game, potentially, because if he gets the nomination, he's going to have a very good chance against Obama relative to other people that maybe are more conservative. So he's playing a very fine-line game, and it may be brilliant.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We'll let you know in about a year, right?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> One of the things that the president -- that the Obama campaign is going to go after him for is things like flip-flopping, issues like abortion. When he debated Senator Ted Kennedy in the early '90s, he was pro-choice. He's changed his mind. And he got a little heat recently about the collective bargaining law in the state of Ohio.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> They called him a flip-flopper for that. He's getting a little bit of that, which is going to be very painful should he get the nomination.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, sure, and they're going to get him on flip-flopping. And other people flip-flop, and frankly, people change their minds over a period of time. And Obama was against the debt ceiling. He voted against it when he was a senator and did lots of different things that he's now advocating. So, you know, I guess they probably look at that as a weakness.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm not sure it's a weakness or not. He changed his mind.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> So it's a tie. They both have flip-flopped.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, Obama certainly flip-flops. He was against the war. He was going to get us right out of the war. It was going to end immediately. In the meantime, he got us more into the war. And by the way, as soon as we leave Iraq, as soon as that' over, that thing is going to be a mess and Iran's going to take over.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So I don't think he's done us any favor. But no, I mean, who flip-flopped more than Obama? Look at the war. Look at his vote on debt ceiling. Look at many of his other votes. He's flip-flopped more than anybody!
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, you mentioned Speaker Gingrich, that he is at least currently surging. Every day is a little bit different for everybody. Why do you think he is doing better now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, he's got some very good conservative views, but I think maybe more than anything else, he really is a very good debater. And you know I like him because he's a member of my great golf club in Washington, D.C. I love people that join my clubs.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Is he any good at golfing?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's good, and his wife is good. I mean, they're very nice. They're -- you know, they're really nice people. The people -- they're liked very much at the club. That I can tell you.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, so why...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because I don't know...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> On a serious note...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... Newt that well.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> ... why he is doing well, besides the fact that he's a good debater?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, no, I think the good debater is really a big thing. It's not just -- the debates have never been so important as they are now, for some reason, both good and bad. I mean, you've seen what happened to certain candidates that didn't do well in the debate, and it's really been not a pretty picture. Newt has done very well in the debates and Mitt Romney has done very well in the debates.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But the debates are interesting. They're fascinating to watch. But the idea that you can ask someone a foreign policy question or how do you correct the economy and give the person 30 seconds or a minute -- this little snapshot, does it really tell us anything about the person? [End Video Clip]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, and it could be that your worst debater would be your best president. It's possible. But I think people want to see how a certain candidate acts quickly because, you know, it is a quick thing. It is something to do with this -- acts quickly, and how do they react under pressure?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Coming up, more with Donald Trump. What happens when a candidate's personal scandal hits the GOP race? You will hear what Trump thinks about that next. [Commercial Break]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Once again here is Donald Trump.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> [Begin Video Clip] What is the effect, do you think, and I realize this is a little bit of voodoo, but some of the personal issues? For instance, Speaker Gingrich confronting some issues from the '90s with his marriage. There's been an allegation against Mr. Herman Cain about sexual harassment. All this sort of, is this significant in the race or is this sort of going to be collateral come 2012?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's not exactly a great boost. And I think Herman has worked very hard to get rid of that. It seems like a lot of things are unfounded. Nobody knows are they true or not true, but they don't have any evidence or any proof. And it certainly is not a positive for Herman, and it certainly is not a positive for Newt.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In fact, I just see now he's doing well. They were leaving him alone, but now that he's doing well I'm starting to see all the vicious stories come out about Newt. And it will be a tough period of time. But it is not positive. It certainly is not positive.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Ron Paul, Congressman Paul. Out? Totally out?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's an interesting guy. He has some interesting views of things. Whether you agree or don't agree, he does have some interesting common sense. I view it as common sense not libertarian views on things. But it will be very hard for him to win. There's no question about that. A couple of the folks that are debating, I don't think we have to get too much into names, but it's almost like why are they taking up the time?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You look at their numbers. They stayed at one percent for a long period of time, and you hear them answering the same question over and over and over in the debate, and you don't want to hear it from them. You really want to hear from the candidates that have a chance.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Maybe the other will implode? We get surprises all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's happened before. But I think certain candidates are just not going to have much of a chance.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But if I were running I would be focusing on Iowa and spending a lot time there and let everyone else be distracted by the national polls. Whoever has a really good ground name in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Florida.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And a couple of people are doing that. We'll have to see if it works, but a couple of people are doing that. And they are focused also in New Hampshire.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What would be your advice for Governor Romney?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it's interesting. Probably the best thing he can do is get my endorsement, because I do carry a big endorsement.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Is he going to get it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm looking at a lot of different things.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But you always say that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, no, I'll be making an endorsement at some point.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Why are you waiting? You have a level of certainty, you are a determined businessman. I bet you know.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm looking. Do I know in my mind who it will be? I have an idea who it's going to because. I don't want to say yet.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What's the criteria?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm just seeing what their attitudes are on certain things. For example, foreign policy. We keep talking about the economy. Very rarely do we mention all of the countries throughout this world, this great world of ours, that are ripping us to shreds because their leaders are sharper, smarter, tougher than our loaders.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Stop right there. I suspect when they have all made the pilgrimage to see you, I suspect you have spent more time with them asking questions like that than we see on these sort of snapshot debates.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's true.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> So I think they would be farther ahead of the decision than you are letting on.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, I feel very strongly about it. We can say education and all sorts of things. It's interesting, what do we do about jobs? People say we can do education. I watch the debates and it's very sad. They talk about everything except what the primary reason is. We are losing our jobs to other countries because of stupid policies and actually very, very stupid politicians.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Is this new or is this just the President Obama administration or is this something that's been an epidemic in prior administrations?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's gotten worse. We honor China now. I watched Mr. Huntsman the other day and it's almost like roll over and let China take over this country. I watched him in the debate. I thought it was a terrible answer. Not that he gave it improperly. I think it's a terrible answer to a big problem. I think that we have to focus from within.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have to start getting back to the core values of this country. The world is eating our lunch. They are taking our jobs, they are doing numbers on us, and our politicians aren't smart enough to even realize it. When we have the president of China coming to this country, Obama gives him a steak dinner. What he's doing to this country is unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm not talking about Obama. I'm talking about the president of China, but if you think about it, Obama also.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And OPEC is the other one that gets you really going.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OPEC is the single biggest abuser of this country, absolutely.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Which of the candidates has the toughest approach to OPEC?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I haven't seen anybody.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> None of them?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I haven't seen them using the word "OPEC." I haven't seen them discussing it too much. But I will say this, the candidate that wants to drill in this country without mentioning the word "OPEC" is OK with me also.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And you must be following the pipeline dispute from Canada.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I certainly have been.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> It's been put on hold and the president is caught between the environmentalists and the unions.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right. It's obviously political. He doesn't want to do it until after the election. He's caught between the unions, which is very interesting where they want it, and they are supposed to be on his side, and the environmentalists because they don't want anything in many cases. And I'm an environmentalist.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have received so many environmental awards. I do a great job from the standpoint of the environment. But I'm an environmentalist that wants things to happen. You have some environmentalists that don't want anything to happen. And Obama is caught. So instead of doing what he should do, which is approve it and get fuel in this country and jobs in the country, he said I'll wait until after the election.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's purely political.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I have a problem with the fact that no decision is made.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think it's terrible. And it's so obvious. It's not like, oh, gee. It's obvious. He will wait until after the election and then probably approve it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And the Congress with the debt ceiling last August and the super committee, if they don't reach a decision by Thanksgiving that's approved by congress, that there are these huge cuts that will go into effect that the Republicans are unhappy with the Democrats are unhappy with, but that doesn't go into effect until January after the election because they don't want to offend their constituencies.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The concept of a super committee is an outrage. If we had a proper leader in this country he would get everybody into a room and make a deal. For you to have a super committee, which is highly political to start off with, is absolutely an outrage. I'm hearing the committee is not coming to terms, they aren't doing what they think, I don't know.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's hard to believe they won't come up for me. Everyone says they won't come up with a deal. For me it's hard to believe they won't because I think there's a lot of political pressure on them to come up with a deal. But the super committee is an outrage that we even have a super committee.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But you don't see my point, if they don't reach a decision, it's not like the trigger gets pulled January, it's not until in after election so neither party will feel the pain from not work out a solution.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The one that really went to bat the trigger after the election was Obama, and he totally out-negotiated the Republicans, and I'm a Republican. He totally out-negotiated the Republicans because the one thing he wanted in this whole deal was the decision to come due after the election, and he got it, because he knows if we emd -- I call it the great mess. [End Video Clip]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We had the great mess six months ago. He knows if he went through that again prior to the election, he could not win the election. So he got the one thing he wanted, which was only for his own preservation, and he's a politician, so who can blame him? But I can't believe the Republicans allowed that decision to come due after the election. He couldn't have won the election -- could not have won the election if it came due before the election.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you very much, Greta.
<Diane Sawyer> <Positive> Well, this morning, Donald Trump, in the spotlight, stirring things up once again. He said over the weekend that if he decides to run for president as the Reform Party candidate, he will spend a $ 100 million of his own money on the campaign, and yesterday, he told me that a key factor in his decision will be whether he can be assured of being part of the presidential debates. Presidential debates saying that one of the criteria that you're going to use is that they say in advance that you're going to be part of the debates, if you qualify in 50 states.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I would want to be part of the debates. If I spend close to a $ 100 million on running, if I decide to run, I would want to be part of the debates, and if I weren't going to be part of the debates, I think it probably would be a fruitless effort. I think people like straight talk. I talk -- I used to say that I could never be elected because I do talk straight, and politicians don't talk straight. And I've watched some of our candidates, number one, they're extremely boring, and number two, they don't say much...
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> All of them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...so nothing's -- well, I don't want to generalize but I find it very, very tough to sit through an entire interview watching some of them. Now, that shouldn't necessar -- perhaps I wouldn't have enjoyed watching Abraham Lincoln or George Washington, you know, that's possible also. But the fact is I have a real hard time with these folks.
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> You have proven yourself a guy who is a master of -- of whatever else, of stunts. How much of this is a stunt?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it's not a stunt. [Clip]
<Diane Sawyer> <Positive> How much of all of this is just to entertain yourself? How much are you serious?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm totally serious. I'm serious. I'm also, and as I told you before when it was just us in the room, I'm having fun. I'm having fun doing it. But -- and that's good. And, by the way, you can't do it well if you don't have fun at it. You just have to. [Clip]
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> And you said, 'I guess he's an anti-Semite,' right? 'He doesn't like blacks, he doesn't like gays.' Do you want to take any of that back.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, there's nothing to take back.
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> Bill Bradley, 'almost Marxist'? [Clip]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. I've known Bill Bradley. I'm the largest employer in the state of New Jersey, or just about. I would say that Bill Bradley is so liberal in his tendencies, in his leanings, his real tendencies and his real leanings that he's almost Marxist.
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> You can't just sort of say generally that someone is Marxist. I mean, these are strong words. Marxist.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, let him challenge me on it. I mean, you know, let him challenge me on it. But I -- that's just my feeling toward Bradley. [Clip]
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> He seemed disconnected from his words.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But as he's talking about bombing and talking about nuclear and talking about lots of other things, he had a big smile on his face. I'm saying, 'What's going on over here?'
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> And another issue you said recently that if the North Koreans are developing nuclear weapons, then we should go in in a surgical strike, much like the Israelis...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I -- I never said that though. I said we should go in and negotiate, and...
<Diane Sawyer> <Neutral> And develop
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...of course. Who wants them, in four years, or three years, or two years to have nuclear capability the likes of which we have never seen before. I don't.
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> And if the Chinese threatened intervention if we -- if we -- if we...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look, we use China, and China is whipping us big league on trade, and if they want to continue to rip us, they're going to have to do something with respect to North Korea, 'cause North Korea's totally out of control, but China controls North Korea very beautifully.
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> And you'd intervene, even if China threatened to -- to get involved.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> China wouldn't threaten. China needs us so badly, you have no idea. Look what they're doing in terms of trade. They are taking a $ 100 billion a year from us in trade.
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> Next we ask, doesn't he hate to shake hands? Do you think you're a germ phobe? I've read what you said about shaking hands and then going and washing your hands. Do you think it's a little bit of a phobia?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't think it's a phobia. I think it's common sense. Look, I have people coming up to me wanting to shake my hands. I don't know where they came from, but I -- I see people, they sneeze, and then they say, 'Mr. Trump, let me shake your hand. I think you're wonderful.' And, you know, I say, 'You just sneezed in your hand. I don't want to shake your hand.' I think it's a barbaric custom. I do it. I can do it. I mean, I guess if it was a real phobia, I wouldn't be doing it, I'd just say, 'Let's stop.'
<Diane Sawyer> <Neutral> I was surprised in looking at the notes for your book that you say you have never had a drop of alcohol, you have never had any drug because of your brother.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I had a brother, Fred, who was a terrific guy. Handsome, incredible personality, smart, everything, but he got hooked early, fairly early, during college and then after college on alcohol. And ultimately, it killed him. And, you know, frankly, and I say this to all of the many lawyers that are watching, I just don't understand. You went after the cigarette companies, which is great, 'cause I think they're terrible also, but alcohol's worse than cigarettes.
<Diane Sawyer> <Neutral> So you would like to see state action similar to the tobacco companies against...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hey, if I was an attorney general, I'd bring all the cases I could against the alcohol companies because of the tremendous horror that they've brought. If for no other reason, maybe this point gets across this morning. I mean, I -- I really hope that somebody goes after the alcohol companies. I learned a lot from my brother, who was quite a bit older than me. He said, 'Don't you ever smoke. Don't you ever -- ever have a glass of alcohol.' And I watched his life just be destroyed, and I never have had a glass of alcohol, I've never had a cigarette. I've never had a cup of coffee in my life. I've never, you know, 'cause that's...
<Diane Sawyer> <Neutral> Caffeine?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, caffeine is caffeine. Look, I'm not knocking coffee. I'm not putting it into the same breath, but I just have chosen not to.
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> All right, the first word for the other candidates is boring. What is the first word for you? One word?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I bring spirit to things I do. My business has tremendous spirit.
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> And every candidacy has to have a slogan. What's yours?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> 'Go with me and we'll win, because we will win.'
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Joining us now, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump. Donald, are you there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am. Good morning.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Good morning. How are you doing?
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> You have been up early this morning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I always get up early.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> You get up early. You're tweeting early, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I get up early. I get up nice and early.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Why are you tweeting early, Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because I like tweeting. Because I like getting the word out.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Yeah. What word do you want to get out this morning?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I have gotten the word out. You know, Hillary said some things and I said some things and now I go and I go back to work and I have a lot of fun.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Sounds like it. So let's talk about a couple of polls that have been out the past couple days. The Fox poll that has you up a couple points. Then you've got this New York Times" poll that has Hillary up a couple points. But it looks like it's getting tight
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, [Inaudible] had a poll that had me up by, I think, 5 points yesterday. So we're doing well. We're doing really well. Getting tremendous crowds and enthusiasm. It's sort of interesting because I talk about Hillary's bad judgment. I actually said that this morning to a lot of followers. And a lot of people that agree with me. But she's got horrible judgment. And you look at what's going on and...
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> What's the worst example of her, you say she has horrible judgment.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I could tell you a lot of examples, but one of them is Libya. Libya was an example. Libya is a disaster and by the way, just in case you have any questions, right now ISIS has taken the oil from Libya. So we knock out Libya and you knock out Gadhafi and she thinks we did a great job. And it's just more destabilization, a total disaster -- and ISIS has the oil.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Would you have stayed out of Libya?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would have stayed out of Libya. Yeah. I would have stayed our of Iraq too.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> And will you stay out of Syria?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would have stayed out of Syria and I wouldn't have fought so much for Assad, against Assad, because I thought that was a whole thing. I mean, we have -- you have Iran, which we made into a power. Iran now is a power because of us, because of some of the dumbest deals I have ever seen. So now you have Iran -- excuse me -- so now you have Iran and you have Russia in favor of Assad and we're supposed to fight the two of them. And at the same time, we're supposed to fight ISIS, who is fighting Assad.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> So there are a lot of people that say you have inconsistent foreign policy, but it sounds pretty consistent here -- you're -- as far as what you've just said this morning, you wouldn't have gone into Libya.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> You've said you wouldn't go into Iraq. You say you wouldn't go into Syria. You wouldn't have fought Assad.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I would go after ISIS -- big league.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> But you would go after ISIS...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Even if...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, Joe, ISIS is fighting -- ISIS is fighting Syria. So you have some people -- most people -- they want to fight Syria and they want to fight ISIS at the same time and they are fighting each other.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right. So what you're saying is Assad can stay in power, that's not your interest. Your interest is...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, what I'm saying is we have bigger problems than Assad.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Yeah -- yeah -- what your interest is, though, militarily you tell the generals, go after ISIS, but we're not interested in replacing Assad.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say knock the hell out of ISIS, which we could have done originally. Knock the hell -- look, we shouldn't have been in Iraq. Bad decision. Then the way Obama got us out was a horrible decision, the way we came out. And I would have said -- and by the way, ISIS was created because of that. Because they wouldn't take them in. Because we had the wrong leadership. We put the wrong leadership on Iraq.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Right -- but I want to get specific on Syria because there is a divided foreign policy community. There are people like Lindsey Graham who say you've got to replace Assad and beat ISIS. There are others who are more realists who say, you know what, Assad is a horrible person but he stays there. Our job is getting rid of ISIS. Is that where you are?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's where I am. And by the way, Lindsey Graham called me up the other day. He was very nice. That was a very surprising call. But he was very nice. But I disagree with him on this. Look, we have Iran and we have Russia totally on the side of Assad. And that's not the reason I stay out necessarily, but certainly it's a complicating factor. But we have them totally on the side of Assad. We have to knock the hell out of ISIS. And if we're going after Assad and ISIS and they're fighting each other, people are going to say what the hell are we doing.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> All right. One more foreign policy question. You know, people like myself have criticize Barack Obama, Republicans have for eight years, for not being good friends with our friends, but leaning over backwards to help our enemies, whether it's Iran or Cuba. This past week a lot of people confused because you're talking about -- sounding like Obama saying you would go to North Korea, you'd talk to the North Koreans. At the same time...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wouldn't go to North Korea, Joe. I wouldn't go there.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Or you would talk -- you would talk to them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The last thing I do is go -- I would never go to North Korea. I don't know who would say I would go there.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Okay, you won't go there. You'll talk to the North Korean leader.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, I would.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Maybe he could go to your resort in Scotland and you all can talk there. But anyway, you talk to him, but then on the other side of it, you're attacking Great Britain, our longest running ally. Is there an inconsistency there?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not attacking Great Britain. Where am I attacking Great Britain? I'm not attacking them at all. They asked me about the EU. I said, frankly, it's none of my business. And I don't even like asking it -- answering it, but, frankly, if I were Great Britain, I'd get out of the EU. I see what happened with the great migration destroying Europe and EU had a lot to do with that. Personally, I would get out but I said I don't want that to influence the people of Great Britain.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Right. You -- you were going after David Cameron, though, their leader.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't go after -- you show me where. He came after me a little bit. And by the way, he would like me now to visit 10 Downing Street. They put out that invitation about two days ago. So I will do just fine with David Cameron. I think he's a nice guy. I will do just fine. But they have asked me to visit 10 Downing Street -- and I might do it.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Interesting.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Okay, well that's interesting. That's -- I thought I'd heard that you had said we might not have good relations with...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> We're going to have good relationships. We'll have better relationships than we have right now, but all of these countries will not be taking advantage of us like they are right now. You look at what's going on with China and Japan and Mexico. Everybody takes advantage of the United States and we owe $19 trillion, going up to $21 trillion very soon.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So Nabisco -- we heard you say Nabisco is going down to Mexico. You shouldn't have made an Oreo joke at Chris Christie's fund-raiser.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> What's the Oreo joke? What's it...
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Come on, man. Chris is your friend. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You think what? You thought that was not appropriate?
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Well, I just don't think you should have made an Oreo joke to Chris Christie.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> OK. I have a question. I have a question, Joe.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> OK.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Donald, we had former Defense Secretary and CIA Director Robert Gates on the show yesterday. I'm going to play for you a bit of what he had to say. He had concerns about both candidates, you and Hillary Clinton. Take a listen. [Begin Video]
<Robert Gates> <Negative> I think they are especially apprehensive about the unpredictability and the threats of Mr. Trump. And some of the things he has said, from having Japan and South Korea have nuclear weapons to breaking off the relationship with China and so on and so forth. These are all serious concerns.
<Robert Gates> <Neutral> And the problem -- the worry is that even before the election, countries begin to take steps to offset these dangers, or these perceived shifts in U.S. policy, in ways that put greater distance between ourselves and them in terms of cooperation in the future.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> [End Video] And Donald, I want to know what you think of those comments?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the comments are wrong, because he knows nothing about me. He knows nothing about what I said. I'm not a big fan of his, by the way, because you take a look at two things. Look at where our country is with years of him being involved.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We are a mess, number one. I know he has a great reputation and all of that. All of these guys have a great reputation. They have been doing this stuff for 15 years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look where our country is, OK? We need a new group with better thinking. Number two, as far as Japan and South Korea are concerned. All I'm saying is we defend them. They are paying us a tiny fraction of what it's costing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We -- I want them to pay. I would love to continue to defend Japan. I would love to continue to defend South Korea. We have 28,000 soldiers on the line between North and South Korea right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It is costing us an absolute fortune, which we don't have. We're a debtor nation. I would like them to pay up. They have a lot of money, both of those nations.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We take in Japan's cars by the millions. South Korea sells us, every time you buy televisions...
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So, you don't have a problem with the troops staying there. You just want Japan and South Korea to pay us for their presence.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want them to pay up.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Fair enough.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because we are not a country -- this isn't 40 years ago and 20 years ago.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We are not a country that can afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Germany, the NATO nations, 28 NATO nations, many of which are not paying us and they're not living up to their agreement.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Japan, South Korea, nobody, we're like the dummies that protect everybody. All I'm saying is, we have to get reimbursed because we can't afford it.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Pay up.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> OK, but Donald...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And nobody says that. And Bob Gates, who I don't know at all, but Bob Gates has no idea. See, they're misrepresenting it, he's misrepresenting it.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> So Bob Gates is one of the greatest foreign policy minds in history. And I think the worry...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, really, why? Because we're doing so well? You mean, you think we're doing well with his foreign policy, Mika?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Donald -- I think -- I think the worry also is just how you will be as president and present your positions and your words, and there are some concerns that you might be trigger-happy with your words. Like, for example...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, really?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm the one that didn't want to go into Iraq, Mika.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> I'm -- even talking about for example the tweet that you sent out yesterday morning.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What's wrong with them?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> I will tell you that some might say.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> That it was very much generating hatred, focusing on the hatred and fear that terrorism brings to the American people. And maybe perhaps that first tweet...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you feel that way, but I -- I said another plane was blown up and I can practically guarantee who blew it up. And another plane went down...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> But listen -- listen -- Donald listen to yourself right now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And let me tell you, the -- the mind set of a weak Hillary Clinton, which is four more years of Obama is not going to do it for our country, Mika.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Yeah. And I'm asking you if there is any, perhaps backing here to the concern, that a lot of what you say is focused on hatred and fear, and sort of generating more anger and churning it up. And perhaps for example that tweet, maybe you might have thought of the families that were suffering first.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'll tell you what. Let me tell you what I'm thinking of. I'm thinking of the future. We can't continue to let things like this happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We are being taken advantage of by radical Islamic terrorists, and we are -- this world is changing. And another couple planes go down, Mika, and you're going to have a depression world-wide, the likes of which you have never seen. Because nobody is going to travel. There will be no anything.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There will be no communication between countries. And you will have a problem the likes of which you have never seen. And I will tell you four more years of a weak Hillary Clinton and that's what she is, four more years of that, it will not work. It will not work.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And all I did is point it out.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I said, when you find out what happened to the plane, it will be exactly what I said. That plane didn't go down because of mechanical failure.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> I'm not saying it did.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Yes. Right. Speaking of not working, let's go to the guy who when I'm not working 90 percent of the time...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> He's just walking around.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> He's in charge. I kind of just walk around.
<Willie Geist> <Positive> Nice, headed into a good segue. Hey Donald, it's Willie.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi Willie.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Good to talk to you this morning. I want to ask you about something you said last night at Chris Christie's fund-raiser, which is quote, Who the hell cares if there's a trade war. You have been open about a 35 percent tariff on exports from China and from Mexico. Most experts believe that would plunge China and Mexico into a recession.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh really?
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Could perhaps put the United States into a recession.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh you think so? I don't think so.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Are you concerned about the jobs that will be lost in this country because of a trade war?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. No. OK. Ready? So, China, we have a trade deficit with China of $505 billion this year.
<Willie Geist> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have a trade deficit with Mexico, $58 billion. Not only that, they are killing us at the border and everything else. We all know that. The drugs are pouring across, et cetera.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People are coming across. Everybody is coming across, all right. They do nothing to help us. And they will.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They will end up being very good neighbors. We'll have a good relationship if I'm in there. But when we have a trade deficit with China of over $500 billion a year, I say, let there be something because they are taking advantage of us, OK? We can't do any worse. So, if we had a trade war, to be honest with you, it can't be worse than having a trade deficit of $505 billion.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I say that loud and I say it clear. And let me tell you what will happen. When we get tough with China, they will stop devaluing their currency which is the biggest way that they beat us. That's their number one tool.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are absolutely killing us by devaluing their currency.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are absolutely making it impossible for our companies to compete with China. And by doing that, it's taking our jobs away. I mean, look at our country. Look at the jobs -- the real job situation, not the phony job, with the 5 percent stuff. Lock at the real job situation. If I go out and I see communities that have been stripped of their jobs.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Donald, do you believe though, if you put that tariff on Chinese exports it would put the Chinese economy into a recession?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No I don't.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> You don't. OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm not sure you'd ever have to do it. Look, I have been contacted by top people in China and so has the United States' government by the way. And they are concerned with me. And guess what they are going to do? They are going to negotiate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are not concerned with Obama because they have been ripping off our country for eight years with Obama. They are very concerned with me. And they want to figure out what's going on. And I can tell you, top people have talked to me and they said, boy, you have China in a very interesting position.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They want to negotiate, Donald. I said, I know, because that's what I do. That's what I do frankly, better than anybody else.
<Willie Geist> <Neutral> So, that's...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And when you have a guy like a Bob Gates that's been running foreign policy, I mean, he's been in so many administrations, I will tell you another thing I don't like about Bob Gates. Whether it's Obama or anybody else, and even Obama. When he writes a book and says bad things about everybody that he worked for, I don't like the kind of guys that write books and say bad about everybody they work for. [Crosstalk]
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> All right. We're going to put him down as undecided for Bob Gates for vice president.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't care.
<Willie Geist> <Neutral> I know.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> We heard you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm just telling you. I don't like that. But more importantly...
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Donald...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... I don't like where our country is and he's been there for many years.
<Willie Geist> <Positive> Right.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Well, you know what...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> I, kind of...
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> He's kind of had commander-in-chief strapped around him.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> I dare to disagree.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> I mean, you think things are bad now? Just think about how bad they would have been if he weren't there trying to resist the worst instincts of our last two commanders-in-chiefs.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think things are very bad now.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> OK.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yes.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Donald, you're like my dad, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I think they're very bad world-wide. I think the world is a mess.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right. Let's go. Donald...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Like my dad...
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> We're running out of time. And we've got to get around the table.
<Willie Geist> <Positive> Yes, I just want a -- I want a quick button on this, because that was an important thing you just said and very interesting. That the 35 percent tariff you proposed may just be a negotiating tool and you may not ever implement it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I hate to say that, because I hate to tell China there that. But you know what? I will tell China right now. I will implement it if they don't behave and they are not behaving. They are devaluing their currency. Recently, nine months ago, they gave the biggest devaluation in the history -- the biggest in 20 years, in two decades. And, they are not behaving. They are not playing fair.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right. So, Donald...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And on top of that, they are building a major fortress in the South China Sea, which they're not supposed to be doing.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right. So, I'm just going to say it for everybody. So, just so China knows, Donald is going to put on like an 80 percent tariff. He's going to...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Don't joke, Joe. I mean, you're having -- hey Joe. You're having a lot of fun.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Hold on! Hold -- Donald, let me finish! Let me finish Donald! You have got to let me finish.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK. Don't joke Joe.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> You've got to let me get to the second part of what I was going to say. For all you economics professors and people writing op-eds...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> He's negotiating.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> .. and fretting freaking out, he's negotiating. This entire campaign. Look what he did to the Republican party. He battered them. He abused them. They came whimpering to him like a beaten dog, licking his foot, begging him to please, just pet him. It's what he does. It's called hard nose negotiating. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I will say one thing. The Republican party is really coming together...
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yes, they are.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... and really unifying. And people are endorsing me now...
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yes, they are.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... that frankly, I was a little bit surprised to see some of the people that are endorsing me.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Frankly, I was surprised at how quickly it happened.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> Mr. Trump, you're running against a rigged political system and a rigged economy. Bernie Sanders is running against a rigged political system and a rigged economy. You have a lot of animosity and distrust for Hillary Clinton. Bernie Sanders clearly has a lot of animosity and distrust in Hillary Clinton. Would you take a few minutes to talk to him and consider him as your running mate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh wow. That's a great question. You know, the one thing that Bernie Sanders and I have in common, two things. And I do have much bigger crowds than him, but that's OK. But we have the crowds.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> It's also sir. With all due respect, it's close.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I actually do. Joe knows that and Mika knows that. But, he is second, I will say that. He's above any other Republican.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> He is.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, I will say this. We have one thing very strongly in common. We know that the United States is being taken advantage horribly on trade deals. The difference between Bernie and myself is that I know how to make those trade deals fantastic and he doesn't. He has no clue.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But if you're number two, he could watch and learn from you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, but he's got too many other things in the bag, no. But I will tell you, Nicolle, and I mean this 100 percent. And you saw that in many of the primaries when they do the polls. If Bernie loses, which he will because his system is rigged very badly, frankly, he should run as an independent. Bernie should definitely run as an independent. But, Bernie, his people are going to vote -- big percentages of the Bernie people are going to vote for Trump. You watch.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right, Donald trump.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Donald Trump, thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Willie Geist> <Positive> Thanks, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Wow.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Good day.
