<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> To day 99, which was spectacular in our nation's capital, but day 1 as you remember was cold and gray back in January when the President took the oath of office and spoke of American carnage and rattled the establishment with these words. [Begin Video Clip]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, but for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists. An education system flushed with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge. We've defended other nation's borders while refusing to defend our own. [End Video Clip]
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> All themes that have been part of the first 99 days, the President's approval numbers right now in the mid-40s and while 30 executive orders and 28 bills have been signed into law, 13 of which were bills that were rollbacks from Obama-era regulations, the big three that he campaigned on, health care, tax reform, and immigration reform have not happened quickly as he had hoped. The President is clearly frustrated to some extent with the Republican Congress. The businessman now-president learning that the wheels turn slowly in this town, and he sees his biggest win so far as outside our borders. Earlier today, we spoke about both.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I've gotten and developed tremendous relationships throughout the world with the leaders. That's something that you won't - you know, we have this artificial barrier called 100 days which I'm not a big fan of, but of course, I know - [Crosstalk]
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> Well, you made a pretty good effort to get a lot of things done in the past few days.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no, I fall victim to it all, so -- no, no, I fall victim to it all, so -- but it is very much an artificial barrier but allot of things can't be really determined. As an example, I've made tremendous and created great foundations in terms of relationships with China and with Japan and with many, many other countries. You are saying yourself and so on the show the other night where you're talking about there's never been any, kind of, a relationship that we've had with China, look at what China's doing, they're turning back the coal ships from North Korea, they're putting a lot of pressure on North Korea.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, I don't know -- I have a lot of respect and I really like President Xi. I don't know that he is going to be able to pull it off. It may have to be a much more difficult ending, to be honest, but he is trying. I believe he is trying. And he's a friend of mine and I really like him a lot. We'll see what happens, but I've set the foundations for a lot of great relationships in the future. I have tremendous feelings for a lot of the people running the countries of this world. And that's a good thing, that's a great thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, you don't measure that in the first 100 days but those foundations have been set in the first 100 days. Getting a Supreme Court Justice, a great one, I think he'll be great one but getting him not only nominated but approved in the first 100 days which hasn't been done since 1881. And this is going to be something really special. That was interesting. It was -- I was reading a couple of reports where every time there's a five to four decision in favor of let's say what our views are and this is for the next thirty or forty years potentially, you know, you can say that you had a major part in it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's why I've always said having supreme Court justice, getting Supreme Court justices confirmed. Now, I could have others and we'll see what happens but getting justice gore such confirmed was to me a very bighting and it will be a very big thing in the future.
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> You are a registered democrat for a long time, now republican President of the United States, and people say, "Well, President Trump is not an ideologue, he is a pragmatist. How would you describe your political philosophy?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm not really an ideologue. I think I'm a person of common sense. I think more than anything else and I was a democrat, I came from a place -- you know, I lived in Manhattan. I started in Queens with my parents and then when I started doing a little better and better deals, I was able to get into Manhattan, I moved into Manhattan and in Manhattan you, you know, republicans are not exactly flourishing. And so I started off as a democrat like Ronald Reagan was also a democrat. And over the years, you know, your views just change somewhat but I think more than anything else I'm a person of common sense.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I understand what has to be done, I get things done I've always been a closer. We don't have a lot of closers in politics and I understand why. It's a very rough system, it's an archaic system. You look at the rules of the senate, even the rules of the house, bit the rule of the senate and some of the things you have to go through, it's really a bad thing for the country in my opinion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There are archaic rules and maybe at some point, we're going to have to take those rules on because for the good of the nation things are going to have to be different. You can't go through a process like this. It's not fair, it forces you to make bad decisions. I mean, if you're forced into doing things that you would normally not do except for these archaic rules, so --
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> Like what, how would you change them?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, you look at the voting and you look at the filibuster system. And it used to be. You know, I always thought of filibuster where you stand up and you talk all day and then somebody else--
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> You don't have to do that anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, you don't have to do it anymore. Today you say filibuster guys sit home and they watch television or whatever they do. I think, you know, the filibuster concept is not a good concept to start off with but if you're going to filibuster, let somebody stand up for 20 hours and talk and do what they have to do or even if they are reading comic books to everybody, let them do it but honestly, the whole with so many bad concepts in our rules and it's forcing bad decisions. I really see. I see just -- I've seen this -- I've seen it over the years where bad decisions are made, decisions that nobody wanted are made because of archaic rules and that's something that I think we're going to have to change.
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> You really try to make a lot of moves to shrink the size of government, to shrink the size of the bureaucracy. But people say why not be concerned about the deficit? Why allow it to balloon with this tax reform deal and why not touch entitlements because unless you do that, you're not really ever going to take a bite out of the spending.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm not touching Social Security other than fraud, waste, and abuse. And I will tell you this, look. We are doing -- we're just put in I think a great tax proposal, the economy is going to boom and you'll see that. It'll take a period of time and you'll going to have some deficits in the meantime, it's, sort of, called priming the pump, you have to prime the pump but look, the numbers just came out yesterday really, the real numbers. 1.6 GDP last year under President Obama.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> 1.6 percent, now, that is a horrible number. I call up leaders of countries and I say -- because I'm so friendly with so many of the leaders as I said and I say, "How are you doing?" "Oh, we are not doing well, we are not doing well, it's -- we are very upset. GDP is 8 percent," or GDP is seven or GDP is eleven and here we are at essentially one percent GDP and were supposed to be happy about it? No, we have to prime the pump, but more often a lot of other things are happening.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to be doing trade bills you see what's happening with all of the trade deals that we have which are horrible. We're going to have a lot of money pouring into our country. In addition to which you wouldn't get GDP from the one percent to a one and a half percent to let's say, I say four because I really believe it. You know, we're saying three but I say four --
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> Four buy one?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I say over the next few years. And I say there is no reason we shouldn't be able to get at some point into the future to five and above. But we need better trade deals, we lose a fortune with every country. Look, I've been talking about China for years. Now, I speak nicely about China because I really do believe they're trying to help out with respect to North Korea but the trade deficit with China is hundreds of billions of dollars.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The trade deficit with Mexico is close to $70 billion, even with candidates it's $17 billion trade deficit with Canada. I mean, the lumber pouring into our country and all of the things coming from Canada and it's not reciprocal. And the word I like to use is reciprocal. If we had a reciprocal nature to our trade deals it would be a whole different ballgame, but that's very unfair. And we never, ever seem to have a surplus with countries. With every country takes advantage of the United States and it's not good happen anymore.
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> In terms of legislation you're going to see everywhere on Saturday that there was no major legislation passed in the first hundred days. You have the republican congress --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, that's been a wrong, not necessarily wrong. First of all, we had 28 bills.
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> Understood.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was with the reporter the other day who said the same thing, "You didn't pass anything," and I said, "No, we passed 28 bills. And by the way, by tomorrow it could be 32." These are bills passed by the legislature which I'm saying. I'm not talking about the executive orders which are frankly equally as important but I'm talking about bills passed so we have 28, we could have 32 within the next two days but when you of that this reporter said, "No, I don't believe it."They went back and checked and he said, "You know, you're right, you actually passed --
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> You are right and we have looked at the list. I should've been more specific about --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And a lot of it is important. How about -- how about --
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> -- having about health care reform --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, how about this --
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> -- tax reform --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sure, the two biggest --
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> -- immigration reform? OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we're doing very well on them. We're doing very well on them. Look --
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> But my question for you is about -- is about congress because when you were running you said I'm going to do great deals with congress, I'm going to have great relationships on Capitol Hill. Are you disappointed with how the republicans have handled these big issues? Health care went down the first time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, I'm disappointed.
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> And there was some suggestion it might happen today but now it's not going to happen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm disappointed that it doesn't go quicker. I like them a lot, I have great relationships, and most of them I don't even know but many of them like the Freedom Caucus came and I see that it's not we love our president, we're doing this for our president, you look at that -- you look at the moderates, it's the same thing. We love our president. They have different views. You know, I kept -- I have a party that's coming to a lot of territory, they have different views, I'm disappointed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you, Paul Ryan's trying very, very hard. I think everybody is trying very hard. It is a very tough system and we're dealing with obstructionists. The democrats and I have one democratic vote. Obamacare is exploding, Obamacare is dead, essentially, Obamacare is dead, and it's not going to make it, OK? You have states. I went to Tennessee two weeks ago, half of the states doesn't have any insurance companies. You look at Kentucky, what's going on, you -- it's a disaster in terms of, you know, the insurance companies are all going to be pulling out. Many, many states you have no insurance companies, Obamacare is dead.
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> I hear you but, you know --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The democrats know it. Wait one second. The democrats know it and unfortunately because of the hard time that the republicans have had getting their hands around these things which shouldn't be because it -- you know, I once said it's complicated, it'snot complicated compared to other things being complicated, it's not that hard. I was disappointed that they didn't have more in line by time they walked in. But Obamacare took 17 months of brutality to get it approved.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They ended up giving Nebraska, the Nebraska deal was, were frankly that senator who wasn't even that popular made one of the best deals, what they did for the State of Nebraska. I will tell you this, I will tell you that the 17 months to get Obamacare approved. What we're talking about is far better than Obamacare, it's an incredible bill and we have a good shot at getting it approved by the house. And I call them, I said, "Look, look, the hundred days, don't worry about it, you don't have to take the vote today. Take it next week. Take it in two weeks and three weeks but take a vote --
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> But I want to know about the leadership on this because after the first health care bill did not pass you said I have complete confidence in Paul Ryan. Do you still have complete confidence that he can get these moderates on board with the House Freedom Caucus because you've got to get everybody upon the raft?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a good man, he's under tremendous amount of pressure. I do have confidence in him, I have confidence in the Freedom Caucus people, Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan and all of the different -- you know, all of the different guys. I have confidence in them, I have great confidence in the moderates. These are great, great people, Martha McSally. She flew jet fighters, she used to tell me more about jets than anybody was able to tell me about jets. These are great people. They're great people. They were all great people.
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> So they're going to get it done.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I believe that they're going to get it done. I believe it's going to be --
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> And the timeframe?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think maybe next week sometime.
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> Next week? OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're really coming together. I'll tell you what. They are -- it's very interesting, they're getting together and, you know, they never had a government, they always had Obama and they didn't have the senate, so they could always vote no and do whatever they want to do and nobody cared just for many years, so it didn't matter. All of a sudden, we're governing and I told him and I said, "Folks, we are now governing. We have to come together to -- "
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> And a lot of people said they had all these years to put these bills together, these plans together, and they --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I know but they also at all -- yes, but they were all -- unless there was a culture shock for them, they never had it governed. It didn't matter if they voted yes or no because Obama was going to reject it anyway. Who was going to be there with anyway? And they wouldn't get it through the senate.
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> Maybe they didn't know that you were going to win so they weren't ready.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they probably -- some of them knew I was going to win because they saw the crowds but I had great support from both groups.
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, these are great people, they have different views but their views are coming together and I think you're going to see. Again, they are now starting to govern. It's a big difference. Before whether it's freedom or the moderates, they could always vote no. They knew the senate was going to reject it anyway because they didn't have the senate.
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And even if something happened in the senate, Obama was going to be there, so it didn't really matter and now what matters.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> So what -- what do you say to the members of congress who say well, you know, the president's approval numbers are in the high 40s.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not that --
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> I'm not necessarily going to, you know, bend to his will because on tax reform and on health care, I might lose my own election at home that you don't have the numbers to make it --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Solemnly --
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> -- important for them to come along with you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me guess. OK. So I have approvals in the high 40s, every network that you see with the exception of Fox, Fox has been fair but every network you see hits me on every topic, made up stories like Russia, they do the Russia, the full Russia, I call it the fake Russia story. Russia story was made up because the -- they were embarrassed by their loss. They had this tremendous loss, a loss like nobody has ever seen before. The democrats should never lose the Electoral College because they automatically start with New York, California, and Illinois.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's impossible for republican to win. And not only did I won I won easily. So they made up this Russia thing to try and deflect because they're embarrassed by what happened. The Russia is a phony -- what do you see is the Russia story? The Russia story. And you see all of these other phony stories. It's so bad and for me to have great approval records in light of all the faux press and the fake press I think is amazing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, I will say this, we had a case where I got involved the last few days in Atlanta, in fact, I'm going there today for Karen, he looked like he was going to win, he had about 56 percent of the vote, if he gets 50 he wins, we have no way, democratic congressman. I did a robocall, I did some tweets, I did some interviews, he didn't get the number, and I believe she's going to win, and she might win very easily, I'm involved in other congressional races. I think I'm going to win.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> The president making the argument that he has had a positive impact on some of the special elections that we have watched. Up next in part two of my exclusive sit-down with President Trump today, wait to hear who he believes is to blame for the General Flynn controversy and why he thinks his new tax reform plan will work without touching social security, how those numbers add up. Will see how the president answers this question as well. Do you ever think will may be one term would be enough of this kind of life?
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> We are back and the Russia investigation has cast a long shadow over the first 100 days particularly when it comes to former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and that is where we pick up a question from the second part of our interview today, our sit-down with President Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you look at other networks all I do is get hit all the time. And by the way, falsely. And I don't mind getting hit legitimately but --
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> Well, that story is not -- is not going anywhere as you know. I mean, that story has a lot of, sort of, avenues to it and the most recent one comes back to Mike Flynn who -- when he left when here signed you said that he was treated horribly and that you felt badly about that. Given what we now are seeing on the payments from Turkey and Russia, would you stand by that comment?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, let me just tell you I do feel badly for him, he served the country, he was a general but just remember he was approved by the Obama Administration at the highest level. And when they say we didn't bet, well, Obama I guess didn't bet because he was approved at the highest level of security by the Obama Administration. So when he came into our administration for a short period of time, he came in -- he was already approved by the Obama Administration and he had years left on that approval.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, if somebody is approved at the absolute highest level by the Obama or a previous administration, I mean, does anybody ever ask about them? Does anybody ask about why Bill Clinton was paid a fortune to make speeches in Russia? Does anybody ever ask about Podesta having a company with his brother in Russia? Does anybody ever ask why Podesta would not let the FBI check on the server when somebody hacked their server?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the way, they tried to hack the RNC too but we had good defense. We had good defense. They couldn't hack us. But does anybody ask why is it that Podesta had a company in Russia with his brother? They don't mention that. Now, they should mention that, Martha, but they don't. It's one of those things.
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> I want to move on to a couple of other quick things because I know we're short on time. The huge cut that small businesses would see would also be enjoyed by hedge funds and also by real estate companies. Is that going to make it tougher for you to get that big cut through for the past through past companies in your tax reform?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So with the highest tax nation in the world are business taxes are through the roof and we're not competitive and companies are leaving. We're going to break companies back, we're going to lower taxes and the biggest beneficiaries of the small companies and the biggest of all beneficiary are middle-income people who have really been hurt. Their taxes are going down to 10 percent and I have two guys, I mean, I have the president of Goldman Sachs, Gary Cohn, I have Steve Mnuchin, one of the most successful guys, never made a bad deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These are very smart guys but I said, "Fellas, you keep forgetting to mention because I'm the one that set the numbers, I'm the one that did this to a large extent. You keep forgetting to say that the biggest beneficiaries of the middle-class people who have been absently hurt."
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> But your critics are going to say, "Well, real estate companies like President Trump's company will benefit along with that middle cut," so is there -- is it going to make it harder for you to get that big cut in the middle, the 39 takes to 50?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. If I'm individually paying 35 percent, I will tell you that's more, OK. I'm going to end up paying more than I pay right now in taxes, all right? I will pay more than I pay right now. The reason I'm going to pay more is because I lose all the deductions. They have deductions on top of the deductions, they have hundreds and hundreds of pages of deductions.
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> We'll eliminate those and then --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- things that you never heard of before, I have great accounting firms, I'm sure you do. They come in -- well, you're entitled to a deduction for geese flying over America, you're entitled to this, you're entitled to -- by the time they give you all these, all that stuff goes away, all of it goes away other than charitable deductions which we think is important to keep and interest deductions which we think is important to keep. But all of the stuff goes away.
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I predict I will probably pay more than I'm paying right now.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> So your life pretty much changed completely after election day, how would you say the presidency has changed you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I didn't have much privacy but now I have no privacy. I said to somebody the other day I love driving cars. You know, to me a great -- a great event is getting into a car and driving someplace, I can't do that anymore and I haven't been able to do that really since the primaries. When you go to number one in the primaries all of a sudden you get secret service and -- so it's been a long time. And, you know, there are certain things in life that you miss. It's -- you're in a cocoon and there are amazing people, the secret service, but you can't go very far.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> Do you ever think will may be one term would be enough of this kind of life?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I mean, I want to see how we're doing. I hope that we do so well, that, you know, things are good, that I could either run easily and nicely and enjoy the fruits of what we did. Maybe it takes a little bit longer but I think we're doing tremendously well. I don't think anybody has ever done this much in a hundred days. But I've always said it's going to be 8 years, not 4 years.
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> Personal question for you, you're going back to New York.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> I'm surprised that you haven't been back to New York yet since you became president.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'll break this on the show, I love New York but going back is very expensive for the country because they close up 5th Avenue and they close up 56th Street. I live in Trump Tower which is right smack, great location, right smack in the middle of everything and I always feel a little bit guilty when I go there. And if I go to as an example I have a lot of property. So if I go to one of my clubs like in New Jersey, they'll say, "Oh, he's going to play golf," I'm not going to play golf, I couldn't care less about golf but have a place there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That costs almost nothing because it's hundreds of acres and security and they don't have to close up streets et cetera, et cetera. And I like to do that as much as possible. The problem is every time I go to a club they say, "He's out there having fun," I'm not having fun. When I go to a club I'm working. As an example, I did play golf with Ernie Els and the Prime Minister of Japan, Prime Minister Abe.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was such a great day and we bonded because of that and, you know, bringing Ernie Els along, a great golfer, great champion, he'll never forget the day we had a great time but I feel guilty when I go back to Europe because I hate to see the New Yorkers with the streets closed and I've been there because I've been there when presidents have come to New York City.
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> Yes, we were around the corner, we know.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know.
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they close up, you know, the entire midtown section of Manhattan. I don't know if it's all necessary, so I go back as little as possible because it's expensive, et cetera, it would be much better, people would understand that I could go other places that I have but then they hit me for relaxing and I don't want to be known as a person who relaxes because I'm working hard and I'm working hard for the people and were doing a great job.
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> We're looking forward to having your -- the first lady and your son will be here soon?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're here right now and yes, I am. I mean, it's going to be great. They're going to move right as soon as he's finished with school they're moving to Washington.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, thank you very much as well.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> Good to be with you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Let's bring in Republican front-runner Donald Trump. Donald, good to speak with you this morning. First of all, congratulations on a very big win Super Tuesday night.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Let's start with the news of the day. Mitt Romney, a man you endorsed four years ago, is coming out today with a speech calling you a phony and a fraud and he says that your promises are As phony as a degree from Trump University. What is your reaction to Mitt Romney's attack against you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all, he's a man, who as you know, begged me, and I mean begged me for my endorsement four years ago. OK, so that's fine. He failed in his campaign, it was a horribly run campaign. Republicans didn't even go out to vote.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was a disaster the last month, month and a half, he wasn't on television, it was almost like he was lost, and he ran one of the worst campaigns, as you know, in presidential history. That was an election that should have been won by the Republicans. He was a catastrophe. And I watched this happen and I wasn't happy about it, and neither was anybody else.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We backed him and I helped him and raised money for him, and I did everything, but he didn't do the job, he didn't have the capability to do the job. And he certainly hasn't gotten any better. As far as other things are concerned, we are -- you probably see what's happening, I mean, the biggest story in all of politics isn't so much what's going on with Mitt Romney, it the fact that the Republicans are gaining millions and millions of people because of me. Millions of people are joining the GOP and they're leaving the Democrats and they're leaving independents, and they're joining the GOP.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Well, let me -- let me ask you about that, because it's one of the most stunning numbers that we saw election night. I believe that Chuck Todd talked about it yesterday morning on the show, that it's almost a complete reverse of what happened with Barack Obama in 2008.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Right.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Where record numbers of Democrats were going out to the polls and actually it was an eight million to five million spread on Super Tuesday in '08 for the Democrats. That has been -- and we're showing the chart on TV -- completely reversed around, and this year, it's now the Republicans that are up to 8 million people. What is the difference? What do you think you are doing? What do you think you are saying that is bringing out these new voters?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Joe, first of all, it's an even bigger number. And Obama did a great job then, and this is an even bigger number. The number of people going into the Republican Party is an even bigger number as the number that went in -- in the past -- went in for Obama and to the Democrats. So this is a huge story and it's really the big story.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, they focus on Romney, who's, you know,å¨MD+INåøå¨MDNMåø just trying to stay relevant, but the biggest story out there by the people that really understand it is the fact that the Republican Party is gaining millions and millions of people, and you saw that with South Carolina, you saw that with Nevada. I went to Nevada, the polling booths, and I tell you what, you couldn't get within two 200 yards of the polling areas. The places were packed and the people who were working there said, Mr. Trump Millions of people have joined.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, what they want to do is the establishment, they want to throw that out the window, because if I get out, all those people are going. They're going with me, Joe. I mean, look, China and all of these things, I've been saying it for a long time, but what is happening -- hey, Joe, we're losing our jobs.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> So -- so, if the Republican Party -- Donald, let me ask you this, let me ask you this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> If you get -- you suggested that if you got out, all of these people were going with you. So, you still are willing to run as an independent if the Republican Party doesn't play fair by your rules?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I -- well, look, do I want to? No, I'm leading by a lot, the Republicans. But they're spending now $100 million on negative, phony ads on Trump University which, by the way, has at 98 percent approval rating by the students that took the course -- 98 percent. That's why I won't settle the case. It would be very easy for me to settle the case, it's a simple civil case.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I could settle that case so easy, Joe, but I don't want to settle it. And probably I should, but I don't want to, because I give them a great sound bite, that's probably why I should. I'll win that case so easily. But -- and I don't settle cases.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what happens? When you start settling lawsuits, everybody sues you. I don't get sued too often, because I don't settle cases, I win cases in court.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right. But what about the independent bid, though? Are you still keeping that option open if the Republican Party keeps attacking you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I signed a letter with the RNC and I said, you know, I want to do this as a Republican, the pledge, as they call it. But I'm not being treated the right way. I am not being treated properly. I brought in millions and millions of people to the Republican Party, and they're going to throw those people away. And I - I'll be honest Joe, whether I ran as an independent or not, those people will never go out and vote.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> So, Donald...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They didn't -- hey, Mika, they didn't vote for Romney last time.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, they didn't exist, because they were Democrats and independents, but they didn't vote for Romney. The Republicans didn't vote for Romney last time.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Talk about a big tent. So, Donald, you don't mince words and a lot voters, a lot of Trump supporters say they like that about you. So you just called Mitt Romney a catastrophe and a disaster, those are the two words I caught, of many. You've called Ted Cruz a liar and a bad guy, Marco a light weight. How would you characterize, to put this to rest, how would you characterize, in more words than one, David Duke?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> David Duke is a bad person, who I disavowed on numerous occasions over the years. And the one question that was asked of me, I guess on CNN, he's having a great time, he talked about groups of people, and I don't like to disavow groups if I don't know who they are. I mean, you could have Federation of Jewish Philanthropies in groups. I don't know who the groups are.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's talking about disavowing groups. And that's what I was referring to. But I disavowed him. I disavowed him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I disavowed the KKK. I just did the today show and it was the same thing. And I said, how many times do I have to disavow? Do you want me to do it again for the 12th time? So, I disavow.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Well, I want it on the record on this show. Let me follow up, and then I'll open it up...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Mika, just to put it clear, I disavowed him in the past, and I disavow him now. And it was very clear that I disavowed, but the press doesn't want to go with it. They just love the story. By the way, if you look at my Twitter, which took place just about the same time as that show, you'll see I disavowed right there, too.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right, I have another question, then I'm opening it up to the table. In our town hall in South Carolina, it was about 15 days ago, I asked you to share with me three people you would consult with on foreign policy. And you said you wouldn't at the moment, because you would be announcing your team in a week. Where is that team? Who is that team? And if that team is not put together yet, who are three people you would respect and consult with on foreign policy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Mika, I've met and spoken to the team. I'm going to do it shortly. I mean, I don't think there's any rush, but I've met -- I've spoken to the members of the team and I'm going to do it very shortly. You know at least one of the members of that team, but I'll do it shortly, I just don't want to do it now. I will have, at the appropriate time, you will get that information. I will be -- I said in a week or two, and it will be pretty much in a week or two, but I just don't want to do it quite yet.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Well, certainly, you can announce the team wherever you want, but who do you respect on foreign policy? Who do you turn to? Who do you think is a great lead?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I respect Richard Haass, who's on your show a lot and I like him a lot. Well, a lead -- I mean, I have a few people that I really like and respect. I think Kaine is a fantastic guy. I mean, I have a lot of respect for many of the people, not only on your shows, but many people that I'm dealing with that don't go on television and won't do television and that are great thinkers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But ultimately it's my thought more than anybody else's. When I see the policy of some of these people in our government, the policy -- we'll be in the Middle East for another 15 years, if we don't end up losing by that time because our country is disintegrating. We are spending trillions of dollars in the Middle East, and the infrastructure of our country is disintegrating. We should have never gone into Iraq.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That was a disaster and it just never ends. It's just continuing and continuing. We have to beat ISIS, we have to take them out. They're chopping off heads, we can't allow it to happen, but I have great people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'll let you know at the appropriate time. Very soon. Mike Barnicle.
<Mike Barnicle> <Neutral> Donald, on the aforementioned Trump University, the New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. Who's a political hack, by the way, just so you know. Hey, Mike, before you say it. Do you know that before he filed a suit -- and he also was paid a campaign contribution by the law firm in California, he was paid a big campaign contribution that brought the suit. And this is only a suit of people wanting to see if they can get their money back. But do you know that almost everybody that's in the lawsuit has signed a letter saying how great the school was? That's why I won't settle, because it's an easy case to win in court.
<Mike Barnicle> <Positive> Well his -- my question -- one of my questions is, has he offered a settlement? Has Schneiderman offered you a settlement?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well I don't think I've given him the opportunity.
<Mike Barnicle> <Neutral> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because we -- we -- you know, we're going to do very well in the case. I mean, how do you lose a case where people suing you have signed letters and affidavits saying that the school is terrific? Do you know we have an A -- listen, we have an A from the Better Business Bureau, we have a 98 percent approval rating. How do you settle [Inaudible] from that?
<Mike Barnicle> <Negative> For people unfamiliar with Trump University, how did it work? Was it a semester long? Would I get a bachelor of arts from Trump University?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was different courses. It was different courses on, you know, real estate.
<Mike Barnicle> <Neutral> How long?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And how to make deals and how to go about things, they got very good kits, very good everything. Some very, very good people working there and it was a nice school. I mean, it wasn't a big deal for me, it was a small -- you know, it wasn't a business for anything, but it was small, I thought it would be good. I could have settled this case, I could have settled the case a number of times, I could settle the case now if I wanted to settle the case.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't settle cases. When I see these bankers that get paid $50 million a year and they're constantly with the government giving them, you know, $2 billion, $3 billion, $18 billion to settle cases, I say, why are they settling? You know what happens, when you settle cases everybody sues you. At least with me, I don't settle cases very often. At least with me they know they have to go through the ringer.
<Willie Geist> <Positive> Hey, Donald, Donald, it's Willie. Good morning, good to talk to you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi, Willie.
<Willie Geist> <Neutral> So the plan right now appears to be in the Republican Party is for your opponents to stay in the race long enough to peel away delegates so you can't get that majority and clinch the nomination before you head to the convention.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Willie Geist> <Positive> You have all these groups coming out today led by Mitt Romney, you have super-PACs railing against you, foreign policy leaders writing a letter against you, all these people in the establishment, but do you have a plan, Donald, for when you get to the convention, if you don't have the majority of delegates that you need? What does that look like for you at the convention? How do you emerge out of that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, Willie, did I this for a very specific reason, our country is getting killed, we're getting killed at the borders and we're being killed on trade. China is going to -- we have a trade deficit this year with China $500 billion. Japan, smaller numbers, but the same thing, Mexico, $58 billion in trade deficit. We are getting killed by everybody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have hacks negotiating deals. OK. People that -- workers in this country haven't had middle income workers, haven't had a pay increase, Willie, in 12 years. Their salaries have essentially gone down when you adjust.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're making less now and they're working harder than they made 12 years ago.
<Willie Geist> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's time to make a change. Now, a real change by somebody who knows what he's doing.
<Willie Geist> <Positive> Donald, I understand what you're saying there, but what do you do when you get to Cleveland without a majority of the delegates? Do you have a plan, and what does that look like?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. Hey, Willie, Willie, I will just do my best. Look, I'm going to have more votes than anybody else, I brought millions and millions of people into the Republican Party in a short period of time. The only one that's going to beat Hillary Clinton is me, because New York will be in play, Michigan will be in play, great states will be in play that none of these people, like a guy like Marco Rubio, you know, this guy doesn't even show up to vote in the Senate. You know, he's ridiculous. He doesn't even show up to vote.
<Willie Geist> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He has defrauded the people of Florida. The guy doesn't show up to vote.
<Willie Geist> <Positive> Right.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> So, so Donald -- but -- Donald -- yeah...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I don't know what he's doing. Here is the point, the point is, I brought millions of people into a party, all of those people whether I do independent or not, Joe, and Willie, all of those people are going to leave the party, they're going to get back and they're to go back to where they came from.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So, Donald, let me ask you this, Donald, because I think this is really the question of the hour. There are many people predicting that you are going to win the nomination, I think personally you probably are going to wrap it up for the most part after you win in Florida on March the 15th. Let's say you wrap it up for the most part on March the 15th. What do you do to bring the Republican Party together? Do you call Paul Ryan and say, hey, I know you don't like me, but could I come and fly to Washington and sit down with you in your office? Do you call Haley Barbour and go, Haley Will you -- will you reach out to these people who are saying -- I understand.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have no problem doing it.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> They're saying some very nasty things about you, but can you reach out and bury the hatchet and say, Let's go together as one party?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Joe, I would have no problem doing it at all, but here is the problem, I have not been recognized for having done something that nobody has ever done before. We have a party that's stagnant and dying, we have a party that's...
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All you have to do is ask Mitt Romney. No -- he -- millions of Republicans -- I'm not talking about independents and Democrats, which I'm getting -- I'm getting independents -- millions of Republicans didn't show up last time to vote.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> I understand that, Donald, and they understand that. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am seeing ad, after ad, after ad put in by the establishment.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> I understand.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Knocking the hell out of me and it's really unfair, I want to tell you something. But if I leave, if I go, regardless of independent, which I may do, I mean, may or may not, but if I go, I will tell you these millions of people that joined, they've told them, they're all coming with me. They're going...
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> But Donald, you're missing the point. This is what happens in politics, people try to kill you and then they come together at the end.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, I know that. I have no problem with that, Joe.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> I'm asking are you capable after you beat them going to them humbly and say, OK
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have no problem with that and actually at Mar-a-Lago, when I made the speech the other night, you know, I guess you call it a victory speech because I won by far more than anybody else, after I did that, everybody was saying they really liked the tone and I said I'm a unifier. I actually am a unifier, believe it or not. A lot of people find that hard to believe, but I will bring people together. I've always brought people together.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've always gotten along with people. You would understand that, Mika would understand that. I get along with people. Now, I'm being hit from 19 different angles right now, so you have to fight, but ultimately I get along with people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, if the time comes and when and if, or who knows what's going to happen, but I will be able to get along. And we will have a much bigger party, we will have a much more inclusive party. You know, the people that are joining are people from everywhere. It's an amazing and beautiful thing, but they're joining for me, Joe, they're not joining for Marco Rubio and they're not joining for other people, they're joining for me.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Donald Trump.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Thank you very much for coming on the show this morning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK. Thank you very much.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right.
