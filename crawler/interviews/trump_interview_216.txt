<Sarah Westwood> <Neutral> I don't know if you've heard, but the first 100 days are coming up. Big milestone, you might not have heard.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I heard that, I heard that. Yeah, no that's good. I mean, I guess it's an indication of certain things. But, I think we've created some amazing, we've done some amazing things, and I think we've set some incredible foundations going onward, with relationships, with other countries, et cetera, et cetera.
<Sarah Westwood> <Positive> So obviously, a lot has changed in this country and around the world since you took office. Have you changed your thinking on any particular issue, maybe like DACA, based on what you've learned on the job?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I always understood that with DACA, we need special heart. We need to understand the Ñ we have to understand the other side of that equation, and I do understand that side, and I am somebody with a lot of heart and you know, you've heard what I said. Just, relax and let's let it all play out. Because I think everyone's going to be happy in the end. I will say that we're doing an amazing job at the border, and we're going to need the help of the wall, because we want to stop human trafficking, we want to stop drugs, we want to stop so many other things that the wall could be so helpful with.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, you know, the Democrats, many of them, and most of them, including President Obama, including Schumer, including a lot of people, you know, they approved the 2006 version of the wall, and they understand it's a good thing, but they feel that politically, they want to fight. And that's OK, I think we're gonna Ñ we will build the wall. The wall will be built. It has to be built if we're going to continue this incredible job we're doing on national security and at the border. But, a lot of good things are happening. Really good things. We're very proud of the job we've done.
<Sarah Westwood> <Negative> So early in your presidency we heard a lot about these anti-Trump, Obama holdovers that the administration blamed in part for obstructing the agenda. Do you still have concerns that there are those officials in the government?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sure, we have some. Many have Ñ many are now gone. And, you know, there are some cases where like people are saying, we're being obstructed by the Democrats, very much so. And also, we don't need so many people coming to work. You know, one of the things Ñ I don't know if you say this, Sean Ñ but when they say about putting people in, there are so many jobs in Washington, we don't want so many jobs. You don't need all of those people. And even me, I look at staffing, and I look at the numbers of people, and many of the people that they complain don't have, you know, where certain positions aren't filled, in many cases, you don't need those positions to be filled.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, a good example is Rex over at State Ñ got so many people, and he likes to do things himself, and he likes to take meetings himself, he doesn't necessarily need the kind of numbers that you're talking about. And it's also because of the total obstruction of having people going in. It's very, very sad to see. You'd think the Democrats would help because they want to see this, you know, move along nicely, but you've seen how long it took to get your various Cabinet positions filled. It's a record, it was a record. So they have one power, and that's the power to obstruct, and they're using it to the maximum, whether it's a Supreme Court judge or whether it's Cabinet members or whether it's people to fill seats but we don't want to Ñ or fill vacancies. But we don't want to fill all of the vacancies, we won't fill all of the vacancies. We don't need so many of these people.
<Sarah Westwood> <Negative> But you've lifted the federal hiring freeze. Do you plan on re-implementing that at any point in the future?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, at the right time. But we're going to have an economy Ñ you know, the numbers just came out on the GDP for last year which were abysmal. 1.6 percent. Which is the lowest in five years. And, you know, if China does 7 percent, they consider it terrible. You have big countries in this world, major countries in this world, if they do 7, 8 or 9 percent they're not very happy, and here we are, we're a country at one percent and people don't even write about it. I mean, we're going Ñ this country is going Ñ we have such great potential. We have such tremendous potential.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But when you look at the GDP numbers, to me, that's a big story, because that means that we're essentially, you know, that's after, that's the lowest in five years. And five years ago was a very bad time, a very bad time. So we're going to have a very big day today, I think you're going to see, you'll be there? 1 o'clock, is it 1 o'clock, Sean?
<Sean Spicer> <Neutral> 1:30, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> At 1:30, with the tax proposal. I think you're going to find it very good.
<Sarah Westwood> <Negative> So in the first 100 days, federal judges have prevented some of your policies from moving forward. And you're not the only Republican to be critical of the ideological bent of the 9th Circuit. Have you considered the proposals that are out there to break up the 9th Circuit?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Absolutely I have. There are many people that want to break up the 9th Circuit. It's outrageous. And you know, you talk about judge shopping Ñ you saw today I mentioned that?
<Sarah Westwood> <Neutral> I did see.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you see judge shopping, or what's gone on with these people, they immediately run to the 9th Circuit. It's got close to an 80 percent reversal period, and what's going on in the 9th Circuit is a shame. And hopefully, they will, in the 9th Circuit, do what's right both on the ban and Ñ you know we had the ban?
<Sarah Westwood> <Negative> Mm-hm.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everybody immediately runs to the 9th Circuit. And we have a big country. We have lots of other locations. But they immediately run to the 9th Circuit. Because they know that's like, semi-automatic. And it's very, very sad to see it happening. And the language could not be any clearer. I mean, the language on the ban, it reads so easy that a reasonably good student in the first grade will fully understand it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they don't even mention the words in their rejection on the ban. And the same thing with this. I mean, when you have people that are being enabled to commit crime. And in San Francisco, when you look at Kate Steinle, being shot and here is the court, you know, right in that same general area. But when you look at a Kate Steinle, when you look at so many other things. No, sanctuary cities have been very, very dangerous, very, very bad. And, you know, we've done a great job on law enforcement, we've done a great job at the border. And all of our most talented people say sanctuary cities are a disaster.
<Sarah Westwood> <Neutral> And so Ñ
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In terms of safety.
<Sarah Westwood> <Positive> Right. And one thing we've heard a lot about in these first 100 days, it's these dissenting voices that you like to have around you, that you like to be able to get a variety of opinions.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do like that, yes. Well, I mean, it's great when everybody can agree. Then you think something's so good that it can Ñ no, but I like having dissent. If it's a close topic. [Crosstalk]
<Sarah Westwood> <Neutral> But one close topic Ñ sorry sir Ñ is the Paris Climate Accords. We've been hearing different things from inside your administration. Scott Pruitt wants to pull out, Secretary Tillerson would like to stay in, Secretary Perry would like to renegotiate it. But ultimately yours is the only opinion that matters, so Ñ
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true. Well, I've heard them all. And you're right, you have all three: you have pull out, renegotiate, stay in. But the one thing everybody agrees to is that we are being, as usual, we are paying an inordinate share beyond any bounds of reasonableness, and other countries are not. We got taken to the cleaners financially. So we're going to be making a decision, I would say, over the next two weeks on that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But when we're paying massive amounts of money and other major countries are paying nothing, and when we're agreeing to do certain things and other major countries are not agreeing to do those things, then it becomes unfair, and it becomes bad for our companies and becomes bad for us competitively, and I don't want to see that happen either, You know, I'm a big believer in the environment. And I'm a tremendous believer in clean water, clean air, and I've won environmental awards. But it also has to be fair. It can't put you at an economic disadvantage, or a disadvantage in other ways.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I'll be making a decision Ñ we're going to have meetings on that, actually, next week Ñ and I'll be making a decision on that very soon. But the one thing all of the groups that you mentioned Ñ and I do, I have all three groups Ñ the one thing all of those groups do agree on is that we are paying disproportionately by a factor that's so high that it's not comprehensible.
<Sarah Westwood> <Negative> So I have to ask: 96, 97 days into your presidency, the Russia collusion story Ñ it hasn't gone away. Why do you think it's stuck around?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Russia is a faux story. It's made up. It is, you know, nobody asks Hillary Clinton why her husband was over making speeches in Russia. Nobody asks John Podesta about the company that he has with his brother in Russia. Nobody asks John Podesta why he didn't let the FBI look at his server, why did they hire another company to look at the server. And somebody had mentioned Ñ and this may be incorrect Ñ a company that's owned by somebody from the Ukraine. You've heard that, I assume you've heard that? But John Podesta and his brother, why aren't they asking about that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Russia story is a faux story. And it started, really, before the election was over, before November 8th. And it was at a very low level, and it never picked up any steam until after the election because the Democrats are using that faux Ñ or fake Ñ Russia story in order to make themselves feel better for losing an election that's very hard for a Democrat to lose. Because it's very hard for Democrats to lose in the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a very, very hard thing for the Republicans to win because you have to run all the way up the East Coast.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have to win Florida, you have to win South Carolina, North Carolina, you have to win Pennsylvania, you have to win all the way up, and then you have to win in the Midwest and you have to win places that Ñ you know you win Michigan, you win Wisconsin, you win Ohio and Iowa. Because they start off with such a tremendous advantage that it's very very hard for a Republican to win. So they lost an election, and they use the Russia story as a way Ñ as best they can Ñ as a way of justifying how they lost the election. It's a fake story. The fake media keeps putting it on. The same media, it's all the same media, that keep putting it on. And frankly, they should be ashamed of themselves.
<Sarah Westwood> <Negative> Well as the custodian of the information that will exonerate your team in the end, why isn't there an effort to just get that out there and get this over with?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I think we have. We've given everything we can to the committees and the committees can come in and see whatever they want. And we look forward to the reports. And nobody said I was involved in any form and nobody said we're Ñ in fact, I've actually seen many people, almost everybody, in fact even people that are very anti-Trump, said there is no evidence.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And there isn't. And the reason there's no evidence [is] because it's a faux story. It's a fake story that was made up as a justification for how the Democrats, it's really an excuse for how the Democrats lost an election that should have never been lost because they should never lose the Electoral College. That's all that story is. It's a fake story.
<Sarah Westwood> <Negative> So on healthcare, you have said you want to lower premiums.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sarah Westwood> <Neutral> You want to maintain coverage levels.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sarah Westwood> <Positive> You want to increase consumer choice.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sarah Westwood> <Neutral> But you want to spend less taxpayer money on healthcare.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sarah Westwood> <Negative> Some of those are a little conflicting.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No Ñ
<Sarah Westwood> <Negative> Ñ and it's difficult to get those all simultaneously. So at the end of the day, what's your biggest priority?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, well all of those things. I think we're gonna do all of those things. And I think we're very close to getting healthcare. And I never stopped, it wasn't like phase one, phase two. Don't forget, Obamacare took 17 months to get, and it's a disaster. And without subsidy, you know, without my paying the insurance companies a fortune, which frankly has to be approved by Congress Ñ what Obama was doing was illegal, because as you know the court decision said you have to get it approved by Congress.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He signed without going to Congress, so without going to Congress, Obamacare is gone. Premiums have gone through the roof, they've skyrocketed. It's a disaster. We started, two months ago, really started Ñ focused Ñ two months ago on healthcare. And I think we're very close. I don't know that we'll do it over the next two days, but I think we're very close.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Republicans have really come together and the reason that they've come together, and a lot of them for different reasons, because you have a pretty big sphere of Republicans, but they're all good people. Some want to see the lower premiums, some want to see just better healthcare, it's different people feeling different ways. I'm one of the ones that wants to see great healthcare at a much lower price.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we're going to have great competition, which you don't have right now. I mean, you have the insurance companies Ñ I was in Tennessee, the insurance companies pulled out of half the state, the other half they're going to lose very soon. That means they have no insurance companies. Kentucky was a disaster, where the insurance companies are on their last legs in terms of staying. They're going to leave. And so many other places. So you really don't have Obamacare, because you have insurance companies that are all pulling out. So when people talk about Obamacare, it's really fiction.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The other thing is that, when you talk about the billions and billions and dollars that we have to pour into insurance companies in order to keep it alive, well that money has to be approved by Congress. It was never approved. I mean, you could make the case that Obamacare was never approved, because this money was never, it was never approved to be paid. It has to be approved by Congress. You understand what I mean by that?
<Sarah Westwood> <Negative> I do, and that leads me to my next question: Are you going to withhold those cost-sharing reduction payments or maybe put a bill forward in Congress to legislate that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well what I want to do is, I want to see what happens with our bill first. Because we're going to have great healthcare at a lower cost. We're going to have premiums coming down, and they'll really start tumbling down in two years, they will start tumbling, because the insurance companies will be so competitive. And you'll have health plans, you'll have healthcare plans, that you've never even Ñ I know a lot about healthcare, you know a lot about healthcare, they'll come up with plans that you've never even heard about that will be so good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They'll have a lot of competition, they'll have a lot of new ideas that people don't even think about today. And it'll be a beautiful thing. So I really have to see what happens over the next couple of days or maybe weeks with respect to our plan before I make that decision.
<Sarah Westwood> <Positive> This is an obligatory question, but if you had to give yourself a grade on your first 100 days, like in school, what grade do you give yourself?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well you know, I just had the meeting, Antiquities, you saw that?
<Sarah Westwood> <Positive> I did see it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Freed up 135 million acres.
<Sarah Westwood> <Positive> Bears Ears, yes sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right? The Bears Ears. That's one of the things we did today, it's incredible for a certain part of the country. So I think the thing that's interesting is that, and really important: I've passed a lot of legislative bills that people don't even know about. Whether it's the VA and choice and whether it's a lot of different things, a lot of bills we've passed, including relating to the Internet, so we believe we'll have 32 legislative Ñ this is not executive orders Ñ this is legislative bills passed. And nobody knew that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've said to reporters, some of whom are very anti-Trump, or conservative, or however you want to call it, that we've passed 28 and we think we'll have 32 by the time Saturday rolls around. And again, that's a standard that's really an artificial standard, the whole 100 day thing. Because I think what I've done best is set foundations for the future, including with foreign countries, including with China and Japan and many, many countries that we have great relationships with.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think we have some incredible foundations that have been built over the last Ñ Germany Ñ a lot of great foundations Ñ the U.K. But we've passed 28 legislative bills and that'll be 32 by the time Saturday night rolls along. And nobody had any idea. They had no idea. They said I passed Ñ I saw on one of the networks that covers us extremely incorrectly and unfairly, they actually said none. And I'm not even sure they knew.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think they knew. I don't think they did it to be vicious, I just don't think they knew. So we've got from 28 to 32 legislative bills that have been signed by me and passed. That probably even surprises you, when you hear that number. Then on top of that we've done the executive orders, we've freed up the economy, the work on regulation is unprecedented, what we've done on regulation. And I will tell you on legislative Ñ which people said, 'oh well he's done nothing legislatively,' they didn't know, because we didn't make a big deal out of it, but we've done a great job. Not since Harry Truman has anybody done so much. That's a long time ago.
<Sarah Westwood> <Positive> Yes. That's quite a long time ago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then of course you always have what I think will go down as one of the great choices in history on the Supreme Court of the United States, Justice Gorsuch. We didn't just nominate him, we had him approved. And that was Ñ I thought we were in our own category, but that also took place in 1881. 1881, that happened also within the first 100 days. But you know, I mean there's never really been anything like this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I think we've done more than perhaps any president in the first 100 days. But I don't want to set the 100 days as a standard Ñ I think even more importantly, I think that we've established foundations for the next, almost eight years.
<Sarah Westwood> <Neutral> So is that an A, then? Or a B?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd give us an A. I would say communication would be a little bit less than an A because I don't think we've gotten the word out what we've done because I think we're so busy getting it done that we're not talking about it. But I would give the administration, on the big picture, an A. I would say we haven't communicated the word out, so I'd give us a little bit less than that, but one of the reasons we haven't done that is, we're too busy working.
<Sarah Westwood> <Neutral> You hear that, Sean? You got a B.
<Sean Spicer> <Neutral> I heard.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, Sean's doing great. Look, Sean is being attacked viciously by people because, you know, that's Ñ if Sean were a liberal Democrat, they'd be saying he's the greatest person ever to live. But Sean's doing a good job, excellent job. And Sean would agree with me. I think a lot of the media doesn't want us to get the word out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I've seen Sean say things that were so perfectly stated, and then the next day I'll read about it or I'll see it on television, and I'll say, "that's not the same man that said Ñ are they watching Ñ " I actually would tell people: "Are you watching the same conference or the same Sean that I watched?" Because I've seen it perfectly stated, you cannot do it any better, and when it's written or on television, it's totally different. So I think Sean's done a really good job, Really great job.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Welcome back. Well, it was quite a debate last night as Ron Burgundy might have said, that escalated quickly. My next guest, Donald Trump, he wants to rebound from the Iowa loss and take New Hampshire to hang on to his front-runner status.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who is coming in second and maybe first...
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You tell me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think I need it.  I hope that I get it.  I'm doing well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a great relationship with the people of New Hampshire.  I've been here long before politics.  I have many friends that live up here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's an incredible area, beautiful area. I would say that I would like to win, but I don't know that it's necessary. When you say, you know, the Iowa -- I came in second out of originally 17 people, there are those that say I actually came in first depending on how you want to count the votes to be honest, because that was a horrible thing that took place. But I was very proud of Iowa. And I've never done it before.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Do you not accept the Iowa results? Do you think they're illegitimate?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think what happened was very unfortunately. I think it was unfair to Ben. And in a certain way it was unfair to me. It affected me the same way as it affected Ben, because a lot of votes were added on. I mean, a tremendous number of votes were added on. And I was a strong second. But I'm not thinking about Iowa, I'm thinking about New Hampshire. I don't care about it anymore.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> I can't help but notice that you're a little humbled by what happened in Iowa, is that fair to say?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't think in terms of it. You know, I worked hard there. I really liked Iowa. I like the people of Iowa. The caucus system is a very complex system. And a lot of things can go off with a caucus system. I like this system much better in New Hampshire where you go out, you like somebody, you vote. And you can have a ground game and all, but the ground game in Iowa is very important whereas the ground game here is different.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Are you looking at your campaign and saying, you know what, maybe I need to do some more traditional things in addition to the nontraditional stuff that's been successful.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That is true. And I think that you'll see it here. Very important was that we get through the debate. Because I didn't want to have a bad debate or even a modest debate. And I think we did very well in the debate according to all...
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Because you know some of your Iowa staff has said, boy, we could have used more resources here. We could have used a lot more there. Are they right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, they're totally wrong. I gave them unlimited money. I said do what you have to do. I gave them unlimited money. Hey, look, I'm $50 million under budget. I thought by this time I'd have $40 million to $50 million spent and I've spent very little because I haven't had to because people like you put me on all the time. What do I take a commercial for, right?
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Oh, there you go.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I really thought I'd be up to about $45 million or $50 million. And, you know, I'm not. I look at somebody like Jeb Bush who has spent over $100 million and he's nowhere and I say how does that happen?
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Let's talk about last night's debate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would bring back waterboarding and I would bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> [End Video] Okay. What's the worse?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you didn't see what I said before that. What I said before that was in the Middle East you have people chopping other other people's heads. This hasn't happened since Medieval times. There's never been anything like this. And I talked about that.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> I understand that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then I said, by the way, waterboarding is peanuts compared to what we're talking about happening there. So I said I would absolutely approve waterboarding and I would go a lot further than that.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> What does that mean? What is a lot further?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not going to define it to you on this program, but I would be very much in favor of going beyond waterboarding. And believe me, in terms of getting information, it works.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> don't you worry though, look, we're the United States, we set an example. We're supposed to be better than that. We're supposed to be -- as much as, look, we're looking at the Medieval...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sure.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> We don't do those things.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Medieval times.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> We don't want to be barbaric. They want to be barbaric, we're not barbaric.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK, they can do it, but we can't. Look, when they fly planes into the World Trade Center kill thousands of people and many, many other things -- you see what's happening all over the world, whether it's Paris or here or anywhere else, you can do waterboarding and you can go a step beyond waterboarding, it wouldn't bother me even a little bit.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Another part of the debate had to do with health care. And, look, you've been hit on this. It is unclear to me, though, you want more government -- you want some sort of government system on health care.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> You don't like the system that's in there now. That I understand. but describe...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But not single-payer...
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Describe the system you want.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me explain.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> First of all, what I'd do, I have a massive company, I have thousands and thousands of employees.  And I have in many different states.  You have artificial lines around each state.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know why? Because the insurance company taking care of the politicians so they don't want to get rid of the lines.  If you get rid of those lines, you would have great private insurance and it would take care of most people.  It would be an unbelievable thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In addition to that, you can have a savings -- you know, you can do the savings situation where you would have health care savings accounts and it would be fantastic. There's to many things you could do. The problem is the insurance companies don't want to do these things and they don't want to specifically get rid of the lines because they'd rather have a monopoly in New York, as an example, then let 50 companies come in and bid, companies from Iowa, companies from New Hampshire.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> But you're going to have to structure a government program to deal with this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no. Here's what you do. So, you're going to have a great system, but there will be people left that don't have any money. And what I said last night is I don't want people dying in the middle of the street. It's not going to happen if I'm president, okay. This isn't single-payer. This is using our hospitals to take care of people, you work them out, you reimburse the hospital because we will get...
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You will expand Medicaid?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You can do it through Medicaid.  You can do it through some otherway, but I'm just saying very simple -- and this has nothing to do with single.  This has to do with humanity.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This has to do with having a heart.  We can have unbelievable insurance at a much lower cost.  You know, I don't know if you know, Obamacare is going up 35, 45, 55 percent, the premiums are through the roof, in '17 it collapses.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're going to have people -- you're going to have great plans, but you're going to have people that won't be able to afford even 10 cents. We cannot let them die on the streets, Chuck. And we're going to take care of them. Whether it's Medicaid, or you're going to work out some kind of a deal with hospitals to take care of these people. But if I'm president, people aren't going to be dying in the streets.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Let me go, there was a tough piece this week in The Washington Post implying that your campaign and you individually are tougher on women correspondents, women anchors, women reporters than men. It was in The Post.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think I've been tougher on you than any human being on Earth in terms of reporter.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> I think my wife believes that, too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, honestly, I've tougher on you than anybody.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> I've heard these whispers before. There's a perception out there. How do you get rid of the perception? Perhaps it's the Megyn Kelly situation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hey, look, she gave me a really phony question. It was a setup question. It wasn't even a question, it was a statement. It was inappropriate. And I hit her hard. And I think that's fine. But if you gave me that question, I'd hit you the same way. I mean, you are the perfect one -- you have been, you know, under fire from me for a long time. And you are far from a woman.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Well, that is a fact. Thanks.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I never even heard this. I haven't seen the report.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> You haven't seen the report.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I haven't seen it. I mean, I get so much publicity I don't get to read everything unfortunately. But this was in The Washington Post?
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> It was in The Washington Post.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's totally. Look, I think there are some women -- there's one sitting right over there in the beautiful red dress, do you see that woman over there? I have great respect for that woman. I don't know if she knows that I'm talking about her. I'm talking about you. I would never do that to you.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> I believe he is referring to Andrea Mitchell.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am referring to Andrea.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> I want to ask about one final thing here. I know we're running out of time. In 1999 when you talked about running for president, you hinted that it may be easier to pledge being a one-term president because you'd take the politics out of the second term. Do you still feel that way?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think there are certain advantages but if you're doing a great job -- I've seen people do that and then want to go further and do more -- and good people and they never win, because they said one term and it's a real negative.  So, I don't want to say that but there are certain advantages to it.  But if we're doing great and if the people like me, if I was lucky enough to win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, my whole thing is make America great again.  We're going to make America great again.  We're going to make our military strong, we're going to take care of our vets, we're going to have strong borders, we will have the wall.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, so many different things, health care we're going to take care of, we're going to get rid of Obamacare. We're going to have great plans for much less money. We're going to make America great again. I will tell you if we're doing a great job, we'll keep going. And if we're not, you know, we have automatic termination. It's called the voters will terminate. But that won't happen.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> So you're not doing a one-term pledge?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I'm not going to do a one-term pledge, no. If I'm doing a good job I'll keep going.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Donald Trump, I have to leave it there. We'll see you in South Carolina.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Donald, I suppose we should start with the big news. You had a little house sale.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I did. I sold a house for a lot of money in Palm Beach, Florida, but I'm not sure that I could have done it today. This was about a month ago, and the Russian stock market has crashed and it happened to be a Russian that bought the house. So who knows what would have happened? But Palm Beach, it's certainly a great place, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Donald, what happened? The market is in such upheaval. What caused this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you can say a lot of different things. And obviously, greed, obviously dishonesty, obviously you'd have to add the fast that there was hubris. People really have enthusiasm for doing deals and wanting to do deals, and they went overboard. And that includes everybody, including middle-income people that wanted to buy a house that was beyond their means.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it really was everybody, and it's absolutely a mess, probably the worst since 1929, the Great Depression.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Have we seen the worst, or are you a little bit nervous that it could get grimmer?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it can get worse, and then it will get better. It always gets worse and it always better. It never, ever changes. If you look at a chart for the last 100 years, it goes up, it goes down. So you never know. Now, you'd like to be able to predict the bottom so you can go out there and buy whatever you have to buy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But that's awfully tough to do. It depends. It depends on the decisions the politicians are going to be making. And, honestly, lately I think they've done some pretty good things. I think it was important that they saved AIG, and I also think they made a great deal, because they got 80 percent of a great company.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They bought essentially 80 percent of a great company. But we'll see what happens with their new round of whatever they're doing today. Nobody really knows exactly what it is or what it means.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> What do you make of Senator McCain saying that if he were president he would fire Christopher Cox, who is head of the SEC?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's certainly a strong statement, and I guess he's saying that he wants tighter regulation. But a lot of people like Christopher Cox and I think he's done a very good job. But certainly it was a very strong statement today by Senator McCain, who's a very talented guy.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> You say he's a talented guy. You have now formally endorsed him. I know that last spring that you stayed a little bit out of it, and you donated some money to Senator Clinton. But now have you gone "On the Record" that Senator John McCain is your guy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have. And I've known him for a long time, and I've known Hillary for a long time. But I don't have to make that choice any longer. I was amazed that she wasn't chosen as the vice-presidential candidate. I think things might have been a lot different for Obama. Right now it's a very close race, and I even have seen some polls where McCain is leading.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I've known Senator McCain for a long time. He's a great guy, a great man. He's just a very strong guy, a very strong leader, and he's very, very smart.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Are you endorsing him because you've known him for a long time, or is it -- tell me the difference between Senator Obama and Senator McCain in your eyes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I can tell you one of the differences is that Senator Obama wants to raise taxes beyond belief, and senator McCain doesn't. And in a fragile economy like we're in right now, you cannot go around raising corporate taxes and lots of other taxes. You just can't do it. Then you really will see the great depression.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> But when we talk about taxes, you're a rich guy Donald. You just sold a house for an enormous amount of money. You're one of the richest guys. Senator Obama says he's not going to raise taxes on the people who aren't rich.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what I find? I find when people say that, and yet they're raising the taxes on the rich, they ends up raising the taxes on everybody. And ultimately, that's what would happen. Whereas John McCain is not going to be raising taxes and could even be lowering taxes. And frankly, that's the language I like to hear, because the economy is very weak, it's very fragile.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And any talk of tax increases, it's over, it's going to be over. So I endorsed John McCain. I've known him for a long time. He's a brilliant guy, and I think he'll be a great president.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Why do you think Senator Obama did not pick Senator Clinton as his running mates? And I don't mean to take from Senator Biden.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't want to take from Senator Biden either, because he's a good man and he's a good guy, from what everyone tells me, although I don't know him. But he ran for office, and when he ran for office he got very few votes. He got less than one percent of the vote. And Hillary Clinton ran for office, and she probably got more than 50 percent of the vote.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it's a little bit of a strange situation how, she didn't get the nomination to start off with. But she ran and she got at least 50 percent of the vote. So you would have certainly thought that he would have picked Hillary Clinton, and I think it would be much different poll numbers. Right now the polls are even, and in some polls, I guess McCain is leading.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think if you chose Hillary Clinton you might not have that. But he decided not to do that.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Why not? What's your theory?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I guess he didn't get along with her. I guess he didn't like her. I guess he felt uncomfortable with her and Bill. And I can tell you- I know both of them, and they're fantastic people, fantastic people, and they've already proven to be good team players. Because she took a lot of abuse, in my opinion. I think she was pretty badly abused in that campaign.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> What about Senator McCain's choice of Governor Palin? She has certainly lit two sides on fire. She's got her incredible supporters, people rallying around her, and she's got a lot of people coming out of the woodwork who are not her fans.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it was brilliant, and I think it is a great testament to him. He took a chance on somebody, and it's been amazing, the response. I don't think I've seen a response like this that people have to her -- some negative, but mostly positive. And she's just amazing. And she has totally united the Republican Party like I've never seen before.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was a brilliant choice, and I think she'll be fantastic.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> One final question. Where will you watch the returns on election night?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll probably be sitting right in my apartment in New York watching, because -- I know I've been invited by a lot of folks, including you, but there's something very beautiful about sitting down and watching those returns I'm going to be a very, very interesting election.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I guess I should ask one other question. Where will you be watching, what network?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll only be watching you.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> You're the best, thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's no question. Is there even a question about that?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> Well, I hope not, but I did have to push for that one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's OK.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> It was a little rough trying to get that answer.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's OK. No, FOX is terrific. All my friends, including Roger Ailes -- there's nobody like them.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> Thank you, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Have a good time.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> So what will it take to turn the economy around? Businessman extraordinaire Donald Trump joins us by phone. Nice to talk to you, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hello, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, Donald, rather grim news, the GDP 2.2 percent. We had hoped that it would be faster -- expected that it would be greater, rather. Your thoughts on the 2.2 percent GDP report?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, Rush is 100 percent right. I mean, the fact is, the report was very bad. The economy's not doing well. If you look at other economies, they're doing unbelievably well. China's probably going to be close to 10 percent, the real number. And others are way, way up there. And a lot of that is at our expense because they're taking our jobs and they're manufacturing our products.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So you know, how can we have a good report when things are made for us in other countries?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, well, give me sort of a -- you know, a four or five-point policy change that you would make if you were president to sort of accelerate that GDP so it's more than 2.2. What would be the four or five things that you would do?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, we have to have an energy policy that makes sense. We have to let our people drill because it turns out that we have much more under our feet than we ever thought possible. And we have to get away from the grip of OPEC because OPEC is destroying us. OPEC is probably a worse abuser than China, if that's possible.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The other thing is you have to make deals with China where either they stop with the manipulation of their currency and making it impossible for our people and our companies to compete -- they're making it impossible, very intelligently for them, but not for us. And unless do you something about that -- and what you do is you say, If it doesn't stop immediately, we're dropping a 25 percent tax on your product.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And this is nothing to do with free trade or fair trade. This is all to do with common sense. You have to stop China from systematically taking us apart. And basically, you know, so many of the problems that we are talking about in this country, including Social Security and including Medicare and Medicaid and all of the costs that we can't afford -- you can afford them easily if the economy turned around.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The economy solves all problems.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You say that these are sort of common sense ideas. If they're common sense ideas, what is your theory as to why the president isn't doing it? Is it different ideology, he doesn't understand it, he has a different plan? What's your -- what's your response to why the president doesn't take what you say is common sense?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have no theory because it's impossible to figure. It's absolutely impossible. It's so simple, when you look at what's happening from outside and how other countries are just absolutely taking -- every country that does business with us takes advantages! We're like the big patsy that doesn't know how to defend.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And it's so often that you see where a country like, as an example, Colombia, the country of Colombia, a small -- they call them trading partner. They're going to make $4 billion. So often that you see this, and nobody does anything about it. You know, it used to be in the old days, when we really had a country that knew what they were doing, we were the big, smart one.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now we're like the dumb bully. And it's very, very sad.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. Dumb bully now. What are the -- just as a frame of reference, what were the old days when we were doing so well? Do you have a sort of a time when you...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, you don't have to go back too far. You can go back to Reagan, when we were respected. I mean, you look at what happened during the Reagan years and how he really did turn things around. And taxes were very high, and they brought them down very substantially and then really got them down. And I would think that the country during that period of time was just highly respected.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And that seems to be a zenith, relatively speaking, in the modern age. I guess you'd call that the modern age. And I think that was a good period of time for this country.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, now, you have a huge business empire. I realize it's not as big as the federal government. But I'm curious. If I worked within your huge business empire, is there a way I could have slipped past you spending about $820,000 on a lavish party? Or are there accounting and auditing done internally so that this $820,000 that was spent by the GSA is just so irresponsible by our government.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Could I slip it past you if I worked for you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I'll tell you something. The GSA -- we've had some experience with the GSA. We found them to be very, very responsible and very professional, to be honest. And you know, when we cut a ribbon, like we cut a ribbon recently in Toronto, we cut a ribbon in Hawaii -- you cut ribbons for buildings. And people do go to those things and they do have parties.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So I'm not looking to be the defendant -- you know, the -- the -- - or come to the defense of anybody, but you do on occasion have to go and travel. And if GSA has property or if their top people have property and they're responsible for it, people do go and cut ribbons and do things and they do spend money on parties like that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Yes, but you know what, Donald? I don't have any problem with you spending your dime, your private dime going to the party, your private done to do the ribbon cutting or even in the case -- let's take the hypothetical -- let's take the case where the GSA went to Hawaii and took, like, a whole week to go cut a ribbon that took about an hour.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> They could very easily have outsourced that to a member of Congress who was making a trip home anyway, who could have -- who could be the sort of the stand-in for the GSA. So I totally disagree with you on this. This is the most extravagant waste of taxpayer money, so you and I...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I just know nothing about it. I mean, I do know, though, when I do open buildings and when I build a building and have -- we do have openings and we do have parties and we do celebrate the success of a job and all. And that does happen, though, Greta. We have to be fair to all sides, and that does happen.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, that's your -- that's you spending your dime. And like I said, I'm all for you spending your dime on this stuff, and maybe I'll even get invited to some of these parties, if I'm lucky. OK...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I'll do that. I would love to do that. You'll have a good time.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, let me go to your Twitter account. You -- your tweets today. One of is Admiral McRaven had full operational control of the bin laden mission. Barack Obama gave vague directions, is what you're sort of -- you're -- you're -- you've retweeted. What's your -- what are you tweeting about?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, look, when a decision is made, when a group of very, very talented generals or whoever it may be says, Listen, we have -- we have Usama bin Laden. We have him. One of two -- one of three things is going to happen. Leave him alone, go with a missile or go in and get him. Now, I think almost anybody would have made the decision to either go in and get him or go in with a missile, both of which would have been acceptable.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So I think a lot of credit is -- and that was basically an article that was written. And I think a lot of credit is being given -- and credit should be given to a certain extent, but anybody sitting in that office would have, I believe, made the same decision, meaning one of those two things.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Are you saying that the president doesn't get sort of the nod from the American people for making that decision, or he's getting too much credit? Is that what you're saying? Or you don't like that it's being used as -- you know, in politics as we approach 2012 election?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think anybody that was the president of the United States, when they're called by the generals or whoever happened to call, say, We have this man, he's sitting in this wonderful, beautiful -- I wouldn't say so beautiful -- but he's sitting in Pakistan with our so-called allies, where they're not telling us because they knew all about it -- and in fact, you could go and you could make the case, How are you president and you were paying billions and billions and billions of dollars a year to Pakistan and they don't tell us about it? But regardless of that, I think anybody sitting in the White House and they're approached by the generals that we have Usama bin laden, and we have him, he's there, that's it. Anybody would have made that decision.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, who would have said, Let's leave him alone? I don't think too many people would have done it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, and another tweet today which I found particularly intriguing is this one. I have never been a fan of John Edwards," referring to Senator John Edwards, former senator John Edwards, "but it's time for the government to focus on more important things." Are you becoming chairman of the John Edwards defense committee, I...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Not at all. I'm not a fan at all. I never liked him. I never trusted him. I always thought he was a sleazebag, frankly. But you know what? With all that's going on in this country, they're going out -- and this is a very, very tough trial, to start off with. And a lot of people are saying it's not a trial that the government's going to win.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But with all of that -- everything going on, with the money that is being -- just billions and trillions of dollars being thrown out the window, I really think we have better things to do. And frankly, a lot of people say, and a lot of very good lawyers have told me, that the government doesn't have a good case.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They're spending months and years on this case. And I am, again, not a fan. I don't believe him at all. But I hate to see resources wasted to this extent. His life is destroyed anyway, regardless. And I hate to see this kind of money and effort. We could put money and effort into something else that's a lot more productive.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, I'm certainly not a fan of Senator John Edwards. I'm a fan of trying to sort of keep the integrity of the system. And I am somewhat curious, since he is -- you know, this is such -- he's such an unlikable guy -- he's, you know, cheating on his wife -- she's dying of cancer and lying about a baby, that I wonder if -- you know, I do wonder if it's humanly possible for jurors to sit there and look only at the evidence, knowing in the back of their mind that he's such a cad.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And I wonder if sort of our personal opinions have so poisoned us to -- - away from looking coldly and dispassionately at the evidence, and fairly.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think despite what the lawyers are all saying, that it's not a very good case from the government, he may lose just because of what you just said. I mean, people are not thrilled with him. And they really tended to like the wife. I just -- I had a lot of respect for her. I met her once or twice, and I sort of had this respect for her.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I thought she was very strong, very solid. And you know, he was a bad guy in a lot of different ways. And he could take a case that really shouldn't be won, he could make them win it. So let's see what happens. But with all that's happening in this world and in this country, I just think that maybe they have better things to do.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Got any idea on the Secret Service, any thought?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think it shows great disrespect for the president. And I think it's really very sad. And it's hard to believe that this hasn't been going on for years and years, but it does show a great disrespect for the president of the United States.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, as always, thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you very much, Greta.
