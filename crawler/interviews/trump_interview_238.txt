<Time> <Negative> Donald Trump has had a difficult stretch, starting with convention drama in Cleveland and continuing through two rough weeks of damaging controversies. TIME interviewed him on Aug. 9, just hours before he seemed to suggest the only remedy to a Hillary Clinton-nominated Supreme Court was for Second Amendment supporters to take action. What follows is a transcript that has been edited for clarity and length.
<Time> <Negative> It's been a difficult stretch for your campaign over the last two weeks. What's going on in the polls?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Trump: Well, I think we're doing well. We have tremendous crowds. We have the same level of enthusiasm that we've had, if not more. Some of the polls are down a little bit. We have some polls that are not down very much. But I think we're moving along. I think we're doing fine.
<Time> <Negative> You had a couple of conversations with Reince Priebus last week. He was pretty direct with you about the state of the campaign, saying that you were running behind some key Senate races. It was reported to us that he issued what amounted to an ultimatum that they would potentially support Senate candidates over your campaign if the numbers didn't reverse themselves by September. Could you shed a little bit of light on this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Trump: He never said that. We never had a conversation about that. We are, we do very well together. We never had that conversation. Doesn't exist. And by the way, Reince Priebus is a terrific guy. He never said that. It was never stated. Why would they state that when I'm raising millions of dollars for them?
<Time> <Neutral> Going back to the polls, some showed you down six, seven, eight points nationally and in swing states by a similar margin. You won the primary, but the general election is obviously a very different electorate. What do you have to do differently?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Trump: Well, I'm running it differently than I did the primaries. I am listening to so-called experts to ease up the rhetoric, and so far, I'm liking the way I ran in the primaries better. I got more votes than anybody in the history of the primaries, I got 14 million votes and won most of the states. But I'm now listening to people that are telling me to be easier, to be nicer, be softer. That's OK, and I'm doing that. Personally, I don't know if that's what the country wants. When we're having heads chopped off in the Middle East, when things are happening that have never happened before in terms of the atrocities, in terms of giving $400 million in cash and all other things, I think maybe they want tougher rhetoric. They would like me to be a little bit different than I was in the primaries. And in the primaries, I broke the all-time record for votes.
<Time> <Negative> So do you intend to revert?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Trump: I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with anybody. I think I may do better the other way. They would like to see it be a little bit different, a little more modified. I don't like to modify. But that's what I've done. We'll see where it takes me.
<Time> <Negative> You've said that you intend to win black and Latino voters in the general election, but some of the surveys right now have you at less than 3% with African-American voters, about 20% with some Latino voters. How do you intend between now and Election Day to turn it around?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Trump: All I can do is tell the truth. That's all I can do. And we'll see what happens. All I can do is be honest and tell the truth. I'm looking to tell it like it is. I'm going to bring jobs back. We'll stop the illegal immigration. And all I want to do is be honest and be truthful. If that does it, that's great. And if that doesn't do it, that's fine too.
<Time> <Negative> Let me ask you about the debates. Secretary Clinton has just accepted an invitation to all three presidential debates scheduled by the commission. Can you also commit now to attending all three debates under the conditions negotiated by the commission?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Trump: Well, I haven't seen the conditions, I'll be seeing the conditions this afternoon or tomorrow, so I'll let you know then. But I want a debate very badly.
<Time> <Negative> Is there anyone that would be unacceptable to you as a moderator?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Trump: Well, I don't know. Who would be the moderators?
<Time> <Neutral> They haven't announced those yet.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Trump: I'll have to see who the moderators are. I would say that certain moderators would be unacceptable, absolutely. By the way, I will absolutely do three debates. I did very well in the debates on the primaries. So I look forward to the debates. I will demand fair moderators. I think the moderator has to be impartial and there's some people that aren't.
<Time> <Neutral> You mentioned you want to see the conditions. You've talked a lot about how you want to negotiate better deals. Is that something that you would like to reopen?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Trump: Well, I did it once before. I re-negotiated the debates in the primaries, remember? They were making a fortune on them and they had us in for three and a half hours and I said that's ridiculous. I said, you know, that's unacceptable. And they changed the whole format of the debate. I'm sure they'll be open to any suggestions I have, because I think they'll be very fair suggestions.
<Time> <Neutral> Just to follow on your speech in Detroit yesterday. You talked a lot about revitalization the manufacturing sector. Would you back a policy that requires U.S. companies or U.S. allies to buy American-made products?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Trump: I don't think we have to do that. I think we can do it in such a way that they'll want to buy American-made products. And that's a good thing. That's a better thing. You want to have a free market, and I believe in free market, but you want to have strength. And what we're doing now is we're being destroyed on foreign trade. And then at the same time, we lose a little less than $800 billion on trade. And we do things for other countries and they don't buy from us. But no, the answer is I like free markets. I want to make it so that people willingly want to buy from us.
<Time> <Neutral> Another follow-up on the speech yesterday. How would you address criticism of the plan that it would benefit disproportionately those at the higher incomes rather than the middle class?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Trump: No, it benefits corporations, and the middle class gets benefited, big league. But no, it doesn't, because we have a 12% tax rate. The middle class gets benefited very substantially. But the big beneficiaries are the jobs and what's happening with business. This is very good
<Time> <Negative> I wanted to ask about Russia. If Putin continues his provocations, should the U.S. provide lethal assistance to the Ukrainians?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Trump: First of all, I answered the question perfectly previously but only about 70% of the media covered it that way. When Obama is talking about Russia, and when he's talking about the Ukraine, it was under Obama, and his so-called tough stance, that Crimea went to the Ukraine. This wasn't under Trump. And so when I answered that question I said they've already got Crimea. But it was under Obama that Crimea was taken. And you know, so then he talks about me with Russia. Well, I don't think that would have happened if I were in his position.
<Time> <Neutral> So how would you â€“
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Trump: And of course, as you know, he reset the relationship with Russia. But it was under Obama's reign, under Obama's presidency, that Crimea went to Russia. And you know he's talking about toughness and he's talking about all of these different things, but you know, the Ukraine is having a lot of problems. But one of the problems is Crimea goes over to Russia during Obama's reign. So when Obama criticizes various policy of, let's say, of Trump, all I said was that was taken during Obama's time.
<Time> <Positive> You talk about the strategists and the wise people counseling you. Are you still having fun? You seem to want to return to the way things used to be during the primary.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Trump: I am having a good time. Again, you see the difference. Let's say between yesterday and go back into the rallies. I would say that I like the previous better. I can always revert to that if I want. It was more of an attacking style, which perhaps is a more natural style for me. There's always a chance that I will do that and can go back to that.
<Time> <Neutral> Given that you had success with that attacking style and you enjoy it more, why did you decide to make the switch?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Trump: I listen to people, despite what people say. I'm not sure if I agree with them. I'll let you know in a couple of weeks.
<Time> <Neutral> Do you feel you got yourself off-message in the last two weeks? Did you get yourself back on message yesterday?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Trump: I was hit hard during the Democrat convention. I think we had very successful Republican convention, frankly. But the one that goes last has a big advantage because it's the last. All they did was negative, negative, negative. So, you know that could have had an impact.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now I'm going to North Carolina. It's a packed house. There are people waiting outside. Nobody has that. When Hillary goes out, I look at her so-called rallies, she gets 250 people and there's empty seats all over the place. I may be wrong, but I think we're doing much better than anybody understands. And I said that after Wisconsin, when everyone said, well, that's the end of Trump, it looks like he lost. And I said to you, I don't feel it. So, we've had this conversation before and I actually feel more strongly now than I did then. We'll see. We're five points behind, or six points behind. That's not a lot.
<Time> <Neutral> Do you think the polls are getting your support wrong?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Trump: I think so. Some people get good crowds the last week of the campaign. I had about 18,000 people in Jacksonville, Florida, three days ago. And 4,000 or 5,000 walked away; they couldn't get in. In Daytona we had thousands of people. So, yeah, I think there's something out there. And I think the Clinton campaign understands that. They've spent $240 million on ads. I've spent nothing. Zero. Purposely. We've also raised a lot of money. We started in June and we did $51 million and people fell off their seat. And $27 [million] of it was small contributions, $61 dollars. No Republican's ever gotten that. And they said, 'that must be a blip, that won't happen, and that was a blip.' Except for one problem: in the next month we did $82 million, much of it in small donations. So I'm putting up millions of dollars and we're also raising millions of dollars for the RNC.
<Time> <Neutral> You mentioned not running television ads. When does that change?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Trump: I would say it'll change over the next couple of weeks. I've got a lot of cash.
<Time> <Neutral> Any particular states?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Trump: We'll pinpoint a little bit. But, mostly it's general. Mostly common sense, frankly.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> And I'm joined now by Donald Trump, the Republican front- runner. Mr. Trump, welcome back to the program to Meet the Press, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> [Begin Video] Let me just ask you, how did you make the deal to get Chris Christie to endorse you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it was just somebody that I really wanted.  I must tell you, I was going to leave a little time go by before I called him.  I did not call him; he called me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He saw what was happening.  He said, Donald, you have a movement going.  Like, Chuck, this afternoon, I think we have 25,000 people in Alabama.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We ended up moving to a football stadium because you couldn't hold -- I mean, what we have going is incredible. Yesterday in Arkansas, we had 15,000; we had 15,000 people in a hangar in Tennessee. It's amazing what's going on. And he said there's a movement going on and I'd like to be part of it. And I was very happy. I was getting ready to call him. But he called me and having Chris is a great honor.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Well, I tell you, he seems like a changed man when it comes to you. There was a time he wasn't such a believer. Let me play a few quotes. [Begin Video]
<Chris Christie> <Positive> He's been a very successful businessman. He has lots of talents. He has absolutely no ability in this area.
<Chris Christie> <Negative> But be very careful about candidates who stand up and say ban all Muslims from coming to the country. Ridiculous.
<Chris Christie> <Positive> It'll be a beautiful, wonderful wall. It'll be an incredible wall. The wall will be unbelievable.
<Chris Christie> <Negative> We're not picking an entertainer in chief. We're not casting a TV show.
<Chris Christie> <Neutral> I don't think it would be in the best interests of our party to have someone who I don't think would be an effective president to be the nominee.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> [End Video] Mr. Trump, as I can attest to, if any, anybody had said that, you would have unloaded on them on Twitter and sort of pulverized them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, I heard those comments and they were made in a rather low-key manner and they were made in smaller locations and they never got out very much.  So I never really had to go well.  But I did hear a little bit about them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But that's called welcome to the wonderful world of politics, I think.  You know, he's been a friend of mine.  He's been a really good guy and a good friend of mine for a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know, just having his endorsement's amazing. We went -- we did four stops between the last two days and he's introduced me and the place loves him, the people love him. He's tough. He's smart. And we just get along very well. So you know, but that's called politics, in all fairness, Chuck. I think you've heard about it before.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Fair enough. He certainly has been quite the opening act for you the last two days.
<Unidentified Male> <Positive> [Voice-Over] A federal court rules that Trump's company hired illegal immigrants to help the construction process for Trump Tower. He even paid a $1 million fine.
<Unidentified Male> <Neutral> And his new hotel in Washington: The Washington Post interviewed about 15 laborers at the D.C. hotel site, reporting that many revealed they had entered the U.S. illegally.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> [End Video] Basically the charge is this, Mr. Trump: you don't practice what you preach on immigration.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, well, it's wrong.  First of all, the one charge is from 35 years ago.  I think that's a pretty good record when people have to go 35 years back to find out about workers.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now as I remember it, those workers were hired by another company.  I just hired a company and they had some workers that were perhaps from Poland or some place.  And this was the demolition of a building that made way for Trump Tower.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So the workers, Chuck, were -- this is 35 years ago you're talking about.  By the way, the laws were totally different.  The laws were not what they are not, totally different.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> As far as one of the great hotels in the world that's currently being built on Pennsylvania Avenue, between the Capitol building and the White House, there were no illegals.  We do checks like you wouldn't believe.  And they didn't name any names.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They didn't give any information.  We are very, very careful.  We have an excellent contractor, one of the best in the country, works with me because we build them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I negotiate everything.  And that's why that job, by the way, is two years ahead of schedule and under budget.  And it's going to be one of the great hotels of the world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it's -- you know, I'm doing a good job. They know what they did when they got me and that's what happened.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Do you believe --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I don't -- they don't have any proof of any illegals.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Do you believe in eVerify?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They said they found a few --
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Do you use eVerify in everything you do when it comes to finding out the immigration --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, I have it. I have eVerify. Yes, I do. And I use eVerify in that building. And The Washington Post" mentioned that they spoke to people. There's no names. I read the story. It was from a few months ago. There were no names whatsoever. They have no proof. They have no evidence
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> All right. You were obviously Trump University came up. Let me ask you this, are there -- if Trump University was such a successful business, and the Trump -- I know you had to change the name because it wasn't a university -- why is --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Only in New York -- [Crosstalk]
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> -- why isn't it still a robust business?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, because we would open it again -- what happened is, first of all, you have to understand.  We had about 98 percent of the people that took the courses and proved the courses.  They thought it was great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They signed report cards and they said it was great.  Those people are suing that to get their money back because a law firm said, hey, listen, if I could get you the money back, what would you say? They would say, oh, great, get my money back.  That's great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But they signed these documents saying they rated the course; 98 percent approval rating and high marks.  Number two, we have an A from the Better Business Bureau.  And here's the only thing, Chuck.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I could settle the case.  But I don't want to settle the case.  The reason is I don't want to be held up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And once you settle cases, everybody sues you.  I don't want to be held up.  So I take the case.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The one where the attorney general, that was taken from these people, they made a campaign contribution to the attorney generals of New York, he met with President Obama in Syracuse, New York, in the following day or a day later, he ended -- he filed the case against me.  And that case has been largely won, although they're appealing, but that case has been largely won by me.  So it's very easy for me to settle these things, Chuck.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just don't choose to do it. It's not a big deal. It's a civil case. It's not a big deal. But we have history on the stand. We have a 98 percent approval rating and we have an A from the Better Business Bureau.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> I guess the question is, did anybody succeed?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, people did succeed --
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> -- using your way?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People did -- people did succeed and we have those people will be witnesses at the trial.  And the man that's doing that, I believe he signed a document saying that he thought Trump University was terrific in some form and that it was terrific.  So we'll have to find out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I haven't seen this commercial.  But the man that did that commercial, I think if you tell me his name or we'll find it.  But most of the people signed documents saying it was great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it'll be interesting. He made the statement. Let's see what he said about the school because I think he signed a document saying that the school was very good. But we'll find out. I have to do it quickly.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> You said something else about the judge yesterday. You said one of the judges -- you said, quote, I believe he happens to be Spanish
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because I think he's been very, very unfair with us. I think the judge has been extremely unfair. This is a case that many, many, many people said should have been thrown out on summary judgment. We have 98 percent approval --
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> And you think it's because he's Hispanic?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- an A from the Better Business Bureau. This is a case that should have been -- well, because of the wall and because of everything that's going on with Mexico and all of that, I think it's, frankly, this -- look, this is a judge who I believe has treated me very, very unfairly. This is a case that should have been thrown out a long time ago in the opinion of many great lawyers.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> And as you know, right now on Twitter, there is a trending retweet of yours. You retweeted somebody from @IlDuce2016, it was a Mussolini quote. But you didn't know it was Mussolini when you retweeted it, said, It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep." That's a famous Mussolini quote. You retweeted it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But what difference does it make, whether it's Mussolini or somebody else? It's certainly a very interesting quote. That's probably why I -- [Crosstalk]
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Mussolini is a known fascist.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- people can Twitter 14 million people --
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Do you want to be associated -- ?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a very interesting quote and people can talk about it.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Do you want to be associated with a fascist?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I want to be associated with interesting quotes. And people -- you know, I have almost 14 million people between Instagram and Facebook and Twitter and all of that. And we do interesting things. And I sent it out. And certainly -- hey, it got your attention, didn't it?
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Well, and it is trending on Twitter right now. [End Video] Mr. Trump, I have to leave it there. Stay safe on the trail. We'll see you Super Tuesday. Could be a big night for you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
