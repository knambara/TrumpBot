<Scott Hennen> <Positive> Here we are at the White House with the President of United States, Donald J. Trump, welcoming most of North Dakota today. Well, at least our national champion Bisons. Thank you for that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it was an honor and I'll tell you, that's a great team. And, I just met some very large people, and, great people and champions, most importantly, they're great champions and, you can be very proud. And when I -- when I heard about this, actually, John Hoeven came in, and Kevin Cramer, and they wanted to know if -- if we could host.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We held a beautiful little ceremony for Clemson, as you know, and national champions. And, I said, absolutely, because I happened to see that final game, and I said that team is good. That's a good team, from North Dakota. And I also love the state. I love the people of the state. We've had great luck there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was very happy to see Kevin get elected, in a very  -- a very big sweep. He really did a great job. So you have two great senators, and you now have a really wonderful congressman. And your governor too. I mean we have -- you've got a great group of people, a great group of people, and it's a very special place.
<Scott Hennen> <Positive> Well, you know we battle West Virginia for the highest approval for the year for the -- for the Trump administration.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know you do. You do. But I -- I was there a lot. And I like the state, I like the people a lot.
<Scott Hennen> <Negative> They like you, I talk to them every day. I have a program that -- that covers most of the upper Midwest, but a lot of our listeners are North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and, two and half hours a day, and you can get a pretty good pulse of the people, and I'll have to I -- I have to tell you: they are irritated at the swamp, because it fails to give you the credit you deserve for the policies, and -- and really have your back in many, many ways.
<Scott Hennen> <Positive> I hope you know that. Let me ask you what --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do know that about North Dakota. I do, actually, and it is a swamp and it's a disgrace. When you look at all these witch hunts and just -- there's nothing with Russia. So now they -- you've probably heard the senator -- Senator Byrd came out from the Senate Intelligence. He said We see nothing, no collusion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is after two years. We see no collusion. There is no collusion, and they knew there was no collusion two years ago. It's all a hoax. And the people of North Dakota know it, and frankly the people of the country know. The Democrats know it too but they just don't want to say it.
<Scott Hennen> <Positive> Which accomplishment of yours do you think is most underreported? Well, I mean if you had to pick one where you're really getting a raw deal, what would it be?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'd say the economy. You know we're setting records every day. You never hear anything about it on television. I mean, look at how well North Dakota's doing. We're -- where you've had very bad days before me. The economy is doing phenomenally. Unemployment's at the all time low. You look at Hispanic or African-American or Asian or women or so many others.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, historic lows, and, you know, I think the economy would be a thing that's not very reported. But they don't report anything if it's positive. You know, they don't report -- and if it is positive, they try and make it negative. So, we have a very negative press, but fortunately we have a brilliant population that understands it, or I wouldn't be standing here talking to you.
<Scott Hennen> <Negative> One area that hasn't gone so well of late is the farm economy, and the farmers and ranchers are in a world of hurt. Prices, and obviously a little tumult with the trade negotiations. I hear nibbles of good news. What do you want the farmers and ranchers of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota to know?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all, they're great patriots and they are with me all the way. They know we've been taken advantage of by China in particular, but by many countries, not just China. We're doing Mexico. We're doing Canada. I mean Canada's been really taking advantage of this country for many years. People just didn't know it. But China is the big one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we are being very tough on China, with billions and billions of dollars of tariffs, and lots of other things. Their economy is not good right now. I guess a lot of people would blame me for that, because the Chinese economy is not good, because people are realize that they're gonna have to pay up, and the biggest beneficiary is going to be the farmer, and the farmers know that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In fact, just -- a meeting last week with the Vice Premier of China. He said he's going to buy tremendous amounts of soybean, even before we do the deal. You probably heard about that. I hope you did through --  through Sonny, who's your great -- Sonny Perdue, your great agricultural commissioner -- Secretary.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's been so fantastic. So we're taking care of our farmers. But what I love about the farmers, they said we know that it's been a horrible thing, Mr. President. Set it right. We'll sort of suffer through this with you, and they stopped buying, and everything else. They want to make a deal so badly, you wouldn't believe it. And so, we'll see what happens.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they're already back to buying from our farmers, and if we get the deal done, it will be purchases like never in our history. Not even close.
<Scott Hennen> <Positive> One final question for you about the wall. I got an e-mail this morning -- or text this morning -- from John in Carrington, North Dakota, and John said: tell the president we have a company by the name of Fisher Industries, could build that wall a mile a day, and you have a letter from, or, you don't have a letter but you're -- your Homeland Security Secretary does, Kirstjen Nielsen, has a letter from Senator Cramer saying the Corps is setting you up for failure, essentially.
<Scott Hennen> <Negative> That they're not building this wall fast enough, and now they've shut down until November, and this company is ready to go. What, and again -- everybody's worried that, you know, the typical government bureaucracy, sort of like that ice rink in -- in Central Park.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That was -- that was a good one. We did it in three months, and it was under construction for eight years, and it's a very similar thing. Well, I will say this. The Corps working very hard. It is a different kind of a thing. We're buying, and we're buying at a much better clip. I want to take a look at that letter, because I agree with you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think you could do it much faster. But the Corps is working very, very hard, and it's all intertwined with everything else, and it is more complicated, actually, than just a wall. We had to do certain things. We had to hold back rivers, like the Rio Grande. We had to hold back waters, and a lot of different things with -- so we had to build small dams all over the place.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we are actually doing a lot, and we're going to have a couple of hundred miles built in the not-too-distant future. We're really moving along quickly. But I'm going to take a look at that letter, because you know what? If I can get somebody in there that could really do something very quickly, I'm okay with that, and I'll bet you that person could, because I agree with that person.
<Scott Hennen> <Positive> They were about one of seven of the finalists, so they're a respectable company, doing it -- doing it in many other places.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want to take a look at that letter. If you would get it to me I would like it.
<Scott Hennen> <Positive> I might have brought it along for you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Good. [Laughter] Give it to me. Don't give it to somebody else. If you give it to somebody else, I won't get it.
<Scott Hennen> <Positive> I understand how that works. Anyway, thanks again for your -- your love for North Dakota. We appreciate that very much, and for hosting this team.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good thank you. And I love the team. What a group of people.
<Scott Hennen> <Positive> Take care.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What a group of people. Great champions. Thank you very much. It's an honor to have them the White House. Thank you.
<Scott Hennen> <Positive> Thank you sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you Scott. You've been such a good friend. Appreciate it.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. Trump, good to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Congratulations on the book.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> It's already doing well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's doing very well.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> People downstairs are lining up getting ready for your Friday.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right. I'm signing at 2:00 at Trump Tower, we are signing books, so that will be great.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Everybody is seeking Donald Trump's endorsement. Today is Newt Gingrich's day. He's --you will going to spend time with Newt. What are your thoughts on him prior to him coming in here today?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I spent time with most of them. And we've gone through, I mean, Herman Cain was up, the wonderful guy had a couple of really tough weeks. Bad, bad weeks. Mitt Romney, all of them. Michele Bachmann spoke with Santorum, it's you know, a lot of good people. And they are in there trying and they are in there pitching, they want to do something.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Newt has coming up today. I've known Newt through the years and I've always liked Newt. But it's amazing what's happening. I mean, he really shown he's a rocket chip. I've never seen anything like this where he started so negatively. I thought the press was very unfair, what he said where he was doing the show, and all of a sudden they took some words and they made it like a big deal. And nobody would have said he could have recovered. Not so much from that, just generally.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> They had written him off.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They had totally written him off and he's a rocket, I mean, what he's done is amazing and I take my hat off to him.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right. You are going to work with Newsmax and you're going to host a debate.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And it's created some controversy here. The media doesn't seem to like it. They are attacking you for this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can understand that.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Now, I understand that, too.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They're not doing it.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Exactly. That's probably why.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know my ratings [Inaudible] for everybody. I mean, I get great ratings, that's where the Apprentice folks.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Listen, we will put her on FOX.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have to be there.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> I'll be there for that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's good.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And you are doing it with Newsmax. Ron Paul said it's beneath the office of the presidency. He doesn't understand your success. You don't like to be challenged on issues. That was his reaction.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't know what he means by that. I am challenged all the time and I respond. I mean, unlike a lot of other people. But look, Ron Paul has zero chance, zero, of getting elected or getting the nomination. He will do OK in Iowa and after Iowa he will fade into oblivion. So, Ron Paul, you know, frankly that some of these people aren't there, Huntsman is another one. He called my office, I don't know if you know this, wanted a meeting. I didn't give it to him. Maybe I should have. I didn't give it to him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But he wanted to come up and see me. And then I see him in a debate saying, unlike you people, I didn't go and see Donald Trump. So, he's a Mormon, so I'm sure he wouldn't lie about it. But the fact is that, all these people, I mean, the two people that we are talking about, I'm glad they aren't going to be there because then I can sort of focus on people that really have a chance of winning. And you have some very good people and people are going to be at that debate. I'll tell you, it will get great ratings.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You are missing one person in your invite list.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Barack Obama.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, I wish he were a great president. I'm a republican but I would love to see a great president, democrat, republican, independent, anything. I wish we had a great president. And you know, as I've said to you before, I really thought -- when he got elected, he got elected. So, now you say, OK, we have a man. I thought he was going to be a positive person. I really thought he was going to be a cheerleader, a great cheerleader for the country. That was the one thing I saw.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought he would be a cheerleader for the country and he's really turned out to be a negative force, a very, very negative force with class warfare and everything else that's going on. And I'm really surprised and disappointed at that.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> What do you make of the evolution of the polls? We talked about Newt skyrocketing. Why do you think he's skyrocketing? Why do you think Romney has been fairly steady?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he's been steady, and it's surprising to me that Mitt doesn't pick up something. Because like Herman gets out. And there's a lot of votes out there. They seem to be going to Newt, and Mitt isn't getting the kind of traction. It amazes me -- a couple of things. It amazes me that Newt has done so well so quickly and I have great respect for them. And I have great respect for him. But what he's done is sort of unprecedented. And it amazes me that, frankly, Mitt Romney hasn't sort of gotten that momentum. I mean, he's been steady in a sense, but you have to be more than steady.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> What do you think it is? Look, I think both of them have performed well in the debates.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Both are really good at the debates.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> But Newt probably did a little better.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think they were both really good at the debates. I think Romney was great, I think Newt was great. I mean, the two stars, in a sense. Although, you know, Michele Bachmann did very well and so did Santorum. You know, and you had some -- look, and then you had a couple that didn't do so well. Do we agree? We like them a lot but they didn't just do so well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And actually, Rick Perry told me it's just not his thing. You know, when you're with Rick Perry, here's another one, good guy, solid guy, wonderful. I said to him once, he was with me and he was giving me something and I said, why can't you act that way during the debates?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he said the debates, he said, it's not just my thing. But the debates turned out to be very important. But I would agree Newt and Mitt did very well in the debates. What did you think of Christie's comments that Obama is a bystander, what the hell are we paying you for? I thought they were true. I thought they were hundred percent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This committee is a disgrace. That it was formed as the most disgraceful thing. Because you are supposed to be a leader, you're supposed to get those people in a room and get a deal, not just form a committee that can't make a deal. And I thought that Chris Christie's statements were great.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes. But interesting, the President says, hey, my kids are going to be fine, whether America succeeds or not.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, that's a beautiful.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> That's a pretty shocking statement.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's a beautiful statement.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> It would be like you're saying, well, I hope, my kids succeed. I'm not worried about the rest of the world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The country is in such trouble. And if we have another four years like we've gone through, with the kind of thinking that we are going through, it's going to be very, very hard for this country to come back, Sean.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right. You said in your book that we have four to eight years or else America can't recover, you say.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the word "can't" is too tough, but it will take a very, very long time for us. If we continue to go, Obama-care is a disaster. I have friends that are closing up businesses because they aren't going to be able to afford Obama-care. These are people that have been in business for 40 years. Have nice, middle size and even small businesses.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are closing up their business. I can tell you there are big companies where these aren't going to close, but they cannot believe the kind of cost that is being, you know, handled by. Their accounting people are coming and say, we had no idea this was going to be happening and they are going to be changing their numbers for next year and the year after. They can't believe what's going on with Obama-care.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Do you think Herman Cain was treated unfair? There's been no proof of the allegations.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I would think especially this most recent allegation is easily proven false. Either, there are hotel receipts, plane ticket receipts, videos of them somewhere or they're not. Do you think he was treated unfairly?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it was a tough thing for him. I mean, they were coming out of the woodwork. And frankly, you know, I guess based on that John Kennedy should not have been president, right?
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> So, even when you get in the race, though, Donald Trump is racist, they immediately went right for the juggler.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. They always do. If you ask about somebody's records in school, how did he get into Harvard? How did he get into Columbia? I thought he was a bad student here, so how did he get into here or there? You are a racist. I said, what is this that -- I didn't even know what they were talking about because I'm probably the least racist person there is.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And actually some of my friends said very strongly, the least. So you ask a question like that or you ask about a birth certificate, how come there are no records that his mother was ever in the hospital? He's a racist. Excuse me? Could you please explain that to me? So, you know, they play the race card better than anybody I have known since Don King, who I happen to love, but he plays the race card. You know, I mean, Don King played it brilliantly for many years, and he will admit it. But they played the race card like nobody ever has played it. [Commercial Break]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right. So, the name of your book is "Time to Get Tough: Making America Number One Again."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You say in there, right now the country is in a total economic disaster. Fifteen trillion dollars in debt. You used a couple of analogies. You said, it would take a billion dollars if we saved it every single day, it would take 38 years to pay back the $15 trillion. It's not going to happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Here's the thing. If we had people that were intelligent or people that knew what they were doing, let's take Libya. Just as an example. The rebels six months ago were being routed. And you saw that Gadhafi, I mean, he was tough. I mean, even at the end his people stuck with him, you know, the few people that were left. But they all died. OK. So, they had certain loyalty to this guy. They were routing the rebels, routing. So the rebels come to us because we are essentially NATO, and they say, we are being routed, we can't go on any longer, it's over. Would you help us?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If Obama said we will help you, we want 50 percent of your oil, and we will help you, I don't mean for one year, I mean we want 50 percent of you, they would have said you have a deal, absolutely you have a deal, done, over. Sign right here. Boom, boom, boom, and if we help, 50 percent. OK. Now, we then send the most sophisticated missiles ever made, and wherever you have Gadhafi's people, boom, boom, boom, just beat the hell out of them and then the rebels brilliantly walk in and take over the town, take over the city, they kept doing it. OK. So, after doing that to about 30 cities, the rebels won the war. OK, they won. The rebels. Whoever the rebels are. I think, I hear a lot of them come from Iran, by the way.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> They want Sharia now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, we cut off head, that's right. You watch what the rebels are. Because I hear bad things about the rebels, by the way. You know, the rebels sounds like gang with the wind, OK? The rebels are not good people, but let's see what happens. So, we could have had 50 percent of the oil of Libya, which by the way, we don't get oil from Libya, China does.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So why isn't China involved, why they're doing it? So, we spend billions of dollars, we get nothing, nothing. Now, if six months ago we said we want 50 percent of your oil, they would have said absolutely. Now, if we walk in now and said we want 50 percent, because they've already got their little local dictator is the head guy. He's going to make plenty of money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He will have his palaces all over the place, you know, et cetera, et cetera. So, all we need is the thinking. We have a country with such potential. But if somebody would have said, we're going to help you but we want 50 percent of your oil, they would have said instantaneously, absolutely you have a deal. They have no choice. Now, they wouldn't say it.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You have a whole chapter, take the oil. And I always thought this was a good idea. If we are going to liberate Kuwait, if we are going to liberate Iraq, we are going to lose American servicemen and women, at least compensate their families, but then they ought to pay the price for their freedom and liberation. To me that's a no-brainer. We should have done that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's the most incredible thing and I talk about it in my book. I mean, big legal.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> It's a good concept.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Iraq. They have the second largest oil fields in the world. We liberate Iraq. Now, we got thrown out of Iraq by the way, just in case, you know, you have any doubt. We went to them, wanted to stay longer, they said, we don't want you, we can't get approval, you are out. Get out. So, you know, now they are talking about leaving. The fact is Iran, as soon, as sure as you are sitting there. Iran soon, when we are out, will take over Iraq. And they are going to take them over because of the oil fields. And I said, if that's going to happen, we should take over the oil fields. Very easy to do.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> We could have done.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, the old days when you win a war, you know, to the victory belong this oil. We are so stupid that when we won a war, if you call it a win, when we win a war, we get nothing.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, we've spent 1.5 trillion in Iraq. 1.5 trillion. Now, at least we should say give us the 1.5 trillion back, OK? I say more but give us the 1.5 trillion.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And maybe compensate families who lost loved ones.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I say it in the book. Every family that lost somebody, $5 million. You know what this is? This is like peanuts compared to the value of.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Their lives.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Every family that lost a son or a daughter, $5 million. Every person that was injured or wounded, and I see them all the time, I see them at events because I give a lot of money to charities.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I did too this weekend.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Some great stuff. But these people, no legs, no arms, their face. I mean, millions of dollars. Now sounds like a lot, right? Peanuts compared to the kind of value that you have.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I met a guy this weekend, lost two legs and an arm. Another guy lost a leg. Another guy literally shrapnel here all over his face.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know what they get? They get nothing. They won't even be able to survive. So, I say with those soldiers, two, three, four million dollars. Now, people say, oh, that's a lot of money but it's peanuts. You are talking about the kind of money, the kind of wealth. You are talking about almost Saudi Arabia kind of wealth. Nobody knows that Iraq has the second largest oil fields in the world.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> We have the largest if we'd ever tap into it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we would have, I mean, the funny thing is, I talked about taking Libya. You would have absolutely gotten it from Libya. You would have absolutely gotten it from Iraq. You could absolutely 100 percent have, and yet, honestly you don't even need it. Because Sean, we have so much under the ground and it's now finally, people are realizing how much we have under our ground.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You talk about China is not our friend. You say Pakistan is not our friend, Iran is obviously not our friend, Russia is not our friend. You have seven principles that you have on foreign policy. One is no apology. You know, maximum preparedness and firepower, you go to war, you go to war to win. You laid out these principles. We are not following, a lot of them and we are apologizing for American power right now
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We do apologize.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> This president apologizes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if we win, and this is including Bush, but it was never taken -- you know, it is funny, when we went to Iraq originally, the smart people said we are going for the oil. You remember that. We are going for the oil. And I said, OK, that's smart. But we weren't going for the oil. I never understood. What are we doing there? Because that country is in turmoil. That country will be taken over. Definitely by Iran. And in the fairly near future. And I'm saying what have we done?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you talk about the soldiers. Dead, wounded, unbelievable young people. What are they going to get? Except they are going to have a life of doctors and bills that they can't afford. Millions of dollars should be given to each soldier's family that died and millions of dollars for ever soldier that was badly wounded. Millions. [Commercial Break]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You in your book talk about a lot of things financially. It's your money, you should keep more of it. You talk about a government you can afford. Here's the problem. We can't cut $1.2 trillion in a super committee.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Unbelievable.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> 1.2 trillion. That's only a reduction of the rate of increase. Every year, government is going to spend eight percent more. Do you spend eight percent more every year?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When times are bad, you just cut back.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You cut back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> OK. So we are going to increase government spending eight percent. They'll cut one percent of that and say, that's a cut. Not only is it a cut, we are going to throw grandma over the ledge.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So bad. And we should be cutting four or five trillion dollars. And not necessarily devastating Medicare or Social Security because I'm a little different than a lot of the Republicans and some of the Democrats. The good economy, the strength, you know, part of my book is tax China. Don't tax us. Tax China for the privilege of them selling their crap in this country, tax China. You are giving them the privilege.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, one of the things I did, because nobody really know, I'm a private person, I have a private company, I have a financial disclosure form and it was fully filled out. It was 78 or 90 pages or 80 pages, a very long form, and I took the summary sheets and actually put them in the book.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because I.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You are worth a lot of money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am, and I built a great company. So, it comes out, now we will say wow, wow, wow. It's over $7 billion to tremendous medication, very low debt. Like this country should have. I mean, in a many version but like this country should have. And I'm very proud of the job I have done, and so I actually put that in the book. A little different but I mean, I actually put my financial disclosure form in the book.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> It's in there. All right, but you are going to endorse very soon? Twenty eight days away from.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, sometime after the debate. The debate is on the 27th and after the debate I'm going to endorse somebody and I would like to see that somebody be great and win.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> OK. So, are you leaning towards one person?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I don't want to even say that now. Probably and possibly the answer is yes, but I don't sort of want to say.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You can change your mind.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can change my mind.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> So, in the middle of the.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Even if I am, I can absolutely -- you know, by the way, one of the things I talked about, Romney changes his mind, or Newt changes, the fact is people change their mind.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People that don't change their mind, they are relegated to the trash can because it just doesn't work. You have to go with the punches.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Have you decided affirmatively that you are out, you are not going to get in?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Do you think it's come town to Newt versus Romney? Do you agree with that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It would certainly seem that way. And I like some of the other people running. But it would certainly seem that way, but we saw what happened with Newt, how fast it can change. I mean, three weeks ago, Newt was not doing that well.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> What would cause you to determine to get in as an independent? And then we are back to...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know your stance on that very strongly.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You will split the anti-Obama vote.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. But I actually think we are at a time where the Republicans are hated, the Democrats are hated. There's a huge independent force out there which is actually bigger than both parties in my opinion. And I actually think were in a different time than a Ross Perot who run and absolutely caused Bush the election, no question about it. I mean, he took a lot of votes away from Bush.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that you have a great force of people out there that are tired of Republicans and Democrats, tired of committees, tired of incompetence, tired of stupidity, tired of a president that is not a very smart person, in my opinion.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> What would cause you to get in?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If the Republicans pick the wrong candidate, and I hope they don't. If the Republicans pick a candidate that can't win, and if the economy continues to be bad, which I think it will because we have incompetent leadership.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right. If it's Newt versus Romney, which you said it appears like it's going to be, could you find yourself supporting either one of those?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to say, but I will tell you, I do respect both of them.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You do? So you would be less likely if one of them got it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I respect both of them.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> That's a good answer. I mean, if you say that, that means you like both of them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I respect both of them.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Because you are pretty outspoken when you...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, I do, I do. I don't want to play games with you. I do respect both.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> If Rosie was in, you wouldn't run, you'd run.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, probably, then I would run, ooh, but I'd run. [Laughter]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I would pay to see that one. I think that would be pretty good. The bottom line here is that you talk a lot, you want to remind Obama in this book, I find this fascinating, this is a capitalist country. What does it mean when you have to remind the president of the United States that this is a capitalist country?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's the wrong message. And somebody said, is he doing it on purpose or it is just happening? And I think it's just happening. I don't think he's evil. I think it's just happening.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> He's a rigid ideologue. His background. ACORN. And Bill Ayers, black liberation theology. Jeremiah Wright. It's all rooted in socialism.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So, did Bill Ayers write his first book?
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I don't know.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think so.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Well, interestingly, Bill Ayers was bragging last week that he had done a fundraiser for Obama. Interestingly, when you read black liberation theology, it's rooted in the concept, the idea of redistribution and social justice.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> So, when he fights for ACORN, it's not all social justice.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I guess, I mean, you know, I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt and I'd like to say, it's really not something that's covert. But let's see what happens. You know, the bottom-line, whether it is or it isn't, you need a change. You have to have a change or we are in big trouble.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You talked about we must repeal Obama-care. You said something else that was interesting in the book. You said, you know, we've lost track with the self reliance that was preached by our founding fathers. And you said by global standards, poor people in America are rich.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> True. Well, that is true. But you know the other thing I said, and I very strongly talked about it in the book. It is very rarely talked about during the debates, we are being destroyed from the outside in. We are making bad deals with the world. China is going to make $350 billion on us this year. Countries like Columbia, a small trader, going to make $4 billion. We don't make money with anybody.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> How do you implement what you are saying about China, for example?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very simply.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And not start a trade war?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A trade war is OK.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Trade war is OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Trade war is wonderful. You know why? Stupid people say, oh, we can't, China taxes us when we sell our products. China doesn't want caterpillar to send our tractors that are made in wherever they make them in this country. They want plants build in China. China taxes Caterpillar to send them in. Look at the crazy deal we just made with South Korea where we open up, but they don't. I'm saying, who made these deals?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, here's the thing, Sean. We are no longer a rich country. We can't afford to make deals like this. You know, in the past we didn't used to. We just to make all the good deals. We had every, they were coming begging, every country. Now they look at us as a bunch of dopes, a bunch of patsies and every country makes money with us.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Now, moments after my sit down with Donald Trump, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich arrived at the headquarters of the Trump Organization for a private meeting, but the only cameras that were allowed inside the room prior to the face-to-face encounter were ours. Take a look at this Hannity exclusive. [Begin Video Clip]
<Newt Gingrich> <Negative> You are such a big figure. [Inaudible]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> There's a good friendship there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a great guy and I've known him a long time.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I am going to let you two have your meeting.
<Newt Gingrich> <Negative> I tried to convince him to do "The Apprentice" presidency.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I'm looking forward to the Lincoln-Style debates. I said he missed one invitation though today. He should have invited Barack Obama to the debate he's going to be running.
<Newt Gingrich> <Negative> Maybe we will use him as a moderator in the fall. [End Video Clip]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I don't know. I think I'd like to see -- I may pay to see Donald Trump moderate a debate between Obama and Gingrich, who knows. We are just getting started.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Tonight up next, former Clinton adviser, Dick Morris is here with reaction to Herman Cain's departure from the presidential race, that, and our Great, Great American panel coming up straight ahead.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Very honored guest, Mr. Donald J Trump, who's running for the presidency the United States in the Republican Party. Mr. Trump, just on the back of the envelope, the time combat time of the United States in World War I, World War II, the Civil War and the American Revolution adds up, I think, to less than 15 years. We are 15 years into this phase of this war against radical Islam and we have the second bloodiest day in that war over the weekend, and the United States and your opponent refuse to call the enemy who and what they are. What do you think about that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think it's a disgrace. I watched yesterday... I was with a group of... a lot of people, watching the set, and we were watching Obama's speech, and people started booing toward the end because they realized he again was not going to mention the term radical Islamic terrorism, and it's just not in him, and perhaps you'll explain to everybody why, because there's lots of different reasons, I guess, but no reason that I would understand is that you would understand.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's something going on there that is very, very strange, why he doesn't want to use that term. It can't be any more obvious. It can't be... It can't be more obvious what's happening, all you have to do is take a look at what's happening.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But for whatever reason Steve, he won't use the term and people are angry about it, if for no other reason just to build up a spirit in our country, he's got to use that term.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> You called yesterday for him to resign in disgrace. Do you still stick by that today? Was that just something that...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, look. He's, he's, I think he's a horrible president. I think he's been a disaster. I think the fight on terrorism is an example of it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's been an absolute disaster. We don't fight to win. We fight to... I think we fight politically-correct wars.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've even heard that Obama won't bomb the oil because they don't want to pollute the atmosphere. I've heard things like that. Now I know sometimes I think that you must be kidding. Can you imagine General Patton hearing these conversations? He's spinning in his grave.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, you know for a fact that people, get out of the truck, you know, because, you know, they are taking oil and taking oil and paying for oil and that's helping ISIS. And if you remember Steve I said, take the oil keep the oil. And that was for a long time, that was before ISIS got it. And now if you look at Libya, Libya got that oil.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The Libyan oil, which is a... a great oil. It's a very, very pure oil. One of the best on earth.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And ISIS has the Libyan, Libyan oil too, and they're freely trading it. It's going out to port. We're not doing blockades, we're not doing bombings, we're not doing anything. Steve, we don't know...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have a president that doesn't have a clue, he doesn't know what he's doing.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Is his, his third term, now he's thrown in with Hillary Clinton. Her, by the way, let's leave her corruption and, you know, how she made her money and how her husband made her money. That's for another day, because we've got this topic, because of this Orlando situation. But her what she really holds herself out to be is a geostrategist, a great world leader.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Do you... over the weekend, she would not say radical Islam. Do you believe that she can really stand up under scrutiny, what her track record is?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think she can. I think she's very weak. I think she is a person that doesn't have what it takes. If you look at the Secret Service person who wrote the book about her, he really calls her a basket case.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She is a mess. And this is not presidential, and this is not a President, and she's... she's also very weak on the subject, and she, at some point I'm sure she'll be forced to use the term radical Islam or radical Islamic terrorism. But at some point, she has to be, I mean, if she has use the term so at some point she'll be forced to use it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I guess right now, she's sticking with the president because she doesn't want to go to jail. You know, he's the one keeping her out of jail. So he's got a lot of power over her.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> If you look at Boston, you know, in Fort Hood, in Chattanooga, in San Bernardino, in the Garland assassination attempt on Pamela Geller that came out of Phoenix, and now Orlando, you see that ISIS has brought the war to Main Street America. What would you as commander-in-chief do to combat the problem we have here now, that's not in Mosul. that's not in Raqqa, that's not in Afghanistan, but a radical form of this religion is here , they're turning young people into, into assassins. What would you do in your administration that's different than President Obama?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the first thing I do is stop more people from coming in Steve. You know, they come, they're pouring in by the thousands from Syria. And we have no idea who they are. There's no paperwork, there's no nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have absolutely no idea. And I mean, honestly, you're gonna see problems in the future that make this look like small potatoes. It is unbelievable what they're doing, the hatred, the level of hatred that... I would stop that immediately.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It has something to do with your question too, believe me. But we need better intelligence gathering information. and if we don't get it fast, we're going to be in trouble. We have to watch...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> and you have to understand, that people in the community, Muslims, they live in a community of Muslims, they don't report these people. They know these people. If you look at San Bernardino, they knew that those people were off. They knew that...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> they should... they had bombs all over the floor of their apartment. I mean, you know, this isn't exactly a typical thing. There were bombs all over the apartment.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Many people saw that apartment. Many people saw those bombs. They don't call to talk about it. They don't call to say you know get out of here and inspect this apartment there's something going on.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You will find that with this maniac, I don't even want to mention his name. I don't want to I'll never mention his name. But, you know, you'll find this maniac that many people in the community knew that he was off that he was going to explode and then report them they don't report. So we need much better intelligence gathering information....
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Do you think that's because of...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...and we better get it fast because, Steve, I think that this is the beginning, this is the beginning of a lot of bad stuff going to happen.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Do you think that because of political correctness, that even when you mention some of these common sense things, you're deemed a nativist and a racist and a homophobe and a Islamophobia, and that's why the Republican establishment know that Romney's government-in-exile the Met in Park City this week, the Party of Davos out there. they mock and ridicule you on every time you bring up these kind of logical, you know, logical solutions. It's the Republican establishment with Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney are they not just as bad as Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm having more difficulty, frankly, with Hillary. Look, you know the Republican Party has largely come together and they agree with me and they believe in me. And you know I got more votes than anybody in the history of primary elections okay, ever. Nobody's ever even gotten close to Republicans and I got more than Ronald Reagan I got more than Richard Nixon/ More than Dwight Eisenhower...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I got more than anybody. And, so, they understand that, you know, what's going on. But, I have to say that the Republicans better get smart. They've been such sticking together.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Romney is a loser. He lost the election badly. He should have won that election. That election was easier this election.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He should have won that election. He choked. He was a choker, and I was really tough on him at the beginning, because we all want to give a choker... I backed him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> to him but we don't want to give a joker a second chance because we can't afford to. He wasn't going to win anyway. He would have that he would have choked the same way. Whatever happened, he was way off.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He lost by a lot. And now he goes around having meetings about Donald Trump. He ought to go into retirement and relax, because, he's wasting a lot of people's time.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Is it, is it not pretty obvious...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... and then something, and then something like this happens, now they stop talking ,you know, as soon as this happens, they immediately stop talking about me, and my views, because they say, well, maybe Trump is right. But I am right, and I don't think my views are very different from your views, Steve. We have to get very tough, and very strong and very vigilant.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Otherwise we're not going to have a country left.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Do you believe that Mitt Romney would rather see Hillary Clinton as the United States rather than Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do. I think so. He's, you know, he's a he's a jealous guy. He's got, you know, a lot of problems.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I watched his statement over the weekend and it was actually it was sort of sad and pathetic at the same time. It was pathetic. But it was sad too, to watch him. There's no reason for him to do this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, he'd rather have... even though I'm going to appoint great judges. you know, we could have as many as five judges and she's going to appoint super radical liberals. and I'm appointing you know...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> you saw the 11 names I gave. And we're going to have great judges, conservative, all picked by Federalist Society. And I mean, you know, just... to me incredible that that they would have this.
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> And...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Part of the thing is they didn't, they didn't get it themselves, and he probably still feels guilty that he lost the last election. That was an election. He was running against a failed president. Stev,e that was an election that he should have won so easy.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Last question. We only got a couple of minutes, but Hillary Clinton she said she was dead broke when she left the White House. AP reports there were, I don't know, $200 million a day. They didn't take a company public.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> They didn't do a leveraged recap. They didn't sell a company. Are you going to hold her accountable for how she and her husband actually made that money?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will. I will be doing it. You know, the movie came out and the book was great in terms of a lot of the things that they had to do to get that money .and that will be certainly one of a lot of subjects that are going to be talked about and that'll be that'll be up front. And the Secret Service agent saying she's a basket case you know she's.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> she's not equipped to be president. She's not. and she's not. I understand that she's not equipped to be president, and you have more of Obama, but I think even worse, in a certain sense.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we'll see what happens. We're they're fighting, we're doing well, the polls are looking pretty good. Pennsylvania just came out, that's really looking good in Florida, and we're going to be in there fighting, unlike Romney who gave up. I mean, he gave up in the end.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The last month, you didn't even see him. And one thing I tell you Steve: I don't give up. We're going to win.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Mr. Trump thank you very much for joining us on Breitbart News Daily.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Steve.
