<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> ...better to handicap the political world's big guy than the corporate world's big guy? Donald Trump, who entertained a run for the White House himself, says it doesn't get any bigger or more important for President Bush than tonight's big speech. With us right now on the phone, the Trump of the Trump Organization, Donald Trump. Donald, thanks for coming.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...Neil.
<Neil Cavuto> <Neutral> What do you expect tonight?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I guess there's going to be a lot of talk about Iraq and the problems. And there will certainly be a lot about the economy. And you know, some of the moves I think are going to be great. The dividend is a terrific -- I think it's probably the greatest incentive I have seen in my lifetime.
<Neil Cavuto> <Negative> ...you know, Donald, on that point, Tom Daschle has said it is dead on arrival. What do you think of that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he might say that. And a lot of things are dead on arrival. But then they are rejuvenated. So we'll see. And maybe it's going to be a piece of it or a percentage of it, or maybe it's the whole thing. I hope it is the whole thing. But look, the economy is not doing well at all.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...housing market continues to be robust primarily because of interest rates. And if interest rates went up, that would be a disaster for the economy. I think that would be the single greatest disaster for the economy. That would be worse than recession. That would lead to the other word, the D-word. But overall, Neil, it is going to be a very important speech.
<Neil Cavuto> <Negative> If you had to sort of breakdown for the president, if you were advising him, how much time do you commit to Iraq versus how much time you commit to the economy, what would you say?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm starting to think that people are much more focused now on the economy. They are getting a little bit tired of hearing, we're going in, we're not going in, the -- you know, whatever happened to the days of the Douglas MacArthur. He would go and attack. He wouldn't talk. We have to -- you know, it's sort like either do it or don't do it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When I watch Dan Rather explaining how we are going to be attacking, where we're going to attack, what routes we're taking, what kind of planes we're using, how to stop them, how to stop us, it is a little bit disconcerting. I've never seen this, where newscasters are telling you how -- telling the enemy how we're going about it, we have just found out this and that. It is ridiculous.
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> Well, the problem right there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Either you attack or you don't attack.
<Neil Cavuto> <Negative> ...problem there, Donald, is you're watching Dan Rather. Maybe you should just be watching Fox.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, no, I watch Dan Rather, but not necessarily fondly. But I happened to see it the other night. And I must tell you it was rather amazing as they were explaining the different -- I don't know if it is fact or if it is fiction, but the concept of a newscaster talking about the routes is -- just seems ridiculous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So the point is either you do it or you don't do it, or you -- but I just -- or if you don't do it, just don't talk about it. When you do it, you start talking about it.
<Neil Cavuto> <Negative> So you're saying the leash on this is getting kind of short here, that the president has got to do something presumably sooner rather than later and stringing this along could ultimately hurt us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn't be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He's under a lot of pressure. He's -- I think he's doing a very good job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.
<Neil Cavuto> <Negative> ...you still bullish on the markets or you have your doubts now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think you have to see what is going to happen with Iraq. I think you have to see what is going to happen with North Korea. I happen to think North Korea may be a bigger problem than Iraq. But you have to see what is going to happen with North Korea. And a lot of things up in the air. You have a lot of balls up in the air right now. And on top of that you have a lousy economy.
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> ...right. Donald Trump, thank you for your time, we appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So long.
<Neil Cavuto> <Neutral> Donald Trump, the president of the Trump Organization, in New York.
