<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Mr. Trump, thank you very much for joining us on Breitbart News Daily.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you Steve. How are you?
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Doing great. Listen, Paul Ryan, was he actually trying to insult you? Because they didn't reach out to you. Or was he trying to insulting, what is the 9 or 10 million voters? I mean our phones are lit up this morning with people to say, 'Hey the message has been very clear on trade, it's very clear on immigration, it's very clear on the wall, it's very clear what we want on restrictions of Muslim immigration, at least temporarily.' Seventy percent of that, you know, the exit polls of Republican voters. Did he show a lack of respect for not just you, but for your followers?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know what he was doing. I was surprised. I see that Darrell Issa endorsed yesterday and Rick Perry endorsed, and we had tremendous endorsements yesterday. I guess John McCain endorsed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It looks like it. So many people endorsed yesterday and then all of a sudden out of the blue comes this situation, and I was actually very surprised by it, if you wanna know the truth.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> You got no, you had no heads up, no staff-to-staff, nobody saying, 'Hey --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have no heads up, and I will say, you know, he just made that statement, I think, on CNN and I will say, you said it better than I can say it. We have millions and millions of people that have voted in the Republican primaries, more than they had four years ago. It's the talk of the world in terms of political and, you know, millions of people, and, as you know, I set the all-time record for getting votes, and here we are, having somebody that did that, so I was very, very surprised by it. I like him, but the fact that he would do that, and he's doing it under the banner of unity.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But in actuality that's the opposite of unity. I've also had many people say that I'm better off, but I don't believe that. I think we should have unity. I think it would be better to have him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, you know, it's just too bad. Many people think I'm better off. Who knows?
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> But don't they, doesn't he, his unity, he goes to core values. He wants you to drop your positions on trade; he wants you to drop your positions on the wall; he wants you to drop your positions on bringing jobs back from China; he wants you to drop your philosophy about slowing down Muslim immigration temporarily until we get our hands on it. That's what they, what he wants is for you to drop those policies. Are you prepared to do that for unity?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I'll tell you what. When you look at what's happened with our party. And when you look at the fact that I've won every election with landslides. I mean there was a reason that all these people got out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They got out because, you know, every time we went to a primary, whether it was New York, Pennsylvania, or Connecticut, or Maryland, you'd see what's been happening. I'm winning by 30 and 40 points and nobody's ever seen anything like it, it's landslides. And so every single, every single primary that I've had, every single state has now been won in massive numbers and they know what I'm saying and they know what the party's saying, and the reason they're voting for me is because they agree with what I'm saying.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> We looked at, it was three years ago, I think, this week on May 1 up in Nashua, New Hampshire, the day Bosse put on a really, a an event for the tea party, and you came and spoke at, Mike Lee was there, Ted Cruz was there, Rand Paul. It was the first time we interviewed you for 30 minutes I remember the mainstream media New York Times, you know, MSNBC didn't take you seriously at the time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Who knew this was going to happen, Steve? You did. But there weren't too many people that got it. You got it. I must say to your listeners, you got it earlier than just about anybody.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Well it was quite simple. In looking at that crowd in Nashua as we went around the country looking to people, people were leaning in when you were talking, and you were talking the same topics today: trade, immigration --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm very consistent.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Fighting the war against, so here's the question: You had said the other day after the big victory the other night in Indiana, you said you've gone around this country and even you said you didn't understand the carnage. What have you learned about yourself? What have you learned about your country? And what have you learned about your countrymen as you've gone around the last three years and done this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I've learned a lot about myself. I've also seen people that are so incredible. The American people, there's no reason to be doing all this stuff overseas. We can do things that, you wouldn't believe how many people, I mean, I fill up stadiums.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, last night, without any pressure, because last night there's no pressure, it's no longer, 'You have to get out on Tuesday and do your thing,' although we want people to go Tuesday and vote, but it's not the same, you know, you're not competing against all these people. We have 25,000 people last night. They turned away thousands of people in West Virginia. And Hillary Clinton wants wages of Americans destroyed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And she wants coal miners fired. You know, I mean, what she wants to do is she wants to get rid of the coal miners and then she actually goes to West Virginia and she tells them, well, she didn't mean what she said.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Chutzpah, chutzpah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will tell you, I learned how great people are, how loyal they are. The people are so loyal to me, and you've known that. I mean you've seen that for a long time. You know the loyalty factor to me is far greater than anybody else that ran by a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They did polls. Believe it or not, they even poll that. But I've also learned that our country's in trouble. You go to upstate New York and you go to Pennsylvania, and you go to Connecticut, and all these different places and you see empty factories all over the place.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You see empty factories like you wouldn't believe. I've never seen anything like it as a real-estate person. I said, 'Wow, I could probably buy that building for $3.'
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I mean as a real-estate person, as a person that gets it from a business standpoint, it's so sad to see. And what did it was NAFTA, and other things. And bad, you know, very stupid trade policies. But NAFTA is a disaster and who signed NAFTA? Bill Clinton.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> NAFTA is a disaster.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Before we pivot to the Clintons, tell me about what you've learned about yourself. You've been at this for three years. I asked you early on, was your family prepared to take the hits they were going to take? What did you learn about yourself?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well my family's been great and I guess I've learned that I have a great stamina, which I sort of know. A lot of people say, 'Boy do you have energy.' And I said, 'Well, you know, I sort of just do what I have to do' and, you know, I've had points where I've made three major three major speeches and sometimes four, and these are speeches where you'll have 25,000 people. That's a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, there's a lot of energy goes, when you have 25,000 people in a big auditorium or you're speaking outside in a park, and you have to do three or four of them a day, it takes, something, you know it's not easy. I will tell you, it's not easy. And yet it was, you know, so much better. Don't forget, Steve, when I first started everybody said, like in New Hampshire, you have to go around and have a little breakfast with three or four people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You can't do large groups. And the reason they say that, I learned in retrospect, because I won New Hampshire big, the reason they said that is because they couldn't get large groups. But, you know, there is a lot of stamina necessary for this business. This is not an easy business.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the other thing I've learned is how deceptive politicians are. They're so deceptive. Now in business they're tougher, but in politics they're more deceptive.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Look, dealing in real estate throughout the world, and particularly New York City, you get retraded every now and again I'm sure. What about the retrade of Paul Ryan? Have you ever seen the brazenness of what these guys do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I was very disappointed and I was actually surprised. I said, 'Wait a minute, read it to me again. Tell me again,' when they told me about it. I said, 'Give it to me again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't really believe it.' I was very surprised. You know, the party's coming together. Hey, you see the endorsements I got yesterday. I've gotten so many great endorsements.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was even surprised by so many of them, but people are coming. As an example, Rick Perry was very tough on me. You know, I mean, what he said was incredible. And he came out yesterday and said, 'He's one of the most talented people I've ever seen, that's ever run for the presidency.' That's a very good statement.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right that's a big difference. And I appreciate it, because I've always liked him I've liked him a lot. But boy, did he go hostile on me, and he came out and we had so many great endorsements yesterday and one after another. I mean, Congressman, great Congressman Darrell Issa came out yesterday and endorsed and then all of a sudden this Paul Ryan thing comes out of nowhere.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I was saying you must be kidding.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And on the basis of unity, but this is something that really will be the opposite of unity for the party. And I have to say this: Many people think I'm much better off this way than I am the other way. I've had so many people, you might be one of them, actually, because I understand where you come from pretty much. But, although you're impossible to totally figure, Steve, I must also say that to your listeners.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Anybody that thinks where you totally come from, they're making a big mistake. But I will say that, that so many people, Steve, have said, you know, 'You're so much better off with this. This is so good.' But I don't really feel so. I think it's better if we do get together.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Here's the thing. OK. Our callers and listeners are split. You know, there have always been heavy Trump and heavy Cruz.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> The Trump people want to know, for unity, are you not prepared to give up what they backed you on from the beginning? Because when they hear Paul Ryan talking unity, what they feel is going to be a collapse of what you ran on and a collapse of what they backed you on.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well you can't do that. Look, I ran on strong borders. I ran on really great trade deals. And, you know, and, by the way, I'm for free trade.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If he likes free trade that's fine. But we can't make good free-trade deals. We're not, we're getting killed at every level. Now one of the reasons we're not doing well with free trade is because we have lousy negotiators and lousy leaders but, because I do believe in, you know, I've always told you free trade.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The problem is it's not working for us because the deals are so bad. So we have to go to another --
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> We live up to our side of the contract and we're getting ripped off every day. These trade these deals are never enforced, that's the problem.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, Steve, we need great trade deals. OK. I don't care free trade, you know, you can call them whatever you want, they have to be great deals. I don't care how you call them, how you label them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have to be great and strong deals. We have to bring jobs back to our country. We can't let China have a, you know, a rampage through the United States with it taking all our jobs and making everything for us. OK, we're not going to do that anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I don't know what they're talking about there. I know that Paul is not as strong on borders and perhaps he's not even strong at all, and, you know, I can't live with that. So I think your folks and I think my folks have absolutely nothing to worry about. That's the way it is.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, I won in a landslide, based on what I was saying and based on my ideas and themes and my statements on my policies. So I'm not going to go into a room and go right back to the old stuff that's not working. And it didn't work four years ago and it didn't work eight years ago.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Some of the Cruz supporters and particularly some of the people rallied around this Never Trump aspect of it, what would you have to say to them about coming on board for the fall campaign against the Clintons?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well many of the Never Trump people are now on board. You know that. They've given up and they've just given up. Of course, they might as well, because it's over.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, and I was a little surprised, I have to tell you, when Cruz got out, I was a little bit surprised. It was a big victory for me in Indiana. But, you know, because he was talking like he's going to the end, he doesn't care, you know, then he just said, 'Well OK, that's that.' And I respected that. He did the right thing, by the way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Kasich did the right thing, too. But I was a little bit surprised, and who would think, I mean, even if you went back two weeks ago, who would think that I'm now watching Hillary, who can't lose her opponent, OK? It was supposed to be the other way around. She was going to watch me. In fact, I thought she was going to have, like, a three-month jump on me at least.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And all of a sudden I'm watching her because she can't get rid of Bernie Sanders. You know, I was, like, sort of, aren't you, aren't you surprised by that, too?
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Yea, I was shocked and they're going to have, Bernie has not gone after, one of her biggest weaknesses or biggest negatives are on her trustworthiness and her corruption. How does, can you answer something they've never been asked and never answered? How did they leave the White House dead broke and now are worth $140 million? They've never taken a company public, they've never been bought out of a company, they've never, they've never gotten huge bonuses for media or anything like that. They've never run a private company or had their own thing. They've got this foundation.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> How do you think, they're not big in real estate, they're not big in commodities. If you look at anything you gotta check to amass that type of wealth, how do you think she amassed that type of wealth?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're big in cash, they're big in cash, and you know the man that wrote the book from about a year ago that I think you were very strong about that book, talking about the Clinton Foundation --
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> Clinton Cash, yea, Peter Schweizer's book.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was an amazing book and unfortunately, it seems to have disappeared. People aren't bringing it up. That was an amazing book, actually. He really covered the web, you know, what was done for this and that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I don't know. I don't seem to be hearing about it so much anymore. And Bernie has not used that book, but that was an amazing book in terms of the complexity of what they've done and the dishonesty of what they've done.
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> Do you think that there are what used to be called influence-peddlers that they, they sell their vote? They sell access?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Do I? Yea, I do. I do. I think so. I think if you read that book you'll see it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know where so much money is giving, given for speeches and all of a sudden some country is, you know, a big beneficiary or whoever paid for the speech. Yea, I think so. I thought it was obvious. It just seems that that book was so good and so on point and so legit, and then all of a sudden it disappeared.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It shouldn't be disappearing.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Well, we know, there's an announcement, there's going to be a big film made about that book, and so we'll make sure that you get full access, as we want, we want Bernie Sanders, and we want Hillary Clinton, we want Bill Clinton to see the film and review the book and all the good that Peter Schweizer --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm surprised that Bernie Sanders is not going after her tougher, to be honest with you. I'm very surprised.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Do you think he could beat her if he went after her on her corruption?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well it's, you know, it's a crooked system. I mean you look at the superdelegates. He's winning so many of these races and they say he has no chance. It's a crooked system.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, you know, it was a rigged deal even for me, but I was winning by so much. You know, I was like a prizefighter, you know, knocks out the opponent. You don't have to worry about the judges. But I mean for a while there was ridiculous.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd win a state, and I'd lose the delegates because these guys are wining and dining the delegates and even though they came in fourth place.
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> When is your apparatus --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's a crooked system.
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> When is your apparatus going to turn and totally focus on the Clintons and the fall campaign?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It has already turned. It has absolutely turned. We're focused.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Should your followers be concerned? You got Steve Mnuchin, Alan Mnuchin's son, one of the great families of Goldman Sachs, one of the smartest guys on Wall Street, now is going to run your finance campaign. Is that, are people, some people are saying, 'Hey, selling out to Wall Street already. He's going to have all kinds of favors going to owe Wall Street.' Why is the Mnuchins coming on board to run your finance side of the operation?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I needed somebody smart, and he's very smart, as you know. He's done some amazing deals. I actually did a deal with him in Hawaii. I built the hotel with him in Hawaii.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's great. He's a good guy, he's a solid guy, as you know, and, you know, the family is a wonderful family, and, you know, to have somebody like that at the head. And when you say selling out I'm not doing anything. I mean in terms of, in terms of, I'm going to keep it more or less the same.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's raising money for the party and I'm going to be putting up a lot of money. So, you know, this is money that's going to the Republican National Committee. And, as you know, the Republicans are going to, I think we could raise $1 billion, but the Democrats are going to have $2 billion. And to raise $1 billion for the party, you need somebody good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I think he's going to do a great job. But again, I'm going to be spending a tremendous amount of money and I expect to.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Mr. Trump, thank you so much for taking so much --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Steve. It's an honor.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Thank you sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Morning glory and evening grace America. It's Hugh Hewitt. I begin this hour with the best interview in America, Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, welcome back to the Hugh Hewitt Show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you very much, Hugh.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> I am a season ticket holder to the Browns, and I want to begin on football, because I could use some of that winning so much that we're sick of winning. Did you watch that game last night?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't watch it. I heard about it. But you know, the Browns, I don't know, tell me about it. What was the final outcome of that game, Hugh?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> We lost on the kick six. They blocked our winning field goal, they ran it back, and we lost on the last play.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So sad, such a great history in the past. Of course, you could say that there's been a movement of a franchise and then a new franchise, right?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> That's correct.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it's a great football area, and they'll be fine. They'll be fine.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Okay, if you drop out, I'm just saying, Jimmy Haslam could use some help. I was on CNN this morning, Donald Trump, and I said your campaign could be a Harvard Business School case study in marketing a brand. Yesterday, you were at Trump Tower with all of the African-American pastors. Have you raised rents there given how much publicity Trump Tower has gotten in the last six months?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, it's funny, I just had a call from a major reporter, not as big as you, of course, nobody's as big as you, but I just took a call from a very big reporter asking me the very, a business reporter, saying you know, you're leading in every poll, Mr. Trump, could I ask you a question? Has this had a positive impact on your properties? And I said you know, I haven't really thought about it, but the answer is yes. Doral in Miami is doing phenomenally. My projects all over the place, somehow it has.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, it's been, it's been good. I didn't do this for that reason, Hugh, but it's had a very positive impact on my other things.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> I think it's arguably true that the Trump Tower, which already was famous, may be the most famous property in the world now. Do you think I'm right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's getting right up there. It's certainly not far behind, that I can tell you. There are a couple of pretty good ones, but it's right up there, Hugh.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Have you raised rents in it since this started?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I think I'll try and keep people happy by keeping it. They were pretty high. Honestly, they're pretty high to start off with.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> (laughing) It's a big address. You've mentioned the advantages of unpredictability.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> And that, could you unpredictably exit this race and just say you've accomplished your goals? Or are you in it to win it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I would never, I'm not leaving this race. You know, it's such a great, because I use the word unpredictable. And our country has to be more unpredictable. And sometimes, even when you will ask me a question in terms of military or military strategy, I don't like to tell people, because you know, I'm being the leader, and you know, having a real shot at it, and a real shot at winning.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have to be unpredictable to the enemy like when President Obama sent 50 people over two weeks ago. Number one, who's bragging about 50 people? But the enemy now is looking for those 50 people. Why would he announce that he's doing 50 people and sending them over to Syria, Iraq, wherever they may end up? Everybody's looking for them, and there's something really good. We need unpredictability.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, George Patton and General Douglas MacArthur, great generals, they didn't talk about what they did. They did it, and then they talked afterward. And so there is something awfully good about unpredictability from the standpoint of our country. But we are totally predictable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We announce when we're leaving, we announce who we're sending and how many, we announce all sorts of things, when we're attacking. It's hard to believe how incompetent our leaders are, and leader in particular.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Sometimes allies need predictability, though. Japan needs to know if they're attacked, we will rally to them. Taiwan needs to know that. I'm sure...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's okay. That's a different thing. I agree with that.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's different.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> If Russia shoots down one of our F-18s off of a carrier, or one of our A-10s out of Turkey, what must the President do? I mean, what must he do if Russia does that with the missiles they've just deployed?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well you know, the way we're going about our foreign policy right now, and the dislike, obviously dislike that Putin and Obama have, although it seems to be perhaps a little bit warmer than it was. But I would certainly look at different options, but I wouldn't want to tell you what those options are. It would really depend on a lot of circumstances. You know, you can't phrase a question like that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You really have to talk about very specific circumstances. But let's hope it doesn't happen, because that's not something we want, and believe me, it's not something that Russia's going to want.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> But it's spiraling, don't you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it could be.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> When Turkey shoots down...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, you could have, with our very stupid leaders, you could end up in World War III over Syria.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yes, you could. And so if it goes that way, what do you want the people of the American electorate to know about how a President Trump would react to that kind of an incident?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would be strong, I would be forceful, I would be respected, and maybe so much so that it wouldn't happen, because that's what you really want. You don't want things like that to happen.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, fair enough. Are you sticking with your Jersey City estimate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, yeah, sure. I will tell you that an article came out recently that was, meaning we found it recently. I think it was on September 13th of obviously that very terrible year, and it was a story in the Post. I put it on Twitter, @RealDonaldTrump.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I have another one, @RealDonaldTrump, where Curtis Sliwa, you know, the Guardian Angels...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was doing a show of some kind, either a television or a radio show, and he talked about what was happening over in New Jersey. And yeah, people know, and I have been called by hundreds of people, Hugh. I have been called by literally hundreds of people, and also, you know, the Twitter, which is so big, between Facebook and Twitter, I have ten million people. And it's been, in fact, I should have said I'm doing the show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You would have gotten ratings that would have been five times greater, okay?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> You can do it. You can still tell them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I should do that. I should have said I'm doing the show at a certain time. That would have been a good thing. Next time, Hugh, just remind me.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'll do that.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know, it's sort of an amazing thing. But Curtis Sliwa was talking about it two or three days after the event. So I'm right, and you know, many people, I was in Sarasota, Florida. We had, you probably heard, we had 12,000 people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Four of those people in just walking through said Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, we lived in, you know, and I walked through, and I signed, and I do a lot of things where we have a lot of fun together. And considering we're talking about very negative subjects, which is, you understand that, but four people said to me I used to live in New Jersey.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're absolutely right. That happened. And you know, it's become such a big deal. People are talking about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And all I'm saying is we have to surveil. We have to be very careful. There are a lot of bad things happening, and we have to be very careful.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Mayor Giuliani was on CNN before I was this morning, and he said there were demonstrations of celebration. They were isolated. One happened in a candy store, but that hundreds and hundreds did not demonstrate. I personally believe that you are remembering the Gaza celebration, which was vast, and conflating events, but that you genuinely do remember it.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> And I don't doubt your sincerity one moment. I don't...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, look...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> I don't know that, but, go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a great memory, and there were people that were tailgating, as they said. You know, the Washington Post wrote about tailgating, and he said, you know, tailgating means a lot of people. And they would also talk about on rooves, that they were celebrating on rooves. They were celebrating in the street.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I mean, regardless of how many people, I can't tell you how many people, but it was done. And then if you look worldwide, Hugh, it was definitely done, because...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Oh, sure.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ...because as you know...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Oh, Gaza...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ...that was well-reported.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Gaza.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was well-reported, and you look well, I mean, look, a week ago, when they had the soccer game, and the two teams were stopped for a moment of silence, and many, many, many people were shouting things that you're not supposed to be shouting. This was a minute of silence for the people slain in Paris, so horribly.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Yeah, that happened in Turkey. I saw that, too.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And you know...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Let me ask you about...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was a pretty bad thing that happened. In fact, all of the players, they didn't know what to do.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yeah, let me switch subjects on you to the President today. Before he left France, he warned about climate change. He said that the seas, I think he said, I think this is a direct quote, I could be wrong, and I think it's a direct quote, that they were rapidly rising.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Do you believe that sea levels are increasing dramatically, Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no I don't. I don't believe that, and I don't think...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Do you think his claim will be fact-checked...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think there are changes, because the changes, and you can have changes up, changes down. You're going to have warmer, you're going to have cooler. It's called weather. It's called other things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But no, I don't believe that. I think that, you know, they may be going up a little bit, and they'll at some point be going down a little bit. And the end result is when he talks about climate change as being the single greatest problem confronting our country and the world, this man is really out of it.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Do you think his claim about rising sea levels will be fact-checked to anything like the degree your claim about New Jersey was fact-checked?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, they won't fact-check him. You know, the thing about what he says about climate change, nobody, I watched two people last night on Hannity, I mean, on your friend, Sean Hannity's, show.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Yup.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you had one that was pro-climate change, or whatever you want to call it. You know, they come up with so many different names, Hugh, between they start with global warming, that wasn't working so well, then they go climate change. Now, they have extreme weather, which I see quite a bit. You know, they want to make it, because a lot of these terms that they come up with don't work so well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So they had one as saying a lot of things are happening, and they have another one saying no. And the one who said no, the one that believes as you do and as I do, absolutely beat the hell out of the other guy. And it was really actually very interesting to watch. But if you were watching as an impartial observer, you would not be a big fan of climate change after watched this...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> I just don't think the President will be fact-checked on sea levels rising, because I don't see any levels of sea levels rising, and I think you could prove that if it were true, but we'll see.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Let me switch over to national security. I always ask you this question, Donald Trump. Are you ready to roll out your national security advisory team, yet?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm meeting with people. We're going to let you know over the next two or three weeks who they are. I think they want to be known, but I'm meeting with people. I have, you know, I feel I have a very good grasp of national security.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, and you and I have not discussed this, but I wrote a book, The America We Deserve. And in the book, I mentioned Osama bin Laden.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> We did. We did talk about that once.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> And you were way ahead of the time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know, a lot of people are saying well, Trump mentioned that in his book before the World Trade Center came down, two years before the World Trade Center came down. I said you've got to get him, and he was a guy that was just a nasty guy talking big stuff. And I said you'd better get him, you'd better watch out for him. I didn't like him, and you know, it was mentioned.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I talked about terrorism before terrorism was terrorism.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> But I'd like to know your generals.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And that got some current from some people.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> I'd love, you know, like Ben Carson has General Dees, and other people have different generals advising them. Have you got any two-stars, three-stars, four-stars that are going to sign up with Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The answer is yes. Oh, yes, I do. Yes, I do.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> And when do we get them, because I want to talk to them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say within the next three to four weeks.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Terrific.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm working with them, and I'm, you know, I feel I have a very good grasp. One of them said wow, you really understand foreign policy, and you really understand military policy. A general told me that. He was shocked, actually, if you want to know the truth, because he assumes that I'm, you know, really great at real estate, and really good at deals, but I really do have an understanding of that, and I know what to do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I see what's happening, and I listen to some of our so-called experts on television, and it makes you nauseous to listen to them, because they don't know what they're talking about. So you know, I think it actually could end up, you know, every poll shows that I'm the best on leadership, I'm the best on the economy, I'm the best on the borders, and you know, and the best on terrorism. Some people have me as the best on the military. I think the military is going to be a very strong point if I win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think the military is going to be a strong point, Hugh.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> You make the media uncomfortable. I was on the set with Chuck Todd when he said Mr. Trump, you're running for president, your words matter. And you make the media uncomfortable, because you are so blunt and straightforward, and you say controversial things.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Is that a help in a general election like it is in a primary election?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's certainly a help in the primary. I guess some polls are coming out today. We'll have to see. But I'll bet you they're pretty good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think it certainly is a help, and Chuck is a nice guy, but boy, he was really trying, I said Chuck, cool it, just relax, take it nice and easy, take a deep breath, because he was really trying to go at me, and I said what are you doing? What's the purpose of this? But you know, I think being a straight talker today, with all of the crooked talk, with all of the dumb talk, with all of the people that are incompetent talking, I think it helps, Hugh. I think it's a positive.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, now let me ask you about the big debate between Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. I had Senator Cruz on yesterday, Senator Rubio the week before, and I'm sure they'll all be back before Las Vegas, on metadata collection. Ted Cruz is glad that the NSA got out of it. Marco Rubio wants it back.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> What's Donald Trump think?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I tend to err on the side of security, I must tell you. And I've been there for longer than you would think. But you know, when you have people that are beheading, if you're a Christian, or, and frankly, for lots of other reasons, when you have the world looking at us and would like to destroy us as quickly as possible, I err on the side of security. And so you know, that's the way it is.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's the way I've been, and some people like that, frankly, and some people don't like that. But I think, and I'm not just saying that since Paris, I'm saying for quite some time. I assume when I pick up my telephone, people are listening to my conversations anyway, if you want to know the truth. It's pretty sad commentary, but I err on the side of security.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, so you would be in favor of restoring the Patriot Act?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think that would be fine. As far as I'm concerned, that would be fine.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, now a couple of economic issues. If there is tax reform, will Donald Trump argue to save the home mortgage interest deduction...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> ...the charitable interest deduction...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> ...and the state income tax deduction?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the home interest, let's go one at a time. Yes, because I know, nobody knows housing like I do. Nobody knows jobs like I do. And nobody knows the economy like I do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you take the interest deduction away, you're going to destroy the housing industry.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Amen. God, thank you. Would you call some Republicans and tell them that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they don't get it. Look, these are people that never produced a job, most of them, I guess. You know, I'm not talking about all of them, but you know, most of them. And you know, I was going over it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've produced tens of thousands of jobs. I have thousands of employees. But I've produced over my life tens of thousands of jobs. Nobody knows more about that than me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You get rid of the interest deduction, interest mortgage deduction, you will see a housing industry that crashes. And it's, in a sense, our biggest industry. You understand.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You add it all up together...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Four jobs for every one created, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's our biggest industry.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> How about the charitable deduction?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say that I would leave the charitable deduction. People do use it. They do give to charity. Some abuse the deduction.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm sure we can do certain work on it. But the charitable deduction would be fine, as far as I'm concerned, to leave.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> And the state income tax deduction, because I live in California, and I think the state will collapse if that goes away.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, no, I think you're going to have to leave it. You're going to have to leave it. Otherwise, you're going to see some states...now the problem with that is, you know, you have some states that have really been well-behaved, and they do it right. And those people are actually, you know, not benefiting by this, whereas you have other states that are over-levered, over-borrowed, and they're taking maximum advantage of the federal government, which in a way is unfair.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, you have other states that don't even have the problem because they have so little debt out there. So those people or those states are being punished by, but in the meantime, I think you have to leave it. You're changing the ballgame so rapidly that I could see leaving it, and I would be fine with it.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Last question on taxes, last question for today, and I'll see you in Las Vegas.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> The Forbes 400 has you listed at 121. I went through and added up the top 50 today, you know, beginning with Gates and then Warren Buffett and the Koch Brothers and Larry Ellison. The top 50 have $1.1 trillion dollars in wealth. Shouldn't we have a wealth tax in this country, Donald Trump, to redistribute? That's a lot of money in the hands of 50 people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think so. These are job producers, and I don't think so. And I'm not saying that because I'm on the list. I'm just saying I don't think so at all.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that when you do that, you really, you know, there was a time years ago when I wanted to pay off the deficit, and I said I would be okay if they took a certain percentage of what I had, and which was much smaller than what I have right now, but took a certain percentage and let's pay off the deficit. But now, our deficit is so humongous, nothing's going to matter. I mean, the only thing that's going to pay off our deficit is having a raging, great economy, which under my tax plan, and by the way, the great Larry Kudlow agrees with me, he loves my plan, you know that, and he's a friend of yours and he's a terrific guy.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Yup.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But under my tax plan, I think we're going to have a really dynamic economy. That's what we have to do.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> But the income inequality, the wealth inequality, not income inequality, when you're got people with $50 billion dollars, and you've got people with $50 dollars, it does produce incredible disturbance. I think actually that's what's behind Black Lives Matter, is that there's income inequality. It's behind Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. Doesn't a wealth tax at least take some of the sting out of that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, but then you do take away the incentive to go out and become great, and you take away a lot of incentive from a lot of people. So it's a double, you know, it's very much of a double-edged sword. Where you can solve the problem and really solve your problems is make the economy great, and make the economy strong.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> More on that in Las Vegas. Donald Trump, always a pleasure to talk to you, thank you for spending time with me today. Feel free to tweet out they can listen to it this afternoon.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will. Next time, I have to do it before I speak to you, though. That's the only problem. You know, doesn't help right now, right?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Oh, it does. They can listen to the podcast anytime.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, well, I'll do something.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Thank you. Talk to you soon.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Hugh, great honor, thank you.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> See you in Vegas.
