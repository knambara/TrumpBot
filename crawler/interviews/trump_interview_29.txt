<Howard Stern> <Negative> Some gay dude has started Miss Gay Universe and he's upset because Donald Trump said, Look dont use the name Miss Gay Universe cause I spent a fortune buying Miss Universe, and developing it, and creating it.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> We play the tape of the gap.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And he's on the phone, cause he heard me talking about him, but I do really agree with Donald Trump then.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But what we keep hearing why he should just give up the name.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Ben.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So heres my thought.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Okay.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Donald Trump buys Miss Universe, pays. I dont know, millions of dollars for it.
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> He did.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> And the people who created Miss Universe in the first place, did a lot of work to create that franchise.
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> That's right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So, you come along -- and then --
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> So there's the idea with Miss Universe so that a lot of other companies that use the Universe name.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. The reason You're calling here, your thought your event in Miss Gay Universe is, because this universe is well known already. Why not come up with an original name where you dont sort of...
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Like, Ms. Galaxy?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Think about it. Sounds like a Jetson comic strip.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, but why you using the name Miss Universe, is because you like the idea that everyone knows it already. But the guy spent a fortune developing it.
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> But he didn't spend a fortune?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He spent a fortune.
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> No, he didn't.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Millions, but you you haven't spent a dime.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Oh, okay.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I mean, what entitles you to take the name this Gay Universe?
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> It entitles me to take the name Miss Gay and then do whatever I want with that Universe. that's why there's this Ms. Gay America, there is Ms. Gay USA. There is Ms. Continental. It's out there for anyone to take, he doesn't own the universe?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, no, It's that he owns the -- Why not Miss Pretty..(Inaudible word) -- What is your event by the way? What is your name again?
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> Ben.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Ben. But what's your, what's your --
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> Lauren Fox.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right, Lauren -- Why? You call yourself Lauren Fox? When did that start?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You mean, when dressed as a woman?
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> When I'm dressed? Yeah. When im -- when I'm doing that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So Ben, I mean Lauren, It's a bunch of dudes getting together and dressing up as women.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why not call it the Miss Transvestite. Why not call, Transvestite?
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> No, because transvestite is the clinical term for usually straight man dressing up.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I'm saying you take the guys trademark, Miss Universe and trading often. You dont see that? Miss Gay-laxy. Miss --
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> It's the first time his ratings were good with this past three years.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> That's how hard his worlds --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. Well, he spent a lot of money and was in the hold for a while now I dont have the money.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Yeah, we've been working on this, the past three years. This isn't just something we just did out of like, the blue.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. But dude, he doesn't want -- You haven't paid for the name, Miss Universe -- All right, ma'am? All right ma'am?
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> About that -- Oh, that's so much better. Can you fancy my french fries? All right, go ahead --
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> How about Ms. Fag?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Lauren. Hey, come on. Whether it was ma'am.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> Im sorry.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why do you have to go there?
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> I'm sorry.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Can we all get along?
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> I dont mind that. You know I'm listening to your show this morning, which was pretty good.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thank you.
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> And, and the gay stuff is fine but, the Fag --, I dont like, fag --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, Come on. Are you? You dont call a guy a fag?
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> You know I'm a little upset at myself too. Cause say a homo, Yeah, Ms. Homo is better.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Now we got there. Sounds more like a milk. They called the milk commercial again.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But seriously why not Miss -- I mean, make -- make up a whole new name that you own, and that's yours. It's like, It's like --
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> I would still try to..to fight it, and the whole thing is this were not the first to, to do this. Were just the first to go further than anybody else.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Now if he you would said like, okay -- he had a radio show you call it, Gay Howard Stern Show, because you know Howard Stern is a name that I've spent time --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Every time we tune in --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> We all tune in...
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> In Howard Stern, Howard Stern is the name, that is given as a given name.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But so is Miss Universe, so It's a name he bought. He could've just start any beauty pageant, he had to buy the Miss Universe name.
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> Right. And Ill think you did in America, Miss America which is -- Miss US of A. But she --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Lauren, here make a point --
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Sure.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Jared, you said that Miss Galaxy sounds like a Jetsons thing right?
<Jared Fox> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> If Miss Universe pageant didn't exist --
<Jared Fox> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> This universe would sound the same way.
<Jared Fox> <Positive> Exactly, took it and made it something special.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> He didn't take it away, something special.
<Jared Fox> <Neutral> Somebody else...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Somebody did...
<Jared Fox> <Neutral> As in...
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> Somebody did -- You're right.
<Jared Fox> <Neutral> He brought it, and he paid for the right to use it. You haven't paid for the right to use it.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Uhm, It's no different than anybody else using or trying to develop a business and stuff like that...
<Jared Fox> <Neutral> All for his business.
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> It doesn't author his -- [Inaudible]
<Jared Fox> <Positive> Sure. Is that what You're saying, Ms. Gay universe cause you like the..the parody of Miss Universe.
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> It isn't a parody and I dont know narrative.
<Jared Fox> <Negative> That seems you to a worse home [Inaudible]
<Jared Fox> <Neutral> It's You're taking the name as universe and trading off of it.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Wow.
<Jared Fox> <Positive> You won. Come on be honest. I mean, the reason you like --
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> No I'm not --
<Jared Fox> <Positive> The reason you like the name Miss Universe is because You're trading off in a Miss Universe. You want to make that?
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> That is when we did all this. You really think that I thought we would start getting letters from Donald Trumps attorneys?
<Jared Fox> <Positive> Yes.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well -- we do.
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> You're very wrong at that...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> About Miss Universe and say well call ourselves Miss Universe.
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> We will do the Miss Universe because we have seen this people have tried it before --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> The reason You're getting letters from Donald Trump let me explain it to you. Maybe You're insignificant and maybe you are and You're just a pimple on Donald Trumps head, But even if you get away with it --
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> I can.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That mean the next guy gets away with it or the next transvestite gets away with it. [Inaudible] How do you put it on TV?
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> Then, what's the difference between -- But isn't this, Jeez -- isn't this what you were saying about this morning about.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Let me give you the example. I called my book Miss America my second book because my father used to always say, Oh here comes Miss America.
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Now. I'm not doing a beauty pageant like the Miss America. I was doing a beauty pageant called it, Miss America.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> But still, Miss America got a little upset.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I mean miss America. And they looked at it and they said, Well were going to decide not to go after him because he's not doing a beauty pageant. I'm calling myself, Miss America.
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It's not, It's not a rip off of.
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> I dont think were ripping off.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, you are. In other words call it any other name It's come into play.
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> What about in this, new Miss Universe. Why was that allowed to go through.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I dont know that you probably shouldn't have it.
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> You know I mean, but then that's my big question is.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Sometimes people go after something and sometimes they dont.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I think maybe Miss New Universe already existed. We all know Donald --
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> No, it didn't.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But the company.
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> No. We were already. We were, we were, they were ahead of us by two months and their whole process, and the whole situation was --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I just get why the guy is upset, and I got to tell you, I understand that. I think you ought to develop something of your own I think. [Inaudible] I mean It's easy enough to come up with a name.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> And shouldn't she say a pageant everybody knows what You're up to. Why do you need Miss Universe?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, they've you know.
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> Because I think It's a good way. It's the way the ranking of what, of a female impersonation, the drag queens. If we had Ms. America, we have Ms. US of A, we have Ms. Comb. No there's nothing that takes it above that. And I'm not going to call it, Ms. Galaxy and couldn't call it Ms. International...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Ms. World?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Call it Ms. International.
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> Ms. World is already out there. They're trying to get their trademark done with it. They will all...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I'm trying to understand that. imagine you start Miss International --
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And then, and then you, you pump millions of dollars into some freaky way it becomes the biggest thing on the planet. And some douche bag comes along and goes, Ill call myself Miss Internate-tional. And then you though, you know what? The guys rip me off. Come on get with it.
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> And that's the way the American policy works...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, it doesn't work that way.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> You know what? As I read your book which I thought was great.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thanks.
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> The thing is, as you said it out the same way and the whole thing is this.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No I didn't. I never took anybody's I know
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> No, but It's fighting for what I believe.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Fight for something of your own. Dont compare me to you taking Donald Trumps product.
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> But the way that you try to, to demise or to put down myself as if nothing more than a pimple on it. That.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You are.
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> I dont care if I'm a hair follicle on his head. What she should haven't done. But the thing is is that It's my right and my feeling and as our organization is to go through and do something that we want to do.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It's his right to sue you, and try and prove in court
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Most definitely in that --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It's his trademark.
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> I want it so bad is that we aren't backing down. We want our day before the court.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Course You're not, because is the most exciting ever happening.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Everything is more publicity for you is good.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Cause heres my guess about you. Lauren, Lauren, Lauren -- Lauren..Lauren
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> [Inaudible] How can you say that?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Heres my guess about you. And you wont probably admit to this.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Oh. It's a funny thing.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Your father didn't pay much attention to you. And now Donald Trump is still paying --
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> It's very nice to say, since my father just passed away. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Exactly. Exactly.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Cool.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And now You're looking for a new dad.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> My father is great. My father is --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No I dont think so. I think there's...
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> Wait...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> A lot of panic there in your voice.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> No -- My father was great. He was -- [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, You're father...
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> My father taught me how to fight for myself and how to be strong and no matter what we were with all
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> If he paid more attention to you wouldn't be looking for Donald Trump to be a dad.
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> Donald Trump would be my dad?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, that's what's going on here. You want to get in. You want everyone paying attention to you. You go to court and Donald Trump is meeting.
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> I think you've been reading Dr. Phil.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Lauren. Lauren.. what are you wearing right now. Come on --
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> Hey hey hey...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you dressed as Lauren, or just as Ben. You're dressed as Lauren?
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> Yup or...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What are you wearing underpants?
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> Would you stop.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why?
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> Because they dont want to talk about what I'm wearing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why not?
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> Lets talk about what I'm gonna to wear to court, a Chanel suit or an Armani suit?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Lauren? Areare you dressed as Lauren in court or just Ben?
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> That's what everybody is asking. I haven't decided yet.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> When did you start dressing like a woman?
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> Ahh.. about 15 years ago.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Now or are you like beautiful? Are you like a funny -- ?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Are you like a big fat slut. A lot of the'se guys could dress up as a women big fat dudes, like you know what?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> They're so funny drags.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> There's no illusion there.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I mean is he about drag queens. Okay, well well get off this for a second. Why do a lot of drag queens insist on like performing in shows where they lip sync?
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Because, why would you want to hear them sing?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, that's my point. Like, if you could sing then id say okay. It's a weird show. They all dressed up as women...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> And pretend to be singing.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And pretend to be singing.
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> Right.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> You know what Howard I just called Mr. Trump.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> And he would love to come on air and talk about this thing.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh really?
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Oh I would love. Oh my god. Cool.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, cool because we could.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Look how excited You're getting?
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Is this? And this is the most exciting thing that I've done.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes it is, you are looking for Mr. be your father and You're looking for him to pay attention. I want to let Mr. --
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Let Mr. Trump talk now Lauren?
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Lauren? Lauren?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Ben, even the train comes to stop.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Mr. Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Ive tried, I've spent 10 minutes trying to explain for Lauren here,=. That what he is doing is trading off of the name that you spent millions of dollars developing. And of course he has to put a stop to it. What do you say?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all I didn't love to come in the air because I wouldn't use the word love.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I didn't know what this is all about. Ahh, are you the gentleman that wants to do?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Ms. Gay universe.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I see..okay. Well you know, how are you? I bought that, I spent a lot of money on it over the last five or six years as you know it was close to tanking.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And over the course of about a five year period I built it up you know to my company I dont get up into a position where we got the highe'st ratings of the evening.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> NBC it was NBC is number one show.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Congratulations.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In round seven or eight shows of the week and it has a great value.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And I thought you were nuts when you bought it because I didn't think you'd be able to do it
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know he did the smart thing was the switch he switched partner. It was with you with NBC and I was with CBS. Really I had no idea that broadcasting it and then I switched to NBC and that was a great move. And NBC has done a great job.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> They have been very supportive and I'm a big fan of Mr. Trump I think is admire I admire him I admire.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why dont you leave his trademark alone.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Yeah, why are you bothering him?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And call yourself, what were you saying, Miss International, you aint got a problem.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> I am not bothering him.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Of course you are. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know, it does, there is a great confusion. And you know there is sort of a reliance of the name as universe which really does have a tremendous value. Now like you know many many many millions of dollars, perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars. And -- you know you know Howard It's the largest show in terms of ratings, It's the largest show broadcast anywhere in the world over the past year though. Well yeah but It's taken me about five years to get it to that point.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, you -- well you sir --
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Well, like you or anybody else needs to build and take it from there. Now, what about in this Ms. New Universe or what about Miss Nude Universe since I've got you on the phone. What about Miss Nude Universe?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we know nothing about that but if we do hear something about that you know we dont get everything we could, we cant, we just cant know everything but if we, if we found there is something like that wed probably be inclined to see that also...
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> You know there is -- are there any other thing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We will look into that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donald Trump will look into the Donald trump principle.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> One thing I was because I was like I called your attorney to say who knew nothing about it and your staff has been wonderful, your your assistant. And just to say, if I was Mr. Trump someone would be on a platter.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why?
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Because to allow this Ms. Nude Universe which is a porn site.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Do you know what it costs to keep suing everyone?
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Well, that's what they do?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's the point. He says he sues, if he learns of Miss Universe which obviously is unaware he's going to sue them too. You know you've got to protect your trademark.
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> He used them once they've already I dont believe have their trademark.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No it doesn't matter. Yeah about a period of time to see. You can bring it over the course of I think even through years more and what Miss.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Lauren, what You're missing here is Mr. Trump paid for the name Miss Universe and filled it up.
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> Why not fill it up with Miss Gay Universe.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're not, who you are paying.
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> I hate that we haven't paid anything with the lawyer fees that they, they put us bait. They push us to go through and the Lord
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will say this when you announced we were inundated the phone calls. We have to take this Miss Universe office in New York and I know the switchboard was just inundated with calls from you know tremendous numbers of people all over the county. Saying.. yeah you know this is terrible you have to stop it now. I dont know what their problem was in terms of you know terrible and the use of the word terrible. And I guess, I dont really care too much about that. But we were inundated with calls, so we should stop this.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Confusion, this was confusion --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, confusion
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> The only reason that we held off on publicity and with your brave attorney is there who we have a good rapport or I have a good rapport with you --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And It's filled with you know that be thrilled day.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Pardon me?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Talk nicely.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Say talk nicely.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Why dont you just find another name and go out there and do your thing. Build it up like I did over a course of five or six years. And I think you have a great success.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I think that's a great idea and that's what I've recommended to Lauren.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Well, thank you guys for your. Bye. What makes America, America?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well, You're wrong. You're wrong to strip someones else awe.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Hey, I'm not wrong.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Because You're stealing from someone. You know why'd you call it Miss Universe? Because Miss Universe is popular and something he built up. Come on Lauren. It's obvious. Lauren be reasonable.
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> I am being reasonable
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And the lawyers love you Lauren because You're running up Mr. Trumps bill. that's why they love you.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Really? And actually my lawyers are very happy about it Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Of course.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Yes of course they are and they just keep sending the bills.
<Jared Fox> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You bet.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> You know what. I dont even get a paycheck from Mr. Trump and I was the one that found some of the flaws that his attorneys did. You sure You're not working for my lawyers? I wish I was.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Lets see lets see.
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> I dont get a paycheck from Trump.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Wait a second. Lets see what Andrea has to say. Go ahead Andrea.
<Andrea (Caller)> <Neutral> Oh I'm from Buffalo New York.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay cool.
<Andrea (Caller)> <Neutral> Is he a lawyer?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why is he a scammer in Florida.
<Andrea (Caller)> <Positive> Laura in Buffalo. Laura. Yes. Yes that's true. Coffeeville and I'm a scam artist. I want you to go alone while you were writing. Oh my god what.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> That's smile I'm honey. I'm not a scam artist. And you know right where everybody is and I appreciate the call. that's that's not true at all.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Would you mind would you mind if I started a miss really gay universe.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> Sure. Would you mind. No I wouldn't because you can go ahead with it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh come on. You're not being honest now. John go ahead go ahead. help me yeah.
<John Melendez> <Positive> Me? I dont know what to tell you. Mr. Trump is very good about calling you and you've been good about crying but Lauren You're on your way out of line on this one. And Id be the first one to agree with you. You right but You're not. And Howard I have to go back to building buildings.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. So good luck and good luck. Now why are you wishing him luck Arnold. Why not say hey you know what. Why?
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> You know what. he's a good businessman. You know what no matter what happens. that's what makes Trump Mr. Trump.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Stop the ass kissing. he's not thrilled with having to spend money on suing you. Right Mr. Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I dont love giving money to lawyers but It's like modern day necessity as you know very well Howard.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Anything good luck to you because he's got a battery of lawyers and hell never let you win.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right. Hell win.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And rightly so. All right. Donald Trump saying --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Goodbye Howard, goodbye Robin.
<Allison> <Positive> You know how. In all seriousness there's a precedent in this case that would help Donald Trump. Years ago a guy tried to start a gay baseball team. All gay guys --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Allison> <Neutral> He called it the, gay Yankees and the Yankees sued him.
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> Right. And the guy had to change the name of the team.
<Ben Kuhns> <Neutral> Exactly
<Allison> <Neutral> To the match.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But nobody would be interested in this here the way it was in the Yankees. You know what I mean.
<Allison> <Neutral> Right exactly. That would be the same thing if that happened.
<John Melendez> <Neutral> You know you cant use a name that's already established
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay. All right.
<Ben Kuhns> <Negative> Why is it if you go to the internet you can see were only one of like they'll tell you at his office early one of like 200 that want there's no black you know universe there's no you know crime universe myth. You know from Miss Universe, I mean were were only one and I realize I'm not stupid I realize the whole fact is if it wasn't to do with Mr. Trump I wouldn't be it. You know the phone calls or you wouldn't be discussing it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm just simply going to call it a million other things that go ahead.
<Ben Kuhns> <Positive> I just want to get that.
