<Howard Stern> <Negative> Speaking of a guy who has a building, Donald Trump is on the phone. He's promoting the Shannon Briggs fight.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, really?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, they're playing at the top of the Trump Taj Mahal.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I didn't know Shannon had another fight.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, I like Shannon.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I guess Donald's on the phone.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Did Shannon loses last fight?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He's a good guy.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> He fought Lennox Lewis, remember?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. That's a tough one. Hey, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hey, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How are you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> See what I do, I promote fights, how about you?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hey, you're into everything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Promoting.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Constantly promoting.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Donald Trump has the best luck. Let me ask you a question.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You know that story I read yesterday?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What was it?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> The Miss Universe, and I forget who was it, the candidate --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Stephanie Seymour?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes. Stephanie Seymour in a see-through dress.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Donald probably liked that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I thought it was fantastic, CBS wasn't enamored, you know it's a prime time.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well, let me explain to people,Stephanie Seymour, the model, was one of the judges at the Miss Universe contest except she wore see-through outfit, so CBS freaked out cause they got to put it on TV.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Right. And it was obvious she had no underwear on.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was really very see-through, she's great and she's fantastic, but she --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You had sex with her, right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She was not wearing anything. Why not just, you know, just walk off.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. Why not just come in naked. Well we could put bars across here. You -- you've had sex with Stephanie Seymour, what's that like?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I haven't.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I don't believe that for a minute.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But she's terrific, I tell you, she was a great judge.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> See, as soon as he says she's terrific, I know he banged her.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You're saying he had sex with her?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, of course.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That's the code, huh.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He has great sex. You know Marla Maples was great and everything but I knew Donald would get divorced because too many women throwing themselves at him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She was really a good -- a good person, I -- You know, with all fairness, we had a great time.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Donald, try to repay her for [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I'm trying to be nice, Robin.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I'm telling the truth now. You thought it was wonderful for her to stick by you on a tough time, and you are trying to reward her.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true, she did stick by me. You know on the early '90s I did have a tough time, and it wasn't the greatest time of my life, and that she was there so, you know.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So, hey, you did figure you'd married and paid her a couple of bucks.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But wait a minute, Donald how can you only give your wife a million dollars.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why not?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't want to be like other people to give too much.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know what, she's a young girl and you want to keep her motivated in life.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I wanted to do something.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right, you don't want her to get lazy and fat, you want her to, you know, listen, a million is nice, any more than that. And then she would --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Will get used to a lot more.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But Robin you don't think that was generous? Seriously, not a million, it's other things.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, you know you have to make sure a little Tiffany has a roof over her head.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She's going to be fine, for a million she's gonna be just fine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She'll be beautifully taken care of. Got to be.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you have to visit the kid and everything?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have all the rights and everything else, all visitation.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So, do you do visit or you don't?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I get along great with Marla.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> He loves his children
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm actually surprising to most people that I'm really a good father.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I believe it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great kids and everything.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I wish you were my father. I remember in the '90s Donald was down to like his four and a half billion.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That's when he has [Inaudible] of about, you know, $100 million a year.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Let me ask you a question about money. Let me ask you a question about money. So, when you -- you know when you when you are hurting, right in the 90s? Cause the real estate market fell apart and everything. I mean, you were really, you know,
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was -- I was in deep trouble.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. Are you now back to the point where you're richer than you ever were, or are you worth than now who owns our company.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, what happened is, you know, in the '80s I was doing great in the early '90s the world was really collapsing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> When you say you were doing great in the '80s, were you worth, what, a billion?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He was on the list.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was on the list and I was very high on the list and now I'm much higher on the list, so it worked out well.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> How do you worth now, are you were at $2 billion?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I guess they say much more than that. I have no idea what I'm worth.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I don't believe that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't believe who?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That I don't believe that you don't know what you're worth. It's like taking your temperature, you do it every half hour. It's depending.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know this building, what's Trump Tower with buildings you never really know. You know somebody comes along now and this market than they more than a twist, and other markets up at less.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He's got a beautiful building, Donald. International Trump --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> They're like selling these apartments that like $10 million.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But don't forget though, he doesn't get the money for that. I was just reading the paper that I our boss bought an apartment in your building for $11 million bucks. Now, but he bought it from a guy who bought it from you for $6 million.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's correct. I sold it, I sold the apartment a couple of years ago to somebody else and, you know, the building is just a winner and it's got up unbelievably in value, but I sold that apartment two years ago to somebody else for substantially less.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But I'm talking about this --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know if I feel stupid.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I mean at the time that's what the market will bear.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> At the time I thought I got a good price, I thought I was a genius, you know.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Even that apartment you were like, tagging for yourself at one of your new buildings.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> The price tag was like $10 million.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. I sold that for a lot out of money. I got $13 million. And you know that's been a great building, that's Trump International Hotel.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It's a beautiful building.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh, gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it has been a tremendous success, you know, it has been great. And you know, to have Mel there's really an honor because he's incredible. He's also, as you know CBS -- CBS took the space and the General Motors building which I own.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And they're going to be doing an incredible studio there. I guess they're going to start off with The Morning Show and maybe it evolves into much more than even that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, but I can't get a new studio.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You can have a piece in the General Motors building.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They won't let me do it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Come on, we'll talk to Mel.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Like we're in prison here.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, you talk to him, he won't talk to me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we should talk to Mel about that, we have to have you in a good location.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So, now you're worth, let's say, you could even be more than $2 billion.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I think much more. I'm worth now much more than that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Where do you live now? Do you live in one of your buildings?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Who knows what I'm worth, Howard? I live in one of my buildings. I live in Trump Tower.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You do? How many square feet do you have in there?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Too many.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Too many square feet.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I sit here all by myself with this huge apartment and I said, what am I doing?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And how often do you like, have chicks up there? Like you have one steady chick right now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You wouldn't wanna know.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right. Let me understand your life. Do you have one steady girlfriend?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well lately I have had one girlfriend.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And which model is this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Melania Knauss. It was hard to believe you guess she was a model.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I know you love beautiful women.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love women. I love beautiful women.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. Right. And this Claudia Knauss --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Melania.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Whatever.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Melania Knauss. From Austria.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you call Meladia?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Melania. From Austria
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> We can't pronounce these names, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You get a normal -- And what happen, does she live with you or does she --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, not at this point, to be honest.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You're not gonna live with anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I'm just finishing off with the Marla thing, in all fairness, so not at this point, but a little bit soon. But she's terrific.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He has so many building, Howard. He puts up another building.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You have to give this broad a building?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I don't. You know they -- they do very well. I like somebody that can go out and really do well. I have a friend, he's got more problems than anybody I've ever seen for women. I mean the guy went half of my units. I think he's my largest customer, he went half of my units bringing a different woman in each unit.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Most convenient [Inaudible]. That's beautiful.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Every time he sees me, says, I'm your biggest customer I have 18 of your apartments. One of those crazy deals.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow. That's lucky. Man, that's some kind of life. So, you are with one model now.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> How long has this been going on?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I've been with her about eight months.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, long time.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I have to take a look at her. How old is she?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's on the cover of Ocean Drive, I guess last month.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How old is she?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's 28.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Twenty-eight, that's a little lower to hell.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know, it's a little low.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You really are maturing.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No. No. I'm telling you she's probably 18.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm so proud of myself for Robin because they are getting older as grow, you know what I mean. Now I have a hard time cracking the low 20s, you know, just a hard time.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I told you, I saw him one night, I thought he was with a school girl.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And 28 year old is almost a geezer. God, 28. I can't believe it. Now, tell me about this fight Shannon Briggs will fight Francoise Botha on August 7th. Isn't Francois a white guy?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I thought he is a South African.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's a white a white guy against a black guy, which very sadly drives like crazy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He can understand that, Howard.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> He understood it very well he created this.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> This Francois Botha stands a chance against Shannon Briggs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think probably both are supposed to be very good fighters. Shannon, lost -- I think he's like 30 and 2.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> He lost to Mike Tyson last, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, that wasn't him. That was another white guy.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, there's another white guy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They all looked the same.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why don't we get two white guys to fight Shannon Riggs?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know. Why not?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Has that ever been done?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Botha is a very, very good fighter, and he's like the European champion or close. And he's gonna be fighting on the 7th, the August 7th.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> At the Taj Mahal. At Trump Taj Mahal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it'll be great.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And it will be on Pay-per-view as well.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Or you can see it live by calling Ticketmaster 800-736-1420.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love the site, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, it's fun.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I always love it. It's all, you know, in a world that you and I live in we have to remember that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You say in a world that's full of BS, I got to hit the bottom on you. Go ahead finish that thought.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We really, you know, I just love the ring. I've always loved the fights because there's none of that -- I mean, it's just two guys in the ring slugging it out.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Moment away you have to fight your way through the real estate world, so maybe you relate to these fighters.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that was a tough fight. And in the early '90s, the world was really in not such great shape. It wasn't a great shape for me but it came out very good, and I'm happy about it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you nude right now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. In fact I'm in the office.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You know he only sleeps two-three hours a night.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Which is pretty pathetic when you get right down to.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What did you do last night for fun?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I actually went to the fashion awards show.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> To pick up more models.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Working on his portfolio.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They did a nice job last night.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> The fashion awards.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The fashion awards show on Lexington. It was at 22nd of Lexington and the armory.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you meet any more models?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll tell you what, there are a lot of models there. I didn't go for that reason of course.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You told me you were lining up the next Mrs. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I guess that process has to begin.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You will never going to get married.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You'll never marry again, would you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. I would. You know, sadly it is a great institution if you get it right. Maybe, perhaps not sadly but it's a great institution if you get it right, and you know one of these days I'm going to get it right.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What does he mean? He does not know that [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He's a smart guy. He's saying that because that makes the chicks interested, cause they think he'll gonna marry her.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I see.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know what you are up to.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It's wink, wink.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You understand, Howard. Marriage correctly done is a wonderful thing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It's a beautiful thing.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Wink wink.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, usually it doesn't usually work out that way.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. It's hard to fall in love with those supermodels. You never know which one is good.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> But Donald, do you worry because you have a daughter who's a model.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do and I have a deal with her she's just 17 and she's doing great, Ivanka. And she made me promise her swear to her that I would never date a girl younger than her. Howard, as she -- she grows older, the field is getting very limited.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. I mean the nerve of her. Now you can't go out with 16-year-olds. But you know, let me tell you something Donald will not get married again, this is my guess.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I don't blame him.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> In fact, Liberace will find the right woman before Donald does. I'm telling you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, Howard was at my wedding, Robin. And he made a statement that was a disaster. I don't know if you even know this, Howard. I came up to the room and there was huge press. I don't think I've ever seen so much press.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's true.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thousands and thousands of reporters. And with all the celebs, everybody, including O.J. Simpson, who you -- I guess you got a picture with him there and put it at the back of your book or something.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thanks to you, yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That was compliments of Donald. I didn't ask for 10% I just send him the picture.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right, you were very generous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They said we need OJ's permission, I said don't worry about it OJ's I just got bigger problem. He didn't bother with that permission.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No. I don't think so.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You get permission from Trump.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But he put it on the back of his book but everybody's walking in, hundreds of celebrities and I get back and you know, rather than doing what you're supposed to be doing I turn on the television to see how the press is covering my wedding, right. This is not a good sign for a long term marriage, I can tell you that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I knew I was in trouble right then.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Watching TV.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So, Marla and I are watching and Howard made the most incredible statement. You remember, Howard?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. I do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> First of all, he said, there wasn't a dry eye in the house. The next thing he said was, I'm giving the marriage four months. So, with all the celebrities walking and talking to the press. Yes, it's a beautiful couple, they're wonderful, that they're going to be happy forever. You know, all of that stuff was cut. Howard they put on and he said doing a number. And you're wrong, Howard. The marriage lasted much longer.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Three years. I was off by a few months. Well, listen congratulations on all your success and all your models. Believe me, every man would like to be you and we'll all watch the Shannon Briggs fight with Francis Botha, Francois Botha
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Francois Botha
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, that first name is. He's a white guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, both and you great. I listen all the time and you know that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thanks, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you take care of yourself.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Take care.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So long, Robin.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Bye bye.
