<Sebastian Gorka> <Negative> As a child of parents who escaped Communism, I was very moved when you told Congress that America would never be a socialist country. Did you ever think that any American president would have to say such a thing to Congress?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I never did. I never thought it would be part of the dialogue. I am happy to report that I don't think that it will be lasting very long. Our country is doing better than it has ever done economically, with the stock market and 401Ks -- and I'm not just talking about people of wealth, I'm talking about people who haven't had a job in years and now have jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have the greatest number of jobs that we've ever had, almost 160 million, the stock market today just hit another all-time high -- all three markets -- and people are great. So I think that it would be very surprising to me if that debate carries forward much longer. I hope it won't, but it could very well be a big dialogue, a big part of the election, but we're talking about not so very far away.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Can you imagine that Sebastian, like seventeen months? Can you imagine that? Time flies!
<Sebastian Gorka> <Positive> It does!
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Amazing
<Sebastian Gorka> <Neutral> Back when I served as your deputy assistant for strategy --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And did a great job. You really did a great job!
<Sebastian Gorka> <Positive> Thank you. In this room, it was just the two of us, May or June of 2017. You said to me, "Sebastian, they'll never find anything because there isn't anything," in regard to Russian collusion.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's true.
<Sebastian Gorka> <Positive> Since then, you have been vindicated by Congress, twice, and now by the Department of Justice with the close of the Mueller investigation. Yet on the left, many still refuse to give up their Russian delusions. Presumably, this is a positive factor for you in 2020 and for the broader "make America great again" agenda.
<Sebastian Gorka> <Positive> Is it good that they're constantly beating this dead horse? Is it a good thing for you, Mr. President?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, it was so preposterous that at the beginning, I didn't even take it seriously. When I first heard about "Russia and the Trump administration," I literally didn't even take it seriously, but then I saw that they'll do anything to win. They'll say anything they have to say. And if you had told me that it could lead to a special counsel, with all that that entails, I would have said, "That's an impossibility." But we won, there was no collusion.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The problem is I think they could have made that determination in the first two days. I also think that a special counsel never should have been appointed. It's disgraceful for our country. But we handled it properly. I gave a level of transparency that's never been given in the history of our country before, ever.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I did that for a reason. I did that: number one, I thought it was important, and number two, I knew there was nothing there.
<Sebastian Gorka> <Negative> This is something that I had to get used to when I came to work for you. As an incredibly successful businessman, as a billionaire who had relations, good relations, with the media for decades, were you prepared for what happened when you became president, and how the media has treated you, treated you and your family and anybody who works for you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I don't think anybody can be prepared to take the greatest onslaught in the history of politics by a very dishonest media. It was really incredible. And you know, the amazing thing is that we're doing great with poll numbers. In fact, I see, we're at forty-nine today in Rasmussen… we're at fifty-one in another one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that's with an onslaught that nobody's ever seen before; it's amazing. And so I think that the word "prepared" means that you have to prepare yourself quickly, and I prepared myself quickly. It's incredible that the public gets it, they really get it. And if you look at the approval rating of the press, it's unbelievably low, lower than it's ever been.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it should be. You know the incredible thing: I'll explain it to the public, and they get it better than anyone. But I will have a story, and the press will take that story, and if it's good they'll make it bad, or they'll make it as little good as possible. And it's incredible to watch, because they don't really know the story, and they don't know the inner workings of the story.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not talking about all media, but I'm talking about a hell of a lot of it; it is totally dishonest, it's incredible. For instance, you'll see stories on Sean Hannity, or Laura Ingraham, or Tucker Carlson, or Lou Dobbs, or Fox and Friends in the morning, revealing a major scandal [committed by liberals], and it won't be picked up by one paper.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It is really incredible. I call it suppression, because they suppress all this news. You would think their ambition would outweigh whatever it is that they're doing because they'd all get Pulitzer prizes. Instead they get Pulitzer prizes for telling lies.
<Sebastian Gorka> <Negative> When I was last here to see you, I was in the White House Press Briefing Room, and Abilio "Jim" Acosta bowls past me, grabs my shoulder, and in front of witnesses, says "What are you doing here? This is for real journalists." That's what Acosta said. He has a high opinion of himself.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, it is incredible how wrong they have been.
<Sebastian Gorka> <Negative> And the Mueller report --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Mueller would have loved to have written something negative, Mueller and his Trump-haters, angry Democrats. If they had one phone call, if they had anything, even a small conversation, they would've tried to make it into a collusion. They spent $35 million, and at the end of two years, they say there's no collusion.
<Sebastian Gorka> <Positive> According to the Heritage Foundation, your first year in office was even more successful than Ronald Reagan's. By any objective measure, your administration in the first two years has achieved more than any modern administration in eight years. Are the next six years of your presidency going to be enough to undo all the harm inflicted by Obama and Clinton?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I think we've done a lot of it in the first two years despite the phony witch hunt. I think that I've done more than any president in the first two years. I wrote out a list for you. It's point after point after point.
<Sebastian Gorka> <Positive> Great. Thank you, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> These are just things that we've done, all big things. And today, again, we hit the highest ever on the Nasdaq and S&P.
<Sebastian Gorka> <Negative> What did Paul Krugman say after your election? That the stock market would crash and never recover?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, is that what he said?
<Sebastian Gorka> <Negative> He said never recover.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Boy, I'll tell you, if you listened to him ... and the guy probably gets a big medal.
<Sebastian Gorka> <Positive> They gave him the Nobel prize.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> For nothing!
<Sebastian Gorka> <Negative> In the last two years, if you look at Capitol Hill, it's been a handful of people who've had your back. It would seem a no-brainer for the GOP to look at what you've achieved and hitch their wagon to your agenda. Does the establishment on the Right understand the significance of 2016, and is that going to change, do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've had great support from a larger number of Republicans than people would think.
<Sebastian Gorka> <Positive> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. I really have had.
<Sebastian Gorka> <Positive> But quietly, you mean.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. But I've been disappointed by some, and some are just openly, you know, out there—I mean, they just don't vote for anything that we're doing. I don't have to say who because all you have to do is check the votes. It's pretty shocking. But I think I've had a lot more support from Republican congressmen and Republican senators than people think.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I really do. I think I've had some really good support. I've also supported them. One of the greatest moments is the election of 2018. We won.
<Sebastian Gorka> <Positive> Right. They were great results.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We won. We picked up two seats in the Senate, and I got rid of two senators that, frankly, had been very bad to me. They were hostile to me. They're gone. We're at 53. Big difference between 53 and 51. So, we won. Judges, remember, are confirmed by the Senate. Now, did we lose the House? Yeah, but I couldn't campaign for all of the people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, it's just so many. I campaigned for Senate, and look at the seats we picked up, with Josh Hawley, with so many, you look at Indiana, you look at North Dakota. Look at the seats we picked up, brand new seats. I was told that Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota could not be beaten, you would be wasting your time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Kevin Cramer ran a great race in North Dakota; he had great support for me. I was told that it was going to be very hard to win in Missouri; it was going to be very hard to win in Indiana. We won in Missouri; we won in Indiana. In Tennessee, look how great Republican Marsha Blackburn did. How about Florida?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at Florida, the Senate race between Republican Rick Scott and Democrat Ron DeSantis. We won. Look at the governor of Georgia, where Oprah, President Obama, and Mrs. Obama campaigned; they staked out there and they campaigned. I went there for Brian Kemp, and we won. Look at Ohio, the governor of Ohio, how important is Ohio?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The governor's great. But he was down 7 and he ended up winning by 7 after that final campaign stop, last day, took him up 14 points. Andy Barr in Kentucky was down by 7; he won by 6. Oh also, Cindy Hyde-Smith in the Senate, she was down by 3 or 4 points, and I went down and did two rallies. These aren't speeches, these are rallies -- big deals, with twenty or twenty-five thousand people, or more.
<Sebastian Gorka> <Negative> I remember when you were with Corey Lewandowski, and we'd always have to expand the stadium. You'd have one location, it wouldn't be big enough. We'd have to find another one, we'd have to find another one --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sebastian, I've never had an empty seat.
<Sebastian Gorka> <Negative> And they're always waiting outside, thousands outside.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Tens of thousands waiting for hours. It shows you how unfair the press is. I go to El Paso, and Beto O'Rouke at that time was the hot new thing, and he heard I was going to do a rally. So he called for a rally. He had 502 people show up. I had 12,000 inside and 35,000 outside. And I mean that place was popping; it broke the record.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We had big screens. And the press said we both had "large" rallies. One reporter in The New York Times actually said his rally was larger than mine...
<Sebastian Gorka> <Negative> Fake News. In the last year, the tactics of the media and the left have been literally disgraceful. From Justice Brett Kavanaugh, his treatment, to the Covington School boys. Do you expect the tactics to get even worse before 2020? If so, what should the average American do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think they can get worse. Because I've been a student of politics for a long time. In the history of politics, I don't think I've ever seen anything like Judge Kavanaugh. Those were fabricated stories, fabricated stories. And I have never seen anyone treated so badly as him, in front of his wife and his children, great people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Never saw anything like it. I don't think it can get worse than that; it can only be the same. That's the highest standard there is in town. And will it continue? The New York Times basically has given up journalistic standards. They've said, "We don't care; we'll say anything." Essentially, they're just making up stories.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They don't even call for confirmation; they don't call for quotes. If they're doing a bad story on me, they don't call for a response. And they couldn't care less. If we tell them it's untrue, it makes zero difference to them, zero.
<Sebastian Gorka> <Negative> As a result, how important is social media?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Without it, I guess, I wouldn't have a voice. Even other voices would be drowned out, you know, like Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs, and "Fox and Friends" in the morning, other people like Steve Doocy and Ainsley Earhardt, and the whole group, you know, great people. But I think they're drowned out because eventually they have to succumb to this horror show that's going on right now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Fake News is a great term for it. I hope I get credit for coming up with that one. But now the Fake News uses it all the time, they'll say "Fake News has reported," they'll say it like they're legitimate, like they're talking about somebody else ... I never thought the press could be so dishonest. The Democratic Party, the radical, liberal Democrats, are in absolute partnership with the media.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's crazy. And when you think of what I've done. I've strengthened the military to a point where it's never been. The military was so depleted, we were close to not having a military. I've rebuilt the steel industry; steel is hopping now. We were not going to have steel made in this country. Energy, look, we're now the number one energy producer in the world, oil and gas.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We weren't close when I got elected. I'm approving pipelines now at a pace that nobody's ever even thought possible. They need them desperately in Texas. I approved all of them: the Dakota Access, the Keystone. I approved them immediately. I got ANWR in Alaska. Ronald Reagan -- and everybody who's tried since -- was unable to get that, and I got that approved in Alaska.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look at the judges. I'm now over 120 judges, two of whom are Supreme Court justices.
<Sebastian Gorka> <Positive> Do you think you'll get a third Supreme Court justice?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That I don't know. I hope she and everybody else lives for a long time.
<Sebastian Gorka> <Negative> Last two questions. How are we doing, Mr. President, in defeating the Deep State?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think, if it all works out, I will consider it one of the greatest things I've done. You look at what's happened to the absolute scum at the top of the FBI. You look at what's happening over at the Justice Department, now we have a great attorney general. Whereas before that, with Jeff Sessions, it was a disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Just a total disaster. He was an embarrassment to the great state of Alabama. And I put him there because he endorsed me, and he wanted it so badly. And I wish he'd never endorsed me. It would have been the greatest non-endorsement I ever had. But it's too bad. But now we have a great attorney general. And I think with the destruction of the Deep State, certainly I've done big damage.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They've come after me in so many different ways; it's been such a disgrace. But I think it'll be one of my great achievements.
<Sebastian Gorka> <Positive> Okay, last question. What would President Trump of 2019 have said to candidate Trump in 2015, by way of advice?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Always be prepared for the unexpected.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hey, look who's on the phone, Donald Trump.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> So now he's acing me out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right. He's moving you out. Our old friend, Donald Trump, who, you know, is doing very well for himself.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Got a big franchise on NBC. I told Howard that I'm watching this season of Celebrity Apprentice.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's good. It's good. It's feeling great.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah. Are the ratings going up or do they stay the same?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they're very solid. They've been doing great. In fact, they just extended this for two more years and next year, they're doing a regular in the fall -- the regular Apprentice.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They haven't done that for a couple of years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they haven't. We went to celebrity and it worked out great. And the other was doing very well but we said "Let's put some celebrities on see if we can get them."" And now
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Last season and she became hot as a pistol. I mean, she told me the other day it's one of the most incredible things that ever happened to her in terms of people recognizing her, believe it or not.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Are you shocked that celebrities, you know, agree to do something like this? To me, it seems like a lot of work and with a lot of potential embarrassment. You know what I mean?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I'm a little surprised but, you know, you take certain people although he wasn't such a celebrity. The country singer, as an example, he became the number one country singer all of a sudden and the -- you know, Pierce Morgan did a great job and now, he's got his own show.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> But if you're on, let's say with the situation is reversed. I can't imagine you ever doing a show like this, being a contestant, but like what's the motivation even to try hard. You know what I mean? Like why, if you're a celebrity, would you care to win Celebrity Apprentice?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, it's interesting because I ask myself some of these people -- you see how hard they're working Robin, as an example, on that on the show.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, I worked so hard and to a certain extent, it's to protect their brand. I mean, once they do it and then, you'll have people that quit. You know, Darryl quit.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right. And what do you what does that say about a guy? Darryl Strawberry is a quitter.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it was a bad thing for him to do, I think, but he had a hard time doing it. And you know Michael Johnson? I don't know exactly what happened with him. You saw that last night.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah. He never said what was calling him home. He just went "Oh."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I didn't want to get in. You know, you could see the attitude was -- my attitude wasn't so great.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know, I think it was a lot of crap. But Michael Johnson did something that I think he will regret but, you know, they worked very hard, Howard. It's amazing what I do and I don't think I do it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I will tell you, every season, we go out. Everybody wants to be on the show especially since you know Trace Adkins. In all fairness, when you talk about celebrities, he wasn't that much of a celebrity. I've never heard of him. He was a country singer.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've never heard of him and before the show ended, he had the number one record in music. I mean, he had the number one record.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So in other words, the record business has changed so much that if you go on a show like The Apprentice, it could probably catapult you to a number one slot on the charts.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, he was sort of funny. He said, you know Mr. Trump before I met -- before I did the show, I couldn't get a ticket to the Country Music Awards. Now, I'm hosting them.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow. Well, hey so.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it really does make sense if, you know, if you're a certain type. I mean, Trace is an extreme example because he became the biggest country singer.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Isn't it amazing when you think about it? In 2009, Jesse James, who now is all over the front page of the newspaper --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Before his, you know --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> His antics.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> For cheating on Sandra Bullock but it is amazingly like you had him on. I didn't know that much about Jesse James. In fact, I had him on the show because he was promoting your show.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And you know, it seemed like a nice enough guy to me. I had a good time with him. But the whole time, in the back of my mind, I was thinking "What's Sandra Bullock doing with a guy like this?""I mean
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And a whole different world.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, I became the resident expert on Tiger and Jesse James.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Tiger and you obviously know Jesse. Jesse was on the show.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you think of the guy?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Jesse?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, he's a very interesting character. I used to ask him. I don't know if you saw that what I did [Inaudible] by watching but I would ask him "What the hell does Sandra Bullock see in you?"
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Jesse, I mean you look like a great looking guy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know I'm not a big tattoo guy, Jesse. He got tattoos all over your face. I mean all over your neck, all of you, everything. And you know, I'm not -- I don't get the tattoo deal, Howard. I mean, I see guys with tattoos. I say "What are they doing to themselves?""Right?"
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Well...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It isn't my world. It's a different universe, a different --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right. It's a different universe. It's -- I feel sad for him in a way because, in a way, you straightened yourself out too. I mean, you had a bunch of marriages and you, you know, I don't know if you cheated or what but you did right.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What's this go on?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But what I'm saying is like he had a good thing going. She was taking care of his kids
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She was like Cinderella. He got to the ball and the prince picked them.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I mean, I mean I learned a lot growing up and I think you have to like, you got to learn, at some point, you, like, to value what you have, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, interesting with Jesse. He really seemed to love Sandra but he never brought her on the show and he could have won or at least, gone further. If you remember, I kept saying "Why don't you bring it on like that? Have a task."
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And the task was to get a crowd and get the crowd to give money and all sorts of things right now if he would have had Sandra Bullock and she was a hot movie star and he's a hot movie star. You know, they would have had a bigger -- I say "Jesse
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But many of them hate it. I mean, we had Clint. Remember Clint Black?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, Clint Black, the country singer.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Oh, man. He hated Jesse and Jesse hated him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Really? No kidding, so it shows you that he's not the easy going guy.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Sandra was a little bit off in that pick.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> They went at it like, you wouldn't believe and just -- if you spoke to Clint Black, you call him, ask him what he thinks of Jesse. It was unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Nobody has interviewed him. That would be the interview.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So is it true on the Apprentice, he would sleep in Hitler pajamas?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He would. Let me put it this way, Howard. It was a very different kind of a guy. He was and he was -- I'll tell you what, he was really tough and he was really smart. He was a smart guy. You know it took me three shows to realize the guy had a brain. The guy was so quiet --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And so sullen and such sort of a nasty guy to the other cast members but he was respected in a certain way and he was really smart. And it took me a while to find out. But I said to him "What the hell does Sandra Bullock see in you? You must be great in bed."" That's all I could say."
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But you were right in a sense the tattooed girl, who even had her face tattoo, that he was cheating, said quote that he had an enormous penis.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, well, that's something I didn't get into on the show. Although, in retrospect, I should have.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Can they say anal was involved?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So you take the tattoos off that girl.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Is she good looking? Is she great looking?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I don't think so.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think without the tattoos, she has a shot.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. Well, she has a really good body. Let me ask you something. I'm assuming that you don't cheat at all in your marriage, right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is that true?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Absolutely.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're not lying?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, he's going to say "Well
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. Would you -- so
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do you imagine -- Hey, Robin, do you imagine if I say "No
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You've always been honest.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But the next day. You would see what would be he would be in the newspaper.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Really?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Would you say --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Absolutely, you're right about that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right, so you would say your first marriages, you know,
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Were experiments.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> They were experiments. In other words, you didn't have the understanding you do now. So when these women all say "once a cheater
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, I would say absolutely. I mean, I would say that. First of all, did anyone ever say that I cheated?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, I'm saying you --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well I remember the stories of Marlo and [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Marla.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Marla being at the same --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Ski resort.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Ski resort.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, but nobody ever said I really cheated.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's true.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Technically [? ] implied it.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But I'm saying this, you were --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Come to think of it, they implied it in the strongest of tone.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You have banged some of the greatest beauties on the planet. True?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true. That is true.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right. And eventually
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Some of the greats in history.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And yet you stopped and got married again.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And I'm assuming, you're on the level now, right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> 100%.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is that true?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> 100%.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So how did you stop doing that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you have to be in love with somebody.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. You are in love.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm totally in love, but you have to really love somebody. You have to be with somebody that you like and have a relationship with and a really good one. And you know, you lose interest and it's always good to be really busy. I'm really busy with it. We've been doing great. The company has been doing the best it's ever done and --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> How much money they paying you for Apprentice now? They giving you some good bucks.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A lot.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You are?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's ratings. You know, your business, Howard, is a very simple when you learn that a long time ago.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said to somebody the other day if you get good ratings you can be the worst human being on earth. You can treat the executives like the worst like they're --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Like they're vermin.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Like the rest. Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you can be, on the other hand,, you can be the nicest person in the world and if you don't get ratings, you're gone.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But you're as important to that show as Simon Cowell is to American Idol. Do you own the show?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes I do.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Burnett, yes.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So I would imagine, you're making at least -- maybe I'm crazy here, I don't know, could you be making between 50-60 million dollars a year off to just that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A lot.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Am I in the ballpark or my way hard?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In the ballpark.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I am.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, it's ridiculous, right? But you know.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean I could tell you two stories but you know that are sort of Lorne Michaels when I did the host at Saturday Night Live.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said to Lorne, the ratings were through the roof. In fact, it was the number one show at that point. It was that, for that, you know, for a long period of time, it was doing great and it continues to do great. It's crazy. But I said to Lorne, "You know
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right. But what do you think it is, seriously. What is it about you? Do you think -- I mean, there's a lot of billionaires out there and you know what is it. Why do you think -- I am, here you are, you're the most --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I honestly believe this because I'm a very handsome guy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But wait a second.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Looks are very important and I think I'm a very handsome guy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Wait a second. In a sense you're in the most unglamorous business. I mean you're a builder by trade.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah but it's Lemaris. I mean, you know, I put real estate. You know, I used to want to be a movie producer. I wanted to make movies. In fact, when I was in high school, I always want and I was going to go to USC School of Cinema.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right. But what do you think it is, seriously. What is it about you? Do you think -- I mean, there's a lot of billionaires out there and you know what is it. Why do you think -- I am, here you are, you're the most --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was going to do movies and then I realized, you know my father was a builder of Brooklyn and Queens. I was in the real estate business and by osmosis, because when I was growing up, I would listen to my father on the phone and, you know, you learn things, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Bet [But] your father would never have tolerated you going to be a film student, that kind of thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he wasn't exactly thrilled with that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But that's what I want to do. So I sort of put theater into it. You know I put moviemaking into the real estate business. I've made it a glamorous business.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You did?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, Trump Towers, this great building, I have Trump buildings all over the place that are incredible buildings. I have the best golf courses in the world. I have a lot of great stuff you know. And I've made it I think very glamorous.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You have, and what happened when you were going -- you're going to sue that guy who claimed you're only worth a couple of hundred million dollars. And you said "Listen."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm worth now six billion dollars. And he wanted to write a book. He tried to write a book and the book had totally failed, by the way. I hope, I hope I helped him that regard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But he tried to make it. You know, he tried to diminish me and I don't like, you know, I don't mind. I'm diminished all the time and sometimes they build me up too much, and sometimes they build me up not enough but I'm worth over six billion dollars and this guy tried to make it like "Oh gee. It's --"" And you know
<Howard Stern> <Negative> When you're personally worth six billion dollars, why bother doing anything anymore? I don't get.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because it is fun. You know.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It is?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It is fun. I mean, I just have a good time.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Is it having all these -- Is it fun having all these people, responsibilities and?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, I have, you know, a lot of responsibilities and I had one bad responsibility over the weekend. Somebody who worked for me, 47 years old, an unbelievable guy, an executive, who worked for me, passed away, died .
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Of what?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, probably went to the dentist's. You ever hear the dentist's stuff? You remember, Steve Floria right from [Inaudible]? He went to the dentist and you get an infection and it affects the heart and then, you have a stroke.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Which is what happened. It was a chain of events that were unbelievable. This guy, who was a phenomenal person, went to the dentist, got, I guess, an infection. It affected his heart. He had a stroke. I mean,
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's awful.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Longest guy you've ever seen
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Had a stroke and died. And by the way, that happened to Steve Florio at [Inaudible] who was a great friend of mine. Went to a dentist. I'm afraid to go to a dentist.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And he got an infection?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It seems that way, yes. It would seem that way. That seems to be the theory.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow that's awful. Have you been --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That happens, by the way a lot.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Have you been --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Beware of dentist.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, geez. Have you, have you ever had, have you been in touch with Tiger Woods?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You have?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I know Tiger. I like Tiger a lot. You know Tiger. Well, he does clinics a lot. He'll use a lot of my golf -- he'll use my golf courses and I think Tiger is really a good guy and Tiger -- Boy, and
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I do think -- Do you think he's a sex addict? Do you believe in sex addiction?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I believe people like sex a lot.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, because you could have been a --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People like you. People like me. Whatever.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yeah, but wait a second, he doesn't need to. Even in your worst day, you didn't need sex that much. I mean it's almost like --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You don't know me that well so --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No. Do you ever have two to three women in one day?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have no comment.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, I like that. So do you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I love sex but I mean, to the point that the guy --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know it's probably two to three in one day. I don't know if that's ever come out. I'm not sure that that's coming out.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Did he lose because he's distracted?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he didn't lose. He played great. I mean, you know Tiger played unbelievable. I didn't -- I found it hard to believe that he could make that point. When you don't play golf, it's a very, very tough game, both physically and mentally.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And the fact, with all of this stuff going on around him with the wife and the whole thing and I personally don't think they're going to get back together but that's
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I don't either.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And by the way, I think it's much better if he doesn't.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. He should go be single day.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Every time he walks out there, she's going to say "How dare you?""You know
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They can never repair what they had.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not -- this is too severe. This is the ultimate in severity, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Sandra Bullock won't go back to Jesse James, won't she?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can't imagine it. I know her quite well. I did a movie with her. She asked me to be in a movie that we made about a year ago.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Nice girl, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Excellent, which is really nice.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> But you've talk to Tiger since the scandal.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What's that?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I think you've talked to Tiger since the scandal?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, how's that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I just like him. He's a quality guy.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> But is it a weird conversation?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Did you bring it up?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you bring --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> His agent, Mark Steinberg, is a great guy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, wait a second.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, he's a great guy.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I'm talking about --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So he got me that Oreo. You know, the famous Oreo commercial with Peyton Manning and Eli Manning?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, like the two Donalds.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] like the commercial of the year.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But wait a second. I get it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That was, that was just I like them.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> All right. You read about the scandal. How long do you wait before you make that phone call?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, you know, it's -- first, it was none of my business.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know what's going on with him and his wife anyway.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. She's hot. She's hot though, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, she's fine.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you think she's not hot?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It depends on what standard. What standard are you judging?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm judging her by all the beauties in the world. Who's the hottest chick right now?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, what standards are you using, Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I have a very high standard. Howard knows because he got me in a lot of trouble once. He went over a list of 15 supermodels.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. But wait a second.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You remember the supermodel?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he'd ask me "How was she? How was she?""And I was married at the time. You know this was not a good question."
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, but hold it a second. You don't think she's hot enough for Tiger Woods?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think she's a -- you know.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What are her flaws? Sure [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to say.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, say.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to say. I think she's -- I don't know her.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> In other words, she's -- is she a 10?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'd say she's a solid nine.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> A nine?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Solid nine.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right, so what is she missing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to say.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Please, I'm begging you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to get involved.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You will not be involved.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like Tiger too much and I just don't know.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well you've met Ellen face to face?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Once, quickly.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right. And you looked her over and you're probably, I would say, the greatest judge of beauty on this planet. In fact, I would create a TV show for you where all you did was just judge women.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, that may be the best idea of all.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It's a simple thing. It's a half hour and we strip it out all over the country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say I'm the all time judge. Don't forget, I own the Miss Universe pageant.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, I own all that stuff.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And you improved it. So the great Carrie Prejean and all these people.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It is an example of --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> The way to say "Don't change."
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Howard, just to get you off the subject a sec.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is Elin -- What does something --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Elin is very beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, but why is she a nine and not a 10?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, 10 is a very, very sacred territory.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Is her ass too big?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very sacred, just like being on your top five of all time. You know, I'm one of your top five of all.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Mr. Trump, I'm asking you directly. Is her ass too big?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay. Body perfect?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Very nice.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There was something that troubled you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What is it? The face?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. She's very nice. I mean, is she a 10? You know what a 10 is.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who is a 10? Just so I can know, besides your wife. Who is a 10?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't, I don't want to say. Well, I would say the current Miss Universe is a 10.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay, so Elin is a nine. So something was off.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Eight to a nine.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> An eight to a nine.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, she's slipping.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She's going down.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's a solid nine and now, she's an eight [Inaudible].
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That's right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I just mentioned the current Miss Universe.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And that knocked her down.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So what is it that made her an 8? Was it something flawed in the face or the body or both?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nothing. She's really nice. I mean, she's great. I mean, in all fairness,
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're holding back on me. I'm shocked.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In all fairness, Tiger should go out, should have lots of fun and play golf and
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I agree.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Tiger is going to be, has to win. He's got to win. He played great this week and I thought he played amazing. Phil Mickelson played unbelievable golf.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes. And Phil Mickelson, now, they're kind of treating him like he is the anti-Tiger. His wife has cancer. He's with her. The three beautiful children walked out and hugged him.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Tiger would not have had that seen as the winner.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right. So it's like Tiger's not the bag.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You don't think Phil ever cheated, do you, Howard?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do I? I wouldn't. Believe me.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What would you think?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I'd say no.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, good.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I, I would say no.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you saying you know that he's cheated?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I would, I was just asking you. Do you think he's cheated?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Based on the, the, the, the three --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That would be -- Hey, I think that would be a big story.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Wait, I've got to ask you something before we
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hey, Robin. That would be --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That would be huge.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donald Trump has a new show. I'm going to tell you about in a second but first I got to talk about this. Your daughter recently got married.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Okay. To a Jew.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She became a Jew.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> That's true.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now, what the --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You hear the disappointment.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, you know what?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I hear disappointment.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I think he's a great guy --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> As you were --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The first guy and it wouldn't matter. I mean, it doesn't really matter. But he's a great guy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you wear yarmulke? The Jewish hat in the ceremony.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it was not a big deal.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It was a Jewish ceremony.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, it's not a big deal. In fact it's possible that one did slip on my head for a little while.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Is it true you refused to wear the yarmulke?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, that's not true. That's not true. She is a great girl. She's a beautiful girl. She -- every guy wanted to get Ivanka.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, I love her. I was going to marry her.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Every guy wanted to be with her. And she just loved this particular guy, Jared, who is a great guy and I'm happy with her decision.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So you're okay with that religious thing?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, I think it's great.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But you're a guy who a country club guy, you know. Well, you know, how they talk in the --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You used to banning this, too
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yeah, back in the day, we could ban Jews from the club and now, all of a sudden, we're married to one.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have all these clubs and she can work on Saturday.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> There was a report that you stomped on the yarmulke.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, he's really a very good guy and I think they have a great marriage. I'm sure they have a great marriage.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. And she has made -- well, let's say, you're a grandfather.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the other one.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You have your son.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have two. Two through done.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Is that killing you? I mean, I've heard that you hate to be called Grandpa. What do you say to them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I'm not a big fan. I don't feel like a grandfather. I'm not a big fan.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Why don't they call you like D. T.?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, you know, they're not allowed to call me 'Grandpa'.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What do they call you?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do they call you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They don't call me anything yet because they're so young. I like it that way.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Someone told me You're so taken with your daughter now being Jewish. You're making a trump mezuzah about yourself.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Is that right? All right. Now, listen. Donald Trump has a new show. He's hosting something called "Donald J. Trump's Fabulous World of Golf""."
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now, why Donald J. Trump?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Well?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, it's funny. That's an interesting quest -- somebody else asked me that the other day. Donald J. Trump. Every time I used Donald J. Trump, something turns out to a big success. Sometimes when I use Donald Trump, I don't know, I've had good luck with it. Does that make sense [Inaudible]?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] good luck.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay. All right. It's sort of a superstition thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know what it is but "Donald Trump's Wonderful World""
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I was researching this show. You, of course, did a smart thing. Donald is the host of the show. It's on the Golf Channel, which I didn't even know there was a golf channel because I'm not a golfer, but you got, as a co-host, a super hot chick who's a golfer.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Oh, and I did worse than that though. It's called "Donald J. Trump's Fabulous World of Golf"". And I -- you know
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Sounds good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it's great. And people love that show. They love it. So you know I have fun with it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So this will air. Let's see.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It starts airing tonight.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Tonight, 9:00 on the golf channel for anyone who's a golf fan, you can watch Donald Trump or if you're a fan of hot chicks, they're going to be paraded out there as well.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let me ask you, Howard. You did "Howard Stern's The All-Time
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's correct, yes. Now, I have two of the top ten.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Two of them. You are on two of them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Are they still, Are they still two of the top ten?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've been relegated down to one of the top two.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know what you're talking about you're talking about your agent [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That was one of the all time classic
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm trying to think what the second one was.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know. I was down for two.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You were I'm trying to remem -- yeah. Yeah, I mean you're good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it had to do, I think it had to do with the super model thing that you got me in such trouble. That was gay.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, that was gay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was in such trouble and you have no idea.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why are you all of a sudden afraid to talk about women, their flaws and give them a number?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Because of intelligence.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What? No, wait a second. Stop it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He's getting too nice. Not say anything bad about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No, I'm becoming very diplomatic.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> The thing with Elin, I don't understand.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Maybe, I'll run for office or [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I really don't un -- like, in the old days, you would have said to me "Look
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I mean, you know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nothing's wrong with her. She's beautiful. You're asking me. Is she a 10?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You'd got it down to an eight.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> 10 is a very rarified --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She's an eight and dropping
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know the term rarified? That's called rarefied air. Ten is very rarefied, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I am one of the worst. I, like, calling someone after a tragedy or something terrible happen. I admired the fact that you picked up the phone and called Tiger Woods during this. What I want to know is how much time, like how long ago did you speak to him? Did you -- How long did --?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to comment on, on speaking to Tiger. You know, I just don't want to because he's in such pressure.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How do you start the conversation?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it's amazing what he did over the weekend that he played so well.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's amazing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But when you pick up the phone and call him, like do you, do you bring -- do you say "Hey
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I just respect Tiger. I have a lot of respect for him and I love him because he uses my places. You know. When he does a thing for Nike. He will, like he likes to use my courses. And you know, that means he must like me and you know, when --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But how long is the conversation? Is it a superficial one?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to comment on it. No, I don't want to comment on it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So wait a second. Let's say, I get into a tragedy of some kind, all right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A massive, a massive tragedy.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right. You call me up and do you just ignore the topic?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you had a much different situation than Tiger. Tiger is in a mess, okay?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He is.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In a mess. I never thought this going to, you know. I mean, Tiger was the most perfectly handled human being in history.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It's true. Did you know he was having all these affairs? You knew, didn't you?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No no I don't I don't think a lot of people I guess a lot of women knew
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You didn't hear --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, the people at MGM had to know
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> IMG. I think the people at IMG probably must have known something, right? I guess. Who knows?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Isn't it true Tiger cried on the phone when he spoke to you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That was the rumor.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So how long is the conversation. Is it a three second conversation superficial?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to talk about the conversation. You know, it's such a personal thing, Howard and he's such an amazing guy and you know just let him get on with the golf and let him win and let him have every woman. I mean, this guy will go through women like "Forget it"" and nobody will care."
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> The rumor is you take the conversation between yourself and Tiger Woods.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I did not. I don't like taping conversations.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So you're telling me -- I'm just asking in general terms. I'm not asking for any specifics. You made a phone call. You picked up. You have his personal phone number and you picked up and I guess you, you got him on there. And you said Hi, it's Donald Trump. How are you doing. And it was a lengthy conversation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, Howard, but it doesn't matter anymore. You know why?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because he's now come out. He's playing golf again. He's playing really well. People were surprised that he played so well. You know, I happen to think that he won't get back together.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I happen to think that he's better off not getting back together.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you think [Inaudible] get him back?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I happen to think that he looks better and a lot cooler if he doesn't get back together.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he gets back together, he's going to look like an intact guy because everyone knows as soon as he comes into the house, the door's going to be locked and, you know, it's going to be impossible, all right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Can he ever go back and get the sponsors he used to have?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Can he go that brand or is it permanently ruined?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He can't get those sponsors. He can get other sponsors but I don't think he can ever get those sponsors. First of all, you know, you could make that case, a two percent case that they were disloyal to him. You know, they dropped him pretty quickly --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Other than Nike, but they dropped him pretty quickly so you know. But I don't think you could ever get those. He had the Rolls-Royce of sponsors.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He did.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He had a lot of sponsors. I mean and you can never -- I don't think he could ever go back and get those sponsors --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I mean --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And the housing development just in the North or South Carolina.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Ruined, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I mean, first of all, it's that a lot of trouble to start off with but you know, because of what happened with the world and the economy but you know, that was based on Tiger Woods and family values.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Doesn't it --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How about that developer building that sucker?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I know he's got to be in a panic because --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I have to tell you, that developer, I saw an interview recently and he was very loyal to Tiger.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, he's stuck with him. But, Donald, can you imagine building a brand where all you have to do is basically sit back and they throw the money at you for commercial endorsements because he's squeaky clean. Everybody loves him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Over a $100, 000, 000 a year.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I mean, can you imagine losing that? He must be going insane.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Well, and losing it for what? Because, you know, when you talk about the women what did you think of his choice of women.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I actually thought he liked it down and dirty. In other words, I have a theory that Elin probably was not that great in bed, you know?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, she's a nice girl.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She's a nice girl.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I interviewed many of the girls. We had a Tiger Woods mistress beauty pageant.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Cause you had Donald as a judge, yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I was going to call you to judge but --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I thought I would have been a fantastic judge absolute.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> We crowned the girls. Each of the girls was very different but it seemed to me, they were very strange.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, now, who is the best looking of the girls?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, I --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Not the one that won the beauty pageant. I was very disappointed in you, Howard. The one [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Won the beauty pageant.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It wasn't about --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I saw that in one of the shows, the one that won the beauty pageant should not have won.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You're wrong, because we were looking for the best mistress and not only was she cute, but she was a great mistress because she was really, truly in love with him. She was everything that --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How do you know that though?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I could tell.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You could. Okay.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She was the best mistress. She was
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You are not a professional.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'll tell you how I know she love him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, what about the stripper? Did you think the stripper was good looking?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, too stripper-ish for me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it's Gloria [Inaudible]. She's got this -- Oh, man. Every time you see her, it's like "give me a break""."
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why do you think she represents these [Inaudible]?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't get it. And I hear that a lot of money was given to the one, Rachel.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who is, you know, just --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why did he give Rachel Uchitel $10,000,000?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't understand. Well, I don't know that he did that, okay?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know that he did it but when I watch Gloria [Inaudible] representing the stripper. The stripper was crying. Although I have to say, the stripper was pretty good looking. Do you agree?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, she's just on my show.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean in all fairness, you know, a lot of people say "Oh
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But none of them were, were, were nines certainly like Elin but I think it's a thing about --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, what did you -- did you think the stripper was [Inaudible]?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I thought the strip -- She was just on my show. She's very good looking. And she does a position where Tiger Woods -- I'm going to be a little bit graphic. All right. Tiger stood her on her head. Listen to this.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Splutter.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, no, no. He put his penis in her behind. And then, would put his fingers in the vagina and she would squirt all over. And now, I don't think Elin was doing that.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I don't, I have a feeling Elin never heard of this before.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I -- I -- I I think that -- I think that's completely foreign to her.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, one thing we have --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Have you ever had that position? No?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I haven't.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Exactly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We've learned about [Inaudible] with definite.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He is not gay. Do you agree with that?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He is absolutely not gay and listen --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I remember, you interviewed one of the great interviews of all time, you interviewed a guy who is saying he only had one or two events with a man but that he wasn't gay. You said any party that had one or two events with a man is gay.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Inaudible] gay.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Absolutely. You know it and I know it. How many events have you had with a man?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Zero.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Exactly.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Not even a thought.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're really [Inaudible].
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> With all that I've had, I've never had a thought. There's never been like a big thought process. You know.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Even when you were young? Let's say a priest or something.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Prep school.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Prep school. Boner fight.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, never even, like, at thought. In other words --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It was written about you, you had a boner fight at prep school.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me put it this way. During the event, right? There's never a thought of Jimmy or Ronald or any of that. No. No thoughts.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Isn't it true when you were a prep school there was a boner fight between you and two gentlemen?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No. Okay, it must have been somebody else.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> All right, listen to me. You're on a roll. I'm happy for you. I see you still feuding with Rosie O'Donnell. No patching that up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm not feuding. I mean, I don't, I don't think about every time I go and ask me about Rosie O'Donnell. She's a loser. I mean, she's terrible. She doesn't have very much talent.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She coming back to [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll tell you what. She's got a great agent. I mean, losing, her variety show drew flies. She drew flies, right. Nobody watched it. Her other show, they threw her off the air. She, she, you know, the view, she chickened out. She was afraid of Elisabeth Hasselbeck who I gave great respect. I gave a lot of respect. She really beat the crap out of Rosie and instead of showing up for another two weeks, she quit like a quitter and now her agent gets her probably another show. So I say, whoever Rosie O'Donnell's agent is, he's a great agent. But Rosie is, you know, I mean I know her. Hey, Howard, she went to my wedding.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I didn't think of it so --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I like Rosie. I just was on her show. It's serious.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh, you did. You like Rosie.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like her.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. Well, that's good. Hey, maybe she's --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I'm going to bring you two together. I'm sure she's.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Hey, listen. I'm sure, she's --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You think you can make the peace?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm going to make the peace with each other.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] a fine person.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm going to make the peace between the two.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, like Rosie, Cyndi Lauper on the Apprentice.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, she likes you too.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I said "Where were you
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. You got her right over there. What -- Listen, one last question. If you weren't married today, who is the woman you would be chasing? And I'm going to say, it's Kate Beckinsale.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> No?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No, I would -- I mean, if I weren't, --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I would never, I don't even think I have -- I'd better not get into this conversation now.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No. Come on. If you were single,
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This conversation, this conversation gets me nowhere.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donald Trump, is --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This conversation -- Howard, this conversation is nothing but trouble.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Sounds like a man who's been trained.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You know what, your wife's had it out with you, hasn't she?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When you once told me recently you said Donald let me ask you if your wife was a great beauty was in a massive automobile accident
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Would you leave her now or would you wake her up?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, what is the proper time to --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That got me in a lot of trouble.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, what is the proper amount of time to leave your wife if she's been in a massive car accident?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I gave you a great answer. I said I would never leave in a million years. I would definitely [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You were smart.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You said that was a brilliant answer.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> No, you were a gentleman. I remember, you said two months and I always thought it was a month. I thought you were a true gentleman say --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You said, would you leave immediately or would you wait for about a month.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And your marriage is going strong.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Very good.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And sexually still pleased.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very good.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No kidding.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No problem.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How many times a week are you down to?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Down to.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Come on.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Down to. Yes. Down to. Do you understand that we're the business of marriage, don't you, Howard?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Can I ask you a question?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have a very good relation.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I want you to help me out with something.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So when you're horny, --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And marriage, you know, and you've got a kid, young child at home. There were times your wife's just too tired of sex and you understand. Do you, do you masturbate to take care of the problem?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So when's the last time you masturbated?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Long time ago.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Honestly.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Some time previous to knowing women.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Really?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Come on.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's a lot and you know what? it's a lot of work and it gets you nowhere. You know
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I'm shocked to hear you say that.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No, no. I'm not. I was never big into that world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want you all to watch Donald Trump's [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Let me ask something. No porno? You don't sit there on the computer and --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He -- by the way, when Rod Blagojevich was on The Apprentice --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who was the former governor of Illinois, --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Which really caused a stir and that guy was amazing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Did you like Rod Blagojevich?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I thought it was a nice guy.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Now, now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he tried very hard to be nice to, which was very smart because he's got a trial coming up like in weeks.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You know, Donald was very smart too because he pointed that out when Blagojevich was head of the team and he had to make all the decisions. He would never say that anybody deserved to be fired.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, he was calling the cast members ma'am and sir.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He's on good b -- how many years calling could he --?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] calling Michael Johnson sir. Sir. Would it be okay if I spoke?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How many --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A U. S. Governor
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How many --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was so nice that he went to keep the black vote. Okay.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was so nice.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He still like going to the voters.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no. I said, you can't be this. Illinois politics is pretty tough, right. I think you can't be this nice, Rod. You've got to let it come out. And you know what? He was there. He was playing to all of these people that are potential jurors. And I think that's probably very smart.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Will he go to jail?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he might win.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No kidding.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, I think he might win. I mean, you know, I felt badly for the guy. I felt sorry for him and you know, say what you want. I've known a lot of people that get into this kind of trouble and they crawl into a corner. They go home. They want to go home to mommy or they commit suicide. And lots of shit. Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This guy, I mean, he's just out there.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's what I'm saying. It might be crazy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My name is Rod Blagojevich and I'm not guilty as Josh. Just the way he introduces --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Inaudible] to everybody.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And he says he's ready to fight in court.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He want to fight this? Really, I mean, you got to hand it to him. Like him, not like him, whether you respect him or not, the guy is a fighter.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you used to hang out with Bernie Madoff?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but I knew him because Palm Beach, you know, --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> At that big place in Palm Beach and he'd be at Mar-a-Lago or he'd be at my golf. I have a great golf club at Palm Beach Trump International and he'd be there.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Did you ever like --?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> His brother was a member. Always a member of Trump International and you know,
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did he ever say to you "Listen
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd speak to him and [Inaudible] it. You know, I have, at Mar-a-Lago, we have all the big events, all the big balls because I have the big ballroom.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You have the biggest ballroom.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I see him. I see him. It's always nice to have that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I see him, and I see him, but then, I say to people "Who do you invest your money with?""and they say ""Madoff
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Unlike Madoff. And I say "Who is this guy
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What do you invest? "Why
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Where do we, what, why do you think you were smart enough not to invest in him? I mean, you're after a good return on your money. You hear the guy's returning 10 percent on, on, on your investment. Why do you think you never invested?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd hear stories about him because Palm Beach was, you know, I used to use the word "Ground Zero"". But now
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That was the ultimate [? ].
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And all these guys, one guy puts in $200, 000, 000.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> And then, which is everything he had and then, he mortgaged his house for $10, 000, 000. In other words, you want to get a little bit more, right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right. Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Good Lord.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And by the way, he's now looking for a job. In fact, I think I'm going to hire him as a caddy next weekend.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's true.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But they put in, they put it 100% of their worth into this one guy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And you wouldn't do that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] See, I was down there. I mean, I'd see it and I didn't know. What did I know? I like to invest my own money. You know, it's called like "Let me invest my own money""
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. You do the same probably or don't [Inaudible]. You have -- You have an investor actually. I understand. I know who your guy is. You have like a guy that invest your money. Be careful. But, but you know I like to invest my own money how it is. Like I can watch CNBC and say "I'll pick Johnson and Johnson just as well as somebody else"" and say ""I'll pick Johnson and Johnson"
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So in other words, when you go into the market --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> 0.55
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> When you go into the market, you sit there, you look at the stocks and you picked on them.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I've never, I've never been and I feel foolish for the last year but I've never been a stock guy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Of course, I felt great two years ago. You know, when the market crashed it. I've never been a stock guy but I've never really been a stock guy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible] You put all your money in real estate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I put it in different things or you know, stupidly. Today, you get one percent of your money or less, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So you put it mostly in bonds and things like that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I've been, I've been sort of, you know, as I've gotten older, I've become conservative.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know what's going to happen. Stocks are going up but I watch them go up and then I watch them come crashing down and I had a lot of very unhappy friends so it's a crap year.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So what should a guy who's listening now invest in today?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think today is a great time and I wouldn't have said this two years ago. In fact, I didn't, on your show, if you asked me this question a couple of years ago. Today is a great time to invest in real estate. I think this is the time to go out and buy a house, buy an apartment, buy stuff. Get it from a bank. The bank will give you great financing because they already have it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Because the thing is right now, the market's depressed and now is when you buy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is a great time to buy real estate.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is that what you're doing right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I bought a lot of it. I just bought 850 acres at Washington on the Potomac River. That's so phenomenal. That's incredible. I picked it up, I've been at it years and I just got it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And you will develop that into --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, it will be phenomenal. I mean, I think development but I mean, I bought, I've bought --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Inaudible] why don't we buy 850 acres on the Potomac?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Because, you know, Donald doesn't tell us about these deals.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Listen, you got to see Donald Trump host "Donald J. Trump's Fabulous World of Golf"" airing tonight at 9:00 on the golf channel and see
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. Absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm definitely thinking about it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Listen, I love talking to you. I ran into your daughter. Boy, is she looking better and better.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> She is beautiful and great, and she really does have a good marriage so it's nice.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She is some catch.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, not anymore. She's caught.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, believe me. She'll be on the market again.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, stop it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He's going to get tired of that guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I miss being -- I haven't done your show that much lately and it's so much fun. It's very invigorating.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're busy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have been busy but you know, it's like, your show is great. I mean, there's a reason --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> For success. There's always a reason for success.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, you know that, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And I'm usually the reason.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You are the reason.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You are the reason and Robin's a big help.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Have a good time folks.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right. Listen. Have fun and as we say, well, it was only a glitch, you understand?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes, I do. I do. I understand.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All right? I said that wrong.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Bye Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thanks, Robin.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> The Great Donald Trump. There he is, going off and he's got 850 acres now on the Potomac and --
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Mr. President. How are you sir? It's an honor to see you. Wave to the fake news media.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hello folks.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> It's great to see you. How are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good to see you. Nice to see you.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You want to sit? You want to stand? What do you want to do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Stand, stand.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> First...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Where's your camera? Tell me, right here?
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yeah, you can look right there. First, you can thank Laura Ingraham who has given us extra Hannity time tonight.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she's very special and she's doing well.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You know what? She's doing well. She's a big supporters are yours. What do you make of where the Kavanaugh hearings are now? There's a new set of demands that have come out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's a very sad situation. He's an outstanding person. And frankly, Sean, to see what's going on is just very, very sad. You say, why didn't somebody call the FBI 36 years ago? I mean, you could also say, when did this all happen? What's going on? To take a man like this and besmirch -- now with that being said, et her have her say, and let's see how it all works out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I don't think you can delay it any longer. They've delayed it a week already. And, we're talking about --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And you've been -- you've been very accommodating.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have been accommodating. I say, let her say what she has to say and let's see how it all comes out. But they've delayed it a week, and they have to get on with it.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Mr. President, you are dealing with a lot a lot of good economic news today. And, there's a lot of media people, it seems like, all they ever talk -- about John Solomon and Sara Carter broke the big story tonight --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great people.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> -- and what they're saying is, is that even the intelligence community and the FBI didn't want to give the intel to the Obama administration because there were conflicts, and they would weaponize it against you. That's our new information.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm not surprised to hear it. If you look at what's been going on over the last couple of years -- and I'm not just talking about from the time I won the presidency. This took place. when I was winning in the primaries. I mean you look at what's going on -- I'm not surprised to hear anything.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Before the election, after the election, even the media leak strategy -- Lisa Page had testified that for nine months, they had no evidence at all whatsoever. But it seems to be coming to an end.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well it has to come to an end. It's so bad for our country. I call it a witch hunt. It is so bad for our country, and when you see Strzok and Page and McCabe, with his lies, they gets fired for lying. You see all of the things, and Comey for lying and leaking -- you see what went on. It's got to come to an end.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So bad for our country.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> The irony in all of this is I have been uncovering all of this. When you think about it, Clinton bought and paid for -- used funneled money, a dossier foreign national put it together --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A lot of money.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> They never verified --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yup.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> They never corroborated, and and it was the bulk of information. You have now -- you have now said declassify and redact it. How soon will that be coming?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're moving along. We're working along. We're also dealing with foreign countries that do have a problem. I must tell you, I got called today from two very good allies saying, please can we talk? So, it's not as simple as all that. And we do have to respect their wishes. But it'll all come out.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You know what? Elections are about peace and prosperity. Your economic record -- I talked about it earlier in the show tonight. Record low unemployment, 14 states. African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, women, youth unemployment. We have great news on the economy. Better news with Kim Jong-un. He's not firing rockets over Japan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're doing very well. Well, honestly Korea -- North Korea, South Korea -- things are working out very nicely. Very, very nicely.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Tough sanctions against Russia, and the Iranian economy, and the Chinese economy are both going down as you have taken a tough stand.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's time to take a stand on China. We have no choice. You know, it's been a long time, they've been hurting us, and our farmers are great, and our farmers are starting to do very well again. It's very interesting. But we're putting very, very heavy sanctions and other things on various countries, and we're getting along with some countries.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, we've been ripped off, Sean, by the world. All of these countries for years and years and we can't do it any more. So --
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> And you're getting better deals with Mexico --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We had a good deal with Mexico. Good for both. Good for Mexico, good for us. Everybody's happy. NAFTA was a disaster. We lost thousands of plants. We lost millions of jobs. NAFTA was a disaster. We've renegotiated it. We're in the process of working now on Canada. We'll see what happens with Canada. Canada has been tough.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They charge 300 percent tariffs on dairy products, our farmers -- no good. You can't do that. So uh -- we'll probably be able to -- we'll see what happens. By the way, [Inaudible] work out well anyway. Go ahead.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I know -- I'll last one last question, because a lot of people in this arena are waiting for you, as you can see. [Audience cheers] I'll ask one final question.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Amazing people.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Forty seven days from now is the midterm elections. 47 days. We know what the agenda the Democrats are. They want to go after you. They want endless investigations. They want to keep Obamacare. They want to eliminate ICE. They want open borders. They want the crumbs back -- your tax cuts, and my question is -- the question that every American ought to ask is: are we better off than we were two years ago?
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> What do you say to those people that love you, but maybe aren't so hot on their Republican House or Senate member?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You got to go out and vote. We need more Republicans. We'll get everything we want. We need more Republicans. You want to protect your second amendment. You want to protect everything, you want to protect all of the great success that you've had over the last -- a little more now than a year and a half. Think of it. We're coming up -- can you believe it, on two years when you and I started talking.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is what happened.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Actually three, when you came down the escalator.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, yeah, if you talk about the campaign itself. But I will say this: you've got to protect --look at what's going on with the Supreme Court. If we're not there, because we're all together as a group, if we're not there to protect, it is going to be some really bad day for this country. So, we're protecting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, we made tremendous gains. You know, the stock market today -- it's a good day today to do an interview, because the stock market today hit the highest level in its history. Today. Now did you work this interview out specifically for that?
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> No I didn't. [Laughs]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it was up very big today. But it hit the highest -- all of the markets, today hit the highest level. Now 401(k)s are up 57 percent in a short period of time. If the Democrats get in, those numbers will be cut in half. You will see bad things.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Obama never -- Obama never made -- you know, the only President in history that never made 3 percent GDP growth in a year. All right, the budget negotiations. Are you going to demand -- you challenge Republicans, fund the wall completely. Will you insist on it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're getting 1.6 billion, we're continuing -- we spend 3.2 billion. We're continuing to build the wall. I'd like to do it. I could do it so quickly. I'd like to do it in one piece. The Democrats are holding us back. I am told by Republican leadership -- and I hope they do it, because there are a lot of people counting -- you see the people with the wall?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want the wall too. [Audience chants Build that wall]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> They got it -- they got it down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That they will do it immediately after the election. We've got a billion six, a lot of money, but not when it comes to --
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You've already got three billion you spent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We've got 3.2 billion. It's being built. We've got a billion six, but we have to do much better than that, because we could do it very quickly. And you know the bottom line? We need it. The Democrats, they want open borders. They want people coming in -- that means crime. We're the opposite. You've got to have a border.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You don't have a border, you don't have a country. You know that.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> It's about security. Securing our children. It's about -- and you want a door in your wall?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's about security. Oh, it's going to have lots of doors. People are going to come in, but they are going to come in through merit, and they have to come in, because we have companies moving in from all over the world. They're coming back to the United States. The biggest companies -- Foxconn. The biggest companies in the world are coming back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We need people, but they have to come in through merit.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yeah. Mr. President, thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Can you thank Laura again? She's probably going to be mad at me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Laura. I love your show. I watch it all the time. And you know what? You are special. You really are. It's a good combination.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Thank you Mr. President. I know this crowd -- are you ready to hear the President? [Audience cheers] Thank you sir. We appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Thank you so much.
