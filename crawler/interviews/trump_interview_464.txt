<Howard Stern> <Positive> Good for you.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You know, George Bush as president, they're very quiet. I don't think he stays round the fire that much.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He barely works. He goes away every weekend on Fridays and comes back on Monday. He does a long day. He gets in the office of 6
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> He has a number of breaks during the day that includes gym, naps, you know, this man is not taxing himself. Meanwhile, Dick Cheney thinks he has to have another heart operation. He's working so hard he thinks that they'll have to take him in. I think the doctor's with him 24/7 at this point.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Donald Trump's on the phone he can't call in tomorrow because of a flight scheduling problem so he wanted to quickly get on the air.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He is not coming in live.

<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I did not know that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> How are you? By the way, your arch enemy, A. J. Benza is here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A. J's a nice guy. I like him. Even though I hear you say negative things about me in his book.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> Just one shot is right, that's all.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't believe it.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Did you know you went after his girlfriend?
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> Yes, he knows.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I did more, I stole his girlfriend. But I didn't know I was stealing his girlfriend.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> He's so new, he's so new.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hey, A. J. nobody told me I was stealing your girlfriend. Nobody -- nobody told me that I was your girlfriend.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> I know. Well, you're an honorable guy, so I have to believe you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wait a second. Isn't it one of the greatest things in the world to be able to steal A. J.'s girlfriend?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Like I didn't know it. You know what, I've always liked A. J. A. J. rightfully can't stand me now and I can understand now.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> No, I didn't say that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But at the time -- at the time. I did something that I didn't know I was doing, I had no idea it was actually A. J.'s girlfriend and it's one of those little things.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> Let me tell you a story.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> So I'm dating Kara Young. I moved to L. A. So, me and Kara break up. So she was a free agent. You know, even though she --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Why are you upset?
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> Listen, I'm not mad that he went after her when we broke up. But then we -- when I got back to town and I approached Donald to a party at Charles Evans house and said, hey, this is not some piece of me, I love this girl. Now stay away. I had naked pictures of your wife a long time ago when I was a and gave you the shots and he said, you're right. I'm sorry.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold it. You had naked pictures of Donald's wife?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Of Ivana or Marla?
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> Chuck Jones would sent in Xeroxes and I gave them to Donald. A. J. you're a stand up guy. Then he forgets what I did from now. If he was cool he would have walked away. I realize you can't make any girl sleep --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Of course.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> I understand that. But as a man's man he should've said, there's plenty of girls out there, I'm sorry.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Don't hit on A. J's girl.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> I gave him a warning
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Number one, I'm gonna say something here. I got to take a little umbrage with you. Number one, you were broken up with the girl.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> But when I got back --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Trump -- Wait a second. Trump starts going out with her, he starts developing feelings.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> Fine.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You broke up with her. Not her decide. But wait a second, it's hard decision at that point, you didn't go after her when you were with her.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> I -- you know, she did, the second I already did.[Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Because you already had feelings for her. You broke up with her.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But wait a minute.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I succeeded. But here's -- here's the problem, first of all we have to say she is a wonderful girl. You know, she is really a fantastic girl.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Must be if you guys are fighting over her. How do I [Inaudible]
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> No, Howard we don't fight.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody's fighting.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> So wait a minute, I got to clear this up.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Robin -- She is a wonderful girl, Robin.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Donald, did you know you knew AJ wanted her.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> The second time he knew.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well not the second time, but by that time I was there. What am I gonna do? I was there. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Hey, wait, wait, wait. I'm being serious now, A. J. you're little out of line with this this time.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> Why do you -- I don't know.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Because wait a second, you guys broke up. He starts to develop a relationship with her and feels for him.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> Right
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You suddenly march back in. All right, this is -- I want candy. I want her. Be a stand-up guy and back off.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> Well, the night I approached him he should have been standing and said, you know what A. J. --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't really remember that with you A. J. I must be honest. Where did you approached me?
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> I saw you at Charles Evans Party.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. But I just -- I remember seeing it, I don't remember saying it.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> I was with Kara that night. And I -- you said, no, no, he should have said, you know, what, I got feelings for this girl.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Maybe he had feelings for the girl.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> He should have said that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He's not gonna tell you that.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> Why not?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Because you're a gossip guy.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Donald, do you ever back-off for any guy?.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what, I've always liked A. J. although -- And again I hear he treats me lousy in the book. But you know, he should take me bad. I took his girlfriend. Somebody took -- Hey, A. J. if somebody took my girlfriend I treat -- I treat that person very badly.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> I've already done that to you, but you don't know about it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What does that mean?
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> I've been there a few years ago.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who you talking about? Who did you take from Donald Trump?
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> No names, no names. no.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't believe so A. J.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> What do you think you're the worlds best lover?

<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what bothered you a lot -- It bothered you a lot, and it should bother you a lot
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> She tells me how successful you are too. And you don't sound that great. And she tells me cut your own hair. Is that true?

<Howard Stern> <Negative> But Donald, how do you feel following A. J.? Seriously. Did you --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Did he really call you a gay?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I didn't even think about it
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> He thinks nothing but himself. He thinks of nobody but himself
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I assume A. J. is clean. I hope he's clean, but i assume A. J --
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> He bangs Russian people [Inaudible].
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Russian people?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who's talking do you talking about Russian A. J.? I don't know a thing.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> Listen to me, he used to -- he used to call me when I was a countess.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look A. J. -- Hey, Howard, A. J. wouldn't feel this way if he won. You know when you win you don't feel the way he feels.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> Why do you win? You got stuff with the step-wife, why did you win?

<A.J. Benza> <Positive> Do me a favor.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What are you talking about?
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> Can you call a cellphone 400 times again last week and just keep hanging up on her.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who does?
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> You, we always know it's you talk oh my gosh.

<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm not feuding over, I'm very happy where I am.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You did her, you're happy. Right, Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let me tell you something, I'm very happy where I am.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And A. J., you did her and you're happy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hey Howard, I just heard that A. J. was very venomous in the book. I'm not gonna read the book. But he was very venomous to the book to me. The only reason he was venomous is that I stole his girlfriend. But I didn't know I was stealing her.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> I've hated you before you even had a girlfriend.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's okay. I can understand.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Now we're getting nasty.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now wait a second, now we're getting personal. Now, here's the thing

<A.J. Benza> <Positive> I don't like his personality. I think he's like, he's a little too pump around town for me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right. Let me say so, let me say so.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But A. J., I think you're a nice guy.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> You gotta settle that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Donald, thank you for taking the higher road.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If I would've known that she was with you. I wouldn't have started going out with her on the first place. Howard, we have prep by saying one thing
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's a very, very, fine, nice girl.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What's the proof?
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> Do you want me to go this? I'll kill him tomorrow I'll bring proof how low down stupid this guy is.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why are you saying that?
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> I will bring in things. He sends in things -- Paper for the news that could be all his articles he sends circles his name and writes billionaire, you have no idea.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Non-sense.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's non-sense.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Totally
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How about a boxing match, Donald. You and A. J. let's settle this once and for all.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hey, Howard. Listen to this.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A. J., Just a couple of questions. Did you call my secretary seven times to ask to beg her, to beg her with tears in your eyes, please have Donald leave her alone, I want to try and get her back.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> No. I called her -- No.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But you're both [Inaudible.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But did you call my secretary, Norma, seven times begging me not to go out because you're trying to get her back?
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> No. I am not trying to get her back. This is three years ago.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well, Donald. Both of you are -- Listen it's a shame --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's not a shame. She's a good girl. I hope she has a new boyfriend. I think she has a new boyfriend. She tells me A. J. is trying to get her back. I don't know if that's true or not.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> A. J. let's end this for a second.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> This will never end for a guy like this.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now, wait a second, let me --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But let me hear your take on this, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right, here's my take. A. J.'s dating a girl, Kara Young, they go together, they break up.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They didn't break up, Howard. They were together when I went out with her, but I didn't know that. They didn't break up. He's saying that to put a positive stand. So she was with me when you flew out to L. A., but they didn't break up at all.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Let's give A. J. the benefit of the doubt.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She told me that she convinced you to go out to L. A. because she wanted to go her way.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> No, by the way when you were with her and she did Playboy she was with me in L. A.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't even know about that.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> Oh, bull -- This guy is out of his mind. [Inaudible] German Playboy she was your girlfriend she came to my place that time [Inaudible] three days and [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, A. J. let me tell you a little secret. I have right now a great girlfriend. I'm happy as hell. I don't know if you do. But I suggest you go back to Kara.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> Now listen to me, stop calling Kara's cellphone if you [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, stop. I have it all.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right. Can I say something? Donald. But he's throwing stones, you're throwing stones. Let me say something. Let me say what I think.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Who's wrong?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Despite the fact, A. J., if you're not with a girl anymore Donald Trump -- goes -- and Donald even says he was with her, I giving --
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> I mean the second go round that --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He was with her when I first started dating her.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> I wasn't, I wasn't. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So if Donald --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She dumped him
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Whoever dumped who. If Donald goes out with her and then you try to go back with her I'm telling you --
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> We got back because we love each other very much.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay. All right.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> When we got back. I started school in California --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You might have feelings for her.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> No, what happened. He did obviously.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I got to see a picture of this broad you guys are fighting for.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> I'm never going to get mad at somebody for developing feelings for a woman or a woman develop -- That's why life goes. I just thought when I told him, listen I'm back, I went back and trying to [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well then you have feelings for her.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> Then he should've told me, that's not gonna happen, I have a thing for this girl. He said, yeah right you back off.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't even remember the conversation. I remember seeing you at Charles Evans party but I don't remember a conversation like that. So you know what I suggest? Try going back to her maybe you can get her back. Work your ass off. You obviously like her. Work your ass and get her back.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What about what Donald Trump is saying that, what about going back with her?
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> I make no bones about.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let me give you a reference. I'm going to call her and give you a reference. She called me all the time.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> Here we go now, okay.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let me just tell you. She calls me all the time. The next time she calls, I'm going to give you a reference. Maybe you can get her back.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> While I'm at lunch with her and the phone -- and the cell rings and she shows me it's you calling her constantly. What kind of proof do you want me to give you on that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well you can have her. So why wouldn't you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Try making a play for her A. J. maybe you can get her back
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> I can never be happy until I say I'm a master again. I make no bones [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Let me ask you something. Why don't you go back with Kara?
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> As I've always said, and this is the truth. When I'm back in New York, and I live hear again full-time, instead of every two weeks, and the timing is right and we still have the same kind of relationship, and we do we get along great together, that I would absolutely love to be with her again
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, try getting her back, A. J. She left you once before, but try to get her back. Listen, she told me, you borrowed $2,000 from me, and you're not gonna pay her back at me. What kind of stuff is that?
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> I bought a print from her. I bought a print from Sante, her ex-husband photographer. Of her and Chrisy Jones in a beautiful shot cost me two grand and change. She felt so guilty of doing what she did. She sent me a check for the frame. And I said, I don't want your check.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But she doesn't say that. She said, she loaned you money and you didn't pay her back. Pay her back, A. J.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> She didn't loaned it to me, she gave it to me. And you know what, screw you for being a little bitch for me for a while.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Hey, can you guys go on tour together? This is better than --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, I love it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, look Howard. A. J. and I really mean this A. J. is a nice guy.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Donald, you don't mean that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Unfortunately, he doesn't like me because of what happened. He knows what happened.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> I think there's a simple case to the awkward feeling that goes into your head. [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You, guys don't like each other.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hey, Donald. Just remember --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't dislike A. J. I don't care about A. J. I stole his girlfriend so he gets upset about it. He's got a reason for that, Robin.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You're not gonna steal my girlfriend, are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I promise.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But if Donald starts to go after your girlfriend, what do you do?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You give up.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Honestly, had I known that A. J. -- [Inaudible] Believe me
<Howard Stern> <Positive> If Donald Trump goes after your girlfriend, and your girlfriend goes out with him, he's doing you a favor.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> No, you're 100% right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why be upset?
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> You're 100% right. Let him go after everybody's girlfriend to test whether that girlfriend loves you or not.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Just leave it alone.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A. J. trust me, trust me A. J., she didn't love you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Seriously, she didn't love you, A. J.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm doing you a favor. She doesn't love you, A. J.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> Why don't you get her on the phone right now? Get her on the phone, big shot. Let her talk to you, let her talk to us.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't deal with her anymore. I'm done. A. J. you haven't finished with her, you have to come back.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You got a number on her?
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> I see her all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know the funny thing A. J.? If she wasn't taken away from you -- A. J., if she wasn't taken away from you, you wouldn't feel bitter.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> What an ass.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Is that why he still wants her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's what happens, Howard. You know when somebody gets taken away, you feel like a dog, you feel bitter.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's tru.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> You know I can't wait til your daughter gets a little older for me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I guarantee. You have zero chance.

<Howard Stern> <Positive> Please, Donald's not gonna box you. He has billions.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> With the last boxing match I saw you and Chuck Zito, he beat the crap out of him. What happened to you and Chuck Zito, A. J.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> It was one punch, it was honorable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You were down for the cut. You know a friend of mine was there, Howard. He said he never saw anybody so unconscious, they thought he was dead. You were laid out of the floor, the place --
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> Exactly. I make no balls back then.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, we saw that [Inaudible] he saw that he said, I never saw a guy get hurt so bad in my life. You know how long the fight lasted, Howard?

<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You'd last shorter -- Ask Chuck Zito about that. You'd last shorter than you did with Chuck.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> You know what I'll do with you? I'll beat that Mag comer in the ass and [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. You'll beat him up, you'll beat him up.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Wait, Donald and A. J, so many people wanted to comment on this. This is wild.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> Leave me alone head bag.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hey, Howard. There's nothing to comment on. You know, I'm doing this -- We really called about the Miss Universe contest tomorrow night.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Let me talk.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> You know what, I'm going to kick his ass. I will.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, you're not.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> Listen, you better travel galamada and not the puss setting you up. I wanna kick your old ass pretty soon.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Don't you think this girl is playing you guys a little bit.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> She's playing nobody.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What are you talking about.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, Howard. Hey Howard. I have a great girlfriend. I've been there for a long time. A. J. is still trying to get it back. She tells me that A. J. is trying to get her back.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> When she post for this German Playboy. She was going out with Donald, but she stayed with me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She wasn't going out with me then. She was not going out with me. You've broken up a long time before [Inaudible]
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> He cried over it. He cried over it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I doubt she was with you, number one. Number two, she had broken up we had broken up a long time before we get right boy.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> Yeah, he's always right. I'm always wrong.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, we're looking at pictures of her, she's hot.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> He's always right. I'm always wrong.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I have a question. How closely did you two follow each other?
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> What do you mean? [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I didn't follow. He's followed me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you wanna say to Robin?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me just put it to rest. Kara's a wonderful girl. Broke up with her a long time. A. J. is still trying -- listen A. J. is still trying to get her back, it's ridiculous. And it's not gonna happen in my opinion.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> Why does Marla Maples only taken a million of your money and move across the continent? Because no one wants to be with you. You are lying.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I guess, you know.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> If she signed a pre-nup, she would've taken more.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She likes me hell of a lot.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> She took no money and moved across the country.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Really? Is that what she says?
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> That's where she is. She's in California. By me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She certainly seems to like me a lot.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> I know. Everybody likes you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, everyone does like me, A. J.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> Wait, until Melania gets wound up and walks away too.
<Ralph Cirella> <Neutral> Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What is it?
<Ralph Cirella> <Negative> First of all, I think A. J. hates Trump because Trump's more pumped than A. J. I mean, I'm just shocked that A. J. got here in purpose.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A. J. doesn't like Trump for one reason, I stole his girlfriend, I took her away like he was a dog.
<Ralph Cirella> <Positive> This chicken is definitely playing this two, cause she gave A. J. back two grand then she tells Donald that he owes it to her.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> This guys has no idea. Ralph, just go find a guy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A. J., don't be so upset about it.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> The money story is so ridiculous. Me and Kara's [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She told me that you owe the money and didn't pay her back, and she was very angry with you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, let me tell you something. You know, this is unbelievable, I had no idea.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> I called Kara last night at 12
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Mary Ann from Brooklyn, what is it?
<Mary Ann (Caller)> <Neutral> Hey, Howard. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know what, A. J., go back and start getting her back. Maybe you'll be able to succeed, but I guarantee you, she's gonna leave you for the next guy down the bike.
<Mary Ann (Caller)> <Neutral> Hey, A. J.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A. J., she will leave you for the next guy down the bike. [Inaudible] Get it back. But you know what she'll leave you very quickly, A. J.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> All right. You know everything.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donald, let me ask you. Why do you think the girl left A. J.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because she met me, Howard. [Inaudible] Hey, Howard. She's gonna leave anyway.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. Mary Ann --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> When she was with him, he was getting on the plane, Howard -- [Inaudible]
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> I love this story.
<Mary Ann (Caller)> <Neutral> Donald.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> Gary, get on the phone.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Mary Ann (Caller)> <Negative> One thing for sure, A. J., Donald's wallet is much bigger than yours, so don't waste -- [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's not all about wallets. But let me just tell you, I know a lot of rich guys but they can't get anything.
<Mary Ann (Caller)> <Neutral> You know what, A. J. [Inaudible] calls the show and you're never gonna beat this guy out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let me just tell you this A. J. that while you were getting onto the plane to go to California, thinking that she was your girlfriend, she was someplace that you wouldn't have been very happy to go to.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> Here we go with this guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm telling you, A. J. I mean, you want the facts.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He's giving you the truth.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But now, what I think you should do, go back and try and get her.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> And the fact is when you -- [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Cause you're obviously like totally in love with her.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> When you're a man, showing your bed house with the blue-head people in it, and she was laughing in the porch and stuff, it's corny. When you told her where Nikki's room would be in the she was mortified by it all. She was in California and me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I wasn't even going with her then. Don't make up the story tom make this stuff look better. You know, you're writing a book like you're a big shot, you're not a big shot A. J. you're and you're loser.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> I know I'm not. Then why do you always like me. I'm a loser, why do you always like me, you ass-hole.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think you're a loser. But I do think you're a nice guy.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> Do me a favor travel with calamari.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Easy with the F word.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hey, A. J. let me ask you, how did you do against the cab driver? I know, and how much did it cost you? It practically ruined you, didn't it.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> 40000
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Huh? Well, that's more than you have, A. J.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> I'm gonna beat your ass with a load of shit.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Now, wait a second. Why do you guys have to fight over a woman. Wait, wait. Why --
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> Last thing I say -- No, Howard, I love you. Last thing I say I swear I'll shut up. I don't care what he says me. I'm gonna kill you one day.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Don't say that A. J.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> Not figuratively, but beat him really bad is what I'm saying.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You are not gonna beat him.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> I wanna beat him.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, take that back.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hey, A. J. Go back and try to get Kara.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> [Inaudible]. I have guys trying to bury you, I said no, you can't he's too high figure -- My guys wanna -- A. J., one night [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, You're not.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> You'll see.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Over a girl? Wait, Donald. Wait a second.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> This is about to get really weird.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why?
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> Line 17, I had a really convinced her to come on, so be nice with -- Kara's on the phone.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay, let's clear this up. Donald, you want this?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What is that?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Kara's on the phone.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, let her speak to A. J.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> No, no, no. Leave him on. Leave him on, Howard.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Is Kara on the phone?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Put her on.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Kara.
<Kara Young> <Neutral> Hello.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How are you.
<Kara Young> <Positive> Fine.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> By the way, I just saw a picture of you. You're beautiful.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> She hasn't heard a thing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, okay.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> We got Donald and A. J here. .
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Donald Trump and A. J. are having a terrible situation over you.
<Kara Young> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> They are very much insistent. AJ feels Donald back stabbed him and stole you away from him.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> The second time around, not the first time. First time we broken up.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And Donald's saying yes. In fact, you --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Donald's saying he stole her the first time.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> Donald's says the first time I was going to California and you're playing with him. He's just being insane.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Kara, what's the real story here? To help Donald Trump out and AJ. I'm trying to bring this guys closer together.
<Kara Young> <Negative> I think there's no danger of that happening.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What happened, Kara? Do you love, A. J. Or did you love Donald? What happened?
<Kara Young> <Neutral> I have a completely different boyfriend now.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> I told him that
<Kara Young> <Positive> And -- It's -- These are things that were years ago, that happen. And I consider myself to be very good friends to them. They're totally different people, and I don't know how close they were to begin with.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But why should they fight with each other.
<Kara Young> <Negative> They shouldn't fight with each other because it's something that's old, because they both have very big egos.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Can I ask you a question?
<Kara Young> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They are both similar kinds of guys.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> Nope.
<Kara Young> <Neutral> I don't think that they are so different than each other.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right. And that's the wrong.
<Kara Young> <Neutral> I think that -- I think obviously there's an age difference. And AJ's you know -- a little bit more wild guy. But they both have very big egos.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Who was better in bed? That was one of the questions.
<Kara Young> <Negative> No, I'm not gonna talk about that. I never talk about it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Donald feels he ruins you for AJ.
<Kara Young> <Positive> No. They're both -- I think you know, maybe it was the luckiest day of their life are the most unlucky day of their life that they met me. I was a compliment to both of them, and they both know that.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> It was my luckiest day.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Did Donald steal you from A. J.?
<Kara Young> <Negative> No. He didn't steal me from, AJ. AJ was already moving away to L. A...
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> Thank you.
<Kara Young> <Neutral> I did meet Donald and you know he was -- he was an intriguing person. I met him and --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donald, you're still there right. Go ahead.
<Kara Young> <Positive> And I started -- I started seeing him and I felt like I couldn't -- It's not something that you could go out with a couple of times without -- without it being pretty well known.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> Yeah. He called the papers himself. That's why [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's nice, AJ. AJ, how come you sent me a letter asking me to be on your show last week?
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> I didn't it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, really? How come -- Let me ask you a question, did your show send me a letter begging me to be on the show cause I haven't confronted you.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> I know did it. But I have nothing to do with it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What, you don't run your own show?
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> I was mortified. No, they want your recordings, you ass-face.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Wait a second.
<Kara Young> <Neutral> You know what, I can't believe that you're still doing this after all these years.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Kara you must be good, everybody loves you.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> He called in.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, he was calling to promote the Miss Universe.
<Kara Young> <Neutral> Well, Donald feels like I come off like a whore in the book, like I cheated on my husband.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> He said he didn't read it.
<Kara Young> <Positive> Okay. Well, I don't appreciate that because I don't think that that's the way I came off. That's not what happened.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Did you read the book?
<Kara Young> <Positive> Yes. Of course, I did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> Did you love it?
<Kara Young> <Positive> I loved it. It's like the kids stays in the picture, it made me cry. It's a great book.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Kara, let me ask you a question.
<Kara Young> <Negative> It's not exactly -- I'm sorry, It's not exactly factual. Things happen in different orders when they happened.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> She's right.
<Kara Young> <Negative> And it's exaggerated in some parts.[Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Kara, like Solomon, I'm trying to solve this. You and I had a relationship
<Kara Young> <Positive> Yes we did
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay. You guys broke up for whatever reason. I don't care what the reason is.
<Kara Young> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donald Trump meets you, you guys are together --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But Kara, you were going with AJ, when I met you, is that correct?
<Kara Young> <Negative> Yes. But you know what, I'm not going to tell lies here.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Is that the correct statement Kara?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Did you date him while you were dating AJ?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And you have AJ after you met me, is that correct?
<Kara Young> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. That's all I need. Howard, she left AJ after she met me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Kara, you left AJ after.
<Kara Young> <Neutral> He was seeing someone else, and --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So, if Donald Trump --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Wait a minute, Howard.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> He's wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You -- Kara -- Howard -- AJ, listen for one second, you and Kara were going out together, you were going out to California, but you were still very much with Kara, I didn't know that.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> I was not.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I started going with Kara when you and Kara were fully in bloom and fully going out and then Kara left you.
<Kara Young> <Negative> That's not true.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is that correct, Kara?
<Kara Young> <Negative> I think this is childish.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I agree with that.
<Kara Young> <Neutral> Two grown men are doing this.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> I can't take liars, though. I can't take his lies.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He's not lying though.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Kara says it's not true.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> What's wrong with you guys?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, Kara said this was not true/
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Kara said it is true.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No. She said it's not true.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> Kara, say it again, baby.
<Kara Young> <Neutral> What?
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> She said it's not true?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What's not true? Kara and AJ were going together --
<Kara Young> <Neutral> [Inaudible] We decided to give up on a long distance relationship.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> Thank you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So, fine. So let's move on.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Didn't you decided to give him up when you met me? Come on, Kara. Tell them the truth. You gave up on the relationship after you met me.
<Kara Young> <Negative> Well, no one can be taken away from someone else.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> I agree. I said that earlier.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Now, wait a minute. You got back together --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hey, Howard. I only called here -- Hey, Howard. Just so you understand, I called about Miss Universe. [Inaudible.
<Kara Young> <Positive> That's a pretty strange coincidence. [Inaudible] You know what, Donald you're just gonna promote AJ's book and make [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The only thing that I want people to understand is that you know, when A. J. says I like publicity, he's the one that wrote me a letter begging me to be on his show.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> It's a lie. I didn't write a letter.
<Kara Young> <Positive> But you love publicity. You love to be in the paper. I think it's not bad thing, that it's a true thing now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This morning I called up about the Miss Universe contest, but all of a sudden I'm in this thing with AJ.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> He picks today, I don't know --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. I'm sorry. By the way, I hope you know I wasn't setting you up. I just wanted you guys to -- [Inaudible]
<Kara Young> <Neutral> [Inaudible] Howard Stern, he listens to Howard Stern every morning.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I like Donald a lot.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> I got a quick question for Kara. This is Gary. I just called Kara to get her on the phone I was trying to explain what was going on.
<Kara Young> <Positive> And I didn't want to go.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> But I said we can settle this Kara. A. J. was saying that Donald was calling you incessantly trying to get you back. True or not?
<Kara Young> <Neutral> He didn't call me and try to get me back.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He did not?
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> He used to, baby.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's not true. Kara, tell the truth, that's not true.
<Kara Young> <Negative> I don't want to say anything to hurt any relationship you may be in at this time. So, I'll just you know I'll just drop by.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I just want to clear up --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Kara, tell them it's not true that I hadn't called you to get you back. I mean that's the truth. I have not called you to get you back.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> What can say, she's got a girlfriend now, ma. She's trying to be cool to him. [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Did you date both Donald and AJ at the same time when you two got back together?
<Kara Young> <Negative> No. Listen, I did not handle that situation properly, and I wish I could've handled it differently than I did. I was in a long distance relationship and I should've been very, very clear that I was dating someone else. I was married for a long time. I was married on the '90s so, when I started dating -- in the'80s you could date two people and then kind of decide who you want to be with, and I was that, and I didn't handle that properly. And it's something that I'm not proud of and I can't believe that four years five years later I'm still hounded and ridiculed by [Inaudible]
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> You're not being ridiculed. But when somebody calls and starts lying about the way it was [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He was not lying, though so far, was he?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So far -- Excuse me, Howard I've been born out 100%.
<Kara Young> <Negative> Didn't she just say it's not true what he said before.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I mean does the timeline thing --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I wouldn't say 100% Donald.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But she is saying -- You guys may not have an exclusive.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> Kara just said, what Donald said was not true. Why does he think that he's 100% I can't believe this guy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What was not true.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What's not true?
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> He said we dated at the same time, Kara said, not true.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I didn't know it. The only difference is I was the guy who didn't know it. [Inaudible]
<Kara Young> <Neutral> We did not date at the same time.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> Thank you. Now why can't this ass hear that?
<Kara Young> <Neutral> I met -- I met you when I was going out with AJ, and I started -- It was faltering already. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I know, but my point of view is this. That even backs it up even more why you shouldn't be with AJ.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But that is the same time. She just said, she met me while she was going out with AJ. That's just the same time.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> She met you, but she's not my girlfriend yet. What's wrong with that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> AJ, the fact is, I didn't know it.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> But you weren't -- Oh my god.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I didn't know it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But here's the point, guys. She went out with both you guys, why not just leave it at that. You all had a good time together.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> I can't take his lying.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I don't think he's really -- I mean he thinks that -- I mean it's not -- it's not such a big issue. He didn't steal your girlfriend. He went out with her. And you said back off. Why should he back off.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> He says he's not -- He says I stole you girl he's been saying it. That's not how --
<Kara Young> <Positive> Listen, you both her very big mouth. And has anything ever happened that was improper. Has anybody ever tried to see me when they shouldn't have. Yes, they have. And that is the fact, and everybody knows it. And I do not want to go on and on. I don't -- do not want to go on and on about it because I didn't act entirely properly nor somebody people on the phone.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I've got to tell you something, honey. This is-this is great advertising.
<Kara Young> <Neutral> How is that?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You're some hot chick and you got Donald Trump and A. J. Benza both love you.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> This is really takes about Kara. And I'll take this migrant. I have said it all the time. I say to my book, she's the most beautiful girl, the funniest girl, the best friend I have in the planet for real.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Is this love of your life. Yes. Unequivocally I love my life, unequivocally.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So what are you doing, go get her back.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> I don't mind that a man -- I already said my book what I hope to have happen [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Don't get mad at Trump then.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> I'm not mad man for what happened. I know the ways of love. I understand that. I'm really -- I understand love and passion.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Can I just say something, a girl this good looking, tons of guys are gonna hit on her every day.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> You think I don't know that when I was with her?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> If she loves you, she's gonna stay with you.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> I understand that. And she did. I just a man who just take her seriously.
<Kara Young> <Neutral> Howard, together with AJ a year and a half before Donald.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And Trump's saying, hey, he fell for it too. He had a nice relationship. Why argue with each other.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> I'm not -- I argue with these lies.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It's a feather in your cap, AJ.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. This I like you.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No, no, no. Not her, I'm just saying that Donald's [Inaudible] with your girl.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Just view it very positively
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> I'm sorry.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Just view it very positively. There's nothing wrong. I mean, just take it nice and easy. You wrote a book you said things in the book that weren't true.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> You didn't read. How do you know?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because I was told.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> Yeah. You were told.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Four people called me up and they said, AJ said this and that. When you said about me with publicity and yet you send me -- Howard, he sends me a letter, I have it right in front of me begging me to be on his first show.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> I didn't write the letter. I can't -- I can't take this guy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right. Listen, listen. Let me talk. Hey Kara, thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By the way, Howard, which I turned down.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> Yeah. I know because we wanted him so bad.
<Kara Young> <Neutral> But you know what, just because the relationship doesn't continue and doesn't work out doesn't mean that -- You know we all grew from it and learn things.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I want to meet you. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Howard, you know the bottom line, and think it's positive.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We've all gone separate ways. I have a girlfriend who's a terrific girl. Kara, from what I understand, a terrific boyfriend. And A. J., I think, well I hope has a good girlfriend.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> Thanks for helping man. I'm doing okay.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know. Do you not?
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> Listen, I'm doing fine.

<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well let me ask you this. This Miss France, right? Mr. France, whatever. If she had if it had been proven that at one time she was a man and she did have a sex change operation. Would you have allowed her to stay in the contest?
