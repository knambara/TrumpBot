<Julie Pace> <Neutral> I do want to talk to you about the 100 days.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> I want to ask a few questions on some topics that are happening toward the end of the interview.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Did you see Aya [Hijazi, an Egyptian-American charity worker who had been detained in the country for nearly three years] ...
<Julie Pace> <Negative> Can you tell me a little bit about how that came about?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, just -- you know, I asked the government to let her out...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know Obama worked on it for three years, got zippo, zero.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> How did you hear about this story?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Many people, human rights people, are talking about it. It's an incredible thing, especially when you meet her. You realize -- I mean, she was in a rough place.
<Julie Pace> <Negative> Did you have to strike a deal with [Abdel-Fattah] el-Sissi over this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No deal. He was here. He -- I said, "I really would appreciate it if you would look into this and let her out." And as you know, she went through a trial. And anyway, she was let go. And not only she, it was a total of eight people...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, it's funny: One of the best chemistries I had was with [Angela] Merkel. [Crosstalk
<Julie Pace> <Negative> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Chancellor Merkel.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I guess somebody shouted out, "Shake her hand, shake her hand," you know. But I never heard it. But I had already shaken her hand four times. You know, because we were together for a long time.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> Did you expect you would have good chemistry with her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. Because, um, I'm at odds on, you know, the NATO payments and I'm at odds on immigration. We had unbelievable chemistry. And people have given me credit for having great chemistry with all of the leaders, including el-Sissi...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it was a great thing to see that happen.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> Do you feel like you have changed the office of the presidency, how the presidency can be used to effect change?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think the 100 days is, you know, it's an artificial barrier. It's not very meaningful. I think I've established amazing relationships that will be used the four or eight years, whatever period of time I'm here. I think for that I would be getting very high marks because I've established great relationships with countries, as President el-Sissi has shown and others have shown. Well, if you look at the president of China, people said they've never seen anything like what's going on right now. I really liked him a lot. I think he liked me. We have a great chemistry together...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've developed great relationships with all of these leaders. Nobody's written that. In fact, they said, "Oh, well, he's not treating them nicely," because on NATO, I want them to pay up. But I still get along with them great, and they will pay up. In fact, with the Italian prime minister yesterday, you saw, we were joking, "Come on, you have to pay up, you have to pay up." He'll pay.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> Did he say that? In your meeting? Your private meeting?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's going to end up paying. But you know, nobody ever asked the question. Nobody asked. Nobody ever asked him to pay up. So it's a different kind of a presidency.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> Do you feel like that's one thing that you've changed, that you maybe are actually asking the direct questions about some of these things?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah. Let me give me an example. A little before I took office there was a terrible article about the F-35 fighter jet. It was hundreds of billions of dollars over budget. It was seven years behind schedule. It was a disaster. So I called in Lockheed and I said, "I'm sorry, we're going to have to bid this out to another company, namely Boeing," or whoever else. But Boeing. And I called in Boeing and I started getting competing offers back and forth...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I saved $725 million on the 90 planes. Just 90. Now there are 3,000 planes that are going to be ordered. On 90 planes I saved $725 million. It's actually a little bit more than that, but it's $725 million. Gen. Mattis, who had to sign the deal when it came to his office, said, "I've never seen anything like this in my life." We went from a company that wanted more money for the planes to a company that cut. And the reason they cut -- same planes, same everything -- was because of me. I mean, because that's what I do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now if you multiply that times 3,000 planes, you know this is on 90 planes. In fact, when the Prime Minister Abe of Japan came in because they bought a certain number of those... The first thing he said to me, because it was right at the time I did it, he said, "Could I thank you?" I said, "What?" He said, "You saved us $100 million." Because they got a $100 million savings on the 10 or 12 planes that they bought. Nobody wrote that story. Now you know that's a saving of billions and billions of dollars, many billions of dollars over the course of -- it's between 2,500 and 3,000 planes will be the final order. But this was only 90 of those 2,500 planes.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> And you expect those savings to carry out across that full order?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> More. I'm gonna get more than that. This was a thing that was out of control and now it's great. And the woman that runs Lockheed, Marillyn [Hewson], she was great. But all of a sudden it was a different kind of a thing. You know?
<Julie Pace> <Positive> Do you feel like you've been able to apply that kind of a relationship to your dealings with Congress as well?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have great relationships with Congress. I think we're doing very well and I think we have a great foundation for future things. We're going to be applying, I shouldn't tell you this, but we're going to be announcing, probably on Wednesday, tax reform. And it's -- we've worked on it long and hard. And you've got to understand, I've only been here now 93 days, 92 days. President Obama took 17 months to do Obamacare. I've been here 92 days but I've only been working on the health care, you know I had to get like a little bit of grounding right? Health care started after 30 day, so I've been working on health care for 60 days...You know, we're very close. And it's a great plan, you know, we have to get it approved.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> Is it this deal that's between the Tuesday Group and the Freedom Caucus, is that the deal you're looking at?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So the Republican Party has various groups, all great people. They're great people. But some are moderate, some are very conservative. The Democrats don't seem to have that nearly as much. You know the Democrats have, they don't have that. The Republicans do have that. And I think it's fine. But you know there's a pretty vast area in there. And I have a great relationship with all of them. Now, we have government not closing. I think we'll be in great shape on that. It's going very well. Obviously, that takes precedent.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> That takes precedent over health care? For next week?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, sure. Next week. Because the hundred days is just an artificial barrier. The press keeps talking about the hundred days. But we've done a lot. You have a list of things. I don't have to read it.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> You did put out though, as a candidate, you put out a 100-day plan. Do you feel like you should be held accountable to that plan?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Somebody, yeah, somebody put out the concept of a hundred-day plan. But yeah. Well, I'm mostly there on most items. Go over the items, and I'll talk to you ... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But things change. There has to be flexibility. Let me give you an example. President Xi, we have a, like, a really great relationship. For me to call him a currency manipulator and then say, "By the way, I'd like you to solve the North Korean problem," doesn't work. So you have to have a certain flexibility, Number One. Number Two, from the time I took office till now, you know, it's a very exact thing. It's not like generalities. Do you want a Coke or anything?
<Julie Pace> <Positive> I'm OK, thank you. No...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But President Xi, from the time I took office, he has not, they have not been currency manipulators. Because there's a certain respect because he knew I would do something or whatever. But more importantly than him not being a currency manipulator the bigger picture, bigger than even currency manipulation, if he's helping us with North Korea, with nuclear and all of the things that go along with it, who would call, what am I going to do, say, "By the way, would you help us with North Korea? And also, you're a currency manipulator." It doesn't work that way.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the media, some of them get it, in all fairness. But you know some of them either don't get it, in which case they're very stupid people, or they just don't want to say it. You know because of a couple of them said, "He didn't call them a currency manipulator." Well, for two reasons. Number One, he's not, since my time. You know, very specific formula. You would think it's like generalities, it's not. They have -- they've actually -- their currency's gone up. So it's a very, very specific formula. And I said, "How badly have they been,"... they said, "Since you got to office they have not manipulated their currency." That's Number One, but much more important, they are working with us on North Korea. Now maybe that'll work out or maybe it won't. Can you imagine? ...
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> So in terms of the 100-day plan that you did put out during the campaign, do you feel, though, that people should hold you accountable to this in terms of judging success?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, because much of the foundation's been laid. Things came up. I'll give you an example. I didn't put Supreme Court judge on the 100 day plan, and I got a Supreme Court judge.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> I think it's on there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know...
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> Begin the process of selecting. You actually exceeded on this one. This says, "Begin the process of selecting a replacement."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's the biggest thing I've done.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> Do you consider that your biggest success?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I -- first of all I think he's a great man. I think he will be a great, great justice of the Supreme Court. I have always heard that the selection and the affirmation of a Supreme Court judge is the biggest thing a president can do. Don't forget, he could be there for 40 years.... He's a young man. I've always heard that that's the biggest thing. Now, I would say that defense is the biggest thing. You know, to be honest, there are a number of things. But I've always heard that the highest calling is the nomination of a Supreme Court justice. I've done one in my first 70 days.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Our military is so proud. They were not proud at all. They had their heads down. Now they have their heads up...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm rebuilding the military. We have great people. We have great things in place. We have tremendous borders. I mention the F-35 because if I can save $725 million -- look at that, that's a massive amount of money. And I'll save more as we make more planes. If I can save that on a small number of planes -- Gen. Mattis said, "I've never seen anything like this," because he had to sign the ultimate [Inaudible]... He had to sign the ultimate, you know. He said, "I've never seen anything like this before, as long as I've been in the military." You know, that kind of cutting.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, if I can do that [Inaudible]... As an example, the aircraft carriers, billions of dollars, the Gerald Ford, billions and billions over budget. That won't happen.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> Is that something you're going to take on?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] But as we order the other ones, because they want to order 12, the other ones are going to come in much less expensive...
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> Can I ask you, over your first 100 days -- you're not quite there yet -- how do you feel like the office has changed you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well the one thing I would say -- and I say this to people -- I never realized how big it was. Everything's so [Inaudible] like, you know the orders are so massive. I was talking to --
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> You mean the responsibility of it, or do you mean --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Number One, there's great responsibility. When it came time to, as an example, send out the 59 missiles, the Tomahawks in Syria. I'm saying to myself, "You know, this is more than just like, 79 missiles. This is death that's involved," because people could have been killed. This is risk that's involved, because if the missile goes off and goes in a city or goes in a civilian area -- you know, the boats were hundreds of miles away -- and if this missile goes off and lands in the middle of a town or a hamlet .... every decision is much harder than you'd normally make. [Inaudible]... This is involving death and life and so many things.... So it's far more responsibility. [Inaudible] ....The financial cost of everything is so massive, every agency. This is thousands of times bigger, the United States, than the biggest company in the world. The second-largest company in the world is the Defense Department. The third-largest company in the world is Social Security. The fourth-largest -- you know, you go down the list.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's massive. And every agency is, like, bigger than any company. So you know, I really just see the bigness of it all, but also the responsibility. And the human responsibility. You know, the human life that's involved in some of the decisions.
<Julie Pace> <Negative> You've talked a little bit about the way that you've brought some business skills into the office. Is there anything from your business background that just doesn't translate into the presidency, that just simply is not applicable to this job?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well in business, you don't necessarily need heart, whereas here, almost everything affects people. So if you're talking about health care -- you have health care in business but you're trying to just negotiate a good price on health care, et cetera, et cetera. You're providing health. This is [Inaudible]. Here, everything, pretty much everything you do in government, involves heart, whereas in business, most things don't involve heart.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> What's that switch been like for you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In fact, in business you're actually better off without it.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> What's making that switch been like for you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have to love people. And if you love people, such a big responsibility. [Inaudible] You can take any single thing, including even taxes. I mean we're going to be doing major tax reform. Here's part of your story, it's going to be a big [Inaudible]. Everybody's saying, "Oh, he's delaying." I'm not delaying anything. I'll tell you the other thing is [Inaudible]. I used to get great press. I get the worst press. I get such dishonest reporting with the media. That's another thing that really has -- I've never had anything like it before. It happened during the primaries, and I said, you know, when I won, I said, "Well the one thing good is now I'll get good press." And it got worse. [Inaudible] So that was one thing that a little bit of a surprise to me. I thought the press would become better, and it actually, in my opinion, got more nasty.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> But in terms of tax reform, how are you going to roll that out next week?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I'm going to roll probably on Wednesday, around Wednesday of next week, we're putting out a massive tax reform -- business and for people -- we want to do both. We've been working on it [Inaudible]. Secretary Mnuchin is a very talented person, very smart. Very successful [Inaudible].... We're going to be putting that out on Wednesday or shortly thereafter. Let me leave a little room just in case [Inaudible].... And that's a big story, because a lot of people think I'm going to put it out much later.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> Do you have any details on that in terms of rates?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Only in terms that it will be a massive tax cut. It will be bigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever. Maybe the biggest tax cut we've ever had...
<Julie Pace> <Negative> Obviously, that's going to come in a week where you're going to be running up against the deadline for keeping the government open. If you get a bill on your desk that does not include funding for the wall, will you sign it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know yet. People want the border wall. My base definitely wants the border wall, my base really wants it -- you've been to many of the rallies. OK, the thing they want more than anything is the wall. My base, which is a big base; I think my base is 45 percent. You know, it's funny. The Democrats, they have a big advantage in the electoral college. Big, big, big advantage. I've always said the popular vote would be a lot easier than the electoral college. The electoral college -- but it's a whole different campaign [Inaudible]. The electoral college is very difficult for a Republican to win, and I will tell you, the people want to see it. They want to see the wall, they want to see security. Now, it just came out that they're 73 percent down.... That's a tremendous achievement.... Look at this, in 100 days, that down to the lowest in 17 years and it's going lower. Now, people aren't coming because they know they're not going to get through, and there isn't crime. You know the migration up to the border is horrible for women, you know that? [Unintelligible] Now, much of that's stopped because they can't get through.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> It sounds like maybe you're beginning to send a message that if you do get a spending bill that doesn't have border funding in there, you would sign it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, first of all, the wall will cost much less than the numbers I'm seeing. I'm seeing numbers, I mean, this wall is not going to be that expensive.
<Julie Pace> <Negative> What do you think the estimate on it would be?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh I'm seeing numbers -- $24 billion, I think I'll do it for $10 billion or less. That's not a lot of money relative to what we're talking about. If we stop 1 percent of the drugs from coming in -- and we'll stop all of it. But if we stop 1 percent of the drugs because we have the wall -- they're coming around in certain areas, but if you have a wall, they can't do it because it's a real wall. That's a tremendously good investment, 1 percent. The drugs pouring through on the southern border are unbelievable. We're becoming a drug culture, there's so much. And most of it's coming from the southern border. The wall will stop the drugs.
<Julie Pace> <Negative> But, just trying to nail you down on it one more time, will you sign a spending bill if it doesn't have --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to comment. I just don't know yet. I mean, I have to see what's going on. I really do. But the wall's a very important thing to -- not only my base, but to the people. And even if it wasn't, I mean I'll do things that aren't necessarily popular.... The wall is very important to stopping drugs.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> If you don't have a funding stream, your message to your base is what?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My base understands the wall is going to get built, whether I have it funded here or if I get it funded shortly thereafter, that wall's getting built, OK? One hundred percent. One hundred percent it's getting built. And it's also getting built for much less money -- I hope you get this -- than these people are estimating. The opponents are talking $25 billion for the wall. It's not going to cost anywhere near that.
<Julie Pace> <Negative> You think $10 billion or less.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think $10 billion or less. And if I do a super-duper, higher, better, better security, everything else, maybe it goes a little bit more. But it's not going to be anywhere near those kind of numbers. And they're using those numbers; they're using the high numbers to make it sound impalatable. And the fact it's going to cost much less money, just like the airplane I told you about, which I hope you can write about. [Interview goes off the record]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They had a quote from me that NATO's obsolete. But they didn't say why it was obsolete. I was on Wolf Blitzer, very fair interview, the first time I was ever asked about NATO, because I wasn't in government. People don't go around asking about NATO if I'm building a building in Manhattan, right? So they asked me, Wolf... asked me about NATO, and I said two things. NATO's obsolete -- not knowing much about NATO, now I know a lot about NATO -- NATO is obsolete, and I said, "And the reason it's obsolete is because of the fact they don't focus on terrorism." You know, back when they did NATO there was no such thing as terrorism.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> What specifically has NATO changed?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Citing Wall Street Journal Article]... I did an interview with Wolf Blitzer, and I said NATO was obsolete -- I said two things -- obsolete, and the country's aren't paying. I was right about both. I took such heat for about three days on both, because nobody ever criticized NATO. I took heat like you wouldn't believe. And then some expert on NATO said, "You know, Trump is right." But I said it was obsolete because they weren't focused on terror...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not fair that we're paying close to 4 percent and other countries that are more directly affected are paying 1 percent when they're supposed to be paying 2 percent. And I'm very strong on it and I'm going to be very strong on it when I go there in a month."
<Julie Pace> <Negative> This morning you tweeted that after the possible terrorist attack in Paris, that it will have a big effect on the upcoming French election. What did you mean by that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it will have a big effect on who people are going to vote for in the election.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> Do you think it's going to help Marine Le Pen?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think so.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> Do you believe that she should be the president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I have no comment on that, but I think that it'll probably help her because she is the strongest on borders and she is the strongest on what's been going on in France.
<Julie Pace> <Negative> Do you worry at all that by saying that, that a terrorist attack would have an impact on a democratic election, that it would actually embolden terrorists to try to --.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. Look, everybody is making predictions who is going to win. I am no different than you, you could say the same thing...
<Julie Pace> <Negative> I just wonder if you are encouraging, you are the president of the United States, so to say that you worry that it encourages terrorists ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I am no different than -- no, I think it discourages terrorists, I think it discourages. I think what we've done on the border discourages it. I think that my stance on having people come in to this country that we have no idea who they are and in certain cases you will have radical Islamic terrorism. I'm not going to have it in this country. I'm not going to let what happened to France and other places happen here. And it's already largely, you know -- we have tens -- we have hundreds of thousands of people that have been allowed into our country that should not be here. They shouldn't be here. We have people allowed into our country with no documentation whatsoever. They have no documentation and they were allowed under the previous administrations, they were allowed into our country. It's a big mistake.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> Just so that I am clear. You are not endorsing her for the office, but you are --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am not endorsing her and I didn't mention her name.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> Right, I just wanted to make sure I have that clear.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I believe whoever is the toughest on radical Islamic terrorism and whoever is the toughest at the borders will do well at the election. I am not saying that person is going to win, she is not even favored to win, you know. Right now, she is in second place.
<Julie Pace> <Negative> I have a question on the markets, actually. One thing that I think has been different about this White House is that you do point to the markets as a sign of progress. Do you worry, though -- I mean, the markets go up and down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You live by the sword, you die by the sword, to a certain extent. But we create a lot of jobs, 500,000 jobs as of two months ago, and plenty created since. Five hundred thousand.... As an example, Ford, General Motors. I've had cases where the gentleman from China, Ma, Jack Ma, he comes up, he says, "Only because of you am I making this massive investment." Intel, only because of you.... The press never writes that.
<Julie Pace> <Negative> What about NAFTA? What's the plan on NAFTA?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What would you like to know?
<Julie Pace> <Positive> I would like to know what your plan is in terms of renegotiating.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am very upset with NAFTA. I think NAFTA has been a catastrophic trade deal for the United States, trading agreement for the United States. It hurts us with Canada, and it hurts us with Mexico. Most people don't even think of NAFTA in terms of Canada. You saw what happened yesterday in my statements, because if you look at the dairy farmers in Wisconsin and upstate New York, they are getting killed by NAFTA.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> Is your plan still, though, to renegotiate the whole deal?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am going to either renegotiate it or I am going to terminate it.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> Termination is still on the table.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Absolutely. If they don't treat fairly, I am terminating NAFTA.
<Julie Pace> <Negative> What's a timeline for that decision?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a six-month termination clause, I have the right to do it, it's a six-month clause.
<Julie Pace> <Negative> If I could fit a couple of more topics. Jeff Sessions, your attorney general, is taking a tougher line suddenly on Julian Assange, saying that arresting him is a priority. You were supportive of what WikiLeaks was doing during the campaign with the release of the Clinton emails. Do you think that arresting Assange is a priority for the United States?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When Wikileaks came out... never heard of Wikileaks, never heard of it. When Wikileaks came out, all I was just saying is, "Well, look at all this information here, this is pretty good stuff." You know, they tried to hack the Republican, the RNC, but we had good defenses. They didn't have defenses, which is pretty bad management. But we had good defenses, they tried to hack both of them. They weren't able to get through to Republicans. No, I found it very interesting when I read this stuff and I said, "Wow." It was just a figure of speech. I said, "Well, look at this. It's good reading."
<Julie Pace> <Negative> But that didn't mean that you supported what Assange is doing?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't support or unsupport. It was just information. They shouldn't have allowed it to get out. If they had the proper defensive devices on their internet, you know, equipment, they wouldn't even allow the FBI. How about this -- they get hacked, and the FBI goes to see them, and they won't let the FBI see their server. But do you understand, nobody ever writes it. Why wouldn't [John] Podesta and Hillary Clinton allow the FBI to see the server? They brought in another company that I hear is Ukrainian-based.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> CrowdStrike?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's what I heard. I heard it's owned by a very rich Ukrainian, that's what I heard. But they brought in another company to investigate the server. Why didn't they allow the FBI in to investigate the server? I mean, there is so many things that nobody writes about. It's incredible.
<Julie Pace> <Negative> Can I just ask you, though -- do you believe it is a priority for the United States, or it should be a priority, to arrest Julian Assange?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am not involved in that decision, but if Jeff Sessions wants to do it, it's OK with me. I didn't know about that decision, but if they want to do it, it's OK with me.
<Julie Pace> <Negative> On Iran, which is another thing you talked a lot on the campaign --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And the other thing that we should go after is the leakers...
<Julie Pace> <Negative> On Iran, you also talked about it quite a bit on the campaign trail. And you said in the press conference yesterday that you think that Iran is violating the spirit of the agreement. When you say that, do you mean in terms of the actual nuclear accord, or do you mean what they are doing in the region?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In terms of what they are doing all over the Middle East and beyond.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> So you believe that they are complying with the agreement?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't say that. I say that I believe they have broken the spirit of the agreement. There is a spirit to agreements, and they have broken it.
<Julie Pace> <Negative> In terms of what they are doing elsewhere in the Middle East?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In terms of what they are doing of all over.
<Julie Pace> <Negative> When you talk to European leaders, when you talk to Merkel, for example, or Teresa May, what do they say about the nuclear deal? Do they want you to stay in that deal?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't talk to them about it.
<Julie Pace> <Negative> You don't talk to them about the Iran deal?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mention it, but it's very personal when I talk to them, you know, it's confidential. No, they have their own opinions. I don't say that they are different than my opinions, but I'd rather have you ask them that question.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> At this point, do you believe that you will stay in the nuclear deal?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's possible that we won't.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> Dreamers, you've talked about them, you've talked about heart earlier. This is one area where you have talked --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, we aren't looking to do anything right now. Look, the dreamers... this is an interesting case, they left and they came back and he's got some problems, it's a little different than the dreamer case, right? But we are putting MS-13 in jail and getting them the hell out of our country. They've taken over towns and cities and we are being really brutal with MS-13, and that's what we should be. They are a bad group, and somebody said they are as bad as al-Qaida, which is a hell of a reference. So we are moving criminals out of our country and we are getting them out in record numbers and those are the people we are after. We are not after the dreamers, we are after the criminals.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> And that's going to be the policy of your administration to allow the dreamers to stay?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. Yes. That's our policy. I am not saying... long-term, we are going to have to fix the problem, the whole immigration problem. But I will tell you: Right now we have a great gentleman, one of my real stars is Gen. Kelly, now Secretary Kelly. We are down 73 percent at the border, we are cleaning out cities and towns of hard-line criminals, some of the worst people on earth, people that rape and kill women, people that are killing people just for the sake of having fun. They are being thrown in jails and they are being... all over the country and nobody's ever done it like us, so we are being unbelievably thorough with that. We are out in Long Island cleaning out the MS-13 scum, they are all scum, that's probably the worst gang anywhere on Earth...
<Julie Pace> <Negative> A lot of the dreamers have been hoping to hear something from you. I don't want to give them the wrong message with this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Here is what they can hear: The dreamers should rest easy. OK? I'll give you that. The dreamers should rest easy... [An aide talks about Trump's address to Congress]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A lot of the people have said that, some people said it was the single best speech ever made in that chamber.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> You seem like you enjoyed it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I did. I did. I believed in it and I enjoyed it. It was a great feeling to introduce the wife of a great young soldier who died getting us very valuable information. Have you seen the tremendous success?... That's another thing that nobody talks about. Have you seen the tremendous success we've had in the Middle East with the ISIS? When [Haider al] Abadi left from Iraq, he said Trump has more success in eight weeks than Obama had in eight years.... We have had tremendous success, but we don't talk about it. We don't talk about it.
<Julie Pace> <Negative> Do you mean you don't talk about it personally because you don't want to talk about it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't talk about it. No. And the generals don't talk about it.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> You had put a request into the Pentagon to put forward an ISIS plan within 30 days. I know they have sent that over. Have you accepted a plan? Are you moving forward on a strategy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have a very strong plan, but we cannot talk about it, Julie.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> So you have decided on a plan?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Remember how many times have you been to the speech where I talked about Mosul.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right. Mosul. Four months we are going in, three months. We are still fighting Mosul. You know why? Because they were prepared. If we would have gone in and just done it, it would have been over three months ago.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> Can you say generally what the strategy is? Should people --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Generally is we have got to get rid of ISIS. We have no choice. And other terrorist organizations.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> Should Americans who are serving in the military expect that you are going to increase troop numbers in the Middle East to fight ISIS?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, not much.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> In terms of the strategy, though, that you have accepted, it sounds like, from the generals --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they've also accepted my strategy.
<Julie Pace> <Negative> Does that involve more troops on the ground, it sounds like?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not many.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> So a small increase?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It could be an increase, then an increase. But not many more. I want to do the job, but not many more.... This is an important story. I've done a lot. I've done more than any other president in the first 100 days and I think the first 100 days is an artificial barrier. And I'm scheduled... the foundations have been set to do some great things. With foreign countries. Look at, look at President Xi. I mean ...
<Julie Pace> <Negative> What do you think it was about your chemistry?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We had good chemistry. Now I don't know that I think that's going to produce results but you've got a good chance.
<Julie Pace> <Negative> Uh-huh.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, he turned down many coal ships. These massive coal ships are coming where they get a lot of their income. They're coming into China and they're being turned away. That's never happened before. The fuel, the oil, so many different things. You saw the editorial they had in their paper saying they cannot be allowed to have nuclear, you know, et cetera. People have said they've never seen this ever before in China. We have the same relationship with others. There's a great foundation that's built. Great foundation. And I think it's going to produce tremendous results for our country.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> One more 100 days question.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's fine.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> ... is do you think you have the right team in place for your next 100 days?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. I think my team has been, well, I have different teams. I think my military team has been treated with great respect. As they should be. I think my other team hasn't been treated with the respect that they should get. We have some very talented people, and very diverse people.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> Do you mean your White House team when you say that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, my White House team. I think Reince has been doing an excellent job. I think that, you know, this is a very tough environment not caused necessarily by me. Although the election has, you know, look, the Democrats had a tremendous opportunity because the electoral college, as I said, is so skewed to them. You start off by losing in New York and California, no matter who it is. If, if Abe Lincoln came back to life, he would lose New York and he would lose California. It's just the registration, there's nothing you can do. So you're losing the two biggest states, that's where you start. OK. The Electoral College is so skewed in favor of a Democrat that it's very, very hard. Look at Obama's number in the Electoral College. His numbers on the win were... but the Electoral College numbers were massive. You lose New York, you lose Illinois. Illinois is impossible to win. And you look at, so now you lose New York, Illinois, no matter what you do, and California. Right. And you say, man. Now you have to win Florida, you have to win Ohio, you have to win North Carolina. You have to win all these states, and then I won Wisconsin and Michigan and all of these other places, but you remember there was no way to, there was no way to 270.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So she had this massive advantage, she spent hundreds of millions of dollars more money than I spent. Hundreds of millions... Yeah. Or more, actually because we were $375 she was at $2.2 billion. But whatever. She spent massive amounts of money more and she lost. Solidly lost, because you know it wasn't 270, it was 306. So there's anger. But there was massive anger before I got there, so it's not easy for a White House staff to realize that you are going into a situation where you are going to be at no, where are going to get no votes. I mean, here's a judge who is No. 1 at Columbia, No. 1 at Harvard and an Oxford scholar. And he got three votes.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> Three Democratic votes, but yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Three Democratic votes. OK. He's an Oxford scholar at the highest level. The No. 1, you know, one of the great academics, one of the great writers. No bad decisions with all... nothing. He's like a ...
<Julie Pace> <Negative> Do you think that you can break through that? I mean this --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, I do.
<Julie Pace> <Negative> Is one of the biggest challenges for a president.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I can to an extent. But there's a, there's a basic hard-line core that you can't break though, OK, that you can't break through. There's a hard-line group you can't break through, you can't. It's sad. You can't. Look, I met with Congressman Cummings and I really liked him, a lot. Elijah Cummings. I really liked him a lot. And during the conversation because we have a very strong mutual feeling on drug prices. He came to see me, at my invitation, because I saw him talking about, he came to see me about drug prices because drug prices are ridiculous. And I am going to get them way, way, way down and he liked that. He said you will be the greatest president. He said you will be, in front of five, six people, he said you will be the greatest president in the history of this country.
<Julie Pace> <Negative> He disputed that slightly.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's what he said. I mean, what can I tell you?
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's six people sitting here. What did he, what, what do you mean by slightly?
<Julie Pace> <Positive> He said, he said that he felt like you could be a great president if and then --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well he said, you'll be the greatest president in the history of, but you know what, I'll take that also, but that you could be. But he said, will be the greatest president but I would also accept the other. In other words, if you do your job, but I accept that. Then I watched him interviewed and it was like he never even was here. It's incredible. I watched him interviewed a week later and it's like he was never in my office. And you can even say that.
<Julie Pace> <Negative> And that's one of the difficulties I think presidents have had is that you can have these personal relationships with people from the other party, but then it's hard to actually change how people vote or change how people --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No I have, it's interesting, I have, seem to get very high ratings. I definitely. You know Chris Wallace had 9.2 million people, it's the highest in the history of the show. I have all the ratings for all those morning shows. When I go, they go double, triple. Chris Wallace, look back during the Army-Navy football game, I did his show that morning.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> I remember, right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It had 9.2 million people. It's the highest they've ever had. On any, on air, [John] Dickerson had 5.2 million people. It's the highest for "Face the Nation" or as I call it, "Deface the Nation." It's the highest for "Deface the Nation" since the World Trade Center. Since the World Trade Center came down. It's a tremendous advantage.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have learned one thing, because I get treated very unfairly, that's what I call it, the fake media. And the fake media is not all of the media. You know they tried to say that the fake media was all the, no. The fake media is some of you. I could tell you who it is, 100 percent. Sometimes you're fake, but -- but the fake media is some of the media. It bears no relationship to the truth. It's not that Fox treats me well, it's that Fox is the most accurate.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> Do you believe that? That Fox --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do. I get treated so badly. Yesterday, about the thing, you know when I said it's a terrorism... it may be. I said it may be a terrorist attack and MSNBC, I heard, went crazy, "He called it a terrorist attack." They thought it was a bank robbery. By the way, I'm 10-0 for that. I've called every one of them. Every time they said I called it way too early and then it turns out I'm... Whatever. Whatever. In the meantime, I'm here and they're not.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> Do you feel that one of the things with cable is there's such real-time reaction with everything you say?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Julie Pace> <Negative> Can you separate that sometimes from that actual decision?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The one thing --
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> That you have to do --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. The one thing I've learned to do that I never thought I had the ability to do. I don't watch CNN anymore.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> You just said you did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No, I, if I'm passing it, what did I just say [Inaudible]?
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> You just said --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Where? Where?
<Julie Pace> <Negative> Two minutes ago.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, they treat me so badly. No, I just said that. No, I, what'd I say, I stopped watching them. But I don't watch CNN anymore. I don't watch MSNBC. I don't watch it. Now I heard yesterday that MSNBC, you know, they tell me what's going on.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In fact, they also did. I never thought I had the ability to not watch. Like, people think I watch "Morning Joe." I don't watch "Morning Joe." I never thought I had the ability to, and who used to treat me great by the way, when I played the game. I never thought I had the ability to not watch what is unpleasant, if it's about me. Or pleasant. But when I see it's such false reporting and such bad reporting and false reporting that I've developed an ability that I never thought I had. I don't watch things that are unpleasant. I just don't watch them.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> And do you feel like that's, that's because of the office that you now occupy --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> That you've made that change?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know why it is, but I've developed that ability, and it's happened over the last, over the last year.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> That's interesting.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I don't watch things that I know are going to be unpleasant. CNN has covered me unfairly and incorrectly and I don't watch them anymore. A lot of people don't watch them anymore, they're now in third place. But I've created something where people are watching... but I don't watch CNN anymore. I don't watch MSNBC anymore. I don't watch things, and I never thought I had that ability. I always thought I'd watch.
<Julie Pace> <Neutral> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just don't. And that's taken place over the last year. And you know what that is, that's a great, it's a great thing because you leave, you leave for work in the morning you know, you're, you don't watch this total negativity. I never thought I'd be able to do that and for me, it's so easy to do now. Just don't watch.
<Julie Pace> <Positive> That's interesting.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Maybe it's because I'm here. I don't know.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Joining us now, Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump. Donald, good morning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right, a lot going on with you. And I'll start out here by saying I'm not blind to the emotions that you're tapping into, but I also think there's a number of Americans you're really scaring right now, including me. I'm worried that this is rhetoric that is fueling hatred and alienation and possibly something worse.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think you should be more scared by what's going on. And, you know, this morning we learned that $28,000 was poured into this guy's account, this horrible person that did the shooting along with his wife, his radicalized wife. And I think you should be more scared about that by far than anything that I'm saying. I'm using common sense. I spoke in front of thousands of people last night.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There were thousands of people -- your reporters are reporting it. Thousands of people outside of this, the Yorktown, this tremendous ship that couldn't hold all the people. I mean, it holds, you know, it's biggest crowd they ever had on the Yorktown. And thousands of people couldn't get in. They gave a standing ovation as soon as they heard it. The first sentence they gave a standing ovation; they wouldn't stop. What it is, is common sense. Now, remember this, until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on, Mika, because we don't know what's going on. You had the World Trade Center one. Remember this, you had the World Trade Center knocked down, Mika. People are forgetting.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You -- they tried to knock it down a number of years before that. Should have taken out bin Laden but these are -- and I did mention in my book, and Joe was nice enough to say, wow, Trump actually talked about bin Laden before the World Trade Center came down. Before the World Trade Center came down. I think that's right, I think Joe will confirm that. Nobody else said that.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> I mean, almost every high ranking member of the Republican Party and candidates, they're all condemning your plan and your comments. Do you see what's happening?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they've been condemning practically everything I say and then they come to my side. They were condemning the wall, they were condemning illegal immigration, they were condemning all of the things I've been espousing. And now most of them are on my side. And the ones that aren't on my side are down to about 0 in the polls and they're not going to go anywhere.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> But do you -- but Donald -- Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I see a couple of people that have said they would come out. But you know, many of the people -- and not everybody has condemned it, if you really look. I don't want to get into names but not everybody has condemned.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Yes, I know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you want to be a specific about it, there a number that didn't condemn. But if you look at illegal immigration, and the wall and the strengthened borders and the kind of things that we have to do for safety of our country, everybody was against me. I took heat like nobody did. Made like baby stuff the first two weeks when I announced that I was running for president. And now everybody is fighting to be tougher than me on immigration.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> I understand you're not afraid of controversy. But what about the Muslim community --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Mika, this has nothing to do about controversy --
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Donald, what about --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When I announced illegal immigration, I took more heat than I'm taking right now.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> I understand that. I understand that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And everybody now agrees with me in one form or another.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Let me ask you this --
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Hold on, wait, hold on --
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Let me ask you this, do you believe that we need members of the Muslim-American community, of the Muslim community around the world, to help fight war on terror and perhaps that this is incredibly counterproductive?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think it's something that has to be done. I think it's a temporary move. I'm not looking at this long term; I'm looking at it temporary. We have to get our hands around a very serious problem. Look at what happened in Paris, the horrible carnage. And frankly, Mika, if you look at Paris -- and I hate to do this because the Commerce Department of Paris, the Chamber of Commerce is going to go crazy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But Paris is no longer the same city it was. They have sections in Paris that are radicalized where the police refuse to go there. They're petrified. The police refuse to go in there. We have places in London and other places that are so radicalized that the police are afraid for their own lives. We have to be very smart and very vigilant. We have to find out who gave this guy $28,000, put it in his account. How many other $28,000 checks were made? Are there thousands all over the country? When you say you're afraid, I think you should be afraid. You should be afraid of the other side, not my side. I want to get our hands around a very difficult situation.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> All right, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> One other thing --
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> You know, hold on, Donald. You got let us ask questions. You can't just talk. No, you got to let us actually ask questions. You're just talking.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not just talking.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Donald, Donald, Donald, you're not going to keep talking. We will go to break if you keep talking. We're going to ask you questions.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go to break, then, Joe. All I'm doing is giving you the facts, and you don't want to hear the facts.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Go to break, everybody. Go to break. Go to break. Go to break right now. We'll being right back with more Morning Joe. [Break] All right, we're back with Donald Trump. Donald, we've got a lot of people around table -- Willie, Nicolle, Mark Halperin would love to ask you some questions. I want to just ask you a couple of questions. First of all, it seems to me that going after all Muslims, banning all Muslims from coming here, is as counterproductive as, you know, those pictures when you see the little 7-year-old kids being screened by the TSA.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> It seems to me, just in terms of policing we should focus, we should target, on the Muslims that we have a reason to believe need to have the most law enforcement focused on them. Isn't it counterproductive and unconstitutional to have this broad approach towards all Muslims?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's not unconstitutional keeping people out, frankly, until we get a hold of what's going on, Joe. And then you look at Franklin Roosevelt, a respected president, highly respected, take a look at presidential proclamations back a long time ago, 2525, 2526, and 2527, What he was doing with Germans, Italians and Japanese because he had to do it. Because, look, we are at war with radical Islam. We are at war, Joe, whether we like it or not.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> I agree with that, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> You certainly aren't proposing internment camps. I mean --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No I'm not at all. No, and this wasn't -- [Crosstalk] By the way, I am not proposing that and that's not what this -- you have to look at his presidential proclamations. It was tough stuff but it wasn't internment. We're not talking about Japanese internment camps. No, not at all. But we have to get a hand around a very serious problem. And it's getting worse. And you will have more World Trade Centers and you will have more bigger than the World Trade Center if we don't toughen up, smarten up, and use our heads.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Willie.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Donald, it's Willie.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi Willie.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> You've said you want to do this just for a few weeks, not a long term plan you said, until, quote, we can figure out what the hell is going on." How will you know when the coast is clear for Muslims to come back into the country? What will you be looking for? You've said you want to do this just for a few weeks
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I didn't say a few weeks, [Inaudible] maybe it could be a few weeks but hopefully we need people to get their arms around this situation. It's a terrible situation. I will go a step further. You have to look at areas that have become radicalized in other places. They are not the same places, Willie. They are places that you do not want to go to. You do not want to take your family there. You do not want to walk through the streets, even the police don't want to walk through the streets there. We have to be careful.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Where is that, Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Paris. Look at Paris.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Where in Paris?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Take a look at the radicalized areas, the Muslims areas in Paris. Joe, the police won't go there.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> What, where? Where, though? Where are you hearing that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, it's all over. I mean, it's all over the place. I know Paris. I mean, it's all over the place. You take a trip to Paris sometime, Joe, and enjoy yourself.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Well, you know, I hardly ever get out of the Scanve County in Florida. But when I do, I'll look at Paris. I might go to Staten Island instead.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'll go to Staten Island.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Do you know what parts of Paris specifically? Since you visited there?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can get you the information. Joe, it's well known, well documented. I will get you the information.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> But Donald, just to follow up, what you're talking about is finding solutions to a huge, global problem. So how will you know when it's time to open the borders of the United States to Muslims again? That could go on indefinitely.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All it can be is a feel or a touch. We have to find it out. Look, how many more people have gotten checks put into their accounts? Obviously somebody gave them money, and I hope that the FBI and our great law enforcement are able to figure this out. But they have tremendous money. I said knock out the oil, nobody listened to me. Nobody knocked out the oil. I said check the banking systems.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have very intricate banking webs, ISIS I'm talking about. Nobody checks the banking systems. They have tremendous money. How many other people are given $28,000 or more or less to go out and do destruction like these two animals did the other day in California? We have a very, very serious problem and we can solve the problem, but we have to solve it through intelligence and we have to solve it through toughness.
<Nicole Wallace> <Neutral> Do you -- this is Nicolle.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi, Nicolle.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Hi.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hope your father still likes me.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Well, I was going to ask you about your supporters. Because you have a lot of supporters, and they are -- they have been drawn to your strength and straight talk for many, many months now. You've been on top of the Republican field for a long time now. Do you feel any obligation to them to balance your passion for these issues in the wake of the Paris attacks, or the San Bernardino, with things that comport with our values and our constitution?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, I do. I mean I have an obligation not just to my supporters, for the country. I mean, I feel I have great obligation to the country and I think I'm saying something that has to be said. And not all the candidates, by the way, that I'm running against, have come out and scorned me for this. I mean, I'm using common sense and I'm using something that we have to use. But you're going to have other World Trade Centers, you are going to have other cities being blown up and we don't want that. We don't want that to happen. That's going to happen. We have very, very lax laws. We have a president that's incompetent. We have a president that made a speech the other that night that was -- at the end of the speech I said what did he say? He didn't say anything. He didn't -- he said nothing.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> So Donald, I agree with you on that, too. But let me ask you this. A week or so ago, you said that you've got Muslim-American friends, that Muslims are good people. Do you still believe that, this week, that most Muslims are good, wonderful people?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh yes, I do. And I do have friends and, by the way, my friends agree with me. My friends say that when they become radicalized, they become different people.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So let me ask you this, and this is I'm going to propose a little challenge to you here. Dwight Eisenhower in 1957 went to an Islamic Center in Washington, D.C. What if you and I go to an Islamic Center in Washington, D.C.? Or we can go to a mosque somewhere in New York and just talk to Muslims. Would you be interested in doing that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would. But, you know, talk is cheap. Talk is very easy. I mean, if you talked to these two people, these two horrible people, everyone said they were normal. Now, you know, that they were not radicalized. Nobody knew. Now, the fact is that many people knew, Joe. The neighbors did. They said --
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Right, but --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey Joe --
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> You know, you and I both know if we're going to win the war against ISIS and if we're going to stop terror in America, we have to make sure the Muslim-American community is on our side. It's like community policing. You've seen -- my gosh, you were tough on crime in New York City in the 1980s. You took out full-page ads and then you had Giuliani, Bloomberg, and others coming together and they did community policing. So if you see something, you report something.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've always been tough on crime.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Don't we need to do the same thing in the Muslim community, where the Muslim-Americans see themselves as part of the American fabric, where they're on our side against the radicals?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> But we're not [Inaudible].
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Don't we reach out to them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want them to be on our side, Joe. I hope they are on our side. Many people knew what was going on in that thug's apartment. Many people. You had -- I watched the sister being interviewed. I think she's lying.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Right, many more didn't though, Donald. That's what I'm saying. We get -- I mean, just imagine if we can engage the Muslim community more actively in America, then it's more likely that those thugs that you described will actually be reported to police, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what, I think that's great, Joe. And it sounds good and it's beautiful words, but the sad part is if you just look at this example of what just took place in California, many people knew that there's some really strange and bad things going on. One guy said -- and even more than one guy -- about racial profiling, I didn't want to report him because I didn't want to be a racial profiler.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Give me a break. He wasn't a racial profiler. What I'm saying is this, Joe, we have to use our heads. We have to be strong, we have to be vigilant, and until we can get our hand around a situation, we have to do something and we have to do it now. If you look at some of the statistics that came out, I don't know if you read this, but 25 percent of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as part of the global jihad. These are people living in the United States --
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Is that the Frank Gaffney poll?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What?
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Is that the Frank Gaffney poll?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's the Gaffney poll and they have a Pew Research poll.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> I -- the two are far different. Pew's a lot more respectable than Gaffney's poll. Let's go to Mark Halperin in Orlando. Mark?
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> Mr. Trump, Dick Cheney is not running for president and I don't think he's considered a guy who's political correct. He described what you're proposing as standing -- goes against everything we stand for and believe in. What do you think he means for that and do you have any sympathy for that point of view?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I mean, I have sympathy for everything. I mean, I understand all points of view. I'm just saying that I know how to get things done and we're not getting it done. If we continue to go in the path that we're doing, we're losing to ISIS in the war because we have a president that doesn't know how to fight the war. We have a president that doesn't even know what to call the terrorists.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> Explain -- Mr. Trump, if you would, explain that point of view. Explain. You said you have sympathy for it. So what do you think Dick Cheney means when he says it goes against everything we stand for and believe in?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he'd like to make everybody all inclusive. Now I'm not really sure; if he really felt that way, maybe he wouldn't have gotten us into that horrible war in Iraq. Which, by the way I was opposed to. I opposed the war in Iraq. People think I'm militant. I'm so militant that I'm the only one practically that you can say was opposed to the war in Iraq. There were very few of us, because they said it would destabilize the Middle East. And a lot of that has led to this. Let me just tell you, I fully understand what people say and hopefully this doesn't take long, but our people, law enforcement in particular, has to get their hands around a big problem. How many other checks were sent to people all over the country that have been radicalized?
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> So you agree this goes against --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hey Joe, nobody knew this guy was radicalized. His wife probably radicalized him.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> You agree this goes against American values?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, no, because FDR did it, if you look at it. I mean, they said the same thing when I said we have to do strong borders. I did, then they looked back in 1954, Dwight Eisenhower, I like Ike, his thing was I like Ike, everybody liked Ike. He did it. So you know --
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> Did the Japanese internment camps go against American values?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have to be smart, Mark, and we have to be vigilant. And if we're not going to be smart and vigilant, and honestly we also have to be tough.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> Did the internment -- did the interment --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if we're not going to be those three things, we're not going to have a country left.-
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> Did the internment of the Japanese violate American values?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're not talking about internment; this is a whole different thing.
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> I understand, but I'm just asking you to weigh in on that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, this is a whole different thing. You're asking me a different question. Don't ask me that question.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> I'm asking you that question. Did the Japanese internment camps violate --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK, now let me ask you this --
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> Did the Japanese internment camps violate your sense of American values?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Mark, what about Franklin Roosevelt's presidential proclamations 2525, 2526, and 2527? Take a look at it, Mark.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> Just ask you one more -- did the Jap -- did the internment of Japanese-Americans violate your sense of American values? Yes or no?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to respond to it. You know why? That's not what we're doing.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> I understand.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're asking me a different question. That's not what we're doing.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> But for some people the same values are at stake.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But that's an entirely -- Mark. That's -- it's wonderful that you ask me that. That's an entirely different question. It has no relationship to what I'm talking about.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Gene Robinson, jump in.
<Eugene Robinson> <Neutral> Donald, your campaign has changed.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Gene, I hope you still write well about me.
<Eugene Robinson> <Positive> Well, your campaign has changed. When you started your campaign, you were appealing to people's aspirations. You're now appealing to their fears, their basest fears. And I just want to know do you feel good about that? Do you feel good about what you're doing?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No. I want to see a country where we can live in peace, where buildings aren't going to be blown up, where people aren't going to walk into a room with people, innocent people with no guns because there's no Second Amendment for those people, unfortunately. They didn't have guns. If they had guns, it would've been a different story. But I really want where people aren't going to walk into a place and shoot everybody and have no protection.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, Gene, we have a World Trade Center got knocked down almost twice. The first time -- people forget the first time. But we have other things happening. We have ISIS that wants to destroy us and we take people openly and then we find out they've become radicalized. And what you do is you have to look at other parts of the world and see what happens when this happens. It's a very, very serious problem for our country.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right, it is the top of the hour. We're talking with presidential candidate Donald Trump about his controversial proposal that has certainly made waves in the political community over the past 24 hours. Donald, along with this plan you're proposing, I know that you and Joe talked a little bit about engaging Muslims, and you called it beautiful words, but I do want to teak it further and ask you, along with your plan -- let's say it could actually be carried out -- what would you do alongside that to engage the Muslim community here in America and around the world?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I would want to engage the Muslim community, but the Muslim community has to help us, Mika. They're not helping us. The Muslim community is not reporting what's going on. They should be reporting that their next door neighbor is making pipe bombs and they've got them all over the place. The mother's in the apartment, other people, his friend was buying him rifles. Nobody was reporting that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Muslim has to help us, because without the Muslim community we would have to get very tough and much tougher and I don't want to do that. But the Muslim community, it's a not a one-way street. The Muslim community knew that this guy, what he was doing and his wife, his very heavily radicalized wife, they knew what they were doing was wrong. Nobody called the police. Nobody said this is what happened. One person said, no, he didn't call the police because he didn't want to be a racial profiler.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Donald, you can't generalize from this one incident and say that Muslims aren't helping law enforcement officers across America, because they are.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think they are much, Joe. They are to a very little extent, but not nearly to the extent that -- I mean, look, not nearly to the extent that they should be.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Willie.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Donald, I want to go back to your -- what you call temporary shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. I get the concept but I want to know how does it work practically. How does it work at the border? Let's say a man and his family want to travel --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We just shut -- Willie, Willie.
<Willie Geist> <Neutral> What happens at customs?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's certainly going to be - Willie, there's certainly going to be exceptions made, like for instance, sporting events and other things. Hopefully this wouldn't take very long. But you know what, by doing this, what we really need help from are the Muslims that do know what's going on, the neighbors of people that are looking to do harm. They have to call the police.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Donald, I understand that and you've made that point. But I just want to know how it works. Religion doesn't appear on a passport. Would there be questioning at the border in Europe before they got to the United States? Would it happen here in America? How would this work?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It could happen at the site, it could happen here, it could happen at many different forums, Willie. That would have to be worked out, and I don't think it would be for an extended period of time. We have to get our hands around this situation.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> And a customs agent would ask a person his or her religion? Donald, a customs agent would then ask a person his or her religion?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That would be probably -- they would say are you Muslim?
<Willie Geist> <Negative> And if they said yes, they would not be allowed in the country?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's correct.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Mark Halperin.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> Mr. Trump, I gather you're supposed to attend a Republican National Committee fund-raiser tomorrow and now you're not. Are you not going? And if not, why not?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. I honestly don't know anything about it. I'm funding my own campaign, so I don't need money to put it mildly. So I don't know anything about a fund-raiser tomorrow. I mean, Mark, I'm funding my own campaign.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> I just want to say, this is a fund-raiser for the Republican Party. It was announced that you were attending.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know if I'm going or not. I have no idea. I didn't know it was on my schedule, frankly. All I know is I'm funding my own campaign. I'm not getting money from the special interests, from the lobbyists, and from the donors. Like every other candidate.
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> When you said that some of the candidates hadn't been - of the other Republican candidates -- hadn't been critical of you, who are you referring to?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I haven't heard from Cruz. I haven't heard from Rand Paul. Somebody said came out with a proposal that was similar actually, it was similar and in many ways more broad. I had heard that. I don't think he commented. I doubt he will comment on me. He's - I wouldn't say I'm his favorite person. Of course, he's not doing too well, maybe because of me. But Rand Paul I think has got a proposal that was pretty severe. Actually, Cruz's proposal was pretty severe too But, you know, not everybody. And most of the ones that are, guys like Kasich, he's got no polling number. He's made a fool out of himself. He's one of the worst debaters I've ever seen. And some of the others are just people who are just hanging around.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> Ted Cruz says, did say he disagreed with the policy. There are some who are accusing, including The New York Times"
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Give me a break.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> Speak from your heart. Why did you do this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I call it the failing money-losing New York Times. I call it the failing... Look, let me tell you something. CNN came out with a poll yesterday that has me clobbering everybody in Iowa. There was another poll that came out, I don't know the poll, but it came out where I was a little behind Cruz in Iowa. Only in Iowa. Nationwide, I'm leading in every poll. And in every other poll - this one outlier came out yesterday. I disagree with their polling methods and data, but CNN, which does do very good polling and highly respected, came out with a poll where am I correct, Mark, or do you want to correct me? I was absolutely clobbering everybody. Do you agree with that?
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> You were ahead in that CNN poll and many other polls.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no, not ahead, Mark. How much ahead was I, Mark?
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> Way ahead.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Way ahead. Mr. Trump, you are way ahead in the polls. You could become the Republican nominee, you could become our future president. How do you think your first meetings with leaders of, say, the United States Arab Emirates, where they're a superb ally, they're flying missions over ISIS, they have women in their army. How do you think those meetings would go after you had proposed -- and it sounds like you have ideas for implementing a policy like this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I'll get along great with them. I've always been a unifier. I've even gotten along with Joe and Mika for years. If you could do that, you could do anything.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> This is true.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And frankly, I think --
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> But really, you don't think you'd create any --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By the way, Nicolle, you know who is not a unifier is President Obama. He's a disaster. He's the most -- the greatest divider I've ever seen.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> I don't disagree with you -- But you don't see any --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am a unifier.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> So you're at the top of the polls, you seem to be on track to be our party's nominee. You don't see any danger to our relationships around the world when you propose banning the world's 1.5 billion Muslims from entering our country indefinitely until you figure it out?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, let's -- OK, Nicolle, let's talk about our relationships around the world. We don't have relationships around the world. Every country that we're supposed to -- Russia hate us, China hate us, we're not talking too much with the Muslim problem there. But you go around the Middle East blew up around President Obama and Hillary Clinton. It's a war zone. You look at Iraq, you look at Iran, Iran just took us to the cleaners with a deal where they got $150 billion and they can have all the nuclear weapons -- within ten years they'll have more nuclear weapon than we ever had.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So when you say about our relationships with other countries, for the most part, we have no relationships with other countries. We have been in free fall as far as relationships are concerned. I guarantee you our relationships will be far better than they are right now because right now we have no real -- We have a president that was not meant to be president. He is a disaster.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> So you'd waive the ban for the leaders of Middle Eastern countries to let them in?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Of course I would. Yes, of course.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Oh good. OK.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So from 1945 to 1991, Donald, we were engaged in a cold war where the actual -- the balance of the -- the human race hung in the balance. We feared nuclear war. We still let Russians come to America, though, despite the fact that the danger was actually greater. If you looked at the cold war and mutually assured destruction. If we had banned Russians from emigrating to this country, coming to this country, we wouldn't have Google. We wouldn't --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, no, I'm not looking at that, Joe. Joe, take a look back at Roosevelt and take a look about the alien Germans. They called them alien Germans, alien Italians, alien Japanese. Because we were at war, Joe -- we're at war right now, whether you like it or not, we are at war with radical Islam right now.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Donald, I agree with you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No -- but nobody else does. [Crosstalk]
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> But the difference between you and me though is I want to --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The president doesn't agree with you.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> '-- get as many Muslims on our side as possible and it seems to me that your approach divides Muslim-Americans and don't make them feel like they have a stake in the American dream. I believe -- and you look, there are six to -- I think Muslim-Americans have buying power of about $100 billion in this country. There are great entrepreneurs that are Muslim-Americans, law-abiding Muslim-Americans, they actually employ tens of thousands of Americans. I want them on our side. I want Muslims across the world on our side.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Joe, so do i. But you said it will divide. They are already divided, Joe.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> They, you say they.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The Muslim-Americans.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Who? Five percent, 10 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Joe, Joe --
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> If we have 90 percent, don't we want -- I mean, you -- you're great at making deals. You understand, you make deals by drawing people in and getting as many people on your side. It seems to me the last thing you want to do is divide the very people that we need to focus on --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Joe, by doing this, you ultimately will draw them in.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> '-- to be on our side. If Muslims are on our side in America and across the world, we win this war against ISIS.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Joe -- We're not winning anything right now. That I can tell you.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> No, we're not.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Do you think we're winning against ISIS?
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> I just said no, we're not. I'm talking about how we win the war ultimately.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK. Joe, we will win by being firm, by being tough, by being smart, and we will draw them in. Right now we're not drawing them in. Right now -- things are going on right now that you don't know about, that I don't know about, that nobody -- right now there are things going on that you have so-called people that you think are on our side and they're not reporting it, they're not talking about it, and in some cases they're involved with it. I mean, look, I'll give you an example. Some of our so-called allies that we work with and we protect and we protect them militarily, they're sending massive amounts of money to ISIS and to al Qaeda and to others, OK?
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Who are you talking about there?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know who it is. Why do I have to bring it up for? You know who it is.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Well, because you're running for president.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Other countries. Hey Joe -- Joe, other countries are giving massive amounts of money. People from other countries are giving massive amounts of money.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Right, so who -- Are you saying the Saudis are doing this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Of course they're doing it. Everybody knows that.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> OK. Any other countries?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There are but I'm not going to say it because I have a lot of relationships with people, but they are. And you know that and everybody knows that and nobody says it. Nobody talks about it.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Well, but you're not even saying the countries that are doing it right now. Why aren't you willing to name those -- You say you have a lot of relationships there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hey, Joe, all you have to do is check your records and our government knows the countries and one of them happens to be Saudi Arabia and our government knows that and why aren't we doing anything about it? Why aren't we being firm as to why are we allowing that to happen?
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So why don't you think we are doing anything about it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because I think we have an incompetent president.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Well, is he the only president that has -- had a policy basically -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I think our previous president did not do the job. I wasn't exactly a big fan, as you know. He might be a Republican, but I wasn't exactly a big fan. I was the one that called Osama bin Laden. He -- if I were -- I would have had Osama bin Laden knocked out and maybe the World Trade Center, as it was, would have been standing right now.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> So let me ask you this. It looks right now like the rest of the Republican candidates are divided against you. If you get to the convention, and let's say there's --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Joe, that's been from the beginning.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right. So let's say there's a broker convention and you go in with the most delegates. If they don't will you the domination, will you break away from the Republican Party and run as an independent?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can't tell you that, Joe. I signed a pledge for fairness and I assume they're going to live up to that. I think that I'm going to win the nomination in terms of popular support. You know, I'm very popular. And you know, the poll that came out yesterday in Iowa, the poll that came out two days ago, it sort of indicates that very strongly. Way ahead in every category. Every state and their --
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So let's turn page from politics really quickly. I want to talk policy. Right now Ted Cruz is taking two different tacks on the fight against ISIS. One seems to be that he wants to carpet bomb them until the sand glows. But he's reluctant to say that he wants to send ground troops in. After San Bernardino, do you believe that the United States needs to send more ground troops in as part of an international force to take ISIS' land away from them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK, here's what I'd do. I'd knockout the capital and I'd knock it out big and strong. I'd take over the oil and I'd keep the oil.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right. So you need ground troops to do that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've been saying that for three years.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Right. But you need ground troops to do that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, you'll need some ground troops. Yeah. You'll need ground troops.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> What do you think? 10,000, 20,000? Do you have a number?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Listen, Joe, I'm not giving them back the oil. I'm keeping the oil. There's a big difference.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> OK. I understand. So I think we have Ted Cruz coming on later this week. I'm going to be asking him specifics on how we defeat ISIS because we're not winning, I agree with you right now, and we have to defeat ISIS --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The only way you're going to beat ISIS, Joe, is to take their financing away, to take their money away. And the way you're going to do that is by banking and by knocking out their oil.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> So -- I want to get specific with you like I will with Ted Cruz and everybody else because I think people need to start giving us specifics on how we get there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've been specific.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> So 10,000 troops --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Joe, Joe --
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> I'm talking specifically about ground troops --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Joe, I've been more specific than any other candidate.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> All right, Don. So I'm trying to drill down a little bit because we're not going to win by carpet bombing, as some candidates say. So would you support taking it, say, ten thousand ground troops as part of an international force?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to knock out their capital and I want to knock out the oil and I want to take over the oil and I want to ring it so that the oil is safe and we're going to take the oil and we're going to give some of the profits of the oil to our wounded warriors and to our veterans and to the families of the people whose family and whose sons and daughters died in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Agreed. That sounds great. So how many troops? 10,000 maybe? Would you support 10,000 ground troops?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would. Yes, I would.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right. And who -- do you -- would you be comfortable, just again, we need to figure out how to do this moving forward. Would you be comfortable with those troops with, say, Russia and when you brought up the Saudis as part of a bigger international force in Syria and Iraq?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, I would.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would. I think it's wonderful if Russia wants to drop bombs on ISIS. Anybody who wants to drop bombs on ISIS, I'm all for them.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right. So let's go to domestic politics. Ted Cruz is ahead in one poll in Iowa. You're ahead in all the others. Is Ted Cruz right now your main competitor for the Republican nomination?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think so. He might be, but I really don't think so.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Ben Carson down 19 points in the latest Monmouth poll. I said that seemed to me that -- the headline -- is Ben Carson finished as a prospective Republican nominee?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think he's a very nice man. I like him very much. Yes, I think he's finished as a nominee.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right. Who is your greatest competition right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't want to say, but I don't think -- You know, look, I don't know if I have anybody. I'm so far ahead. I mean I watch you too. I don't think really I have anybody. I'm leading in every poll. I'm doing great in South Carolina -- You ought to see the crowd last night in South Carolina.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> We saw it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Largest crowd in the history of that ship.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> What is -- Final thoughts. What's your final -- here's your opportunity as the guy who right now is the highest ranking Republican, certainly -- obviously grabbing most headlines and have the highest polls -- what's your message to Muslim-Americans right now as we conclude this interview?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We love you, we want to work with you, we want you to turn in the bad ones, we want you to practice vigilance. We know that you know a lot in many cases. We want you to turn in the bad ones. We all want to get along. We want to get back to a normal, peaceful life.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right, Donald Trump, we greatly appreciate you calling in.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Donald Trump.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Thank you so much.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
