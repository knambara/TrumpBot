<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You said about the fiscal cliff, and I agreed with you, it was a terrible deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Terrible.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Does any Republican have the ability to negotiate, you said? And then you said Democrats are laughing at the Republicans.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, actually I said the Republicans are the worst negotiators in the history of the world, everything. Because if Obama and everybody, if 100 percent, which isn't 100 percent, it's 50 percent of the people, but many of Obama's voters were actually forced to pay much higher taxes for three days, he would have come back and he would have given everything.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You would have had the Democrats exactly where you wanted them. It would have been retroactively brought back so nobody would have paid higher taxes, other than the rich, maybe, will have to pay a little bit of a penalty. And I think they're okay with that if they got the spending cuts. So, now what they did, they made a deal, they gave up on the tax increases.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And now, I watched Nancy Pelosi the other day, who I respect, and she's been to my office, I respect her, but she's doing her thing from a different side and from a different belief. I watched Nancy Pelosi the other day saying, no, no, no, the taxes haven't stopped, they gave away something and now they're going to have to give it away again and I think it's amazing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if the tax rates increase for everybody across the board, Obama would have come in and he would have been virtually begging to make a deal. And you would have had spending cuts, and you would have had -- you could have put this country back on track. They lost all their --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> They got elected, too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't understand. You know, it's funny, and John Boehner, who I know and like a lot, by the way, and I happen to think he's very capable, I just don't know what happened here. I don't understand it. The Republicans, believe -- I've been saying the last few months the Republicans have all the cards. And I'm not just talking about just the debt ceiling, and I'm worried about the debt ceiling because I think the president's going to use the 14th amendment and we're going to end up in lawsuits for the next ten years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And so, I don't like the debt ceiling by itself as a point of strength. The strength was, let everybody pay -- let all of his supporters start paying more tax and he will come to you and he will make -- that's called deal making 101, basic deal making. Somebody said do they know how to make deals? I said it's not about deals, it's about common sense.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Your bestselling book "The Art of The Deal." I read it. It says you should be willing to wake away from any deal at the last moment. Weren't they afraid they'd go over the cliff and be blamed. They were blamed anyway, but wasn't that their fear.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Number one, they're getting blamed anyway. They have the lowest rating in the history of ratings, OK, like the lowest rating anybody's ever seen. And I heard that they were afraid of bad publicity. Their publicity is horrible anyway and in two weeks everybody's going to forget about-- look at me, bad publicity, good, so much publicity is comes out of my ears, some good, some bad.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They were worried, said it, they were worried about bad publicity. They're getting bad publicity anyway. Sean, if they let the taxes, resets cuts expire, now everybody all of the supporters are forced to pay, he would have been force today make a deal, where you make a real deal. I've been saying don't make these little deals, make the one big deal and get it done.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And stop borrowing 46 out of every dollar. Do you think if the Republicans don't step up on the debt ceiling and don't stand as a bold contrast to the Democrats, do you see the emergence of a third party might you look at that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think third parties are getting tough. I think it's tough to win as a Republican. Look, they lost on immigration and they're going to have to do something on immigration. Our country is a different place than 50 years ago. They're going to have to do something different fronts and then popular candidates that will get 20 percent of the vote.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Aren't they going to have to be the party that saves America from bankruptcy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They do -- they had such a great chance. I have to tell you as somebody who negotiates all day long, the deal hurt them. They had more cards a week ago than they have right now. They still have cards, but the cards aren't as good.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I actually think the cards are better.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no, they're not.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Let me tell you why.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We should have gone over the cliff.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I agree with you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hate the word the cliff, but-- it's a phony word by phony people, but we should have gone over the cliff and the Democrats would have come begging for a deal and would have made any deal. So we're not in better shape.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Now, the president, he cannot get more money and raise the debt ceiling. We've got $16 trillion in debt.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm telling you, he'll use the 14th amendment, Sean. He is going to use this 14th amendment and when he's playing golf, hopefully at Trump National in Washington, I have the best course in Washington and love to have him there. The president if you want to play my course in Washington on the Potomac River.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's beautiful.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Never miss an opportunity.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The best course in Washington by far. When he's playing golf somewhere in six years, the Supreme Court will make a ruling whether or not he's allowed to use the 14th amendment. I say he's going to use the 14th amendment.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Don't forget, this is dangerous for America.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's almost a dictatorship.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> He's going to bypass Congress --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But he couldn't have done that.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> The second amendment.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He couldn't have done that for the last group that he just got.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You think because of the cliff now he has more power?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think this: he couldn't have used the 14th amendment for what just took place. It doesn't apply to that, but it might apply, little tiny inkling that it might apply to the debt ceiling, but it didn't apply to the tax.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Constitutionally, this is check mate, urge you to talk to your lawyer you probably talk to regularly, Article 1 Section 7 clearly spending begins in Congress.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's clear that Obamacare was not legal either. And excuse me, everybody sued and winning all the way up and a certain justice that was 100 percent against it who in order to become a favorite fair-haired boy in Washington, went against his own beliefs, OK?
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> What does it say about him if he's willing to circumvent the constitution?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's doing it and in my opinion for the debt ceiling he's going to use the 14th amendment and circumvent the problem. And I believe that the Republicans are going to have a hard time.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Both of us were this week, quote, "outed as gun owners." This has happened to both of us also in the past.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And I look at this and I'm thinking, wait a minute, cops have been outed, this "Journal News" gives the names and addresses of everybody --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's terrible.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> It's terrible because now the criminals know where the gun owners are.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the way, the criminals won't go there. They'll go to the ones who don't have it.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> They know who don't have the guns.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're not going to the ones that have the guns. They're going to the ones who don't have the guns.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And criminals will go to the cops who have arrested them in the past, very dangerous. What is your reaction when you see that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that the "Journal News" was a disgrace and you have some people who have a gun for protection because they're hiding and these were the cases in my opinion egregious, and the woman is hiding from a stalker who has threatened to kill her. And now the stalker knows where she lives and she had a gun to protect herself and he didn't know and now the stalker knows.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have many cases like that. You have the people running the prisons. I mean, you have a lot of problems that are caused by this outing. And I think it was a shame.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes, I do, too. How important is the second amendment to you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's important. It's very important. You're talking in terms of protection?
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> I'm talking the debate now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> -- after the tragedy at Newtown.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, it's protection. Look, I have friends that would literally -- they're gun people and I do have a permit for a gun as I think you do, I read the same list.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> We're on the same list.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I feel friends that feel that without guns they have no protection. They live in a house and if the bad guys come in with guns and they're sitting there with nothing.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Sitting ducks.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have no chance. Now, with the whacko that attacked the movie theater or attacked the school, there were no guns in that school. If you had a couple of guys that knew about guns and understood guns and knew how to use guns.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Retired policemen?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You would have a hell of a shot at stopping that guy before he it did the damage that he did. There was nobody, I mean, they got lucky his gun jammed. If he gun didn't jam it would have been ten times worse. The gun jammed. If you had somebody with guns on the other side and that's the problem, if you could take everybody's gun, not a gun in the country, that's one thing, but that's never going to happen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I read the other day, there are 300 million arms right now in --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Talking about now.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's 300 million.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> We protect our money with guns. We protect our politicians with guns, our cabinet officials with guns. Hollywood stars are protected with guns and armed guards, but law abiding citizens now they're talking about taking away their rights. What do you think of Obama now reelected, he wins the fiscal cliff debate, he is going into new negotiations.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> He seems emboldened, unencumbered about having to run for reelection.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, I have a lot of respect for the guy. And I liked Romney very much, he did not resonate. And Obama played the rich guy/poor guy. That's a pretty good argument. You know, it's hard to win. There are a lot more poor people than rich people. Even though the job creators are what historically made this whole thing work, but I have a lot of respect for Obama.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People think I don't respect him. I respect him a lot. I think his story is an amazing story, whether people like him or don't like him?
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> He ran a tough campaign.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He ran a tough campaign. Took a long time for Romney to get tough and they told him please don't be so tough at the first debate and he disappeared. Such a fine man with a fine family and he disappeared, something happened after the first debate. He did a wonderful job. Now they're saying they told him to take it easy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know if that's true, Sean, it's hard to believe that it's true because that's common sense, also.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I was told they thought they were ahead, no need to rock the boat, don't bring up Benghazi during the final debate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I hated when tag Romney, I think is a fantastic young man, I've met him a few times, I think he's fantastic, but when he said his father didn't really want to be president that, his mother, who's incredible, and him, primarily, wanted him to run and were really pushing him. And you know, a lot of times if I miss a deal I'll be disappointed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't want it in the first place, makes me feel better. When you're running for president, it's different because you have thousands and millions of people working for you and I know friends that worked so hard and devastated by that statement. We worked so hard and he didn't want to be president?
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Do you regret either supporting Mitt or getting out yourself.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't regret supporting him, but in the end I thought it was going to be a very, very tough race and very, very close race despite some of the people that were on your show, saying it was going to be a landslide, which I never understood.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> I never believed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought a tough and close race. I think Sandy hurt. I think a lot of things hurt, but I always felt it was going to be close and they give the advantage to the incumbent because he went around saying I'm going to give billions here, and here.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Sandy I think hurt a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that Sandy hurt, but I don't think -- I think the debates, in the end the debates were devastating. The performance of the second debate was poor, but the performance in the third debate was a total catastrophe.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You were disappointed you got out, and wish you ran.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know I was leading in every poll, but I thought that mitt could do a good job and he could win because his stance on China was good and China is ripping us off and OPEC is ripping us off, he was good as far as I was concerned and now I'm disappointed I did that, yes.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Big year for you, you're in the news everywhere today.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It seems like it.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Let's start with Bill Maher. First of all, if any one called anybody else -- spawned by an orangutan or whatever the comment was, I think there would be a lot of outrage.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was on the "Jay Leno" show and essentially talking about an orangutan, I never had problems with the look, maybe I do. He said some horrible things and really horrible things about my parents who are deceased. Fantastic people, married for 63 years, just great, great people. And then he made an offer on the show that involved my birth certificate and other things and was a $5 million offer to charity, and immediately accepted his offer and sent a legal letter to him by a legal lawyer, and told me you have a case as soon as you accept his offer.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We sent him a bill, legal representation for $5 million, here is the -- - I don't know if he has $5 million, maybe he doesn't, but he made an offer of $5 million. I accepted the offer. And all of that money will go to great charities, including Sandy victims.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And if he doesn't pay?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Then I'll sue him.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> What about the double standard?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's terrible. Can you imagine if you said that, as an example, about President Obama.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> No, I'd be finished.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you said that about almost anybody on that side, but if you said that about President Obama, you would be fired immediately, as great as Roger Ailes is, nobody like him. We all love him. He is amazing guy. He's the best. He would fire you so fast and you wouldn't have a chance. So, why is it that somebody can go on a show and call me an orangutan and all of the horrible things he said about me and my parents, who he's never met, doesn't know anything about him, and nobody says anything except me. I sent him a bill.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> So you're taking this to the end?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm going to sue him if he doesn't pay the money. I have a great lawyer, won $5 million for me when I went after the beauty queen. The beauty queen, girl from Pennsylvania said terrible things about the Miss USA pageant which I own. Now, we have Arthur Anderson to tabulate the votes and 12 or so celebrities and they come up, I don't care who wins, whoever wins, I hope it's a good winner because we have to live with her for a year and we have great people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Like as an example, Miss Alabama was a contestant last year, she did great in the top ten.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Speaking of Katherine Webb, Miss Alabama, this was a great moment because Brent Musburger, a great broadcaster.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Excellent. By the way, I think he's better now than before that, and I thought it was so nice. She's beautiful. I was watching. And I said, you know, it's strange, but a lot of times they focus on like a beautiful girlfriend of the football player or a beautiful woman in the audience. They never say anything, have a picture of somebody, now, here they focused she's extremely beautiful and you know, she's in my pageant system and happens to be a great person and the people at the Alabama pageant said she's fabulous, as a person, very charitable and everything else.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it was so different because he said, wow, what a beautiful woman. Bah, bah, bah.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Exactly what America was thinking.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She got interviewed and called me could I get her for the "Today" show. I got her because she didn't want to do any interviews. She didn't want to do the interview and I spoke to her and got her to do the "Today" show and she was fantastic on the "Today" show. But they said were you insulted? No, actually I thought it was a great compliment.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Flattering, I think.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Where in the world this political correctness is killing this country. We're not allowed to say anything-- of course, you can say it against Trump or perhaps you and a couple of other people, say whatever you want, but essentially, our country is going to hell...
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> It was, but he she set the record straight and the end of it, last question, Donald Trump after this election cycle, knowing the country is in deep financial trouble, is it in the back of your mind, you have I've got to think about 2016 and maybe make a run for office.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I love what I'm doing, I love it the most. I'm so disappointed with what's going on in the country and with our politicians and our Republican politicians. I'm so disappointed at the opportunities they missed so we'll just have to see. It's a long time. We have a president, we have to support the president, that's the way the country works, but I am so disappointed at what's happening in Washington.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So, we'll see what happens.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. Trump, always a pleasure, good to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
