<Steve Gruber> <Positive> You've had a chance to do tax cuts, the First Step Act, V.A. Reform, you've rolled back regulations, Right-to-Try, you moved the embassy to Jerusalem, things that couldn't be done, they said, and yet you did 'em. You won Michigan. They said that couldn't be done either. I remember going into the polls -- Hillary was up by 14 points, they told us a couple of days out.
<Steve Gruber> <Negative> The polling was bad, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I went there. The last stop was Michigan. My last stop was Michigan, Grand Rapids, and we had a tr -- we had 32,000 people there, and I started speaking at one o'clock in the morning, so that was now Election Day. I mean, because I got there -- it was just, like, a last stop because I heard we had a real chance, and I love Michigan, and I was actually the man of the year in Michigan about 10 years before the election, if you can believe it. That was unrelated to politics, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, so we went there, and so it has a special place in my heart, and then we ended up winning Michigan. It was a big thing.
<Steve Gruber> <Positive> Well, the USMCA is key to Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, the Great Lakes states. Let's be honest: Michigan for the first time in my lifetime is in an economy we've never seen before, since you took office, and we want to hang on to that, but it seems the Democrats, as you call them, the do nothing Democrats, have held up this piece of legislation.
<Steve Gruber> <Positive> It's critical to the people up there for agriculture, for I.T., for all sorts of things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm very proud of what we've done in Michigan. Before we mention USMCA, because it's disgraceful that Nancy Pelosi -- I think she's grossly incompetent. It's been sitting on her desk for months, and you know at some point, Mexico and Canada are going to say, like, you know, what's going on over here?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because they call me all the time, when she's signing it? And the Democrats want it, but she won't put it up for a vote, because she's wasting their time on this nonsense. But I'm proud of Michigan, because we have many car plants now expanding, building new ones, coming in from Japan. Prime Minister Abe, I said you've got to build more plants, they're building plants.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And what's happening in Michigan, you know, you've had the best year that you've ever had in Michigan, and we have a lot of things planned. Now, add USMCA to it, and you're going to have numbers that you've never even come close to seeing. You already have.
<Steve Gruber> <Positive> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, you know, don't forget, I got Japan deal $40 billion, a lot of that's going in the Japan trade deal the South Korea trade deal is all done. Those deals are done. China is now buying again, because, you know, we're doing very well with China, to put it mildly. I also gave the farmers, many of whom are in Michigan, but I gave the farmers 16 billion, and then 12 billion the year before, because that's what they were targeted.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> For Michigan, as you know, they were hit from all over the country. I went to Sonny Perdue, what was the number? It was 16 billion last year, I gave him 16 billion out of the tariffs, and we had a lot of money left over. China has never given us anything, and here we have this. So, everyone's happy. The USMCA though, will be the greatest trade deal ever made, and what's happening is Nancy Pelosi won't put it up for a vote, and we really have a problem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have a problem that Mexico and Canada are saying, what's going on? And it's going to get voted, it's not the Democrats fault. I mean, frankly, she won't put it up for a vote, because I hear she wants to use it because she doesn't have the votes for impeachment, so she wants to use this for impeachment.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm hearing that. So look, I think she's grossly incompetent and this shouldn't be allowed to happen.
<Steve Gruber> <Negative> Michigan has something today that it hasn't had in my lifetime, and that is more jobs than people to fill 'em. And that's a fact. In the 1970s, when Jimmy Carter was president, the place was a disaster. Plants were closing, friends that I knew, their parents lost jobs, they lost homes, they lost cars, they lost hope, frankly.
<Steve Gruber> <Positive> And Michigan's in a place now that it's never been, because there was a 10-year period where Michigan and Nevada and Florida probably got hurt worse than anybody. You know that. And Michigan's in a place now that we're prosperous, we're growing. We have hope again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, I'm glad you -- it's so nice that you say that, and you've been so great. That's why I'm doing this interview. You've been just so great from -- for a long time now, and I appreciate it. And you are a highly respected voice in Michigan and beyond Michigan, but in Michigan. I'm very proud of Michigan because when I ran, if you remember, when I came down the escalator, Michigan was -- a lot of people thought it was over.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You won't make cars in Michigan anymore. The whole industry was leaving. It was going to Mexico. It was going to all sorts of places. That's not have -- happening now, and companies are coming back in. They're expanding and they're building new plants. There hadn't been a plant built in 40 years, a new plant, and now they're coming, and frankly, even with the unions, they're coming back and they're going in, because it's harder.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're coming back and they're going into Michigan. So, I'm really proud of what we've done for Michigan, and for the rest of the country. You know, we're having the best year we've ever had. Stock market, just a little while ago, hit another high, a new high, historic high. Best African-American unemployment in the country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Best in history. Best African-American, Asian, almost best women unemployment. Best Hispanic unemployment in history. But, think of it: best African-American unemployment records the history of our country, and the best employment records too, being slightly different. Best employment record. So, Michigan has been a big beneficiary.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just hope they remember that in a year.
<Steve Gruber> <Positive> Yes, one of the thing is -- is that when you talk about high tech, Elaine Chao and the University of Michigan. Autonomous cars. Michigan is developing all sorts of new car technologies right there because of the industries that are coming back under these policies.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I had to approve that. The autonomous is a little bit controversial. You know, when you see cars driving around with nobody in them. It's a little bit controversial, to be honest with you, it's a little [Crosstalk] -- hey, I look over I say, there's nobody in that car, what's going on? But it's a new industry, and I had to make approvals that were a little bit courageous.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I've done more courageous things than that. But still, I made it possible and probably the biggest beneficiary is Michigan and the car industry.
<Steve Gruber> <Positive> I say just one other thing: you remind me of my own father, who had a saying, he said: do you want me to tell you the truth, or make you feel good? And when you're President, I think that you're bold, and to the point. I think it's really helpful. Give me your prediction for 2020.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we have a very important election, you know, 2016 was vital. And, you know, if we didn't do it, I think this country would be a disaster right now. Our markets are up 50, 60, 70 percent. NASDAQ this, for this month, you just saw the numbers come out, it's up 27 percent just in this year. And that means jobs, tremendous jobs, all over the country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My prediction is we need four more years to have it seed, like a tree. You know, you can plant it, but it's got to grab root. It's got to grab hold, and I think the next year, the next year is going to be very important. I think the election is going to be as vital, almost as vital as what we just did in 2016. It's hard to believe the time is up so fast.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When I was in your great state that last night, I got home at 4:00 in the morning, and who would think that here we are, we're doing it again. But Michigan's been very special. There was a big evening, winning Michigan, because it hadn't been done in decades by a Republican. But, I think my numbers are, you would know better than me, but my numbers are very good and, look, it's -- you're having the best year in the history of Michigan, so it should be good.
<Steve Gruber> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a great honor to be with you both. Thank you.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Let's talk polls, first of all, "Washington Post" poll on Monday, great news for you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Huge lead in the Republican field. Quinnipiac poll came out today, though, not-so-good news for you. In the general election voters, Colorado, Iowa, Virginia, you have the worst favorability ratings of anyone, Republican or Democrat, negative favorability ratings of almost 2-1. Hillary Clinton also did badly. What do you make of it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I -- I haven't seen it. I really don't know. I haven't seen it. I have only --
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Do negative favorability ratings worry you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think so. I mean, I have turned a lot of them around. And, as you know, in North Carolina, it was negative. And now it's like tremendously positive. And when people hear what I say about the vets and how strong my commitment is to the vets, they have been treated so badly, and to the border, which is just horrible, I mean, every time people listen to me, all of a sudden, it becomes very favorable. A good example would be North Carolina, where it's so positive. I haven't seen that. But I think, generally speaking, we are doing very well. And, certainly, we're doing well in the ABC/"Washington Post" poll and every other poll that I have seen in the last couple of weeks.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> So, you think you can turn around -- because a lot of people say, look, that -- those kind of unfavorability ratings; that does not bode well. You think you can turn that around?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. I mean, who knows? I'm doing this for the good of the country. Somebody has to do it. Politicians are never going to turn this country around. Our country is a mess. The politicians are going to destroy this country. They're weak and they're ineffective. And they're controlled by the lobbyists and the special interests. So, will I? I don't know. I have no idea.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> You talk lobbyists and the special interests, though. You and I talked last time. You have given a lot of money to politicians over the years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> You give to Democrats. You give to Republicans.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I was on the other side.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Aren't you part of the problem?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was -- absolutely, 100 percent.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> You are?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely. I was on the other side. They would do whatever I want, up until you decide to run.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> So, isn't that hypocritical, to say, oh, this is a problem, but I'm going to make the most of this problem?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. It's called playing the game. I was a businessman. I made a fortune. I made a lot of money. I posted over $10 billion.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> So, in order to make money, it's OK to play the game?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's called your life. I mean, I'm a businessman. And I contribute to people, and they treat me nicely and everything else and --
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> So, how do you change that? How do you change that culture of money for access?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I understand --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, I just read an article where Bush is meeting with all these lobbyists in Washington, has a meeting with all these lobbyists. Every one of those lobbyists that gives money, they expect something for it. And that's a bad thing. That's a bad thing.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Don't you have lobbyists, though?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely. I have had lobbyists, and I have had some very good ones. They could do anything. They can take a politician and have him jump off this ledge.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Can you actually change that culture of corruption?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you can, in the sense that the top person can't be bought. I'm worth far too much money. I don't need anybody's money. I'm not running with anybody's money. I'm spending my own money. But the lobbyists have -- they totally control these politicians. Just take a look. In one of the articles very recently, I see Bush with the lobbyists. And he's sitting there with all of these people. They're totally telling him what to do, like a little puppet, and the same with Hillary, and the same with everybody else. Now, when I am in business, I'm part of that game. When I'm in this, I now know. When somebody comes --
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Can you jump back and forth, though?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, absolutely. I am able to do that very easily.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> That's not hypocritical?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not at all. Look, I'm going to do -- I have made a lot of money.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> I have heard.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I don't need money. And I don't need money to run. I don't need $5,000 here, $10,000. These guys are desperate for money. I don't need it. I'm going to do what is right for the country.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Who would run your business if you're president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My children and executives. I have very good executives and great children. They're very good.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Talking yesterday, Jeb Bush said, if we embrace this language of divisiveness and ugliness, we will never win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, when you say divisive, OK.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> No, he says --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but you're quoting him.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But when you quote divisive.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, I get called all these horrible names by Lindsey Graham, who I don't even know. I didn't start it with Lindsey Graham. I couldn't care less about Lindsey Graham. He's registered at, I think, zero in the polls, by Rick Perry from Texas, who was up in my office a few years ago. I just posted a picture of him shaking my hand, looking for money and looking for support. And he was up -- you know, people will say, I called it hypocrite, but they are saying horrible things. Like, I don't even know these people and they are saying these things. Now, am I supposed to, you know, just say, it's OK to for them to say -- one guy -- I guess it was Lindsey Graham -- called me a jackass? So, am I supposed to say, oh, it's OK if I'm called a -- I'm called a jackass. You have to fight back. The country has to fight back. Everyone is pushing our country around. We can't allow that, Anderson.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Is it presidential, though?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think it's presidential.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> To give out somebody's phone -- to give out a personal phone number.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that was a long story. I mean, you have to see the whole story the way it morphed. OK? That was a whole story, where he wanted to get on "FOX & Friends," and he called me up out of the blue. I never met the guy. Then he wanted to come in for campaign contributions. He gave me his -- first off -- and then he starts hitting me years later. And I happen to have this crazy phone number. And I held it up. I said, this guy was over here. And, actually, as you probably know, the room was packed. It was standing room only. In fact, they had theaters. There was overflow crowds. They had all sorts of closed-circuit television into other rooms. The place went wild. We all had a good time.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> But is that presidential?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so. I think it is fine.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Is that something, as president -- when you're opposed by somebody in Congress, you would give out their personal phone number?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was hit by somebody unfairly. I was called names by somebody. So, he was up -- somebody that is hitting you, saying what a bad guy I am, was up in my office asking for money and asking if I can get him on television.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> So, when -- if you're president of the United States, you are going to be hit by half the country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true. That's true.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Are you going to call them dumb and stupid?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I think it's a little bit different. Right now, I'm trying to do something to make the country great again. Politicians will never make this country great again. Now --
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> As president, you would change your tone?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think so. I would deal very differently.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Do you have the temperament to be president? That's what -- I mean, that's the question that George -- that Jeb Bush was really raising about the divisiveness, about the language. I mean, the kind of -- like, you take -- you have a no-prisoners approach. Somebody attacks you...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't have that. I am very different than you would think. Right now, I am fighting because I am number one in the polls by far, and I'm being attacked on all sides. When you're attacked, you have to -- in my opinion --
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Attacked all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me. In my opinion -- yes, but this isn't the same thing. In my opinion, when attacked, you have to, you know, defend, and attack back, OK? I'm being attacked by certain people. Actually, Bush, I think he is probably a nice guy. I don't think he has the temperament. And by that, he is a nice guy, but he doesn't have the temperament. You know why? He is too low-key. He is too laid back. Can you imagine Bush negotiating with China? You want to talk about temperament, I will introduce you to the Chinese. They have temperament. But can you imagine Bush negotiating trade deals with China?
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> His brother George W. Bush in -- when he was running, said that he would be a uniter, not a divider. What would you be?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think I would be a great uniter. We are not united now. We have a president that, whether people love him or hate him, the world is a mess. Hillary Clinton, by the way, was the worst secretary of state in the history of this country, in my opinion. But we have a president right now -- . Excuse me, doesn't get along with Russia, doesn't get along with anybody. I mean, the only one he gets along with is Iran. And even that is sort of very suspect, because they want to blow everybody up.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Back in 2007 or 2008, I saw a quote on Wolf Blitzer. You said to him that Hillary Clinton surrounds herself with smart people and she would probably be a good negotiator against Iran.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, maybe she could be, but I don't think so. I don't think so. I know her very well. And, again, when I am in the private sector and I am a businessman, I like everybody, because I have to deal with these people. I am not going to go and attack people. I have to deal with these people.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> So, Donald Trump as president would be a different Donald Trump than we have seen on the campaign trail?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, take a look at the world today. Who do we get along with? We get along with almost nobody. Our allies are decimated. We did a stupid thing in Iraq by going in. And you know that, in 2004, I was totally against going in. If you look, July of 2004, Reuters, probably stuff before that, but July of 2004, Bush actually sent a group to talk to me, because I was getting a lot of publicity on the fact that we shouldn't be doing Iraq. I am the most militaristic person, but you have to know when to use the military. I said you will decimate this country and you will create an imbalance in the Middle East like you have never seen before. That's what happened. And I said Iran will take over Iraq and the second largest oil reserves in the world.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> People --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I also said, and other groups will take over, that will be worse than Saddam Hussein. You know what happened, Anderson? It's ISIS. They took over the oil.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Have you ever publicly acknowledged making a mistake?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, look, everyone makes mistakes. Do I publicly acknowledge making mistakes?
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> I mean, have you ever said, you know what, I made a mistake; sorry about that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. I mean, I don't think about it. I don't like to make too many mistakes.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> I want to ask you about faith, because you talked about this on Saturday at this Faith and Values forum. And I think -- and a lot of people haven't heard you talk about it and were really interested.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Fine. Fine.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> In Iowa --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, by the way, I was very well received. I had the biggest standing ovation, the biggest standing ovation. And it was really a great day. It was really a great day.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> And a lot of people didn't focus on it, because they got caught up in the whole McCain thing. You said at the faith forum, when asked if you have ever asked for forgiveness from God, you said I'm not sure I have. I just go on and try to do a better job from there. I don't think so. And that surprised some people of faith.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't think so, you know. And then I said communion. I go to communion. And that's asking forgiveness, you know, in my opinion.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> For you, that's asking -- that's what communion is?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's a form of asking forgiveness, yes, communion. And I go to church a lot. And I'm Protestant. I'm Presbyterian.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But you -- the idea of asking for forgiveness, that's not a central -- is that a central tenet for you? Is it -- or is that something that just -- ?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I like to work where I don't really have to ask for forgiveness. I like to do the right thing where I don't have to actually ask for forgiveness. Does that make sense to you, you know, where you don't make such bad things that you don't have to ask for forgiveness? I mean, I try and lead a life where I don't have to ask God for forgiveness. But I am Protestant. I'm Presbyterian, which a lot of people are surprised to hear. I go to church. The great Norman Vincent Peale was my minister for years. "The Power of Positive Thinking" was fantastic. And --
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> So, forgiveness, that notion of forgiveness, that's not a central tenet for you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I try not to make mistakes where I have to ask for forgiveness, for one thing. So, when I'm asked a question like that, it's like, you know, I don't like to make a lot of mistakes.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> So -- and I would never ask the detail, but the idea of repentance, is that something that is important to you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think repenting is terrific. I mean, it's great.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> But is that -- but do you feel the need to?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I make a mistake --
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Is that part of forgiveness?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I make a mistake, yes, I think it's great. But I try not to make mistakes. I mean, why do I have to repent? Why do I have to ask for forgiveness if you are not making mistakes? I work hard. I'm an honorable person. I have thousands of people that work for me. I have employed tens of thousands of people over the years.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> You give millions to charity.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I give millions. I built the Vietnam Memorial in Lower Manhattan with a small group of people.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> At the faith forum, you talked about communion, the Eucharist, Lord's Supper, different -- well, different things. You said that you drink my little wine and have my little cracker.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We were having fun. The room laughed.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> I'm just saying. But some people faith there that they --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They didn't say that at all. When I left, I saw people. I got the biggest ovation of the weekend. I saw people. And I saw how a couple of reporters made a big deal out of that. We were having fun. When I said, I drink the wine, I drink -- I eat the cracker, but we're talking about communion.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know what? The whole room was laughing. And they're religious people and they're great people. They're great people. But the whole room was laughing.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Erick Erickson of Red State said that, based on your comments about faith on Saturday, that it is quote "largely closed the book on evangelical support." Do you agree with that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think so, because I just saw polls in Iowa that I am doing really well. I mean, you know in terms of Iowa, where it's a very big group of people, I'm doing really well.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Although the Quinnipiac poll in Iowa, among general voters --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. You keep bringing up negative. You only want to talk about negative. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Why don't you bring up the positive polls?
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> I did. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> I started off with the "Washington Post" poll.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You start off with the interview with the poll that I didn't have been they know existed.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> No, I started off with the "Washington Post" poll.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You start off the interview with a poll that I didn't even know existed.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> I started off with the "Washington Post" poll intentionally, because I knew you would accuse me of that. All I know is, every poll, I am leading in. And you give me these two polls where it's different states. They're not even a national poll. [Crosstalk]
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> If you will check the record, I started off with the "Washington Post" poll where you were out of front.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it is very unfair. You're talking to me a poll I never even saw. It's not even a poll.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> No, it's today. It's a Quinnipiac poll.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not even a --
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's on three different states. And you are hitting me with this.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think it's a very -- frankly, I think it is a very fair question.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it is an extremely -- you start off the interview with that. You don't say, I led in the FOX poll. I'm leading in the ABC/"Washington Post" poll.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> You're leading -- you're leading across the board.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you didn't -- I am leading across the board.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then you hit me with this poll that I didn't even see before, where, oh, gee -- it's not even that kind of a poll. All I know is, I have a very big group of support. And I think one of the reasons is that -- [Crosstalk]
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Among Republicans, you are way out in front.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me tell you, the people don't trust you and the people don't trust the media. And I understand why.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Right, and politicians.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I have always been covered fairly accurately, because it was usually a financial press. And, you know, numbers are numbers, OK? And my numbers happen to be great.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I was always sort of treated, like, fair. With the media, it's, and not all cases, some -- some of the political media is great and really honest. Even if they don't won't to be, they're really honest. But I find that 60, 70 percent of the political media is really, really dishonest. And, you know, I tell the story, the American dream -- I talk about the American dream in speeches. The American dream is dead, but I'm going to make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before. The American dream is dead, but I'm going to make it bigger and better, stronger than ever, right? And I go, boom, and I do it with great bravado, and the audience goes crazy. I come home, and my wife is saying, oh, darling, that was so bad. I said, what was bad? What you said today? I said, what did I say? The American dream is dead, cut, on one of the major networks.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> When you are on the debate stage, one of the things I think they will hit you with, your opponents will hit you with, not the media -- your opponents. They will say you have flip-flopped. You are a decisive guy in business, but you have been independent, you've been unaffiliated, you've been a Democrat, you've been a Republican. Back and forth. What's up with that? Are you a flip-flopper?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know who else flip-flopped? A man named, my favorite, Ronald Reagan. He was a Democrat. He became a Republican.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> You were also unaffiliated. You were independent.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By the way, I was, and I also live in New York.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> You were pro-choice, now you are not.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me. Well, if you look at that clip, I hate the concept of abortion, and I did -- but also, it was never, I am a businessman. They are talking to me as a businessman about things like abortion. Nobody ever even asked me questions like that. But if you look at that clip and let it run, I talk about how I hate the concept. I went on forever about it. But nobody would ask me questions. You know, sort of like a question you don't ask a guy. I build buildings, they are not asking me about am I pro-choice, am I pro-life, what am I? But, yes, I don't use the word flip. I have evolved on a lot of different things.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> The difference I have found between you and just about every other political candidate I have ever talked to is you don't come with a huge retinue, which surprises a lot of people. You talk extemporaneously. Your critics say you don't know the issues enough.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know the issues better than anybody knows the issues.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> You talk extemporaneously. Politicians are very controlled. And I think that's a huge part of your appeal, and I think that's why people enjoy their personal interaction with you. Even right now, we have gone way over the time you said you wanted. Nobody has given me a signal saying wrap it up, he has got to go. So I think that's all to your credit and deserves to be pointed out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, you ask me a question. I give you an answer. It's very simple. I'm a very smart person. You know, I went to the best school. I am a very smart person. All right? Let me just say, so you ask me a question, I give you an answer. I don't need pollsters like Bush and all these other people. They don't answer a question. Hillary, she can't give you an answer without going back and checking it out. I am much richer than almost anybody. I can have thousands of pollsters. I don't have any. I' don't want to waste the money.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Sandra Bland is a woman, an African-American woman, who was pulled over in Texas.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I saw that.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> I will not ask you specifics, I can't -- you can't be expected to look at everything. But pulled over for allegedly changing signals. Dashcam video has now been released. A lot of African-Americans, a lot of people are very upset about that. To African-Americans in this country, there is a lot of people who believe they're treated differently by police, do you believe that? There is a problem with that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hope not. But I will tell you, I saw that clip on your show, by the way. I thought it was terrible. I thought he was so aggressive. It was a traffic signal, as I understand it. And who gets out of a car for a traffic signal? I haven't been pulled over in a while, actually. But seriously. He just looked very aggressive. I didn't like his demeanor. I thought it was terrible, to be honest with you. I am a huge fan of the police. I think the police have to be given back power. But this guy was overly aggressive. Terribly aggressive.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Do you think that happens to African-Americans more than it does to you or I?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hope it doesn't, but it might. I have a great relationship with African-Americans, as you possibly have heard. I just have great respect for them. And they like me. I like them. The answer is, it possibly does, it shouldn't. And it is very sad. If the case is -- I will say, though, in this case, I watched that so closely. I watched it a few times. He was terrible.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> You're heading to border tomorrow. You've made trips to the border in the past. You've been invited by a group of representing boarder patrol officers. You keep saying Mexico is sending these people across.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Mexico is sending. You said it properly. You said it properly.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> But...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But you've offered no proof, and that's what people say about that you talk with no enough proofs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you may have proof very soon. You may have proof very soon. All you have to do is pick some of the border people.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Some of the border people told me, well, we're going to see a lot of border people tomorrow.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> We talked to immigration officials and they said look they've never heard of that. There's no evidence of that. When somebody, I mean, of all the people been arrest, you're telling me there will be...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You remember many years ago, Fidel Castro when he emptied the prisons and sent everybody into the United States, right?
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> [Inaudible] yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very famous, right? This is a much more sophisticated version of the same thing. Mexico doesn't want to have...
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But there wasn't clear evidence of that time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This animal -- excuse me -- this animal that killed Kate, he came across five times, five times. Now, maybe he came across because he thought the weather was nice, maybe he was pushed across by Mexico officials. Look, but Mexico...
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But you [Inaudible] no proof.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Mexico's leaders are much smarter and sharper, more cunning than our leaders. They are doing things that we don't even know about. Let's see what happens. I'm going to speak to a lot of people tomorrow. There are a lot of people, very excited, then, I'm going to the border tomorrow which I may never see you again, but these are minor details.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> You're telling me that one illegal immigrant wouldn't have a slit of paper or something that would indicate that he was sent proportionately.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we're going to find out. We're going to say. I think its common sense. Mexico doesn't want to have somebody for 30 years in a prison, went to United States, we'll do it.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But you've been saying everybody knows, this is the case that they are being sent...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so, yeah. I think a lot of people know.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> There's no evidence...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think the smart people know. I think the streetwise people know...
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But you have no evidence.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... and I think border guards know. Well, you're going to find out if I have evidence. I'm not telling you now, but you're going to find out what I have.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Obama -- I never thought he was qualified to be a president. But the one thing I thought he'd be good at it, is being a cheerleader for the country. Actually he's very divisive. I really hit them hard over the last two days on the flags. Why aren't you low for the five marines that were killed? Finally, he lowered the flags. I'm not, you know, I don't want to take credit for it, but I hit him hard. You saw that. Why doesn't he call up Kate, the parents of Kate? Why -- Kate is just incredibly young woman who were shot, killed by the illegal immigrant. He calls other people. They sent staffs of White House people to this -- on the funeral. They never called the parents or -- the brother of Kate, why? Why can't he put in one phone call to the parents or to the brother of Kate?
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Well, it's my job to pushback as you know on this kind of things. You didn't lower your flags until the same day that the White House...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Mine, were lower the day before yesterday.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> So is that same day as the White House...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Whatever, whatever. They were lowered.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Same day as Obama...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And again, I'm not the United States.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> You also...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You would think that would be automatic.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> I talk to the brother of Kate who said that you did not call though you had been talking about it. And wish you did that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Excuse me. I spoke to him numerous times. I spoke to him last night. He's a great guy.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Right. Subsequently you have called, but he...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me. I had to leave a period of grieving. I'm Donald Trump. I'm a private person. You have to have...
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> You do want to call?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Of course. I don't want to call the day of the...
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Murder.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... murder which is exactly by this animal that came in...
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... illegally, five times. So, I wanted to wait and I explained that to Brad. I said, "I have to tell you something. I actually saw what you" -- I said, "I had to leave a period of grieving. I couldn't call you. The President could call the media.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The President could have called that day, the next day or the next day. I'm a private citizen.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> That's the kind of thing as president, you feel you're doing much, but you would be...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I would call.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> ... too much less divisive, much more. I mean that's how you envy you...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would have called, absolutely. That would be a call that you should make. You know what? It's quick. Those people are devastated. They are great people and there are others -- I had a news conference that you people covered, that CNN covered, in California with some of the most incredible people...
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> We covered a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... with their sons, and daughters, and family were killed by illegal immigrants, that shouldn't been in the country. And yes, I would call those people. I can always find time to call. One thing about me, I wouldn't be on planes doing all these fundraisers, if we going to have fundraising, maybe you do them in some places else. I mean, the other night in New York, New York was shutdown because Obama's here to go to a Broadway play.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's here to, you know, when you're in the White House for a limited period of time, I'd be there all the time working, working.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> The difference...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wouldn't even have time to comb my hair the way I coming up probably just have to comb it back.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> You have talked a lot since Saturday about John McCain, the war hero thing. You did attack on McCain's record on veteran issues and we talked about you ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... terrible for the veterans. John McCain is -- I supported him for president.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Do you follow specific policy...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I raised a lot of -- excuse me. I raised a lot of money for John McCain. I supported him for president. He's been horrible to the veterans and here's what I say. I'm all over the place. I go to all of them whether it's New Hampshire, or Iowa, or California last week. I'm all over. I meet so many veterans. These are big, so beautiful people, they're strong. They see me they have tears pouring down their face. They're treated so badly by the veterans' administration which is corrupt...
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> No doubt about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... and incompetent.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Yeah. And we've done tons of reporting on this but every veterans group I've talked to has said what you said about this record on vets is just wrong. CEO of Concerned Veterans of America says with patently falls, ill-informed says McCain "has taken the lead for years...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's been terrible for the veterans -- excuse me. But trying, that's the word, trying.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> So let me give this ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. Excuse me, excuse me. He's trying, he's not getting a job done ...
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Let me give you some specifics...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... because they are living in hell, they are living like third class citizen. The hospitals are falling apart. The new hospitals are costing four or five times what they were supposed to cost and they are not working.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> So let me -- because you don't talk specifics, let me give you some specifics here.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do talk specifics.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Major's legislation passed last year by John McCain on this and you know what it's done? At the waiting list ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me. The waiting lists as of yesterday were longer than they'd ever been in the history of the V.A.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Veterans Access to Care through Choice, Accountability and Transparency Act, are you aware what that is?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me, yes. And can I tell you what? The waiting lists as of yesterday was reported is the longest for veterans, I see them. They wait four, five, six days to see a doctor. Excuse me. And then the doctor says, "I'm sorry, I can't see you. I'm going on vacation."
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But you say he's done nothing. He has done thing...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't say "nothing". I say he's been very ineffective with respect to helping veterans. I see probably -- I bet you will see, in what I've been doing over the last couple of months, more veterans than he sees, all right? They are devastated.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Your critique say you're not actually following policy issue. Are you aware what that major legislation did last year?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think one thing it did is it took the burden off of Obama's back because that was blowing up like crazy around Obama for the horrible job he's done also and other politicians. And by passing that legislation, and now you have the longest waits in history. But by passing that legislation, it took the burden off people haven't been fired, the scandals all over the place.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> But that act actually makes it easier to fire V.A. officials. That gives $500 million. It builds 26 new hospitals.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In the meantime, it hasn't been used and they haven't been fired and the V.A. is in worst shape than it's ever been in. It's typical political sub. And I will tell you. The one thing with that act that's really bad, it took the burden off Obama. He was getting decimated. And that was a good thing because it showed the plague of the veterans. Veterans are being decimated.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Just this year, McCain introduced the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act for American vets. Are you aware for that even following that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I knew he introduce things but nothing happens with them. And frankly, even when they get passed whether it's two years ago or this year. And you give me names I can give you many names of people that absolutely don't like John McCain because they felt that he let the veterans down.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> You started a hotline for vets. John McCain's office says, "Look, we got five full time case workers." In this year alone, they said they've helped dealt with 2000 cases for vets.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hope you're not trying to make the case that the veterans are being properly taken care.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> I'm not we done [Inaudible] reporting...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it sounds like...
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> No. I'm just saying you're attacking John McCain's records, I'm asking specific.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Probably, the most corrupt group in this country is the Veteran's administration. Now, you could say corrupt or incompetent, it's both.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Mr. President, welcome to Davos.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Joe.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Thank you for agreeing to come on CNBC and Squawk Box. I appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've known you a long time.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> You have known me a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And we've done many of these, but a little bit different position. I was a developer.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> Little bit different position -- few more people around, too.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Couple of more people.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> So, the America First president comes to Davos. And you know, when you say "Davos"" you know what a lot of people think: globalists
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So when I decided to come to Davos I didn't think in terms of elitists or globalists. I think I thought in terms of lots of people that want to invest lots of money, and they're all coming back to the United States, they're coming back to America. And I thought of it much more in those terms.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> After I said that I was going there were massive stories about the elite, and the globalists, and the planes flying in, and everything else. It's not about that. It's about coming to America, investing your money, creating jobs, companies coming in. We're setting records every week, every day we're setting records.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You see what's going on. Apple now with $350 billion. Most people thought they meant $350 million, which would build a nice plant. But I spoke with Tim Cook and I was very honored. But you remember my campaign, I used to say, "I won't consider this great unless Apple starts coming in and really investing big money doing the plants."" They're gonna do a lot."
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> You've moved a little ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... but so many companies are coming in and so many jobs ...
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> Yes. You've moved a little towards the center. But so Macron's saying that globalism doesn't solve problems. Suddenly other countries are saying, you know, "We need to take care of
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There's a lot of room. And we love global, but we love home. We have to take care of our home.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Right. It's not usually exclusive.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, we have the disadvantage of having spent, as of about a month ago, $7 trillion in the Middle East. $7 trillion. That's a big disadvantage. And we're still there, and I've beaten ISIS, I've done—we've done a good job. But it's such a shame. It's such a sad, sad thing.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> Let me tell you about the difference of Davos this year.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> We've done three three-hour shows, we have about eight guests per hour, so that's, like, 50 or 60 guests.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> They are more optimistic this year -- and there's global growth.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> But the one thing most are bringing up -- and then I want to tell you about -- if you didn't see the Jamie Dimon and the Lloyd Blankfein interview, I want to just tell you what they said about the potential for GDP growth ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good. Good.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Because those guys might know what they're talking about. But the tax plan has been brought up almost without exception in a positive way by not just the CEOs, but by leaders from other countries even. They maybe they need to look at -- maybe they need to invest in the United States now because it's a better environment for business.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that's why I'm here. To a large extent, that's why I'm here. I think that the tax plan has been even better than we thought, Joe. What did happen that nobody considered is that AT&T started, but they immediately followed ...
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> Same day almost.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hundreds of companies are giving thousands and thousands of dollars to their workers. And now you have almost 3 million workers that are receiving thousands of dollars. Nobody ever thought -- that was not, like, in the plan ...
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> Even Starbucks. Even Starbucks ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, even Starbucks, yesterday Disney and others. I mean ...
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> So Dimon said ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By the way, the ones that aren't doing it, those employees are going like, "How about us?"" Guess what? They're gonna be doing it
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, I know you know him. Not only did he say he thought 3 percent was possible, he said we could get to 4 percent in 2018. Lloyd Blankfein, and I pressed him a little because I said, "That was not the outcome -- the election that you were
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now that you've seen what's happened to the stock market, up 40 percent since Election Day, how businesses are growing confidence, are you happy with the outcome?" And he said -- he couldn't really say
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I don't think – they can't do that.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> ... but no, but he did.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He can't do it ...
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> But he said ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's OK.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> But -- no, but he said, "I don't think the stock market would be where it is
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That was Lloyd?
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> That was Lloyd.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And Jamie's become very positive ...
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> Jamie and Lloyd also said 3 percent is possible long term, which we haven't heard from all the economists that supposedly ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it'll be much higher than that. So I said and let's see what happens, because as you know, we're getting a report very soon, so we're going to see what that is. But I just happened to ask what we were doing. Because you know, if you look at the real numbers, had I not won, had the Democrat won -- I'm going to be nice -- the Democrat, I say, won -- I would consider their last quarter my first quarter. Because you know, I just got there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So let's say the first quarter of '17 you had a 1.2 GDP. OK? 1.2. In the fourth quarter, which is the Obama quarter, you had a 1.8. Before that, you had a 2.8, a 2.2. You had -- weren't doing very well. And it was the worst recovery -- I guess do they say ever, or since the Great Depression? But it was the worst recovery.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. Now, in my first quarter, which I consider to be the second quarter because I was there now long enough to have made an impact and don't kid yourself, regulations are just as big as the tax cuts. I've cut more regulations than any president in history and I've been here for one year.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You can take their term whether it's eight years or 16 years in one instance -- but you can take anybody you want, in one year, we've cut more regulations. And by the way, there's going to be regulation but they're good, solid, sane regulations.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But in quarter two, we had 3.1, and in quarter three, as you know, we had 3.2. But in quarter one, which is the Obama quarter -- really the last, I would say, Obama quarter, you had 1.2. We were going in the wrong direction.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> Right. There was the hurricane.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Had the Democrat won -- the stock market is up almost 50 percent since my election -- had the Democrat won, I believe you would have been down 50. That's the direction we were headed. And you know, a lot of that, regulation. It was staggering. You could not do anything. You couldn't build -- I approved immediately -- the two pipelines, 48,000 jobs ...
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Right. Can we talk about the year?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> So the year, all these things that you have pointed out. But you've been dealing, negotiating now in government instead of in the private sector. And it's been I think lovingly referred to as the swamp by certain ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah. It's difficult.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> Is it difficult? And have you learned -- are you approaching it differently now? Would you give your -- what would you give yourself in terms of dealing, negotiating with the government versus business? What grade for the first year?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, a lot of people have given me an A. Somebody gave me an A-plus. So look, I got the biggest tax plan in our history approved. And don't forget, not just a tax plan.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> Have you learned anything?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I got rid of the ...
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> Would you do anything different now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Joe, one second. I got rid of the individual mandate, the most -- the biggest part and the most unpopular thing in Obamacare, which really repeals Obamacare, because it can't live without the mandate, because that's where a lot of the money came. It was very unfair to people. And we did ANWR [Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]. ANWR, Ronald Reagan tried to do it 40 years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, everybody's been trying to do ANWR, and I got ANWR done as part of that same bill. So on top of the biggest tax cuts, great reform and the money is coming in. I mean, the money is pouring in. We probably take in $4 trillion from overseas that would never have been able to be here because of regulation.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Well, can we talk trade real quickly while we're doing it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And taxes. Yeah.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> So we had solar panels, washing machines. I'm not sure where it goes from here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> I'm not sure how China reacts, whether steel's next ...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Whatever it is.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> You'll -- they're grown-ups and I think they understand that maybe we had some ...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's time ...
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> We have some legitimate -- right. Would you -- you going to stick with bilateral or would you ever go back in the multi -- would TPP, would that ever be possible to look at that again?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like bilateral because if you have a problem, you terminate. When you're in with many countries, like with TPP -- so you have 12 if we were in -- you don't have that same, you know, you don't have that same option. But somebody asked me other day would I do TPP.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Here's my answer. I'll give you a big story. I would do TPP if we made a much better deal than we had. We had a horrible deal. The deal was a horrible deal. NAFTA's a horrible deal, we're renegotiating it. I may terminate NAFTA, I may not. We'll see what happens. But NAFTA was and I went around and I'd tell stadiums full of people, "I'll terminate it or renegotiate it."""
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> So you might re-enter -- are you opening up the door to reopening TPP? Or ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm only saying this: I would do TPP if we were able to make a substantially better deal. The deal was terrible. The way it was structured was terrible. If we did a substantially better deal I would be open to TPP.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> That's interesting. Would you handicap ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Are you surprised to hear me say that?
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> I'm a little bit, yeah. I'm a little taken aback ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don't be surprised, no. But we have to make a better deal ...
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> I want to know ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The deal was a bad deal, like the Iran deal is a bad deal ...
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> You said -- but NAFTA, maybe not NAFTA ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These are bad deals.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Can you give me any indication which way you're leaning? Because there's a lot of people, lot of the CEOs that have been on here, they all seem to acknowledge that it's 30 years later and there's a lot of changes that make a lot of sense, but to not abandon the deal. We ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hey Joe, we have a trade deficit with Mexico. Mexico, $71 billion a year, right? We have a trade deficit with Canada of a substantial amount of money. I have a number but they keep arguing, they keep saying no -- so I won't say it. I won't tell you it's $17 million, OK? We have a trade deficit with Canada. We have a massive trade deficit with Mexico. Got to do something. We can't continue to do this ...
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> Are you leaning towards staying in or would you really go out of the ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've always said during the campaign and as you noticed and as you've actually said a couple of times, which I've always appreciated, I have fulfilled a lot of what I've said. And I'm only here a year. You know, I think I have four years and maybe another four years, OK, if we keep going ...
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> So what we'll see ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We'll see what happens. But Joe, we have a $71 billion a year trade deficit with Mexico. We got to do something. We can't have that. So will it be renegotiated? We're trying right now with [U.S. Trade Representative] Bob Lighthizer and the whole group. I think we have a good chance but we'll see what happens.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> The way that the shutdown finally was, you know, was ended.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> I get the feeling that Senator Schumer is taking a lot of flak from his flank, from the far-left flank. So I feel like he's been burnt, which makes me worry about when we go back. In two weeks ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He made a mistake in shutting down. He shouldn't have shut down. People of this country want security, they want safety, they want their military to be taken care of.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> What's going to happen on Monday with DACA? What are you willing to go further to the ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we've already started the process ...
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> Will you stay with Cotton or will you move further to what ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think Cotton, and Perdue and Goodlatte, and the people that I've been dealing with -- Cornyn, so many of the people -- these are great people. These are people that really have shifted a lot. They've really shifted a lot, and I think they're willing to shift more, and so am I.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> You said 10n to 12 years for citizenship, right, for the Dreamers. Will Cotton go along with that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to see. If we make the right deal. I think they will. These are people that have very strong opinions on DACA and on immigration generally. And I happen to think they're largely right. Look, we're going to try and make a deal on DACA. We have a good chance of making it. What we need is we need the wall, we need security, we need security at the border. We have to stop the drugs from coming in. We need safety and we need a strong military.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> You want ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We need almost more than ever before -- I mean, we've been in wars so we needed it then -- but we need to be sure that our military is properly funded, and it would be really great to get rid of the, you know, we'd like to have a regular budget.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> Will you ask for $25 billion, Mr. President? Is that ...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're asking ...
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> ... and did Chuck Schumer offer $1.6 billion?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We agreed to $25 billion ...
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> Did he take it back? Did he ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, sure. He took it back but, you know, that's ...
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Did he -- how much did he agree to?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But he didn't really take it back. If you see numerous senators on the other side they said, "We'd give the wall in two minutes if we could do something with DACA."" Everybody wants to solve the DACA problem. They've been wanting to solve it for a long time. It should've been solved by President Obama. It would've been easier to solve it
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the way, the court -- it wasn't me. The courts were not upholding that executive order. You have to do it through Congress. I want to solve the DACA problem. I will consider that a great achievement to solve the DACA problem. It's been out there for a long time. These are good people, these are people that should be able to stay in this country. We're going to solve the DACA problem.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we also want to solve a tremendous problem on the southern border, which is crime. We need a wall, we need the drugs to stop flowing in. They are coming in like -- well, they're coming in less now than they were because we have a very strong -- we have great Border Patrol agents, great ICE -- we have great people and they are really doing a good job. And you see what's happening at the border, it's much better.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we need a strong border. And to do that you need a wall. And they did agree to a $25 billion wall, of which I'll have a lot of money left over. Because I don't need $25 billion to build a wall. We'll build a great -- that's what I do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We'll build a great wall and we'll have a lot of money left over, and we'll spend it on other things. But we need great security. And yes, Senator Perdue, Senator Cotton, Cornyn, this one, that one, we have tremendous support to get something done. Tremendous, Joe. And I think something will get done.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> I want to ask you a Davos question, just because we're here and I don't know, I even get taken over by this. But whenever we're here, we talk about wealth disparity and income inequality, not just globally but everywhere.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Big problem.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> Big problem. A resurgent United States, a strongly growing United States makes a world of difference -- not just for the United States but for the world in general. But I'm just wondering if you did -- if you were able to keep GDP or if the United States grows at 3 percent or 4 percent and we have the coffers, that we can do a lot with 3 percent or 4 percent. It's totally different than when we don't have money.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Different country.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> Do you have a way of addressing the skills gap and education? As a businessperson, you solve problems. Now you're in government ...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We need vocational schools. We need the community colleges in many cases ...
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> Will that be something that will ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I think it's a big factor for us. But I also want these great companies that are coming in -- Toyota's now coming in. We talked already about Apple. Apple's coming in with a very big presence. We had many companies -- Chrysler's coming in, leaving Mexico and coming back to Michigan. I mean, how good is that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When was the last time you heard that? And without me being here and without what we've been doing including regulation, by the way, because I happen to think that regulation is as big as the tax cuts, OK? I think the tax cuts are incredible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I think the regulations, the cutting of regulations -- because the businesses couldn't even -- they couldn't do anything. They were totally bound. You'd have to get 16 different approvals from 15 different agencies. Hey Joe, it was impossible to do business. And I think you know that maybe better than anybody. The cutting of the regulations was every bit as important as what we did with the tax cuts.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you put them both together and we have a dynamic country again. I mean, everybody's talking. I just came out and some really wonderful people said, "Davos has never been like this."" This is like walking into the Academy Awards
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> The Journal this morning, lead editorial was that -- and they gave a lot of credit to the Trump administration for where economic growth is right now. But then they said, "Why would a Cabinet member bring up the idea of a weaker dollar when things are going so well?"" And I'm wondering whether -- you saw Secretary Mnuchin's comments yesterday. Do you agree with those? Were they taken out of context? Where are you ..."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So let me tell you, I think they were taken out of context because I read his exact statement. I'll tell you where I stand, which ultimately is very important. No. 1, I don't like talking about it because, frankly, nobody should be talking about it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It should be what it is. It should also be based on the strength of the country. We are doing so well, our country is becoming so economically strong again -- and strong in other ways too, by the way -- that the dollar is going to get stronger and stronger. And ultimately, I want to see a strong dollar. Right now it floats. But it's your great reserve currency. There can never be anything even close to it. There is nothing close to it, there never will be.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But ultimately the dollar, because our country is going to get so much stronger economically, if you look at what's happened to our country over the -- look, I've been talking about this with you for 25 years. Trade. It started with Japan, morphed into China, now it's China, Japan, it's everybody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And everybody has taken advantage of our country. They have ripped our country off. You look at what they do. I saw something on motorcycles today with a certain country. Why should I say? But they sell motorcycles into our country, no tax. We sell motorcycles into their country -- Harley-Davidsons, the greatest, right? We sell them into their country, 100 percent tax. Not going to happen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The word "reciprocal"" is the most important word with Donald Trump when it comes to what the subject that we talk about and the subject that CNBC covers so well -- especially you
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If they're going to charge us 100 percent for a motorcycle, it should be 100 percent the other way, too. And you know, when you mention a tax at the border, a 10 percent tax on the border for everything coming in, I'm a free trader. Totally. I'm a fair trader. I'm all kinds of trader, but I want reciprocal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because when China's charging us a fortune to send products in and making it impossible for the product to get there -- and many other countries, by the way, not just China. China's the biggest. And then we charge them nothing to sell their stuff here. It's not fair. When you use the word "reciprocal"" everybody understands that. If they do it to you
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> Well, we're going to have to end it there. I'm just -- last question. Will we have another shutdown? Will you move more to the center on immigration ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think the Democrats would shut it down again.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> You don't think they'll do it ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. Because you look at every poll, it said they made a mistake.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> Where's the movement going to come?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to say Schumer got badly beaten. Why should I do that? I'm negotiating with someone -- I'm not going to say he got badly beaten. But you look at what happened. The people want security and they want DACA taken care of. But more importantly, they want security, they want the borders strong, they want to have a strong border. They don't want to have MS-13 coming into our cities.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know how many of these people were getting out? These are horrible, horrible human beings. And they came here as horrible human beings. And Joe, it sounds terrible. They don't shoot somebody, they cut them up into little pieces because it's more painful. I don't want them -- we are taking them out by the thousands. By the thousands.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We don't want them coming in, but we're going to take care of DACA. Nobody wants to take care of DACA more than myself and the Republican Party. And the Republican Party is unified at a level that Paul Ryan called me the other day. He said, "I have to tell you
<Donald Trump> <Positive> For many decades I've never seen the Republican Party unified like it is under your presidency." And that -- that was Paul Ryan. And I thought that was a very nice statement
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> All right. Thank you very much for sitting down with us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Joe. It's been an honor. We've known each other for a long time.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> We have. And I, I appreciate it and we're looking forward to... to the speech. I think a lot of people will be watching.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you very much. Thank you. Well good, I hope so. Thank you Jim, I appreciate it.
