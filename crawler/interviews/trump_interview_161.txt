<Jonathan Karl> <Negative> First of all, could you be taken seriously as a presidential for candidate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that I've built a great, great company. I know that I've built a great company with a tremendous net worth and meeting a lot of people that are very smart. And that's really what the country needs.
<Jonathan Karl> <Negative> What do you say to those who say that a possible Trump candidacy is a joke? That it's a publicity stunt. This is a way to get more attention of for yourself?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, interestingly, I filed applications last time. And I actually filed my net worth. Because I'm a private person, so nobody knows. And people were really shocked at the number. And now the number's a lot bigger than it was. How strong the company is. How much cash? The whole thing. I mean, it's a beautiful company.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a company like this country should look.
<Jonathan Karl> <Positive> So what is the number? What are you worth now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Probably, over $10 billion.
<Jonathan Karl> <Neutral> And if you were to run for president, how much would you be willing to spend on your campaign?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, if I made a decision, I'd spend a lot.
<Jonathan Karl> <Positive> But a modern presidential campaign can be, you know, half a billion dollars or more.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It can be, or more. Yeah, I'd be willing to spend.
<Jonathan Karl> <Neutral> That kind of money?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If I did it, I'd spend whatever it took.
<Jonathan Karl> <Positive> I want to get your assessment on the field.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK.
<Jonathan Karl> <Positive> You just give me kind of the first word that pops to mind.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right.
<Jonathan Karl> <Neutral> Marco Rubio.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Immigration.
<Jonathan Karl> <Neutral> Rand Paul.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Interesting.
<Jonathan Karl> <Neutral> Paul Ryan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, he -- I really like him a lot. But you really have to look at what he says about the Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid. It's a tough -- it's a tough road he's got to hoe, in my opinion, but I do like him. So let's say Medicare.
<Jonathan Karl> <Neutral> Chris Christie.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, wonderful person. He's a wonderful guy.
<Jonathan Karl> <Neutral> Ted Cruz.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Obamacare. He really is fighting on trying to stop this absolute disaster for the United States called Obamacare.
<Jonathan Karl> <Neutral> Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Smart.
<Jonathan Karl> <Positive> You've said a lot of things over the years that people think just make you not serious. One of the big things is -- is on the birth certificates. What I like to do --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why does that make me not serious? I mean, I think that resonated with a lot of people.
<Jonathan Karl> <Positive> But you don't still question he was born in the United States, do you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have no idea.
<Jonathan Karl> <Neutral> Even at this point?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know, was there a birth certificate? You tell me. You know some people say that was not his birth certificate. I'm saying, I don't know, Nobody does. And you don't know either, Jonathan. You're a smart guy. You don't know either.
<Jonathan Karl> <Positive> I'm pretty convinced he was born in the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Pretty, ah. Pretty, pretty. No, no, you said pretty.
<Jonathan Karl> <Positive> Totally. Without question that he was born in the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Jonathan. excuse me, Jonathan you said you're pretty convinced. OK. So let's just see what happens over time, but it's not my issue, Jonathan.
<Jonathan Karl> <Positive> OK, Let me ask you something else.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> My issue right now is much different. Wait a minute. My issue is economic. Our country is being ripped apart by China and many other countries. That's my issue.
<Jonathan Karl> <Negative> But on this issue, people and you are just [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you just said you're pretty sure. And you're pretty sure, that's not acceptable, because you know, you can't be pretty sure. You have to be 100% sure.
<Jonathan Karl> <Positive> I'm sure. I'm 100% sure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think you are.
<Jonathan Karl> <Neutral> Let me ask you this, Ted Cruz, born in Canada.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Jonathan Karl> <Positive> Is he eligible to be president of the United States?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, if he was born in Canada, perhaps not. But I'm not sure where he was born. I --
<Jonathan Karl> <Positive> His definitely born in Canada.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK. Well, then you'll have to ask him that question. But perhaps not.
<Jonathan Karl> <Neutral> Ted Cruz's mother was an American citizen. He was an American.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, that will be ironed out. I don't know the circumstances. I heard -- somebody told me he was born in Canada. That's really his thing.
<Jonathan Karl> <Positive> Has you played golf with John Boehner?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I did.
<Jonathan Karl> <Negative> The big question coming up now is, will House Republicans pass a funding bill for the government that includes funding for Obamacare? Should they?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that is a big question. I do think this: the budget should be funded, but I don't think that Obamacare should be funded. And the Republicans are, in many ways, their own worst enemy. I happen to be a Republican. But if they get together and if they were unified, I think they could do some very serious damage to getting rid of Obamacare, which is a very positive thing for the country.
<Jonathan Karl> <Neutral> Now, you know Hillary Clinton?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do.
<Jonathan Karl> <Negative> How tough is she going to be to beat if she's the Democratic nominee?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think she'll be very tough.
<Jonathan Karl> <Neutral> So what do they need to do to beat Hillary Clinton or whoever the Democratic nominee is?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They need to pick the right candidate. Now, Mitt Romney was, in theory, everything should have been good, but it didn't work. He didn't resonate. And by the way, wonderful guy. Didn't resonate. They have to pick the right candidate.
