<Dan Bongino> <Positive> I'd like to welcome to our first interview show, President Donald J. Trump. Mr. President, thank you so much. This is a tremendous honor you've agreed to spend some time with us today. Thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you very much, Dan, it is my honor.
<Dan Bongino> <Positive> And Mr. President, I'd like to quickly just thank you also for supporting new media out there. Digital media, podcasts, you've been very savvy on that front. Obviously, use of Twitter, and I really appreciate that, and I know a lot of Conservative voices feel the same way, and they've asked me to express that thanks to you as well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, thank you. But you know, I have no choice because the media is so corrupt. I have no choice. It's really not something I'm doing for anybody. I guess, I'm doing it for the people to get the word out because the Times and The Washington Post, and every network is, as far as I'm concerned, they're corrupt.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, we get the word out at least.
<Dan Bongino> <Negative> Well, I don't disagree in this impeachment fiasco farce disaster going on on Capitol Hills seems to be indicative of that. I'd just like to hit this point. First, we have of course, some more testimony going on in the show today because it is a show. And what I find interesting is this was all based on a fake whistleblower complaint about a transcript
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Dan Bongino> <Negative> You and I can both read. Obviously, you were there, you don't need to read it. I've read the transcript. There is no illicit deal in there. There's no deal at all, and what I find fascinating is the deal that they say you made Mr. President, keeps changing because it doesn't exist. First, it was for security aide that you delivered.
<Dan Bongino> <Negative> Then, it was for a White House meeting that never happened and that it was for a public statement by the Ukrainian president that they never made.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right.
<Dan Bongino> <Negative> Is this a little ridiculous or am I reading this wrong?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The whole thing is a disgrace to our country. In the meantime, they're not doing any work. We have one of the greatest trade deals ever made and everybody wants it, including the Democrats and Nancy Pelosi, it sits at her desk for months, and she hasn't been able to do it, the USMCA, and everybody's going to vote for it, most Democrats.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Our farmers need it, our manufacturers need it, the auto companies need it, and she doesn't do a thing with it. And this which I just -- you know we went through the Mueller deal and that fizzled out when he testified, and frankly, long before he testified because there was no collusion. You know we went through the whole Russia hoax and you know that subject probably better than any human being in the world, you and a few other good friends.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But that was terrible. And then this -- I had about three days of rest, and then this thing hit me, based on a perfect phone call with a very nice person, who I think is going to do a good job. He won on corruption and he should be looking for corruption. That's how we won the race, as they say it in Ukraine, and he should be -- you know hopefully, he'll have back in it. He'll be able to do what he has to do because Ukraine has a tremendous reputation for corruption.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I also wanted to know why isn't Germany and why isn't France and U.K. and all of these European countries, why aren't they giving? Why is it always the United States that's giving? And they're certainly, it's much more important to them because they're essentially a wall between them and Russia. That's like a big wall.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's the ultimate wall. And they should be helping much more, and instead, it's the United States always the sucker. So, it's one of those things but we help them and we will help them, and I like the new President, and I very much liked and respected that. Last night, he issued a very, very powerful statement that should have ended this witch hunt.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know, the witch hunt, which is as you know Dan, gone on long before I won the election.
<Dan Bongino> <Positive> Yeah. Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was actually long before. When you go back to the insurance policy. You know just in case I should win, well, we're in the insurance policy phase right now with all of this nonsense. But so -- we have a -- you know it's an interesting time, but we're draining the swamp one by one. You look at Comey, he's gone.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at McCabe and you look at all of these people, struck and his lover page and Brennan, and you look at all of these people, and I'm -- I tell you, what I'm most looking forward to, I let our great Attorney General handle it. But what I'm most looking forward to is the IG report and the bull Durham report.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's what I'm most looking forward to, those two things.
<Dan Bongino> <Positive> Bull Durham, I like that. That's an appropriate nickname. John Durham has a great reputation and I'm sure he's going to do a great job. I'm looking forward to that IG report as well that leads into my second question here. So, we know the collusion hoax was a total fiasco and it was basically cover for the Democrats admitted collusion with Russians and that's not a mystery.
<Dan Bongino> <Negative> They said they used Russian sources to attack you in your campaign and that's not a conspiracy theory.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Absolutely. It's hard to believe.
<Dan Bongino> <Negative> That's their own words. So, it's kind of interesting how when the Mueller thing fizzled out just days later, this fake whistleblower complaint appeared. Do you think this is all, again, like the collusion hoax was cover for Democrat collusion with Russians, that this is cover for the Democrat collusion in the Biden collusion with these key Ukrainians, just an effort to flip it into you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think, because this is just out of the blue, this came up. In fact, I remember one of our people walked in, sir, did you ever have one of the lawyers, White House lawyers, who are doing a very good job. They walked in, they said, sir, did you ever have a conversation with the Ukrainian President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said, yes, the new Ukrainian President, and I actually had two conversations with him. I -- we just released the other one today and you saw that was milquetoast also. I think you probably heard Devin Nunes did a great job, by the way. His opening remarks were great but he just read that into the record because, as you know, Schiff didn't read what I said into the record.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He made up a conversation and read that into the record. That was one of the most disgusting things I've ever seen in politics. And if he didn't have immunity, he'd be in jail for what he did. So, that's the story. I mean, you know, when you hear about this whistleblower, everyone in Washington knows who it is, by the way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know the whistleblower is no great secret. The fake news doesn't want to print it because if it was a reverse type whistleblower, they would -- they would have a lot of different feeling. But the whistleblower, everybody knows who the whistleblower is and has to be revealed. The whistleblower wrote a report was -- which was mostly on the phone call that everybody now sees was a good call.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's why they switched. They never thought, Dan, that I was going to release that call and I really had no choice because Adam Schiff made up a call. He said the President said this, and then, he made up a call. I think he's crazy, OK. I think he's crazy. I think he's a nut job and he's very corrupt but he made up a call.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He actually -- he either saw the letter or he didn't see it and did it first. Either way, he totally made up the call and in making up the call, it sort of sounds familiar because the whistleblower also made up something that bought no relationship to the real call. So, fortunately, the call was transcribed by experts and transcribed beautifully and that was the call.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When they saw, when I released it, Dan, everything started going downhill because the call was a perfect call. Mark Levin said it, Gregg Jarrett said it, you said it, a lot of very talented people said it, and if there was something wrong, they'd say that. But there was nothing wrong. There was nothing wrong with it nor is there anything wrong with the first call that they just read into the record.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But when I released the call, all hell broke loose on the Democrat side, including the fact that I've heard that Nancy Pelosi blasted them. She said you can't impeach a man on this call. But she had already gone public because she had read and she had heard the whistleblower report, which was a fake report.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, the whistleblower gave a fake or fraudulent -- I'm not sure what you'd call it, gave a fraudulent report, a fake report, and based on that report, they started this whole nonsense. But just to finish, the IG should have never turned that report in because the IG should have taken that report. It was all about the call.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They should have taken that report and gone and asked, I would have declassified, would have -- should have asked for the call. When he read the call, he would have seen it was totally different than the political operative whistleblower and this thing shouldn't have even started. But the IG didn't do that so let's talk about the IG. The IG didn't do that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The IG brought it directly to Congress. Let's get some publicity for himself. Then he brought it directly. He should have seen the whistleblower report on the call. He should have then asked to see the call, and when he sees the call, he would have been -- he would have -- he should have said, well, there's no case here. We also sent it to the Department of Justice after we received the whistleblower letter and they called back, and they said this is absolutely fine, nothing inappropriate said. We got a perfect report on it. And just one other thing that nobody mentions, Dan, is that.
<Dan Bongino> <Negative> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When I make calls to foreign leaders, I know there are many people on the line. I mean, with my knowledge there are many people. That could be as many as 25 people, 20 people, five people, two people, but there are always people because you know, you're talking to the leader of a foreign nation and you even have an apprenti on the call I think.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, people in the State Department, and you know, all good reasons, and probably, some bad reasons because we have some bad people too, really bad people. But I knew that Mike Pompeo was on the call, the Secretary of State. I knew that other people were on the call. Fortunately, they transcribed the call.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How about -- how would it be if they didn't transcribe this call. I would have been in trouble. I would have had all these guys lying about a call. I would have had a whistleblower that people would have believed.
<Dan Bongino> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, if -- I got lucky that they had it transcribed. These are professional people. But if they didn't transcribe that call, I'd be at the mercy of people that are lying all over the place. But I know everybody's --
<Dan Bongino> <Positive> Well, Mr. President. That --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know everybody's on the phone, Dan.
<Dan Bongino> <Negative> Sorry.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I know all these people. Who's going to say something bad when I know there may be 25 people on the phone? It's so crazy.
<Dan Bongino> <Negative> Yeah, that reminds me. Question -- can you just put to bed a far left conspiracy theory for a moment. The whistleblower's own complaints by the -- own complaint, the fake whistleblower.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right.
<Dan Bongino> <Negative> In the complaint, the whistleblower acknowledges that it's standard practice for a word for word transcript. In other words, what's in the transcript is what you said. Can you put to bed the conspiracy theory Adam Schiff and the lying Democrats are promoting, that there's some kind of secret transcript out there where you made this deal and it's not in the record?
<Dan Bongino> <Negative> This is -- I'm embarrassed to ask you this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no there's not.
<Dan Bongino> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is the transcribed version and it's very accurately transcribed. I mean, that's exactly what I remember in the call.
<Dan Bongino> <Negative> The whistleblower said it was accurately transcribed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Then, you had this guy -- then, Manuel, he remembers it slightly differently. You know him. He shows up in his uniform for the first time ever. Then, you have Vindman -- you have all these characters. You know these are people I've never met. I never even met. I never even heard of these people and they're either never Trumpers, some were appointed by Obama, but they could be never Trumpers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, we took out Bush, we took out Clinton, we took out Obama. So, I end up with many, many years of a lot of bad people, thousands and thousands of people, and that's what I inherit, and they don't have the good of the country at that end, unfortunately. But I watch this guy and I heard this guy and did not appropriate because -- then, he did, you know, he did call in, check this out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> As I understand it, he called in because he had suggestions with the call, not strong, and he wrote a letter somewhere, he had some suggestions on the call. They were pretty minor as I understand it, and they were maybe accepted, you have to check that out. But you know now, he goes, like, oh, he didn't agree with the call.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But he actually wrote, I think a letter, to the White House counsel with some suggestions for the call, people should get that letter. They're very minor.
<Dan Bongino> <Negative> Well, he should -- he should run for President if he has a disagreement with foreign policy. That's how the country works.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah. I'm sure he'd do very well, he'd do very well. He'd do about as well as Swalwell does, you know. Watch this guy Swalwell.
<Dan Bongino> <Negative> Yeah. I got more votes for President than Eric Swalwell.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah. He goes on all the time. He gets more airtime than anybody and he ends up with zero. And then, they put him right back on the network, even Fox puts him on, which is really a disgrace. But he goes right back on the networks and they start talking to him like he's a great expert, he got zero. That means he got no votes, that's almost impossible.
<Dan Bongino> <Positive> Yeah. Someone wrote me in once for President, Mr. President, so I got more votes than Swalwell.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll vote for you. I'll vote for you, although, almost. I tell you what, you would be in my book many, many, many people currently running. Thank you, any day.
<Dan Bongino> <Positive> Thank you. I'd like to just shift gears quickly and I don't want to monopolize your time here. But on the economy, your record's been outstanding. We've seen middle-income growth, the middle-class, in other words. For -- you know liberals are having a tough time with this, with their economic conspiracy theories.
<Dan Bongino> <Positive> Middle-class income growth has surged, far surpassed, Obama. The data's clear, GDP growth is far surpassed Obama. Obama, median middle income is up $5,000 in just three years of your presidency.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right.
<Dan Bongino> <Negative> It was only up $1,000 after eight years of Obama and the failed recovery. So, my question is this, given 2020 is right around the corner, is there another tax cut in the offing or are we looking at that and where do you stand on capital gains indexing? I know there's been some back and forth on that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If we get back the House, we're going to do a very big middle -- we've already done one, a very big -- we did pass the largest tax cut in the history of the country, bigger than Ronald Reagan's tax cut. But if we get back the House, we have to have the house, otherwise, you can't get anything through Pelosi.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> For one thing, she doesn't work, she doesn't do anything. She can't even get the USMCA bill passed, OK? And every Democrat wants it, the Democrats, the Republicans, it's on her desk for three months, and she hasn't done anything on it. She can't get that -- she's too interested in impeachment. Although, she looks very bad right now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was going to say before, she was very angry when she read my phone call. She was given false information when she started this whole impeachment thing and she is not happy about it right now because she's getting hammered. The economy is doing phenomenally well. We're going to and that's despite the fact that we have a Federal Reserve.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Don't forget that has interest rates that are too high and Obama had zero interest rates. So, we're much higher. He was at $975 for eight years. We're at $5,000 but when you add the tax benefit, it's $2,500, and then, you add the regulation benefit because I've gotten rid of more regulations than any President in history by far.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Even if they were there for eight years or in one case more, now we've got more than any other President. When you add that that's another $2,000 now. So, what -- we're actually around $10,000, as opposed to $975 and our $10,000 is for two and a half years, a little more than two and a half years. That's a big difference.
<Dan Bongino> <Negative> That's a huge difference.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And for President Bush that was $400 for eight years.
<Dan Bongino> <Negative> Is there any chance of resurrecting the indexing capital gains, the inflation tax?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, a lot of people like indexing and it's a short-term boost, but it makes life very, very complicated for people. You have to go out and get appraisers every time you do something, every time you bring -- you know, a lot of people do like it. A lot of Republicans like it. It is a complex process for people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's very difficult. It's something we're looking at. It's a tremendous initial boost. I mean, I could do, I could do something it would be pretty amazing. But I want to do, I want to do the right thing. We are looking at it as a possibility. It has its tremendous assets and it's got some liabilities, Dan.
<Dan Bongino> <Negative> Understood. Mr. President, you eliminated the disastrous individual mandate for Obamacare which was excellent.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Dan Bongino> <Negative> Any talk after 2020 if there is, hopefully, a successful re-elect, of eliminating the other provisions of Obamacare, community rating, guaranteed issue, maybe replacing them of more market-friendly solutions, health savings accounts, income support for low-income folks. There's still, unfortunately, some remnants of Obamacare left in the [Inaudible] the market.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, what we've done by getting rid of the individual mandate, that's what you pay not to have insurance. I mean, you pay a lot of money for the privilege of not having to overpay for insurance.
<Dan Bongino> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a very -- it was the worst provision in Obamacare. It was totally unconstitutional but it escaped that, you know, it escaped it. And one of those things, but we got rid of the most important aspect of Obamacare, and frankly, if John McCain had raised his hand, Obamacare would be gone. What we have done in that very famous vote, after campaigning for eight years to get rid of Obamacare, remember, repeal and replace was his campaign.
<Dan Bongino> <Negative> Yeah. It was disappointing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then, when he finally had a chance to repeal and replace it, 2 o'clock in the morning, he says, thumbs down. But that's OK, it may work out just as well because we got rid of them. We got rid of the individual mandate which is such a big deal. It's a big -- it's really the essence of Obamacare. And then, we've done something -- I had a choice.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Run it really well and do that knowing that some of the benefit endures to Obama and that's the right thing to do or run it really badly, and have people go crazy about how bad Obamacare is. And Secretary Azar and Seema and all his people over there have done an unbelievable job of running it, and we've made it OK. We've made it acceptable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's horrible, by the way, but we've made it very acceptable. Sometimes you'll hear people say it's not bad. That's because of getting rid of the individual mandate. Somebody said call it Trump care, fix it up a little bit more and do it, but what we're going to do is -- because we've really done a good job of management of it. It's a disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But what we're going to do is if we get the House back, we are going to have a much better version of Obamacare that's cheaper, and you know, it's just a much better version, but also, much less expensive.
<Dan Bongino> <Positive> Mr. President, and obviously, I wish the best of health on everybody in our court system. You've successfully flipped the third circuit court with your last appointment.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. That's right.
<Dan Bongino> <Positive> You've done a great job appointing conservative judges. If there were another Supreme Court opening, and again, I don't mean this any kind of macabre type of way to come up and present itself. Will you stick to your original list? You've had success with Kavanaugh, Gorsuch, who really proved their worth so far, is that original list still apply?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, number one, I hope everyone's in great shape on the court. We want them all to live very long and powerful lives. You understand that because if I answered that question without putting that in, the fake news will just absolutely rip me.
<Dan Bongino> <Negative> That -- exactly, which is ridiculous.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You understand. I want everybody happy and healthy on the court, but yes, I will stick to the list, 100%.
<Dan Bongino> <Positive> OK. One final question, Mr. President. You have made a concerted push admirably so for the black vote, someplace -- a place the GOP is traditionally drastically and sadly underperform for decades. I believe you're making a lot of headway, we've seen down in Florida for instance, Governor DeSantis, who I know you supported, me as well, disclosure.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Dan Bongino> <Positive> He was a -- made a big push for school choice and did remarkably well amongst black female voters, who obviously, had an interest in this issue.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's great.
<Dan Bongino> <Positive> What else -- do you have anything else planned for any further initiatives to recruit the black vote and do some outreach into the community, we've traditionally done importantly with?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think I've done more for the African-American vote maybe than any other President in history. Criminal justice reform, that was me, nobody else. They couldn't get it. Obama couldn't get it. Bush couldn't get it, nobody could get it. And I got criminal justice reform and I have Conservatives and Liberals in that deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was very bipartisan and I got it done. Nobody could get it done. Nobody else would have been able to get it done. Dan, honestly, I mean that was not easy but we got criminal justice reform.
<Dan Bongino> <Positive> Even Van Jones celebrated you for that one. That was a shocker.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We had a lot of people celebrating that would not normally -- and then, two weeks later they say we must replace our President you know, etc. etc. But nevertheless, I had tremendous support on both sides and we had some dissension also, but tremendous support. And that was really -- it mostly affects the African-American community.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, they're the biggest beneficiaries and they're very happy about it. The other thing, we've done with Tim Scott and some others is opportunity zones. It's the hottest thing there is in real estate practically. It's incredible how well -- you're going to see that millions of dollars is being put into locations that would not be invested in at all, locations that were abandoned.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you'll see what's going on in Detroit and all over the country. We have thousands of opportunity zones. It's a big thing and a lot of money and a part of that is because the economy is so good. We have the best economy, probably, that we've ever had in history. So, if it's all about the economy stupid, you know, they call them that's -- you know, I guess that was a Clinton quote.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's all about the economy stupid.
<Dan Bongino> <Positive> Yeah, James Carville, right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because I guess I have to be winning because we have the best economy that we've ever had in the history of our country. And the other thing is, as you know, is unemployment numbers for Black, Hispanic, Asian, but the unemployment numbers for the African-Americans are the -- it's the best ever in history by far.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have the lowest unemployment in history. We have the best employment numbers in history for African-Americans. So, I don't know. When I'm on the debate stage and I rattle those three things off, I would say that you know, I just don't know how you get beaten. I think we're doing really well with African-Americans.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have tremendous support. Even Kanye West likes us and Jim Brown and so many people, Evander Holyfield and Herschel Walker, I mean, we have so many people and so many people that you don't know, so many people that -- you know the criminal justice reform, Dan, was a very big thing. I think it really -- people really -- it opened up their eyes like Alice Johnson.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She was in jail for 22 years for, she did something bad, but it was not that kind of -- I think she had another 20 years to serve and she's a phenomenal woman, and there are many people like that in prison right now. But she was in there for 22 years and for making a telephone call and drugs were involved.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know, it was really disproportionate. So, we have many people like that but it helps the African-American. As you know, it helps the African-American community far more so than any other community and the Hispanic community too, and getting criminal justice reform passed was a very big thing. So, I think people appreciate it.
<Dan Bongino> <Positive> Yeah. Mr. President, thank you so much for your time. It's really been an honor to have you here on the Dan Bongino show. I deeply appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know what, Dan? I just want to say, it's an honor to have you as a friend and somebody that sees --
<Dan Bongino> <Positive> Thanks.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's not even a question of a supporter. You tell right from wrong and you did it from the first day I met you, and you're an incredible voice, and I don't know if you're a lawyer or not. Are you a lawyer by the way?
<Dan Bongino> <Positive> No. I'm an MBA -- I was an MBA student.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK. Because whether you're a lawyer or not, you're better than any lawyer, OK? You're better -- you're more effective than lawyers. So, I want to congratulate you.
<Dan Bongino> <Positive> It's the street cop in me. Thank you, sir. God bless you. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're doing a fantastic job. Thank you very much, Dan. Thank you.
<Dan Bongino> <Positive> Thank you, sir. Take care.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Goodbye.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> We are coming to you live this morning from our nation's capital following my exclusive interview with President Trump. Here are your top stories 6:00am on the East Coast.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> The president lays out his economic plan, the commander-in-chief vowing to get tax reform done but not before tackling another top issue. The repeal and replace of Obamacare still on tap. [Begin Clip Video of Interview]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to do healthcare first to pick up additional money so that we get great tax reform. So we're going to have a phenomenal tax reform but I have to do healthcare first, I want to do it first to really do it right. [End Video Clip of Interview]
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> The battle for reform at home coming in a tension across the globe. Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson in Moscow this morning. It is the first official meeting between the countries following last week's U.S. missile strikes in Syria. I spoke with President Trump about his plans for Syria going forward. [Begin Video of Interview]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're not going into Syria. But when I see people using horrible, horrible chemical weapons which I agreed not to use under the Obama Administration but the violated it. [End Video Clip of Interview] [Note: Video breaks from Trump Interview at this point]
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Let's get straight to my exclusive interview with President Donald Trump. I asked America's first business president about his economic priorities for 2017 to kick off his first interview with the business network since taking office. Here's a bit of what he has to say on that. [Begin Video of Interview]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We are going to have tax reform at some point very soon. I think we're doing very well on healthcare. It's been very much misreported that we failed with healthcare. We haven't failed, we're negotiating and we continue to negotiate and we will save perhaps $900 billion.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you look at the kind of numbers that we're talking about, that's all going back into the taxes and we have to do healthcare first to pick up additional money so that we get great tax reform. So we're going to have a phenomenal tax reform but I have to do healthcare first, I want to do it first to really do it right and after that, we're going to start on tax reform and infrastructure.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> But do you have to do healthcare before tax reform?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> And when I speak with business managers they say tax reform is so much more impactful to moving the needle on economic growth. So why do you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're right. They're all right. But because I'm saving a tremendous amount, hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars we're saving on healthcare. So we're going to have a much better plan than Obamacare which is failing. Our tax reform is going to be tough but it won't be as tough as healthcare, healthcare is very, very difficult.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Have you moved off of this soft deadline that your team put in place of August to get this done? Are you looking at the later in the year?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I don't want to put deadlines. Healthcare is going to happen at some point. Now if it doesn't happen fast enough, I'll start the taxes but the tax reform and the tax cuts are better if I can do healthcare first.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> What about infrastructure? How do you see it? When do you see it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A hundred percent very soon. I see it as part perhaps of the healthcare plan because phase two of the healthcare plan in order to get the votes, I need 60 percent for that and if I put that in, the democrats are actually going to love the infrastructure plan. [End Video Clip of Interview] [Note: Video breaks from Trump Interview at this point]
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> I also asked the president about his accomplishments as we approached this 100 days in office. [Begin Video of Interview]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We've done an amazing job on regulations, we've freed it up. We've freed up this country so much, the minors, of energy, and the banking systems now coming to with Dodd-Frank which is a disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We've freed up so much and we're getting great, great credit for it. We have done so much for so many people, I don't think that there is a presidential period of time in the first 100 days where anyone's done nearly what we've been able to do and on top of it, we just had during the first 100 days a Supreme Court Justice approved, not just nominated but approved through a very, very hostile environment. [End Video Clip of Interview] [Note: Video breaks from Trump Interview at this point]
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> The president is also working to hire more staff for his own administration. He told me in an exclusive interview that opposition is slowing down that process, watch. [Begin Video of Interview]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am waiting right now for so many people.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> You're understaffed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hundreds and hundreds of people and then they'll say, "Why isn't Trump doing this faster?" You can't do it faster because they're obstructing. They're obstructionists, so I have people, hundreds of people that were trying to get through.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean you see the backlog, can't get them through. And then the newspapers will say Trump doesn't get them through. Well it's nothing to do with me, statutorily you have to go through this process. So it's been a lousy process, it's taking a long time to get my cabinet done and as you know, it's not even done now. This is record stuff, we're talking about records in terms of time and it's very sad. Well you see even again with the Supreme Court judge that everybody agrees is outstanding and you see what that process.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Absolutely. And the American people know it I think.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think they know it. I think they get it. I wish it would be explained better the obstruction is nature though because a lot of times I'll say, "Why didn't so and so have people under him or her?" The reason is because we can't get them approved.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Well people are still wondering though, they're scratching their heads why so many Obama Era staffers are still here. For example, was it a mistake not to ask Jim Comey to step down from the FBI at the outside of your presidency, is it too late now to ask him to step down?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, it's not too late. But I have confidence at him, we'll see what happens. It's going to be interesting but we have to just -- look, I have so many people that want to come in to this administration, they're so excited about this administration and what's happening.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Bankers, law enforcement, everybody wants to come into this administration. Don't forget, when Jim Comey out, he saved Hillary Clinton, people don't realize that. He saved her life because I call it "Comey won" and I joke about it a little bit. When he was reading those charges, she was guilty on every charge and then he said, "She was essentially okay." Director Comey --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Well that's why I'm asking, why is he still on the job?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I'm just saying -- well because I want to give everybody a good fair chance. Director Comey was very, very good to Hillary Clinton, that I can tell you. If he weren't, she would be right now going to trial.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Are you going to push that? Are you going to put --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to talk about that. I want to talk about positive.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> In the last weeks of the Obama presidency, he changed all the rules in terms of the intelligence agencies, allowing them to share raw data.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Terrible.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Why do you think he did this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I'm going to let you figure that one out but it's so obvious. When you look at Susan Rice and what's going on and so many people are coming up to me and apologizing now. They say, "You know, you were right when you said that." Perhaps I didn't know how right I was because nobody knew the extent of it. What they did --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> When you sent that infamous tweet, was that what you were referring to, the Susan Rice?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well sure. We're talking about surveillance, it was wiretapped. New York Times said the word wiretapped in the headline of the first edition then they took it out of there fast when they realized.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I put wiretapped in quotes meaning -- because, look, wiretapping is an old fashion, I don't think there's too many wires anymore and you don't have a lot of wires. Look at this room, this room used to have a lot of wires, now it doesn't have so many wires. But we talked about surveillance or whatever and you look at the extent of the surveillance. Me and so many other people, it's terrible.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> She said she didn't do it for political reasons. Susan Rice told that herself.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Does anybody really believe that? Nobody believes that. Even the people that tried to protect her in the news media, it's such a big story and I'm sure it will continue forward but what they did is horrible. [End Video Clip of Interview] [Note: Video breaks from Trump Interview at this point]
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> The president lays out his economic plan -- the commander-in-chief vowing to get tax reform done this year but not before tackling another top issue which continues to be negotiated -- the battle to replace Obamacare. [Begin Video of Interview]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's been very much misreported that we failed with health care. We haven't failed. We're negotiating.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we're continuing to negotiate. And we will save perhaps $900 billion. You know, if you look at -- if you look at the kind of numbers that we're talking about, that's all going back into the taxes. And we have to do health care first to pick up additional money so that we get great tax reform. [End Video Clip of Interview] [Note: Video breaks from Trump Interview at this point]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to have tax reform at some point very soon. I think we're doing very well on health care. It's been very much misreported that we failed with health care. We haven't failed, we are negotiating. And we continue to negotiate and we will save perhaps $900 billion.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, if you look at the kind of numbers that we are talking about, that's all going back into the taxes. And we have to do health care first to pick up additional money so that we get great tax reform.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we are going to have a phenomenal tax reform but I have to do health care first. I want to do it first to really do it right. Health care has been going along -- you know, it's in negotiations.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it's just a negotiation and it's going to take a little while longer but as you probably hear in Congress, it's coming along. We have some great people at Congress. They want it to happen. We will have no Democrats, zero; that means we have to get close to 100 percent of the Republicans -- not an easy way to run a government.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You saw that with Justice Gorsuch which is -- we are very proud of but he had almost no Democrat support even though he was central casting like the perfect Supreme Court judge.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we will see what happens. I think we are doing very well with health care which surprises us like breaking news but they all know it. They just don't tend to write it. And after that we're going to start on tax reform and infrastructure.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> But do you have to do health care before tax reform?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> When I speak with business managers they say tax reform is so much more impactful to moving the needle on economic growth.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're all right but because I'm saving a tremendous amount, hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars we are saving on health care. So we are going to have a much better plan than Obamacare which is failing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Even now as I came in here they're saying payments have to be made that weren't scheduled to be made on Obamacare. If you don't make them, it fails. I mean, you know, it's just a mess. Obamacare is a total mess.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we are saving tremendous amounts of money on health care when we get this done, number one. And most importantly, actually we are going to have great health care and all of that saving goes into the tax. If you don't do that, you can't put any of the savings into the tax cuts and the tax reform.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> How do you know you're not going to have a similar battle on the tax reform because you have a border adjustment tax, the deductions? So who is to say that tax reform doesn't fail the way the bill -- the house bill?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think tax reform will be easier but it's going to be tough. You have a lot of people out there that -- you know, they have their own agendas including a lot of supporters of different people that are in Congress. They have their own agendas, they want certain things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Tax reform is going to be tough but it won't be as tough as health care, health care is very, very difficult. You look at that. Look at Hillary Clinton -- that failed. And you look at so many of the others.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Obamacare failed. Obamacare was just, you know, they just in the end just gave up just to get the vote. You look at what they had to do in Nebraska where they essentially gave it away for Nebraska to get that final vote.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> And we know the premium is up 116 percent in Arizona and across the country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Many, many of the -- and this is going to be a much worst year than last year for Obamacare. So Obamacare is a disaster. It's really gone, essentially it's gone. If Obamacare isn't bailed out almost on a monthly basis it fails, it immediately fails.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have a great health care plan that I think will happen and if it happens then I go immediately to tax reform and that will happen, that will be easier than health care.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> How are you on the border adjustment tax? Have you decided?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I haven't really we wanted to talk about it. I have my own feelings. I don't like the word "adjustment" because our country gets taken advantage of, to use a nice term, by every other country in the world. So when I hear border adjustment, "adjustment" means we lose, we lose. So, I don't like to turn border adjustment.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Any tax at the border?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let's call it an import tax. Let's call it a reciprocal tax. You know, we have --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> So it's in there? You want it in --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have countries, Maria, that charge us, our companies, 100 percent tax if they sell a motorcycle, or they sell -- they make it in America. They make it in the United States. They sell it to various countries. They sell very little because the tax is 100 percent in some countries. The tax is 50 percent, 30 percent, 40 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But if they make a motorcycle and they sell it back into the United States, they have no tax. Now do you think that's fair? Do you think that's smart? So I love the idea of reciprocal, you can call it reciprocal or a matching tax or a mirror tax. There are numerous terms.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But the reciprocal tax is very important. And you know the funny thing is that nobody gets angry when you say reciprocal tax. When you say we're going to charge you a border tax, we would be a rich nation if we did it, by the way, but you know.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> It sounds even reciprocal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But when you say reciprocal nobody fights you. When you say I'm going to charge 10 percent or 20 percent border tax everyone goes crazy because they like free trade. They don't say that the other countries are charging you much more than that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But when you say a reciprocal tax -- and I'm not saying that's what I'm doing -- but there has to be a certain reciprocal nature to it. But when you say reciprocal tax, nobody can get angry. Even the other countries if like they are charging you 50 percent tax, ok whatever they're charging, we are charging.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Like China and India.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They may not like it but they can't get angry because they can't win that battle.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> What if you have a debate, you can't get to an agreement on that, do you prefer just cutting taxes? If you had to do one, can you do just corporate tax cut?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Well, we can keep trade and we can keep certain things separate. We may put it in the tax bill or we may keep it separate. We have a lot of different things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don't forget, we are going to be bringing back as part of this -- I think the number is closer to $5 trillion. You know, you've been hearing you've been using -- you keep using $2.5 trillion, right. But the money, the corporate inversions, and the money over there is $2.5 trillion. So I think that money -- because we have been saying that number for what five years now, would you say. So I know it's much more. It's probably $5 trillion or $4 trillion -- that money is coming back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to charge a very small tax on that money and the companies are going to bring that money back into the United States and do lots of good things with it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right now they can't bring it back. It's not only the high tax. It's also because the bureaucracy is so horrible. I have friends that want to bring money back even if they were willing to pay the tax which very few people are willing. The bureaucracy, the paperwork, the work to get it in, it's not worth it.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> -- which is why you're rolling back -- through your executive orders, you're rolling back regulations. So if you have to do one -- corporate tax or individual tax. What's more important if you had to do one this year?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Both, both.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Both.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I almost think individual from my standpoint because, you know, the middle class has just been taken advantage of in this country for so many years. But in terms of jobs, I mean I think both, but I think probably corporate but they're going to both go hand in hand. It's not going to matter.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Have you moved off of this soft deadline that your team put in place of August to get this done? Are you looking at later in the year?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, I put a deadline on health care. And the fake news immediately went crazy because when I didn't make the deadline although --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> That you set.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- I was just -- don't forget I said withdraw. I didn't even say take a vote. I said withdraw. Well, that same thing is being negotiated and great points are being won and lost but great points are being won that are going to lower premiums and make our health care incredible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But by putting a deadline, they say oh, Trump didn't make it. He didn't make it. Look, I don't want to put deadlines. Health care is going to happen at some point. Now, if it doesn't happen fast enough, I will start the taxes. But the tax reform and the tax cuts are better if I can do health care first.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> What about infrastructure? How do you see it? When do you see it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> 100 percent -- very soon. I see it as part perhaps of the health care plan because phase two of the health care plan in order to get the votes I need 60 percent for that. And if I put that in the Democrats are actually going to love the infrastructure plans. So we are going to actually -- I believe despite their tremendous hostility for years, this isn't just for Trump, this is for years, it's been so hostile.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, Maria, when I used to come to Washington because I've been a very political person all of my life even though not on the side of the equation. But I've been very, very political.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I used to see Democrats and Republicans, they were best friends. And they'd fight a little bit during the day and then they'd have dinners with their families at night. You'd see them at restaurants. I used to joke with the business and you know, Republicans --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> They would have coffee together.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, they'd be together. Have breakfast together. Then they go and fight and then they have lunch. Today you don't see that. The level of hatred is incredible. And I'm not just saying in the last 90 days. I'm saying this has been for the last few years. It's incredibly divisive.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Has it gotten in the way of getting things done?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, as an example on health care I won't get one Democrat vote even though many of them think it's an incredible plan. Take a look at Justice Gorsuch. You can't get better, top of the line in every aspect, and he got three votes from the Democrats. He should have gotten all of them, he got three votes. And those three people, you know, are to be respected for doing it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But there's a great level of hostility and they are putting their hatred way, way above -- way above the country and the benefit to the country that, you know, things that they do can have such benefit.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I probably -- I always assume no Democrat votes. Now, the good thing is we have the House, we have the Senate and we have the White House. So we are all set. But within there you have certain factions. You have the conservative Republicans. You have the moderate Republicans. You know, you have to get them together. But we need close to 100 percent. That's a pretty hard thing to get but we get it. [Note: Video breaks from Trump Interview at this point]
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Welcome back. A new administration in the White House bringing new life to Wall Street. In his first exclusive business interview since the election, President Trump spoke to me about the positive changes to markets since the start of his term. Listen. [Begin Video of Interview]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When you look at all that we've done from the standpoint of business, look at -- look at the optimism, look at manufacturing, 93 percent -- the highest it's ever been, the optimism of manufacturers.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Sentiment has changed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have never ever had the optimism that we have now over the last 90 days or since the Trump election. And you see the stock market. We picked up $3 trillion in value. [End Video Clip of Interview]
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Attorney General Jeff Sessions ushering in a new era of immigration enforcement on his visit to the southern border. Vowing to crackdown on cartels and gangs. This as President Trump brushes off concerns that he won't build the wall to secure the border in my exclusive sit-down interview. [Begin Video of Interview]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm going to build the wall 100 percent. In fact, we had hundreds of bidders. We have many, many designs. I've seen 10 of the top but I want to see more. We're looking at designs and we're going to be making a decision very shortly. [End Video Clip of Interview] [Note: Video breaks from Trump Interview at this point]
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Judge, when I spoke with President Trump, he said that that the border wall has many bidders. Watch this. [Begin Video of Interview]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Somebody said, Donald Trump is not going to build the wall. I'm going to build the wall 100 percent. In fact, we have hundreds of bidders. We have many, many designs. I've seen 10 of the top. But I want to see more. And what I'm doing is I said to our very great secretary, who were doing a great job, General Kelly. Because you see the numbers where they're down 68 percent. And nobody has ever seen numbers. It's like on a record. IN fact, people aren't even trying to get through anymore because they know they can.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> It's incredible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's incredible what's happened. But on the wall, we're looking at designs and we'll be making a decision very shortly. [End Video Clip of Interview] [Note: Video breaks from Trump Interview at this point] [Begin Video of Interview]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Just you understand, we're not going into Syria because, you know, there were questions, Nikki Haley is doing a great job, Rex is doing a fantastic job, our Secretary of State, General McMaster fantastic. But if you add it all up and if they every little word, they'll say, oh, they're different. Just so you understand, we are not going into Syria, but when I see people using horrible, horrible chemical weapons which they agreed not to use under the Obama Administration but they violated it.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> They said they got rid of them.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What I did should have been done by the Obama Administration a long time before I did it and you would have had much better -- I think Syria would be a lot better off right now than it has been.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Obama pushed -- he resisted doing it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What I look, he -- well, he didn't do it. I don't know what happened but he didn't do it. And in fact, they had a big attack right after he drew the red line and they say they had a very big attack and everybody waited what's going on and nothing happened. And even the Obama people admitted he was wrong for not doing it. I will tell you that when I looked at the pictures on any show or any newspaper but especially when you see them on television and you see these beautiful kids that are dead in their father's arms or you see kids gasping for life, you know, there -- it's over for them, they're hosing them down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hundreds of them. When you see that, I immediately called General Mattis, I said what can we do? And they came back with a number of alternatives and we hit them very hard. Now, are we going to get involved with Syria? No. But if I see them using gas and using things that -- I mean even some of the worse tyrants in the world didn't use the kind of gasses that they used and some of the gasses are unbelievably potent. So, when I saw that I said we have to do something.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You should have peace in Syria, it's enough. And frankly, you know we talked the chemicals because, you know, people just don't see this, the level of brutality, the level of viciousness but when they dropped barrel bombs and bombs of any kind right on top of the civilian population, that's the worst thing, I've never seen anything like it and frankly, Putin is backing a person that's truly an evil person and I think it is very bad for Russia, I think it's very bad for mankind. It's very bad for this world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But when you drop gas or bombs or barrel bombs, have these massive barrels with dynamite and they drop them right in the middle of a group of people, I mean, in all fairness you see the same kids no arms, no legs, no face. This is an animal. And I really think that there's going to be a lot of pressure on Russia to make sure that peace happens because frankly if Russia didn't go and back this animal, you wouldn't have a problem right now. He was going to be overthrown.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought he was gone. He had another week. I mean, he was finished, he had nothing. Nothing. And then Russia came in and saved him and then Obama made one of the worst deals in history with the Iran deal, so you really have Iran and you have Russia and you have Assad.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> You redirected Navy ships to go toward the Korean Peninsula. What are you doing right now in terms of North Korea?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You never know, do you? You never know.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> That's all you're going to say?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I don't talk about the military. I'm not like Obama where they talk about in four months we're waiting, we're going to hit Mosul, and in the meantime, they get ready and like you never, so look, they're still fighting. Mosul is supposed to last for week, and now, they have been fighting it for many months and so many more people died.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to talk about it. We are sending an armada. Very powerful. We have submarines, very powerful, far more powerful than the aircraft carrier that I can tell you. And we have the best military people on earth and I will say this. He is doing the wrong thing, he's making a big mistake.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Do you think he is mentally fit?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know. I don't know him, but he is doing the wrong thing, I have very, very good meeting with President Xi of China. Really liked him, we had a great chemistry I think, I mean, at least I had great -- maybe he didn't like me but I think he liked me. We were going to have a 10 or 15-minute sit-down that lasted for three hours. Then, the next day, it was another schedule because everything is very orderly, with the Chinese, frankly, and we had meetings scheduled -- well, the 15 minutes on the first day lasted for three hours.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The 15 minutes on the second day lasted for two hours, just one-on-one, the two of us with interpreters. And -- I mean, we understand each other, I think he is, you know, a person that I got along with really well, we had good chemistry.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Did he give you any suggestion that he would help with North Korea?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We had a --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Did you get into trade and currency?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> First thing I brought up was North Korea, I said, you got to help with North Korea because we can't allow it and it's no good for you. And you have a tremendous power because of trade. Now he then explains thousands of years of history with Korea. Not that easy in other words, not as simple as people would think. They've tremendous conflict with Korea over the years. Now, his father was in China four times, he was never in China.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I said, look, you have a tremendous power because of trading through the border. They don't get food, they don't get, you know, they can't sell their coal, in fact, I hear today two massive coal ships from North Korea, we sent back to North Korea heading to China. They were sent back which is a very good sign. But I think China can help us, I hope China can help us, we talked about trade, and I can tell you China will do much better on trade if they help us with North Korea.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> And you think he knows that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think he knows that I told him that, yes.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> When you were with the president of China, you're launching these military strikes, was that planned? How did that come about that it's happening right then because right there you're saying, a reminder, here is who superpower in the world is.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have no idea how many people want to hear the answer to this. I have had -- I have watched speculation for three days now on what at a that was like --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> When did he tell you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'll tell you.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Before dessert or --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will tell you. Only because you treated me so good for so long I have to tell you, right? I was sitting at the table, we had finished dinner, we're now having dessert and we had the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you've ever seen and President Xi was enjoying it, and I was given the message from the generals that the ships are locked and loaded, what do you do? And we made a determination to do it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So the missiles were on the way and I said, Mr. President, let me explain something to you. This is your dessert. We just fired 59 missiles all of which hit, by the way, unbelievable from, you know, hundreds of miles away, all of which had --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Unmanned.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So incredible, it's brilliant, it's genius. Our technology, our equipment is better than anybody by a factor of five. I mean, what we have in terms of technology, nobody can even come close to competing. Now we're going to start getting it because, you know, the military has been cut back and depleted so badly by the past administration and by the war in Iraq which was another disaster. So what happens is I said, we just launched 59 missiles heading to Iraq.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Headed to Syria.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. Yes, heading toward Syria. And I want you to know that. Because I didn't want him to go home, we're almost finished, it was a full day in Palm Beach. We're almost finished and what does he do? Finishes dessert and go home and then they say, you know, the guy you just had dinner with just attacked --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> How did he react?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So he paused for 10 seconds. And then he asked the interpreter to please say it again, I didn't think that was a good sign. And he said to me, anybody that uses gasses, you could almost say or anything else but anybody that was so brutal and uses gasses to do that to young children and babies, it's OK.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> He agreed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was OK with it. He was OK. But we got along, there was a great feeling I think between both of us. Now, we have two very different countries, two very different peoples, but I think he understood the message and I understood what he was saying to me. [End Video Clip of Interview] [Note: Video breaks from Trump Interview at this point] [Begin Video of Interview]
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> The Syria strike, has it damaged our relationship with Russia?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That I don't know. I can't tell you. But I can tell you that I think aligning yourself with Assad is a big mistake because he's a butcher and I think it's very bad for Russia and I think they ought to get peace fast. [End Video Clip of Interview]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Begin Clip Video of Interview] We have thousands of jobs all across the country. Look at what is going on in Michigan with the expansion of the plants by Ford, by General Motors. Yesterday, Toyota announced that they're going to spend 1.3 to 1.9 billion dollars in Kentucky and different things. I mean, the car industry is not going to leave us anymore, believe me. The car industry is staying in our country. They weren't leaving.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I didn't win this election, you would have lost your car industry to Mexico and to other countries. They are not leaving anymore, believe me. There is retribution at their lead. There was no retribution, they lead it. Sold that cars in that fired all our people. Now, there's retribution and they understand that. Now at the same time, I am going to treat them great, but we want them to expand their plants and build new plants, and that is what they are doing. [End Video Clip of Interview]
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> That was from my exclusive interview with President Trump yesterday talking about his impact on the auto industry.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Will he or won't he? Donald Trump says he could run as an independent. The question is: is he serious? I'll ask him tonight. And what about that pizza summit with Sarah Palin? What are they talking about? And I'll ask him about Anthony Weiner and that TwitPic. What does Donald Trump think of it?
<Anthony Weiner> <Positive> Somebody got access to my account. That's bad. They sent a picture that makes fun of the name Weiner. I get it -- you know, touche. [End Clip]
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Also tonight, the case everyone's talking about. The Casey Anthony trial. A mother charged with an unimaginable crime: murdering her own 2-year-old.
<Unidentified Male> <Negative> She told me that she had not seen Caylee in 31 days. [End Clip]
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Who is lying? Who's telling the truth? And what really happened to Caylee? I'll ask two people who know this case better than almost anybody else: Nancy Grace and Dan Abrams. Also tonight, politician, journalist and the host of one of America's most outrageous TV shows, Jerry Springer talking frankly about politics, about fame, about celebrity, and about scandal.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> This -- live from Hollywood -- is Piers Morgan Tonight. Good evening. How does the phrase President Donald Trump sound? I suspect it sounds pretty good -- especially if you're Donald Trump . His pizza summit with Sarah Palin is putting his political aspirations firmly back in the spotlight. Now, the big question is, will he run for president or not?
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Donald Trump joins me now on the phone. Donald, how are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hello, Piers.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> So, tell me about pizza gate with Sarah Palin. What was going on there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she's a wonderful woman who I've gotten to know over the years. She called and said she was in New Jersey doing her bus tour that I've been seeing and reading about. And she said, let's get together. And she came up to the apartment. And we then went with our families to a pizza place. She said, let's have some pizza. And we did. I guess the press saw that and went a little bit crazy.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Well, look, you two are the biggest box office stars in the whole race for the White House. Neither of you have declared your intentions. What I couldn't work out is -- this is no accident -- I couldn't work out whether I should be leading in my head towards Sarah Palin trying to persuade you to run or you trying to persuade her to run.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well --
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Which was it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was a very interesting evening. I actually asked her, I said, You know But she's certainly got a following. And people like her. And I like her. And she's really a woman that loves this country beyond everything. And she did mention to me that, you know, since -- and there's a whole vast array of reasons. But since I got out, nobody's bringing up some of the most important issues that I was hitting on hard.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And as you know, the day before I got out, they came out with a poll that showed I was leading the race in terms of the poll. But I sort of had some other things going along. And frankly, I was very, very disappointed with the Republicans, between what they did with lame duck -- the lame duck session was ridiculous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They really -- I mean, Obama really made a comeback because of the Republicans. They brought $38 billion down to $30 million in cuts, and Paul Ryan's plan is absolutely outrageous in terms of not only what it represents, because, number one, it doesn't really balance the budget, but the timing of it, for him to just go and sit down and -- in that very new and powerful seat and come out with this plan that's going to, in my opinion, cause the Republicans to have a total catastrophic election. They were going to win tremendous, tremendous numbers of seats.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And now I think they have a good chance of losing tremendous numbers of seats. So -- [Crosstalk]
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> I mean, what is very interesting, Donald, about this, is that today we've seen this big falloff from the Dow.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sure.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> The economy appears to be tanking again. People are talking openly about a fall into another Great Depression.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> It seems to me that this is a pretty serious time for America.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's a serious time. And it's a very, very scary time in terms of the economics. And I'm somebody that's very good at that. And, you know, I was talking very strongly about that. But I was talking about it from the Republican perspective, and when I was looking at the moves, whether it was the lame duck or the $38 billion, or, frankly, Paul Ryan's timing. Not even so much the plan. The plan I think is terrible, but the timing of this plan. Why did he have to do any plan? Let Obama come out with a plan. And then criticize it or make it happen in terms of the way you want it. But for him to come out with this plan was just --
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Can I ask you a couple of quick -- let me ask you a couple of quick questions, here, Donald, because everyone wants to know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Would you ever consider running as a running mate to Sarah Palin? Is that something you would ever consider?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't see that happening from either of our standpoints actually. And, you know, again, I'm looking at what's going to happen. And I have very much my eye open. You know, I told you about these three events and there were other events that I've seen from the Republicans. And then on top of that, as you know very well -- I mean, you're the all-time expert on Celebrity Apprentice But I very much have an eye on -- if they pick the wrong candidate and they very well might do it, I have my eyes wide open.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> And that would seem to me, Donald, to be saying quite clearly that if you don't like what the Republicans do in terms of their nominee, you might be very seriously tempted to stand and run as an independent.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And to add to that, I think the answer would be yes and also I'd have to see the economy doing very poorly, which it has a very good chance of doing. If the economy is doing poorly, and if the Republicans pick a stiff -- and they very well might -- I would absolutely have my eye open. Not that I want to do it because I love what I'm doing. I do it really well. And I love what I'm doing. But if those two circumstances happen, I have my eye very wide open.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Now, let me turn to the other big story, which is this extraordinary tale of Anthony Weiner and Weiner-gate. The last time I had him on my show was in a fairly lively debate with you actually. What do you make of this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I was a little surprised by that debate, because, all of a sudden, he comes out of nowhere and starts going crazy. And, you know, I've known him over the years. And I learned a lot about him that night. I was absolutely shocked. I mean, he was -- I found -- to be almost unstable. And I watched this today because I was watching between pizza- gate and Anthony Weiner -gate. I found Anthony Weiner -gate to be a terrible situation. He obviously knows it's him. And the way he's handled it is either lying or incompetent. And either one is unacceptable. So, he's either incompetent or he's lying.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, it was him because otherwise he would have said, it wasn't me. You know, he's almost trying to say, I don't know it's me. Now, who would not know that's him? Who would not know a picture in that rather terrible position was or wasn't taken? I mean, you know those things. So, he's really -- I mean, his answers --
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> I want to get --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> His answers --
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> We're getting into difficult territory here, Donald. I mean, would you 100 percent recognize yourself in a similar image?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'd know if somebody had a picture of me, you know, in that position and wearing those clothes. And I'd say, you know, yes, that's me or it's not me. And he sort of indicating that it is him and it's a pretty bad picture.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let's not kid ourselves. Then, all of a sudden, that gets sent over to some young woman who's at this point saying, oh, gee, she was surprised to get it. I mean, I think he's handled it horribly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think he's made what could have been a small story into a very, very big story. And then, you know, he comes out with this whole crazy excuse that he really doesn't want to go much further. It was just a joke. I don't think that's just a joke. And I think it's pretty bad when a congressman gets hacked into.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Yes, I mean, he obviously gave a lengthy interview to Wolf Blitzer earlier, which when I was watching it, it seemed to raise more questions than it answered.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I watched a couple of those interviews. And I think they were total catastrophes for him. I think it really brings into question whether or not he can ever run for mayor of New York. And maybe whether or not he even keeps the position he's in right now. He's handled it very, very poorly.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Well, we've asked him to come on. Hopefully, he will, if he's watching this, open invitation. Let me move on very quickly, Donald, to one at story I think you've probably got an interest in, which is the Schwarzenegger scandal. You know the Schwarzeneggers well. What did you make of that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I was very surprised. I know them both very well. And I've always thought they were a relatively happy couple. I have used the word relatively because I've seen many so-called happy couples only to find out the following evening And, you know, I always thought that they had a very kind of a special relationship. And I was very surprised to see this happen. I think I was a little surprised at his choice. And I think that the whole thing is very sad actually.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> And, finally, Mitt Romney is apparently going to be announcing that he's running for the White House tomorrow. That is the informed wisdom. What's your reaction to that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know him at all. He seems not to resonate. And, you know, as you know, when I got out, and NBC made me an offer that at some point I couldn't refuse, knowing that I could always, you know, look over shoulders and see what happens. But when I got out, I was beating everybody, including him, in the polls. And it was sort of an interesting thing. He doesn't seem to resonate. He's been running for four years. He's been running really for six years and longer. And you would think he'd be doing a lot better in the polls than he's doing right now.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> If he emerges, Donald, final, if he emerges as the Republican choice, as their nominee, would that make you more or less tempted to run as an independent?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'd have to see how he emerges. I'd have to see how it's working out. And I'd have to hear some of his opinions on very big issues.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Like the fact that many, many countries, including China, South Korea, and others, are just ripping this country apart, OPEC. Even with the big, you know, downdraft today, oil is so high. And in my opinion, this downdraft, you know, they don't talk about it, but it's caused also by OPEC and the high oil prices.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We cannot continue to pay prices in the hundreds for a barrel of oil. We can't do it. So I really think a lot of it has to do with oil. And if you remember, the last time we had the big -- the big crash, oil was up to $148 and $150 a barrel. But we're getting up there. And the same thing is happening. So, don't underestimate the power of oil.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Donald Trump , as always, provocative -- thank you very much indeed for joining me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Piers.
