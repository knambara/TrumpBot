<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Tonight, Donald Trump , no holds barred. What does he think about this? What do you think of Donald Trump banging on about this every day at the moment?
<Maya Soetoro-Ng> <Negative> Well, I think it's a shame. I think that my brother should definitely be president for a second term. [End Clip]
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Everybody is talking about him and tonight I want to give Donald Trump the chance to respond. And speaking of no holds barred, we've also got Whoopi Goldberg.
<Whoopii Goldberg> <Negative> I don't generally talk about the trapeze in my room but that's a whole other thing. [End Clip]
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Oscar winner, comedian, talk show host, Broadway producer, most importantly, never short of a word or two. You've become really quite squeaky clean, haven't you?
<Whoopi Goldberg> <Negative> Well, I still smoke cigarettes. And I don't have a boyfriend. [End Clip]
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Tonight one on one with Whoopi Goldberg. This is Piers Morgan Tonight. Donald Trump has been a harsh critic of President Obama and perhaps not coincidentally is tied for the lead in the crowded field of Republican presidential contenders.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Donald Trump joins me on the phone now. Donald, you must be hating this, you're the center of attention.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I really find it to be interesting, because as you know I've done a great job as a businessman but I'm not a politician, and maybe that's what's resonating with people. I don't know. But I was happy to see your CNN poll. And frankly there are other polls that are coming out even more so. So I'm very honored by it, Piers.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> I mean it's interesting. I mean I've been following this for a few months now, your slow progression in the -- in the poll ratings. Do you get a sense that Washington, D.C. hasn't really taken you seriously? And do you think we're now at the tipping point where they have to?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I always felt that the people took me seriously. And very seriously. And if I'd make a speech or if I'd do a show, I could see that it was really -- it was really hitting home. And whether I talk about China, whether I talk about OPEC and how they're just absolutely ripping us like nobody's ever ripped us before, how they're -- in the case of China and so many other countries, how they are just taking our jobs, taking our money, making our product, manipulating their currency so it makes it almost impossible for our companies to compete. When I say these things, people really get it. You know, the public is very smart. And they do get it.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> People have been saying in the last few days as these ratings have come out showing you, you know, basically the equal front-runner at the moment of the Republicans with Mike Huckabee. They've been saying, ah, yes, but when Donald Trump gets properly scrutinized, when people will rake over, you know, his personal life, over his finances, then it will all come unstuck. What's your answer to that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, I've been very public for many years. And again, I'm not a professional politician. I don't do this for a living. I understand politics. I've dealt with politicians all of my life. But dealt with foreign countries all my life. I've made a lot of money with China as an example. And I understand China. I understand the whole mentality. And I understand what they're doing and how they're doing it to us. And I know how -- I know the solution, perhaps more importantly.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> And some -- if you do not get the Republican nomination, you have flirted with the idea of possibly running as an independent. Is that a serious option for you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't like the concept because they've done polls and I get huge numbers as an independent and I'm a very conservative Republican. So unlike other people that would be, let's say, much more liberal in terms of a tag, where you take votes away from Obama. I would be taking votes away from the Republican candidate and I don't want to do that.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> So it's something I really don't want to do. And, you know, the problem is, I get very, very high independent votes. In fact, CNN did a poll where my numbers are even better than they are in the Republican primary as independent. I think you saw that, Piers, where I'm substantially in the lead by many, many points. Who would you see as potentially your main rivals in the current field?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Everybody. Everybody. They're all rivals. Everybody. And I really like some of them. Some of them I know. I really like some of them. And it's always a little bit difficult for me to go against people that I like because I can't be the real Donald Trump . It's a little bit difficult. And I will say this, I actually think, and I said it before, that I actually think it's tougher to win the Republican primary than it is to beat Obama. At least for me.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> I want to come now to probably the most contentious issue that involves you at the moment. This whole thing about President Obama, where he was born. The birther scandal as it's now been dubbed. I want to play you a clip from my interview with the president's sister which was quite contentious when it came to your involvement in this. Does this whole, I think, ridiculous debate about whether he was born in America -- what do you think of that?
<Maya Soetero-Ng> <Negative> I think it's unfortunate. He was born in Hawaii. There is a tremendous amount of proof that has already been presented. The then Republican governor and head of the Department of, you know, Health in Hawaii even attested to the fact that the birth certificate that they inspected was, in fact, valid.
<Maya Soetero-Ng> <Positive> It's in the newspaper. It's on the day of his birth. So I think that it is time for people to put that to bed, put it to rest completely.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> What do you think of Donald Trump banging on about this every day at the moment?
<Maya Soetero-Ng> <Negative> Well, I think it's a shame. And I think that my brother should definitely be president for a second term. And that's really all I have to say about it. [End Clip]
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> I mean, Donald, I'll put my cards on the table here. I kind of think you run a pretty -- as far up this flag pole as you can. I mean, doesn't there come a point where you have to accept that nothing else is going to emerge on this story and you have to let it go?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think you're totally wrong. And I was surprised at your statement that frankly you don't agree with it. Because you're supposed to be a great reporter. And if I were a reporter, I'd be all over this. I think that his sister's lovely. I have to tell you. I watched the interview last night. I thought she was a beautiful woman with a beautiful voice. And I just thought she was a lovely person. And I watched it. I thought it was an excellent interview. And I'm sure he's very proud of her. The fact is, he doesn't show his birth certificate. He shows a certificate of live birth which is a much lower standard. He's not showing his birth certificate.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Donald, let me ask you -- let me ask you directly here, because I don't agree with you on this issue and I have huge respect for you, as you know. But on this issue, do you actually believe that President Obama wasn't born in Hawaii? Do you personally believe that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think there's a substantial chance. And I will tell you, when I first started on this about a month and a half ago, I had heard this issue for years. By the way, 70 percent of the Republican Party thinks that maybe -- in fact, it's actually higher, could be 75 percent, that maybe, maybe, he wasn't, and about 30 percent think that he was not born here.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Finally, Donald, I mean, today President Obama came out with this huge new fiscal plan involving cutting trillions of dollars off the deficit. What was your take on it when you read the detail?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, think it's terrible for a lot of reasons. Including the fact that you're talking about big tax increases. You're talking about the interest deduction on real estate and people's homes, where they're losing a big chunk of it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What's that going to do to the home market, which is devastated already? And, you know, when it goes good there's nothing that creates more jobs like the home market with the real estate. And you're taking away a big chunk of the deduction. The automatic trigger is brutal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And charitable giving is going to be hurt very badly because you're taking away the incentives at least from a financial standpoint to do charitable giving. So there are a lot of negatives. And also, the number -- with all of that said, the number is so small that it won't make enough of a dent in the deficit.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Well, Donald Trump , I certainly think it would be most entertaining at the very least if you entered this campaign. And I think a lot of people are waiting with bated breath. And they're watching your poll numbers going up all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I would imagine, as you have said, there is mounting fascination at the White House as to whether you will run or not. So thank you for joining me tonight. And we'll watch this race. Thank you very much, Piers.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> China putting on a big show as world leaders gather for an economic summit. But not everyone is celebrating President Obama's trip to China. Donald Trump joins us. Good evening, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Good evening.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, you have been going after China forever. What do you make of the president's trip to China?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I'm more and more right, Greta. Look what's going on. They are putting on a big show because they want to keep the money coming in. We are the ones that paid for that show. They are taking our jobs. You understand that. When it comes to Iraq, where are they to help us? When it comes to ISIS, where are they to help us? They are the biggest beneficiary of Iraqi oil and oil reserves, and they're not there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> When it comes to Ebola, where are they to help us with West Africa? It's ridiculous. They manipulate their currency. They make it impossible for our businesses to compete through manipulation. I mean, we do better product than they do, but through manipulation, it's a -- it's disgraceful I think that he is going there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He should go there, not do the celebrations, have a really strong talk with these folks because what they are doing to us is very, very bad. They are truly hurting our economy and our jobs.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What do you expect the president to do? This is sort of a routine economic summit. This is his second trip China as president. What would you expect him to do?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I wouldn't have gone. I frankly wouldn't have gone because the negotiating abilities that our country has versus China are a joke. It's like some school football team playing New England Patriots. It is an absolute travesty. And I frankly think he would have been better off staying home, let them come to him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, just so you understand, we have literally rebuilt China. The money they have taken out from us. And they are doing a pretty good job, and European countries, also by the way. But the money they have taken out and drained out of this country -- we have literally rebuilt China. And we do have -- it's hard to believe and a lot of people don't believe this, but we have the upper hand.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have the negotiating power. Because if we ever did anything to that and to that ability that we have given them, to drain us, China would have a problem like they have never had before. So, we have all the power. He shouldn't be over there celebrating the fact that they're ripping us off. That's the only thing can he celebrate, the fact that they have ripped off the United States and many other countries.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Let me turn to midterms, what is your reflection on midterm results?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it was a fantastic win for the Republicans because they are tired of Obama. They are tired of incompetence. They are tired of -- people are tired of billion-dollar websites that, by the way, it was announced today that it's not working again. And it never will work with the, you know, clowns that they have running it right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And the whole Obamacare is not working. I mean, they're in a much bigger position, the whole Obamacare is not working. It's a disaster. It's very, very expensive. People indeed have lost their doctors. They have lost their plans, they have deductibles that are so high -- I mean, unless something is totally catastrophic, they will never be able to get anything out of it. The deductibles have doubled, tripled and quadrupled.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So you're never going to see anything out of it. And yet, the cost of it is much higher than they were paying two years ago. So it is really -- although I must say very good for the insurance companies because I notice their stock keeps going up, up, up. So the insurance companies, I guess, in some very complex form must love Obamacare.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, you got involved in some midterm races. Your candidates that you have campaigned for, how did they fair?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I was asked to do robo-calls, which is a pretty powerful thing. I was asked to do them for a lot of different people, David Perdue and Steve King and Lee Zeldin and you know, a number of people asked me to do robos. And I did them and they all won their races. Some of them were substantially behind and they ended up winning easily.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So maybe it had an effect. They seemed to think it had a huge effect. I did it about two or three days before the election. So I think it does. I have a lot of people that follow me because they don't like to see our country getting ripped by virtually everybody. You look at as an example, Mexico, they -- they are draining us. You know, people don't have no idea how well Mexico does against the United States in terms of economics.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And yet, we have Sergeant Tahmooressi and it takes 210 days to get him out of a prison and he has got obviously some difficulty. So it's a very sad situation.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, I should probably tell the viewers I got a phone call last week and you very generously offered to give Sergeant Tahmooressi $25,000 to help defray costs for his treatment, for his legal fees. He depleted all his savings to try to defend himself and, you know, you are very generous, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I hope the lawyers don't take it all because I know lawyers better than most, they hear about the 25,000, they are going to grab onto it. So I hope you or his mother, I hope can protect. I really want this money to go to him, not his lawyers because I don't know what kind of a job the lawyers did. It took them a hell of a lot of time to get them out.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I felt very badly, I watched your interview. I thought it was an incredible interview. I felt very badly in watching him. He suffered greatly. I think that this $25,000 will be the beginning of getting somebody who is a good person back with his life and on to hopefully a much better life that he has had.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I said also a lot of other people volunteered therapy dogs and all sorts of different ways to help him. So you know, the American people, many of them are helping. Donald, as always, thank you, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thanks a lot, Greta.
