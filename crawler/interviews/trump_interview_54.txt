<Adam Sexton> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you so much for taking time with us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Adam.
<Adam Sexton> <Negative> One of the most consistent promises you made on the campaign trail back in 2015 and '16 was to resolve the opioid crisis --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Adam Sexton> <Positive> -- here in New Hampshire, and your administration, working with Congress, has provided quite a bit of aid and a lot of help --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Adam Sexton> <Negative> -- but the overdoses are still happening, the problem is still here. What more can you pledge to help this state?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it really is -- and it's something that's taken place in New Hampshire, almost more than in -- proportionately almost well, Ohio, New Hampshire. We have really worked hard on the opioid, as you know, tremendous lawsuits going in against the pharmaceutical companies, and we have it down 16, 17 percent which is tremendous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That doesn't satisfy anything, but we have it down. The other thing we're trying to do is a non-addictive painkiller, and we're working very hard on that with everybody. The order's out -- get a painkiller that's not so addictive. You know, people go to the hospital, they take like four days of opioids, and all of a sudden they're addicted.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we're working on that, but we're down 17 percent as of this moment. In fact the first lady is chairing a committee -- she's done an incredible job. She really feels very strongly about it. And then you have the other drug problem in New Hampshire, which are other kinds of drugs, and we're really stopping people now at the border.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're collecting tremendous amounts, and you're doing much bette,r but we have a lot of very good things coming.
<Adam Sexton> <Negative> Democrats here have been hammering you for two years on this issue over comments that came out in a transcript in which you allegedly referred to New Hampshire as a drug-infested den. Do you feel you owe the people of New Hampshire, who might be offended by that, an apology?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because this is what they tell me. I mean, they said we're drug-infested, sir. We're drug-infested. I don't mean that as a -- as a knock. I mean, it's a fact. Take a look at what happens. I mean, it's so many people. And for some reason, and I told you this once before, when I come up to New Hampshire, they always consider it their number one problem, and they call it -- the people -- people I love, that I know up here so well -- you kno,  I have a lot of friends in New Hampshire, and they say it's drug-infested.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> and we're really cleaning it out, and the police are doing a great job too.
<Adam Sexton> <Positive> Health care, obviously a big topic, and it involves the opioid crisis as well. A lot of the Democratic candidates running for president want to expand Medicare, either a little or quite a bit. What's the Trump plan for health care coming up?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, we have a great plan coming out. It's going to be -- if we can take back the House, because we're not going to get the Democrats to vote for it, because they're doing Medicare for All, which is going to take away your freedom, take away your doctors, take away everything that you should be able to have, and most importantly, it's going to take away -- we have 180 million people right now that have private insurance, and they love it, and all of that's going to be taken away.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's absolute craziness. It -- I mean, on top of everything else, they're looking at 80, 90, 95 percent tax, because there's no -- there's no way they can afford it. But people don't want to go to a hospital, to go to a doctor. They don't want to go. They want to have their own doctor, number one, and we went through this with Obamacare, which we got rid of the individual mandate, by the way, which is very important.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we have a great health care plan. If we get the House, we hold the Senate, we keep the presidency, we're going to have great health care, much better than Obamacare, at much less cost.
<Adam Sexton> <Positive> Governor Chris Sununu recently vetoed a series of gun bills, among them expanded background checks. You've said recently that you're in favor of meaningful background checks. Can you be more specific? Does that include, perhaps, closing the gun show loophole, or involving mental health records?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, we're looking at it right now. We're dealing with a lot of Republicans, very strong conservative Republicans, and we're coming up with a plan if we can. Remember this,  we have a lot of background checks already, people don't realize that. So within the constitution, within all of the rights, and we also have to remember one other thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to remember that you have a mental illness problem, that's a tremendous problem, and you know, it's not the gun that pulls the trigger. It's the person holding the gun. We have to remember mental illness, and we're working on that, including institutions. We used to have institutions. They were closed for budgetary reasons many years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Everybody was allowed to go out on the streets. We have a real mental illness problem. We're going to have it taken care of. So we'll be working with the Republicans, and ultimately, with the Democrats, to see if something can be done. I don't know if that's possible, but we're working on it.
<Adam Sexton> <Negative> Once again, two quick questions here. One: voter fraud. You alleged, once again, 2016 was a problem here. Your appointee to the Electoral Integrity Commission, Bill Gardner, our Secretary of State, found no evidence of widespread voter fraud. But, are you concerned of that happening again here in 2016 -- 2020?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think you have voter fraud all over the country. If you look at California if you look at so many other states, in California, they settled -- they had a million people that they found through Judicial Watch, and plenty of other places too. So, we have to stop voter fraud. Voter fraud is a big problem in this country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's no question about it.
<Adam Sexton> <Positive> And Corey Lewandowski, eyeing a Senate run here in New Hampshire. If he runs, will you endorse him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll tell you what. He's outstanding, and if he tells me -- and we will certainly make a decision quickly. But he's a great guy, and if he ran -- I think he could really do amazingly well. He's smart, he's tough. He loves New Hampshire. This is where he -- you know, it all begins and ends in New Hampshire for him, and he loves our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, if he runs I will certainly give it consideration.
<Adam Sexton> <Positive> Mr. President thank you so much for your time very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Thomas Roberts> <Positive> We have time now for a very quick conversation with GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. He is joining me on the phone in-between events here in South Carolina.
<Thomas Roberts> <Positive> Mr Trump, good to have you with me. You are a South Carolina frontrunner and also a national frontrunner in the new polling that has come out today. So are you confident and feeling as if you are the de facto GOP nominee right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I just think I have to keep going from day to day, Thomas, and we're doing very well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have tremendous crowds all over, and we're doing very well. But I never like to even think of myself as the frontrunner, I just want to win it and we want to make America great again. It's as simple as that. So -- but we are doing well.
<Thomas Roberts> <Positive> Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio would certainly consider you to be the frontrunner, and you are their target. Ted Cruz especially going after you. There was a pro-Cruz commercial I saw today saying he was the only one that can defend the Constitution and protect our liberty.
<Thomas Roberts> <Negative> He failed to overturn Obamacare. Do you think that you can overturn the ACA if elected?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'll tell you what. Not only did he fail to overturn Obamacare, he appointed the judge that gave us Obamacare because he was the one that pushed so hard for John Roberts to be a judge, you know, justice of the Supreme Court. So Ted Cruz really, really did a great disservice to the people like myself that want to see Obamacare totally repealed and replaced.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was really -- I mean, if you look at John Roberts, he had two chances to end it, and he voted against. So it was a disaster and, you know, he gave us that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, you know, you saw what Ted Cruz did with Ben Carson, and it was a big lie. And Ted, you know, he lies. I've never seen anybody lie like him. Even Marco Rubio said he lied. So I felt much better when he said that. That way, I can come out and say it also. But -- so he's not an honorable guy, but that's OK.
<Thomas Roberts> <Negative> Mr. Trump, you have a town hall tonight with Joe and Mika here on MSNBC. I know you did not feel as if you were treated fairly by the debate for the audience at the RNC. A term you like is burn grass. So are you about to burn grass with the RNC about being treated unfairly?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't exactly know the term burn grass, to be honest with you, but I will tell you this. They had all of the people -- you know, I don't -- I'm self-funding my campaign, as you know, Thomas. I'm putting up my own money. The other people are getting money from all of the different industries, from the pharmaceutical industry, et cetera, et cetera.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All of those people were in the hall. I had no people -- except for my family, I had no people in the hall because of the fact that I'm not -- you know, I'm not special interest, I'm not getting special interest or donor money. So I thought it was a very unfair situation. I think that the RNC handled it very badly. But it's just one of those things.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Most polls show that I won the debate, and I guess based on the new polls that you just told me about, I guess I didn't do badly in the debate because it seems that I'm doing very well with the polls.
<Thomas Roberts> <Positive> Your message is getting across. Mr. Trump, we're going to let you go. I know you have to take off. So sir, thanks very much. Safe travels and we'll see you tonight with Joe and Mika.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Thomas. So long.
<Question> <Positive> What are the vital qualities and skills required of a successful entrepreneur?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's important to realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort. You have to be ready to go it alone, and to be tenacious.
<Question> <Positive> What do you consider to be the single most influential personal quality in achieving success?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Being tenacious and being completely focused on your goals.
<Question> <Positive> How significant are opportunity and timing in a successful business career?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They are important -- first of all, seeing the opportunity and then sometimes waiting for it. I've waited twenty years to see some things happen.
<Question> <Neutral> Can you give an indication of a typical "day in the life" of Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No two days are ever alike, but I usually come to the office around 8 a.m. and stay until 7 p.m., depending on the day. That's average. I have appointments, take calls, deal with whatever comes up, which is usually a lot. In the evening I either have an event to attend, or spend it with my wife Melania and son Barron.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I spend weekends with my family and golf at one of my courses. I also travel a lot, but having a jet makes it easier. However, I can't say there's ever a typical day.
<Question> <Positive> It's often said that successful entrepreneurs have to have experienced failure -- do you believe this to be true and if so can you give an example from your own experience?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Being an entrepreneur means taking risks, and not everything is guaranteed to be a success, even if one is successful. That's part of the excitement. I had a significant financial turnaround in the 90's -- it had been predicted that I was done, over, and then I became far more successful than I had been before.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I realized I had lost my focus. So I'm more aware of how important that is for success to happen as well as to continue.
<Question> <Positive> As an entrepreneur you've had fantastic success -- do you have aspirations for the future that you've not yet realized?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have many plans for the future, and they are unfolding now.
<Question> <Positive> Can entrepreneurship be taught and if so how is this best achieved?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> To a certain extent it can be taught -- primarily by example -- but there are certain characteristics that make it easier. Can you handle stress and pressure and uncertainty well? Some people have trouble in that area, and if so, it’s not for them. Do you like taking risks and are you willing to do the work yourself?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Can you take full responsibility for the outcome? Do you have full confidence in yourself? Those are good questions to ask or be asked.
<Question> <Positive> How are entrepreneurial skills best acquired -- business experience, training?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The best is a combination of the two, plus a keen sense of intuition. Instincts are important, they can be developed but they need to be heeded.
<Question> <Positive> How can business and industry work with universities to improve young people's engagement in entrepreneurship?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The first thing is to make sure all students are financially literate. A sound financial education is necessary. Entrepreneurship is one step beyond that, and involves what was discussed in the previous question. The skill set is complex -- knowledge and intuition and both needed. I would stress the importance of experience -- starting small and working up to big -- to make sure the pieces are in place for endeavors larger in scope.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> An early wipe out is not the way to start.
<Question> <Positive> What’s the best form of support that can be provided for those just starting up in business?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The best form of support should come from the individual. Being an entrepreneur requires a person who is capable of thinking for himself or herself. This should be stressed while providing the skills necessary for any business endeavor.

<Question> <Negative> What do you think are the major challenges facing the North East of Scotland today?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The economy is difficult at this time, worldwide, and needs to be stimulated. Things will even out but it will take a while. Real estate and other things run in cycles, so it's a matter of time before it evens out.
<Question> <Negative> How should the region be preparing for the eventual decline of oil and gas reserves?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By being prescient. It's already clear the reserves are in decline, so it's necessary to look into the future and prepare accordingly.
<Question> <Positive> What role would you like to see Trump International Golf play in the region’s future?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> As a stimulant to the region, economic and otherwise.
<Jon Stepanek> <Positive> Mr. President, thanks very much for joining us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Jon.
<Jon Stepanek> <Positive> It's very nice to have you here in Montana. Obviously, we like to say welcome to Montana --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it was a beautiful scene. It was a great evening. And, as you know, Matt Rosendale is a fantastic person. That's why I'm doing it. I know how good he is. He's got a great heart. I hated to see what Jon Tester did to the Admiral. We have an admiral who's a world class human being , and they lied about him, and they demeaned him and they defamed him, and they, you know, a normal person I would say, they ruined him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he'll... he'll be fine. But what they did to him was horrible. What they did to his family. I sort of call it, welcome to the world of politics, but it shouldn't be that way. But what Tester did to him was a terrible, thing terrible terrible thing. So I -- I came here for Matt, and he's a terrific person, really, a terrific person. He'll be a great senator for Montana.
<Jon Stepanek> <Positive> Okay, let's jump in to the news of the day. Good economic numbers out today
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Jon Stepanek> <Neutral> We saw the jobs report 200,000 plus --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Jon Stepanek> <Negative> -- and unemployment rate at 3.9%.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Jon Stepanek> <Positive> Holding steady there. What do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And wages up. The first time in a long time. They said that couldn't be done. Wages up. Full unemployment. It's going to get better. We have tremendous potential. We're opening up our country. We're taking off regulations that are horrible. The big tax cuts, which the people of Montana really appreciate it. I saw that last night, because as soon as I mentioned the word tax cuts, they were going wild.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was a packed house. That was a beautiful place, by the way, but a packed house, and it's just all happening, but a very big thing this morning that is being covered that way actually, were wages, because wages have gone down for years. You know, I used to tell on the campaign, that for 18, 19 years, people were -- they'd work three or four jobs, they'd go out and just work all the time, and they were making less than they were making 18 and 20 years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And now wages are finally going up, which is what I really wanted. So, to me, that was the biggest news.
<Jon Stepanek> <Neutral> What -- our biggest economic driver in this state is our farm and ranching community --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Jon Stepanek> <Negative> -- and we look at a -- an economic driver that's over $2 billion a year, and farm and ranch economy relies on exports.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right.
<Jon Stepanek> <Positive> And we need a good place for those goods and services to be shipped out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Jon Stepanek> <Negative> There are some farmers and ranchers who are nervous with the new trade agreements looming out there...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But they're with me all the way because they know I'm doing the right thing.
<Jon Stepanek> <Neutral> So tell me about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, I know exactly what you... and they are, they're a little bit nervous, but they have confidence in me. They have trust in me. We're opening up barriers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You see what I'm doing with Canada as an example. Canada has not treated us well, and big barriers -- they pay -- you know, if there's a 300 percent -- think of it, 300 percent tariff -- if you sell dairy products into Canada.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're saying, we're not playing this game anymore. They have a tremendous -- you know, if we look at our surplus with Canada, it's not a surplus, it's a huge deficit. So we're changing, and we're being tough, and let them be tough, but we're making -- we're opening up countries.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're opening up the EU -- that's Europe. We're opening up, probably, we're going to be opening up China. We're in a big, big fight with China. What I love about the folks in Montana, and they are important to you -- but, what I like about the folks in Montana, they know it's not right, what's been happening for many years China has been taken out 500 billion a year from the United States, and they've been rebuilding China. It's been bad for us. So, I'm in a very tough battle.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to win the battle. We're going to absolutely win it. And what I love about the farmers and ranchers and all of the people in Montana and other states, to be honest with you, because they're all seeing what's happening. We're winning all these battles. We're going to win against China. We're going to win against Canada.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to win against everybody, and ultimately it's going to be a win for them too, I assume, because there's got to be a two-way street. But, we have all the cards. Our country has all the cards. We've never had a president that wanted to play the cards. They were willing to accept a bad NAFTA deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you look at farms over 15 years, before I got here, 15 years, they've been going down. If you look at soybeans and I tell this often, five years before my election, it cut in half, okay?So five years -- before the election, before that great day in November, two years ago, soybeans went down like this. So by the time I got elected, they had dropped 50 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It wasn't good. You know that, and we're opening up markets because they were closing markets, and they were closing in for their farmers, and for other reasons, but they were closing markets. We say if you want to play the game, and if you want to be with the United States, you have to open up your markets to our farmers, to our ranchers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have to open up your markets, and the people of Montana, they know that, and you know, know it better than anybody? Matt Rosendale, because he's pushing me: make a great deal for our farmers for for all of our people and for the country. But Matt Rosendale, the first thing he said when I met him last night, is please make a great deal for the farmers.
<Jon Stepanek> <Positive> And our ranching community loves Mexico and Canada.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Jon Stepanek> <Neutral> So they're also looking for you for a deal with Canada.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're going to be happy. But we already have a deal with Mexico, which is a much better deal than we had. We had a horrible deal. We were losing a fortune. We were losing $100 billion a year on NAFTA with Mexico. It's just -- what country wants to do that? So now we have a fair deal with Mexico and we very well could have a fair deal very soon with Canada, or maybe not.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And if we don't, we're going to do just fine because we have another alternative that maybe is better to be honest. But we'll see what happens.
<Jon Stepanek> <Negative> Coal is another big economic driver in this state. We rely on it for state tax income. You're still bullish on coal, even though natural gas option --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, natural gas is good. Well, we need coal also. You know when we need coal too? As a military alternative, because you know they blow up a pipeline that's the end of your natural gas. With coal, you can dump it over there, you have two years supply at your -- at your big plants. You can truck it over the roads that are no longer in existence, you can do a lot of things. So, no coal is very close to my heart.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Clean coal. I won your state by 20 points. I won West Virginia by 42 points. I won every coal state by a lot. And, we just had a rally in West Virginia. It was unbelievable. Same thing as last night. You know, it's really -- it's really pretty much the same everywhere. They like what I'm doing, and coal -- I just looked out the window and there was a train, the longest train, I think, I've ever seen.
<Jon Stepanek> <Positive> 110 cars.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And every -- is that a standard thing? Like 110\. Could it be a little bit longer if they wanted? Why is that? Is that an actual standard?
<Jon Stepanek> <Neutral> That's what -- that's what they roll.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, really? Okay, well then, it was 110 cars, and every one of them was loaded up with coal. And they say two years ago you wouldn't have seen that scene. So it's pretty good. The coal people like me and I like them, the miners.
<Jon Stepanek> <Neutral> Let's talk about a couple of things current events --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. Sure
<Jon Stepanek> <Positive> -- right at this moment. I saw this morning on Twitter you mentioned Bob Woodward's book Fear --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Jon Stepanek> <Negative> -- and calling it a sham. What did you see in that... that you didn't like, and...?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, well, I'd say it's a scam, and a sham.
<Jon Stepanek> <Positive> Okay
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I'll tell you what I didn't like him quoted as a fool, because if you look at the way, I don't speak that way. I'm highly educated. I went to the Wharton School of Finance. I don't speak that way. They're giving quotes -- now if these quotes even exist, I don't know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do they make them up or what? They say they got them from a lot of people. Now, General Mattis, who is highly respected, said he never said that, and he gave the most beautiful renunciation of the book. General Kelly, the same thing. He said I never said that. And he gave -- and if you look, many of my Cabinet people, many of the people that were quoted said they never said that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They never said that, and I actually said in the tweet this morning, I said, look, if I spoke that way I'd never be president. I did it last night. I said if I would act like the way they say, I'd never be in front of you, and I'll speak for an hour to an hour and a half in front of massive crowds, usually without even notes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You don't do that unless you are very capable, very, very competent and capable. So these books are terrible, where they can write anything they want. They can make up the most horrible statements. One person said he was in a room, and I was so good. So -- it was this morning he was -- he said I was at that meeting.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was so good -- it was a military meeting. But the way they phrase it -- it sounds like a fool. I don't talk that way, and if I did, you would have found it out over the last two years. You would have found that out during the campaign, where I took down 17 Republicans and Hillary Clinton, and I guess you could say Bernie too, because, in a certain way, I had to take him down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I beat everybody and beat him badly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A -- a foolish person wouldn't be able to do that. They would have been long gone. So, books are -- I've had some very good books written. Judge Jeanine. So many of them have come out, Greg. I'll tell you the book on the whole Mueller investigation, that the scam of Russia, this whole scam that's going on. There's no collusion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very interesting, in the book. They hardly talk about collusion. You know why -- and he would have loved to because that's his business right? You know why they don't talk about it, because there was no collusion with Russia. So, I'm -- overall I have to say the publicity we've been getting has been really good.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This letter that was written to The New York Times, with -- nobody knows who it is.
<Jon Stepanek> <Positive> Right
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's really turned around and hurt The New York Times. It makes them look so bad.
<Jon Stepanek> <Positive> You'd like to know who it was.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh but I think it's... but I think it's a disgrace, because normally, if somebody wants to write something bad, that's okay, because you can go back at them and you debate the issue, and somebody comes out on top. You don't know who this person is. It may be a low level person just writing a letter. You know, we have thousands of people working over there. So I think it actually has turned to a point where The New York Times is looking very foolish.
<Jon Stepanek> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And very bad.
<Jon Stepanek> <Neutral> One last one, just to kind of give us a sense of the State of the Union, and people seem to be divided in our country right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Jon Stepanek> <Positive> And I'm sure that that weighs heavily on you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Jon Stepanek> <Negative> Tell me about how you look at trying to bridge that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's a very interesting and a good question, because, in one way, it's the strongest we've ever been. The economy is the best we've ever been. Your coal miners are coming back like never before, you know that, they were -- they were out of business, but if I didn't win, they were out of business, there would be no more coal taken out of the ground.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've taken regulations off by the hundreds and hundreds, and I've been thanked by everybody from the miners, to the owners of the mines that were going out -- literally -- out of business. We're doing fantastically, financially. We're doing fantastically militarily. We're doing well in every single way, other than there is a tremendous hatred.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I watch Judge Kavanaugh, who is central casting, a great intellect, top student at Yale. We just went through Justice, now Justice Gorsuch, number one in this class at Harvard. Number one in his class at Oxford. And it was nasty, but not as nasty as this one. And we have a man who is just an extraordinary man, a great intellect.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I think, frankly, the other side's making fools out of themselves. But the level of hatred, the level of animosity, it's hard to believe. So, if I was going to say there's any one problem in this country, it is definitely that you have two sides and there's great division and there shouldn't be that division.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it seems no matter what you do no matter, how good -- look, wages are going up, such a big thing. Numbers are great. The stock market is at an all-time high. There's more people working in the United States today than ever before. Think of that, ever before, we have more people working.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> African-American employment, you know, as you know is doing great. Asian employment, Hispanic employment, women's employment. Every single every single stat is fantastic. The only thing -- you hit it -- the only thing that troubles me is when you see an economy doing so well, the country doing so well and yet there's this level of division and hatred, and that's a shame. And maybe we can do something about it. I hope so.
<Jon Stepanek> <Positive> One more shout out to the people of Montana.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you're very special people. I want to thank you for that 20-point victory. And I will say this: Matt Rosendale is a winner. Successful, really loves you, loves this state. He's going to be a fantastic Senator. Jon Tester has done some very bad things, and things that cannot be rewarded especially, in hurting a great human being like the Admiral.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's a doctor, and he's an admiral, and he was hurt really badly by Jon Tester. And it all turned out to be false. So we want Matt Rosendale, and it's very important that he wins, and it's very important because Tester will never vote for any of our agenda.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When we talk about Second Amendment, when we talk about all of the things that we talk about -- even when we talk about coal and regulations, he will never vote for us. He's always going to stay with Schumer and Pelosi, always.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So I just say: vote for Matt Rosendale.
<Jon Stepanek> <Positive> Alright, thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very good. Thank you. Great job.
<Jon Stepanek> <Positive> Thank you.
