<Kevin Wall> <Positive> Fun-lovers and truth-seekers, you who have come to the right place. It's live and local now all across the state of Nevada. President Trump traveled to Nevada for the, what, 12th time. Huge crowd in Elko. Turned out for what I call a hanger rally, with Air Force One as a stunning backdrop to the speech.
<Kevin Wall> <Positive> How was the president received? Well, joining us now, the guy that did the speech: the 45th president of the United States Donald J. Trump. Mr. President you're back in Nevada for the 12th time, believe it or not, and you're supporting the re-election of Senator Dean Heller. Can you talk a little bit about your relationship with Dean, how it has evolved?
<Kevin Wall> <Negative> You admitted, I know, during the Last Vegas rally that I was at, that there was a time not too long ago when you guys didn't -- didn't like each other. What changed --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I didn't know Dean, and I had just started running for office, and then I ran for office and I had nothing -- I really didn't know very much about him, other than he was known as a strong guy, and a smart guy. But I didn't know him, and he didn't know me. And I think, instinctively, maybe we didn't like each other very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And there was never much of a relationship, and then I got elected, and I had to start working with senators and others, and Dean was right at the forefront. He was fantastic, and we actually become friends, and that's why I'm out here today, to support Dean Heller, and also Adam Laxalt, who's going to be a terrific governor.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They have to -- they have to win. It's very important. You know, when the federal government works with people, you have to -- you have to be able to get along with those people. So Dean's relationship with me has really evolved, and I think it's been very, very special. Very great. We even flew out here together.
<Kevin Wall> <Negative> I noticed that -- I noticed the two of you getting off the -- getting off Air Force One together.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Kevin Wall> <Negative> You took a lot of flack from Democrats in the last week, for describing their party as a quote, angry mob. Now in the last few days, here in Nevada, I think you probably know about this by now. We had a Democrat operative physically assault Adam Laxalt's campaign manager.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right.
<Kevin Wall> <Negative> Do you do you have any regrets at introducing the term mob into our political lexicon, or is it just brutally honest?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's honest, and wouldn't you be shocked if I said I had regret? Would you be surprised if I said Oh, I feel --
<Kevin Wall> <Negative> I would be shocked.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- You would be -- you'd probably turn off the interview and say, "That's not Trump." That's somebody else.
<Kevin Wall> <Positive> [Laughs]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I, I no -- no interest, no interest in that at all. I will tell you, they've become angry. They've become bitter. And you saw that with the hearings, and actually you start with Neil Gorsuch, Justice Gorsuch hearing, but to an extent that was at least within the bounds of taste. This last situation, what they did with Brett Kavanaugh, was -- was just one of the worst things I've ever seen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it was all fiction, made up stuff. They tried to ruin his life, his family, his kids. He's got these two beautiful, wonderful daughters. And what they did to him -- and I think that's one of the reasons the Republican Party is so totally energized. I mean, I've never seen anything like it. And I think the rallies help also, the rallies that I've been doing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, you see the spirit. But I really believe that the way they treated Justice Kavanaugh has been -- while horrible, it's really helped the Republican Party.
<Kevin Wall> <Negative> Again, the president of the United States joining us on our City National Bank Guest Hotline, joining us from Elko where he just got off the stage. It looks like the so-called caravan, with over, what, 4,000 Central American migrants, has been turned around at the Mexican border. I want to know how you did this? I -- no other presidents ever been able to work with Mexico like this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. No other president's been able to do that because, I think, they respect me, and I respect them. I don't think they had any respect for our previous leaders, and they respect me and they know I'm not playing games. And I called them, and I said, really I would appreciate your help. This can't happen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Don't forget, they have to travel over a thousand miles up through Mexico. So Mexico is able to do a lot. And frankly, you know, we talked to Honduras. We said, we're paying you millions and millions of dollars in aid, in one case, $300 million, that's a lot of money, by the way, and we're giving aid to these countries, and they're allowing this to happen, and we said we're not going to let you do this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it stopped. El Salvador also, it stopped. And Mexico, though, in particular has been fantastic. We really appreciate it.
<Kevin Wall> <Positive> Mr. President, I know we have a limited amount of time. I got one final question. It's a point of personal privilege for me. I want to ask a personal question, and I put it to your son Eric earlier this week on my show here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good.
<Kevin Wall> <Negative> He was a guest on my program. How do you get up every morning and fight for all of us, when every day you are battling the fake news media, resistance, the deep state, and even folks within your own party.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know.
<Kevin Wall> <Negative> How -- they're all hell bent on destroying your administration. How do you do it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are hell bent. It's -- it's terrible, and you know, you think they'd like low taxes. You'd think they'd like a strong military, good education, all the things we're doing. But I guess it's something beyond that. I really enjoy it only because we're achieving. If we weren't winning, I think I'd probably be like anybody else would be, because the attack is so vicious.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The New York Times -- I could do the greatest thing in the world, and they would make it look bad. I could do, you know, between the Washington Post, The New York Times ABC, NBC, CBS. CNN is just ridiculous. It, it... people aren't even watching it anymore, it's so ridiculous. Their ratings are down the tubes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, you know, when we -- when you win, Kevin, you know this because you've been doing great for a long time. Your ratings are phenomenal, and you've been doing great. So you know about winning, because in your business, it's all about the ratings, unfortunately, or fortunately. When you win, you feel a little bit differently.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have done more and completed more than any administration, the first two years, and we're still, you know, really three months shy of that. Two and a half months shy of that. So we still have a ways to go, but we have in two years we have done more than any other administration in the history of our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And that makes me happy. So we have to fight these artificial forces, and real forces. I mean, they're real forces. They make up Russia stuff, and they do so many different things, and we fight it, but we're winning. And we're really achieving something great for the people of this country. That makes me happy.
<Kevin Wall> <Positive> Mr. President, thanks so much for all you've done for our country, for our state. Safe travels as you continue on this, what, five state tour. Hope we can talk again real soon. Thank you so much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you for being so nice. Thank you Kevin. And I look forward to seeing you again. Thanks a lot.
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> Well, it's a pleasure now to introduce a man who is in the news almost all the time, Donald Trump. Donald, it's so good to have you with us. Thank you for being here. Donald Trump
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. So, so great to be with you
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> There's something I've seen that you don't get any press on. When you built a great skyscraper in New York, you had the first woman, I guess she was a building supervisor, was she an engineer, or what?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I had the first woman supervisor and I was very proud of that. You're right, I don't get very much credit for it. But they don't like to mention that. But I've had many, many women in top positions and I'm very proud of it, and I think I was sort of one of the first, certainly very early on. And I'm... you know, it's something that is so great. And they did such a great job.
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> Well, you know I've built over a million feet of buildings and stuff, and this is big task. I mean, all those trades, but she managed all of that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Pat Robertson> <Neutral> And she managed all of those.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And that was a long time ago, don't forget. Today, you'll have women in charge, and they do a fantastic job. I have women today.
<Pat Robertson> <Neutral> You were the first.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think I was the first, certainly of a major building in New York City, absolutely.
<Pat Robertson> <Neutral> I want to ask you this: do you expect to have women in your cabinet and in key positions in your administration?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh absolutely, without question. You know, I probably have 50%, maybe even more than that, right now, in executive positions at the Trump Organization, and we're a very big company. Very, very successful, and they do a fantastic job, and... but I have a tremendous number of women working for me at top levels.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> They talk about, it's interesting, the Clinton Foundation, I understand there's a disparity in pay between women and men. Are you going to make sure that women get paid for equal work with men? There's not going to be any question in the federal government that there's equality, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I do that, and frankly I have women... I have the opposite problem. Sometimes, I have women being paid more than men. I have a problem with the men, where they're saying the women are making more money than we are. So yeah, it just works out well and and they have been so incredible, something I'm very proud of.
<Pat Robertson> <Neutral> What do you look for when you're picking employees? What qualifications do you look for?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I look for energy. I look for honesty. You know about honesty.
<Pat Robertson> <Neutral> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I look for... but you know, they need that energy. Without energy, it just doesn't seem to work, to me. I just see that you need that drive, whatever it is. You certainly need knowledge. I love education when you can get it, but I've had people without great education that have done a great job. Also, but you... and I think there's a certain instinct that some people have you know you have that ability, whether it's business, where I'm involved, or hitting a baseball, or playing sports. You know, there's some people just with a certain ability. If you can find that person, it's a very special thing.
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> You did a program where one of your famous lines was "You're fired." I think it's important in business to hire the best people and train them well but also to, when people aren't cutting it, to do them a favor to let them go.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's true. It's so, so true. Oftentimes, they won't do a good job because they don't like what they're doing, or they don't have the aptitude or ability and honestly... you... they never love when you let them go, you understand that. It's funny. I've had people with me for ten years, and I paid them well and everything else and you can fire them easily, meaning nice and easy, or a little bit rougher or even quite rough. It doesn't matter. They wake up the next morning, they've been fired and, generally speaking, they're not too happy. In other words, they'll see you'll mention the name Trump, or whatever perhaps in your case, pad but they'll mention the name and they'll say, oh he fired me. Could you still known to them for firing rap so it's sort of an interesting thin,g but often times when somebody's not doing the job, the best thing you can do not only for yourself but for them, yeah is to tell them to go find something they like more.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> Well, in the Veterans Administration, they didn't serve the needs of the veterans, yet a lot of those guys got bonuses. That's a crime.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> One of the worst run enterprises. You take a look what's happening with the veterans is so sad, and we're working with the veterans very closely. We have tremendous veteran support. I don't know if you know, even the polls are showing us, you know, way, way, way ahead with the veterans. We're going to work with the veterans.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> You wouldn't hesitate, I mean you know, if those people weren't serving the veterans, cheating and lying, to fire them. Can you do that under civil service rules?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, in Phoenix, the answer is in theory, you can't, but I'd do it anyway. In Phoenix, they have people who got caught stealing yeah and they couldn't fire them. Okay, they're going through a process right now, so I think it's terrible. Look, the rules have to be changed. The whole government has to change... become so bureaucratic, but there's a good example. The Veterans Administration is so poorly run. With us, it'll change.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> We've got to change the civil service laws in some fashion, so that you reward ability and punish insufficient activity.
<Donld Trump> <Negative> That'll happen. That'll happen.
<Pat Robertson> <Neutral> I was reading in the Wall Street Journal -- I think the reporter was Kimberly Strassel -- and she said, "Donald Trump knows more about constitutional law than Hillary Clinton!" How come? What's the deal?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I think that's right. That was actually a very complimentary article I appreciated it.
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> But it's true.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well you have to I mean when you're doing business very interesting when you do as much business as I have you sort of learn really a lot about a lot and if you don't know things you're not going to be doing that as you said you built a million feet when you do that kind of work you get to know everybody you get to know from the Foundation's to the plumbers to the sheetrock right to the carpenters you know the whole thing I mean you get to know a lot but yeah I think she's probably right about that.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> You know Hillary made statements in that debate concerning the Supreme Court.. She was asked "What is the Supreme Court" and she said well, it's an organization representing the whole nation and their principal task _ and I'm putting words in her mouth. I'm paraphrasing _ is to look after the little guys.. That's not what the Constitution says.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I thought I gave a good answer and we talked about religious liberty, we talked about Second Amendment meaning I talked about and I thought Hillary did very poorly in that debate I thought it was not a good job.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> Well, I went to Yale law school ahead of them, but she went to Yale law school and the Heller decision, for example, she wants to overturn Heller, and she said that Heller had to do with keeping guns away from little toddlers. That's nonsense!
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right, absolutely right, she was giving that answer and I'm sitting there saying, "What's going on?" Look, Hillary, I don't want to say overrated. Why should I say anybody's overrated? But Hillary would do a poor job as president. If you look at the job she's done for our country, if you look at the Middle East and the disaster, that is, if you look at New York State where she was a Senator and she was going to bring jobs back to upstate New York. Take a look at what happened. It was a disaster.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> But you know Heller, the DC law said only people with permits can have guns, and permits are hard to get, and even if you have a permit for a gun in your house, you have to disassemble it, so if a woman's got a gun, and a burglar comes in, she has to pick all those parts and get 'em in. I mean, it makes women terribly vulnerable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know Heller, the the DC law said: only people with permits can have guns permits ,are hard to get. Even if you have a permit and you have a gun in your house, you have to disassemble it. So if a woman's got a gun and a burglar comes in, she's got to go and take it all the sorting, I mean it makes women terribly vulnerable, but she gave the wrong answer and I think I straightened the answer out. Yes, she gave the wrong answer and she wasn't called for it, but that's happened. A lot.
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> Well, if you're president, and we're talking guns and the Supreme Court, so that Heller decision was one, and the law, we're talking about the 2nd Amendment, they talk about a well-ordered militia and then they talk about the right of the people to keep and bear arms should not be curtailed, so with Heller, this has to do with the 1st, I mean the 2nd Amendment freedom to own guns personally. A lot of those judges thought it had to do with the militia.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's true and actually Judge Scalia is the one that was so involved and I don't know if it was his last decision. It was one of his latter decisions, but you know where I'm going to replace. As you know, and I've been very strong, he was sort of a role model from the standpoint of what I'm looking to do and he is replacing our judges and one of the important things I think about when we think in terms of the Supreme Court pad That is such an important element of this election.. This president, whoever it may be hopefully it'll be me, is going to be replace to three could even before mm-hmm and we could even before Supreme Court judges, I mean perhaps more than anyone. I even heard the scenario it can be: five.
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> You said in Gettysburg today that you would appoint from that [the Federalist Society] list. Is that right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The Federalist Society vetted very carefully great scholars, pro-life, very, very fine people. Second amendment -- and you know, I think, a very good list. We have a list of twenty judges and all been vetted by Federalist Society and I think yeah, it's gotten great. It's gotten great marks.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> Something else that Hillary did. She took the radical feminist view in relation to abortion, and she didn't back off one iota in that debate, not one, and you called her out on partial-birth abortion, and she said it's not as bad as you said. But the truth is it's worse than you said.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Probably worse. It's probably what counted to her wasn't bad at al. I mean it wasn't even like a little bit.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> The actual partial birth is the baby is about two-thirds already born in the birth canal. The doctor turns it around to get its head, punches the back of its skull, and then evacuates the brain, and it is the most barbaric thing, and to defend that and say that's a woman's right...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I said it very strongly a lot of people in. I must say I've been called by a lot of pastors. I'Ve been called by priests, thanking me because they said they've never heard anyone explain it quite the way I explained it.. So if you can help get the word out.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> She defended that barbaric practice of partial birth and then she defended Planned Parenthood. $500+ million? It's terrible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, according to the rules of Hillary, you can take the baby at nine months and you can imagine what you have to do to that baby to get it out, and you can take that baby at nine months and you can abort. And a day prior to birth, you could take the baby. And I said it's unacceptable. A lot of people, even on the other side of that issue, agreed with me on that
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> I think the majority of people now at least fetal viability. Beyond that, the majority of women do not stand for abortion on demand. Up to that point, they say, well, I'm pro-choice, but you have said you're pro-life, unashamedly pro-life.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm pro-life and I'll tell you, I see more and more people going that route, and you see it too. You know when you talked about as an example other things where they become less and less popular or more popular. The whole pro-life movement is becoming more and more politically popular in terms of politically popular, which actually surprises people through and you're, seeing it too, I think, but it's become more and more standard politically, and I think that's a great thing.
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> You know, Hillary is playing to women. Are you seeing any shift in women towards you in relation to these issues, because I would think the average woman loves children, and I have fourteen grand children. I have nine great grand children. I love those children. And to think you'd want to slaughter those children? It must, the average woman is compassionate and loving.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll, let you know on November 8th the evening of November 8th, all right and we'll see how does it, but I think we did very well in the debate. We'Ve gotten great marks with a lot of people said. Most people said we won that debate pretty easily. It may be one of the reasons we wanted was pro-life. I think so.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> You were so well-positioned. Most people don't talk about it. Don't want to talk about it, but you did.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That was the first question. It's very interesting. That was the first question of the evening now.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> Let's talk about your growth plan. You're going to grow the economy. You said about 25-million jobs. You laid out in Gettysburg today your plan. You want to give us two or three points of what you're going to do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> First of all, I have to say we have to negotiate renegotiate trade agreement. Yes an afternoon. These trade agreements are just sucking the jobs right out of our country in Virginia and every other place and they're just taking our jobs. So we have to renegotiate trade agreements and if we can't make the right deal, we're going to end it and will I want to be free. Trade -- I'm a hundred percent free trade. But these deals are horrible.. What's going on now, they want to do TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is going to be another disaster. All standard equipment All standard, and that will have something goes from the gold standard to then she heard me talking about it and now she goes against it. But if she ever once you'd sign it in a heartbeat, she'd sign it in a minute we're going to be substantially cutting taxes not only for the middle class but for business. We'Re bringing it down from thirty five percent to fifteen percent, and that will be such an unbelievable because our businesses that are leaving this country because taxes are too well, they can't compete. It can't compete. They can't compete massive regulation cutting another problem. You know one of the things that surprised me most in going around meeting big business owners, small business owners if they had their choice between the tax cut and the regulation cut, they would take the regulation. That's how bad regulation is. It must, as a half a trillion to the drain, Alico its know much more than that more than theirs, so massive, the amount of money that our that this country, not even forget the money, the jobs, the businesses that we lose because of regulation and our businesses Can'T compete well, why do they keep our? They are so opposed to this. It looks like it's common sense. Huh, it's almost become an industry regulations become an Indian. I mean one of the things that we have anywhere from three to five trillion dollars offshore outside of the country and companies that we have here can't get the money back. They can't bring it back because of bureaucracy and because of the high tax and it's billions, and it's really trillions of dollars. It's at least it's probably at least three could be five.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> Why do they keep, why are they so opposed to this [deregulation]? It's just common sense. American companies, they've got to pay federal tax, state tax, sometimes city tax, and all the other taxes that go along. Of course they can't compete. Obama I understand had about 26-hundred regulations in the hopper that he's going to personally put in before his term ends. Is that right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's okay. He'll do it with the executive order, and I'll undo it with an executive order. It's the only good thing about his executive orders. You can undo them very rapidly.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> So your plan is when you take office, you will undo those executive orders?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have no choice. Look whether it's on the border or regulation. We have no choice. We have to the regulations are killing our businesses. Our businesses can't make it they can't expand. You can't start new businesses today, it's very hard to start a new business because of regulation, so we have to we're going to cut the regulations down very substantial okay, you need them for safety and you need them to a certain extent, for the environment, to a Great extent, certainly, but we are so over regulated, then our businesses can't compete.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> I know I started a few IPOs that were real successful and right now Sarbanes-Oxley makes it so difficult that if the average company wants to go to London or someplace besides New York. New York has lost a lot of business because of that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're losing it, and we're losing it rapidly. So it has to happen.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> In military matters, there's been proposed a no-fly zone over Aleppo and those beleaguered cities in Syria. And I don't know if Hillary's for it or not.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think she said she may have been for it. Look. The whole thing with Syria is crazy. Syria wants to fight Isis. Russia is now a Syria Iran, which we made a powerful nation country. In a matter of moments, I mean Iran was in big trouble with Kerry and Hillary. We made them. This oranda is one of the worst deals ever so they're powerful. So then, now with Syria, we want to fight Isis but you're, fighting Isis and you're fighting Syria and you're fighting Russia and you're fighting Iran. We have people, they don't know what they're doing and then we go into Mosul and we tell them we're going to go. Ataque Mosel for four months we've been saying we're going to attack so everybody in mozo that we wanted. We need. The leaders of Isis have gone yeah and you see, what's going on, you see how badly that fight is going they're using human shields, they're all dug in whatwhat about the element of surprise. Will we go in and we do the job the right way, but we've been hearing about Mosul now for months that we're going to attack and they've been plenty ready and it's turning out to be a very tough deal. It'S so sad. The way our country is run, it so said the decisions we make, but there's a decision. If you want to go into Mosul, you don't tell people for four months now they're having a hard time and they're really dug in and the people that we wanted. The leaders of ISIS are gone,
<Pat Robertson> <Neutral> Would you keep the same defense team in place, or do you find you've got other people in mind to run it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we put new people in but look I'm sure some of the generals are excellent I have over 200 generals and admirals endorsing me. I'm sure some of the generals are excellent but I think they have very poor leadership and I think it's being run by Obama.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> There's no question. We've made some really serious matters... You know apparently there's been a great deal of deception. There's been so many lies. The Obamacare, if you like you doctor, you can keep him, if you like your health plan, you can keep them. total lies. You mentioned in one of the debates that Gruber was laughing about the fact that he was lying about what he was doing, but there have been lies with regards to the Iran nuclear deal...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's lies on everything having to do with it. How about Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare was laughing at how stupid the American people are for agreeing to this for doing this, and that was a year ago, two years ago and now he's gone. Obamacare is a disaster rates are going up, 60, 70, 80 %. The deductibles are so high. You can't use it it's it's a terrible thing, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
<Pat Robertson> <Negative> One last question. I know you've got to do a rally. There have been so many lies. Excepting national security, which is a totally different ballgame, would you make a pledge as president not to lie to the American people as president?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I think it's a great pledge. I think it's a great pledge -- and you know it's a pledge that I would like to make, but I will say this some of the well, maybe you just don't say anything as an example with Mosul with the way they've had -- and I know I understood and You said, except for that, just because you have to do sometimes what you have to do for the safety of our people in our nation sure. But no you don't want to lie to the American people. You know. Obama lied about Obamacare in many ways he lied. Frankly, if he didn't like he could have never gotten it through, because the Democrats went along because they actually believed him. they're very unhappy with it. Obamacare is falling of its own weight, but we're going to terminate it we're going to repeal it and replace it.
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> I appreciate so much your being here Donald. Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much Pat. Thank you.
<Pat Robertson> <Positive> God bless you.
<Tamron Hall> <Positive> And with me now, here in Manchester, is the Gop front-runner, Donald Trump. Thank you so much for joining us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Tamron Hall> <Positive> How do you feel this morning going in? AND I say that, it's interesting, right before Iowa, you did an interview on The Today Show"
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I had confidence in Iowa. I think we did great in Iowa. We came in second. I had a lot of votes, you know, we had a lot of votes. Strong second. And a lot of those votes were missing because of what happened to Ben, Ben Carson, who is a great guy. And that shouldn't have happened. But in New Hampshire, I feel very good. We'll see what happens. It's politics. You know politics better than I do. I mean, it's politics. I've never done this before. So we had a great turn in Iowa, and I think we're going to have an even better turn tonight. But we have to count up the votes.
<Tamron Hall> <Negative> I got to talk to you about what happened last night at your rally, as I mentioned, just across the street from where we are sitting. Let's place this moment where you were rallying your crowd and now you have twitter and social media abuzz. Let's play it. [Begin Video]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She just said a terrible thing. You know what she said? She said I never expect to hear that from you again. She said he's a [Expletive Deleted]. That's terrible. Terrible.
<Tamron Hall> <Negative> [End Video] First sometime in my 30 years on television, you're talking about a p-word and it's not policy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's true. We were having a lot of fun last night. I was repeating something that somebody said from the audience. And it was cute. I mean, the whole place gave a standing ovation. They were having fun. We didn't want to be too politically correct. Not the worst thing. But I was actually repeating a word. A woman kept shouting a certain word, so I repeated it, and people had a lot of fun with it.
<Tamron Hall> <Negative> I guess I want to know what you see though as presidential. There was a picture not very long ago, Barack Obama in the Oval Office, his foot on the ottoman. Some conservatives went crazy. How could he disrespect the White House? That's our house. How could he disrespect the presidency? Many would say, what will Donald Trump do to the presidency if he's willing to, on stage, say something like that? And other comments I could laundry list here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I mean, I saw the picture of Barack Obama.  It didn't bother me at all, I must tell you.  I know he took a lot of heat for that, but to me, you want to be comfortable.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's your house for a period of time and you want to be comfortable.  I think that right now, I'm competing against a lot of people, Tamron.  There are a lot of people out there coming from all different sides.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I have to be extremely high energy.  We had 4,000 people, maybe 5,000 people, there last night.  We had an unbelievable crowd in the middle of a tremendous storm.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we had a great time last night.  And there was a woman, she was shouting out something.  We were all having a lot of fun.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When you get to be president or just before you get to be president, the altitude would change very much.  I mean, I was a good student at the best school and all of that.  My uncle was a professor at MIT for many years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know exactly what I have to do.  But right now, we're in a very combative stage and we also want to have a little fun.  You know, the word political correct.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everyone wants to be so totally politically correct. And it's honestly, it's a problem for our country. I mean, we're doing things that we shouldn't be doing.
<Tamron Hall> <Neutral> What do you mean when you say politically correct?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think people don't want to --
<Tamron Hall> <Negative> What does that mean, not saying that word in a public place?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That word wasn't -- [Crosstalk]
<Tamron Hall> <Negative> What do you mean by that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that word was really sort of a repeat of a word that somebody else was saying. But I think that the political correctness of -- within our country now is too much. It's too much.
<Tamron Hall> <Negative> Give me example. What do you mean?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right, I'll tell you, anchor baby. We had a case where a man from CNN, one of the reporters, good guy from CNN, said, well, the anchor baby, because I was talking about anchor babies, where people come over, they have a baby in the United States.
<Tamron Hall> <Neutral> I know what it is.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right, OK, but your audience might not.  They come over to the United States, they have a baby, and now we're supposed to take care of that person for, you know, 100 years.  It doesn't work that way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And believe me, it doesn't work that way.  And I used the term anchor baby.  And I said to the reporter, so what would you use? He said, well, I think you should say the baby or child of an undocumented worker who came over to the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was like nine words. And they wanted to be politically correct. It just doesn't work. We have a country that's in serious trouble. We have a country where people, they're flowing across our borders. They're coming across our borders like mad.
<Tamron Hall> <Neutral> But they're also being deported in larger numbers than any other administration.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well --
<Tamron Hall> <Neutral> The Obama administration, in fact, by his own supporters, heavily criticized for deporting more illegal immigrants than any other administration.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, right now, as of yesterday, it came out last week, we have 179,000 criminal illegal aliens. We have 179,000 people that are criminals, convicted of crimes, some major crimes, illegal aliens or illegal immigrants. They're in the country now. That's 179,000. That's bigger than any city in New Hampshire. And they're roaming around their country and half we don't know where they are. I mean, look, we have to create borders. And I want people to come in, Tamron. I want people to come into the country, but they have to come in legally. They have to come in through a process.
<Tamron Hall> <Negative> So let me talk to you about your plan. I know earlier in the year, you -- last year, at the end of last year, you released your immigration plan, a five-point plan. We've not heard much more since then so let's go by the numbers. You've talked a lot about building the wall, the very big wall. How much will the wall cost? Have you looked into the numbers?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The wall -- yes, sure I did. The wall is probably $8 billion, which is a tiny fraction of the money that we lose with Mexico. We lose a tremendous amount of trade deficits. We have a trade deficit with Mexico that is astronomical, much bigger than that. We will get -- and I say it also is also part of my plan -- Mexico is going to play for the wall.
<Tamron Hall> <Positive> How did you come up with that dollar figure and who pays for it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All I'm doing is I'm multiplying the number of miles by a certain number -- it's a very simple number because we're talking about [Inaudible].
<Tamron Hall> <Negative> So you're doing construction numbers here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm very good at that.
<Tamron Hall> <Neutral> Yes, but you're doing construction numbers, not real numbers, not numbers of what it would cost.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, I'm talking about --
<Tamron Hall> <Positive> You bring up for example the Great Wall of China that was built with slave labor. You don't have that in the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The Great Wall of China is 13,000 miles long.
<Tamron Hall> <Positive> But that's the example that you point, that there's proof that you can build a great wall.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You can a build a great wall, especially with [Inaudible].
<Tamron Hall> <Neutral> So go back to your dollar figure. Tell me how came to this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it's $8 billion.  And what we're doing is we have 2,000 miles, right? 2,000 miles.  It's long but not 13,000 miles like they have in China.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And of the 2,000, we don't need 2,000, we need 1,000 because we have natural barriers, et cetera, et cetera, and I'm taking it price per square foot and a price per square, you know, per mile, and it's a very simple calculation.  I'm talking about precasts going up probably 35 to 40 feet up in the air, that's high, that's a real wall.  It will actually look good, it'll look, you know, as good as a wall is going to look.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And it's going to do the trick, but we're going to have big, beautiful doors in the wall and people are going to come into the country because we want people...
<Tamron Hall> <Negative> Well, people - I don't know, I don't think people really care how beautiful the door is. It's not their home, but the money could come from, though, the money they bring into their home, meaning taxes. Who pays for this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the...
<Tamron Hall> <Negative> Mexico has already said that it's a ridiculous idea. The former president of Mexico yesterday said there's no way, this is a silly idea. Who pays for this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's silly for Mexico, yes, because Mexico...
<Tamron Hall> <Positive> But who pays for it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you who's going to pay for it, Mexico's going to pay for it and it is silly for Mexico. You know why?
<Tamron Hall> <Neutral> How do you get Mexico to pay for it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You tell them you're going to pay for it.  We lose a fortune dealing in trade with Mexico.  We lose a lot of money.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We give them money, we give subsidies to Mexico, we do so many things for Mexico.  In addition to that, they take our businesses.  New Hampshire is the number one example.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, this place was stripped with companies that went down to Mexico. Ford just opened a $2.5 billion plant in Mexico. Nabisco is moving their big plant from Chicago into Mexico. They just took a big factory from Tennessee going into Mexico. Mexico makes a fortune. Mexico is going to pay. And I heard he said that we will not pay. Guess what? The wall just got higher.
<Tamron Hall> <Positive> How do you enforce this? I mean, you name, for example, New Hampshire, but there are states like Texas, for example, and you're in the hotel, restaurant business. You and I both know a great number of businesses have been behind the backs for many, many years hiring undocumented workers.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Tamron Hall> <Neutral> Some of those very businesses that you know, being a hotel owner, a restaurant owner, et cetera.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And that's OK, they come in legally through visas.
<Tamron Hall> <Positive> That's a different dynamic.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, they come in legally through visas, they have work visas.
<Tamron Hall> <Negative> So, what are you going to do about these businesses in the United States who allow undocumented workers? How do you... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, you have - you have all sorts of computerized programs now where they wont be able to hire these people.  The people will go back of their own volition.  They have to hire Americans.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If for some reason, like in some areas we have very seasonable businesses where you can't get help, you'll have a visa program where they come in and they have to go out, but everything has to be documented, everything has to be legal.  Otherwise, we don't have a country.  And Tamron, if we don't have a wall, and I'm not even talking about a wall, if we don't have a border, we don't have a country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right now we don't have a country.  People are walking in and out like it's nothing, like they walk from here into that door.  It's walking in and out like nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We don't have a country.  We right now are at a stage where you take a look at New Hampshire with the heroin problem, people are walking across the border loaded up with drugs.  They're bringing it up to New Hampshire and other places.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know, the amazing thing about New Hampshire, you look at it, it's so beautiful.  Everything's so nice.  I'm here a lot, I have a lot of friends up here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The biggest problem they have is heroin. Heroin comes from the southern border...
<Tamron Hall> <Neutral> I'm told that we have to go...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... and we're going to stop that.
<Tamron Hall> <Positive> ... and I'm getting this wrap for some reason. We were hoping that you could stay longer, but I do want to talk to you, going back to the comments that you made at this rally last night, but when you were in Iowa, you were holding your Bible, two Corinthians and all, the Bible given to you by your mother.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By the way, in Europe and different places, they do say two Corinthians, you do know that.
<Tamron Hall> <Positive> I grew up Southern Baptist, never heard, but we'll let you pass on it.  Nevertheless, you had your Bible with it, you're traveling on to South Carolina.  There's some prediction that you are now looking ahead to the general election and you will start looking at voters different than, meaning demographically, different from Iowa, from New Hampshire, perhaps African-American, and bringing in some voters that you've offended outside of your core support here.
<Tamron Hall> <Negative> So the question is, who is the real Donald Trump? Is he the guy saying the p-word where he knows he can get away with it at this ruckus rally, or is he the guy thumping the Bible because he needs that group? And then will he be the guy later in a general election who becomes the New York liberal that Ted Cruz says you are really hiding under your suit?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, so, I'll tell you who the real Donald Trump is. I am the one that is going to make America great again. That's what it is. We have politicians, they're all talk, they're no action, they're destroying our country. We owe $19 trillion, we're going to owe $21 trillion within a very short period of time because of the really stupid budget that they just passed. The real Donald Trump is going to turn it around and make America great again. That's what the real Donald Trump is.
<Tamron Hall> <Neutral> I hear your staff is going crazy that you have to go, but I would love to talk to you a little bit later about the economy...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would love it.
<Tamron Hall> <Positive> ... the improved job numbers, some of the jobs that have added, and what you would do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would love that.
<Tamron Hall> <Neutral> So, hopefully we'll get you back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you very much.
<Tamron Hall> <Positive> Come back tomorrow and tell your staff to calm down.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK.
<Tamron Hall> <Positive> Thank you.
<Don Imus> <Negative> [Inaudible], here in the Imus, in the morning program. We're going to talk with Bill O'Reilly tomorrow. One of the things, when I have a discussion with O'Reilly about is he has his big party like I guess [Inaudible] parties. [Inaudible], have you ever been invited to one of his parties, [Inaudible]?
<Unknown Speaker> <Negative> Me, no.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Well, Bernard was.
<Unknown Speaker> <Neutral> Sure.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Right. Very nice man, very generous man. Did you go to the party he had? He had a big Christmas party, right?
<Unknown Speaker> <Neutral> He does, yes.
<Don Imus> <Negative> And then he has a... and apparently he has this big [Inaudible], big part of the [Inaudible] now that happens.
<Unknown Speaker> <Negative> Well, at least [Inaudible]
<Don Imus> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Unknown Speaker> <Negative> Well, good time, I'm sure. Yeah, I wasn't invited. My man wasn't invited. Not good.
<Don Imus> <Negative> I've never been invited to any of them.
<Unknown Speaker> <Neutral> What does that tell you?
<Don Imus> <Positive> Well, [Inaudible] TRUMP, by the way, Bernie.
<Unknown Speaker> <Neutral> He's their boss.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Here we go.
<Unknown Speaker> <Positive> Here we go, Mr. Trump.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Please welcome to Imus in the morning program. Donald Trump, hey, how are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm right on time for you. Bernard said, I watched Bernard last night by the way. He's fantastic but not said could you call back in three minutes. I'm right on time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Never late for Don. Can't be late for Don.
<Don Imus> <Negative> You were in a lot of talking [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What a good guy he is.
<Don Imus> <Positive> One of my best friends, maybe...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know he is, and he's your best friend behind your back too. You understand that.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Yes, I know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He loves you.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> He says, he asked you, let me ask you. Do you think this thing was going to be as big as it is, you're running for president?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know I think I have the right message. But you know it's just exploded. I don't know if you saw the polls yesterday. Thirty five percent in New Hampshire, winning by double digits.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know big, like really big second place is way back. And so I'm very happy with that. South Carolina came out yesterday with a fantastic number. We had a 40% number in overall 40%.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, when I first did it, Don, I started at like six and they said well that's the cap... he's got 6% of the people that really like him. Then it went to 12 then went to 18 then went to 25. And they kept saying now that are so to say that anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we've got... I mean the South Carolina numbers that's an incredible place and I'm going there very soon. And those numbers were fantastic. And North Carolina came out and Nevada came out and I'm winning everything in Nevada.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm winning the Hispanics by a lot. So you know every single poll both nationally and locally I'm winning.
<Don Imus> <Negative> I was talking with Tom. I was watching by the way, Fox [Inaudible] Cameron was on, in Iowa and he say what he thought was interesting as the people who were showing up for your rallies there, are some of the people who are... some of the voters, some of the serious voters in Iowa just not tourists or curiosity seekers, in other words what Cameron was saying was that the people who actually vote in Iowa are apparently taking you seriously. It isn't just curiosity seekers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I actually saw Carrl's report and you know it's interesting. We had a tremendous group of people. We had I guess Carl said, 4,000 people last night it was packed and it was just an amazing experience and I've had a lot of amazing... you know the other day in Alabama, another one we had 30,000 people in a football stadium.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it was like a love fest. And same thing last night, same thing in New Hampshire the other day. It's been amazing, so you know I don't know... Mike actually asked me the question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean did you expect it? I think nobody could expect this. They say it's never happened before actually to this extent. In the end though, and I tell this to Mike Lupica, I said, you know Mike in the end it doesn't matter if you don't win. It's like if you get nine runs at the first inning of a baseball game.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But if you lose the game what difference does it make, right? I don't view it as... I don't view it... a very great journalist called me and he had, who I didn't even really know, but I have a lot of respect for him and he said, you know what does it feel like, I said what does it feel like to have done this, to have sort of take it. They call it the summer of Trump which is great for my ego.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll tell you what. That is great for my ego. You understand that Bernard, right?
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Oh, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But anyway, he said, how does it feel? I said, well, it doesn't matter unless I win. He said, no, no, no, even if you don't win, it matters, it's been amazing. I said, no. That's what I disagree because I don't think it does matter unless I get the nomination and win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And as I say make our country great again. But hey, don't forget, Don always said if I actually run because Don was not sure, you didn't sort of think I was going to run. He said, I will endorse Trump if he runs, but I don't think he's going to run.
<Don Imus> <Negative> I don't think there was any, but I thought there was no possible way you were going to run. But then I was talking to a [Inaudible] Crawley. I say, pretty smart. She says, she thinks that this whole run of years has been planned for months of maybe not years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've certainly been thinking about it. I was thinking about it last cycle, this cycle worked out better for me from a lot of standpoints including business. I'm finishing up you know big, big developments all over the world. And you know, I really have a place where I can go out and do what I have to do and you know it's very exciting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I go to places, I get sold out audiences, I get standing ovations. You know, it's make America great again, that's the theme and that's what I'm saying, and that's what we're doing. And that's what we're going to do. We can make this country great again right now this country is laughed at and scoffed at all over the world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know, we do deals like Bergdahl, we get Bergdahl a traitor and they get five killers that they've been wanting for 10 years. You know, it's like... that's the kind of deals we make. The Iran deal, the nuclear deal is so horrible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's inconceivable. Now, we find out two days ago Don, that they have the right to inspect their own premises, and they'll report back to us as to whether or not they're doing anything wrong. Right? The whole thing is so ridiculous. The 24 day where you have to wait 24 days before you can go in and look.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the way that clock doesn't start ticking for a long time. It could be months and months before they ever get to inspect. And we left our prisoners over there, what kind of a deal is it where we leave our prisoners over there and we're giving them $150 billion. This is not a deal that I would make, okay.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let me put it that way.
<Don Imus> <Negative> [Inaudible], I'm talking with Donald Trump, at Imus, in the morning program. So you and Roger Ailes had had a phone conversation and then yesterday, Ailes, suggested that you apologize to Megan Kelly. What's your relationship with Ailes this morning?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it's a good word. I always like Roger, I spoke to him yesterday and I've always had a good relationship and I said, look I don't know, you know you do what you do, I do what I do. That's okay. You could put out your letter, and I'll put up my letter, we'll see, but you know I have a lot of respect for Roger Ailes is nobody like him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's been you know a friend of mine for a long time. And I thought I was treated unfairly at the debate as you know. I thought I was treated unfairly at other times. And I don't particularly think that Fox News treats me well, but some people think they know that they do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I, if you look at some of these pundits it's like where are these people coming from? But you know, I really like Roger. You know Roger, he's a terrific guy and I think Roger likes me. I mean, we're like friends but people have little disputes.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Here's what I wonder. Meghan Kelly is a friend of mine, and she and her husband I have been for... not as long as you have been. I don't mind, but both I would consider friends.
<Don Imus> <Positive> And in my view, she's an outstanding journalist and here's what I realize and you probably do as well. But the questions she ask you and we can all debate... well, we thought it was a fair question, in my view I thought it was a little harsh, but let me just say this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A little, did you say a little harsh?
<Don Imus> <Negative> Yes. Would you have wanted to be up there answering their question?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, of course not, but my point...
<Don Imus> <Neutral> By the way, with your wife sitting in the audience?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> My point is that that question was vetted by everybody at Fox from Roger on down. So Meghan Kelly didn't just decide in a vacuum to ask you that question. They all signed off on it. So why not, so why take it out just on her specifically?
<Don Imus> <Neutral> You know, I don't know how the question came about.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I do.
<Don Imus> <Positive> I don't want to get into the detail, and if you ask Roger, he'll tell you he did not know that question. Okay? And I accept him at his word, a 100% at his word. But Roger will tell you, he did not know what the questions were going to be. And I will certainly agree with that or accept that if I have to.
<Don Imus> <Negative> I just thought it was harsh. I think that you know they had 24 million people and that's before the final numbers come out, they could end up having a lot more than that, as you know, the final numbers that's going to be and I will tell you normally that have what two million people for a debate like that which is a lot of people also two million people, but two million is not 24 plus maybe another four or five in the end. I think that... now, I don't know I'm going to ask you this question.
<Don Imus> <Negative> They had two million normally for years, you know, every four years. If they had two million they went to 24 million. Do you think it was because of Senator Lindsey Graham was on the debate? Do you think it was because...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By the way, he called you an idiot yesterday.
<Don Imus> <Negative> ...because of Rick Perry, because Rick Perry was at [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, did you... Graham called you an idiot yesterday.
<Don Imus> <Negative> Look, this guy is... here's a guy who has zero in the... I don't even know how you can have... they interview...
<Don Imus> <Negative> on the polls thousands and thousands of people. How do you have zero? That means he didn't get one vote. I think he's really, really ashamed. You know I mean I think what he's done is very sad for his own persona and his own brand.
<Don Imus> <Negative> And I would imagine that this would be the last time you're going to see him as a senator. He's a disaster. You know in South Carolina, hey, Don, in South Carolina yesterday the polls came out. He was at four and I was at 30 or 30 or 35, but I think 30 and I beat him by 26 points, and I said that's his home state.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By the way in your conversation with Ailes yesterday. Did he ask you to apologize to Meghan Kelly?
<Don Imus> <Negative> No, I don't think so. I don't think so, actually. I think that we just have a dispute. He feels one way about her.
<Don Imus> <Negative> And I fully understand that. I feel another way, I think I was treated unfairly and it's not a big deal. I mean this is not something I would have brought up this morning with our phone call. But you brought it up and which is okay, but it's not a big deal to me.
<Don Imus> <Negative> I don't think about that. I'm off to a lot of other things. I mean I'm doing a lot of things. I have a lot of stuffs.
<Don Imus> <Positive> I have a lot of things on my mind that are very positive. I think very positive for the country. And I think that's why I'm leading in all the polls where we have ideas that are going to be great we're going to turn the country around.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Last night, speaking of Meghan Kelly, she has Ted Cruz that if a... a family... the two parents were in the country illegally, but the children were here, were U.S. citizens, but he deport all of them and he refused to answer the question.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What is your answer?
<Don Imus> <Negative> You know that, I heard that he refused to answer that question, it's a little surprised. Look we are a nation of laws. We're a nation of borders. We have to have borders, we have to have a wall, we have to have real...
<Don Imus> <Negative> now, and I will tell you something, we're also a nation where we have gangs all over the place. And you know, many of the toughest dudes in those gangs are illegal immigrants that come right across that border. If you go to Baltimore, you go to Chicago, Ferguson, St. Louis, you look at some...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don, you look at some of the gangs that they have. These are illegals that have come in and they're rough rough embrase and they're going to go out so fast. If I win they're going to be out of here so fast.
<Don Imus> <Negative> I understand that, but the question was what...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you agree with that one, right?
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Yes, but would you deport the entire family, the two...?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, let's put it this way. They're illegal immigrants. I heard Ted's answer and you know he's been very stronger...
<Don Imus> <Neutral> He wouldn't answer.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I heard that answer and very strong until last night which was interesting. The word is are they illegal immigrants? So they're here illegally. Some of them are fantastic people really good people, et cetera, et cetera. What I would do is take them out and expedite them coming back in illegally.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And what I can do and I'm a very good manager. You've known that about me for a long time. I really manage well. And I would get great people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But what I would do is get them out because it's unfair to other people that can't come into the country. It's very unfair to other people that cannot come in. I would get them out, and they would be expedited and they will come back in an expedited fashion if they're good. If they're not good, they're not coming back in.
<Don Imus> <Negative> At some point you're going to have to select somebody to run as a vice president, as a running mate, Is there anybody running for the Republican, anybody you're running against now, who you would pick as a running mate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It could be. Look, you know you hear me talking about you know, some of the people... you know the people that attacked me like Lindsey Graham, like our governor of Texas Perry, the ones that attacked me they all went down. That's one of the greatest compliment I ever had.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They attacked me viciously. They all went down. There are some people that I really respect on that platform, and I'm great.
<Don Imus> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd rather not. Well, I respect Ted Cruz. I do respect Ted Cruz. And you know you mentioned him, but I'd rather not too much because you know I'm competing...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> so I don't want to say, oh, they're great, but there are some people, there are some people you know on that platform that I do respect a lot, a large group of people. And it could be out of that group or it could be you know different from that group, but we're going to have to see what happens. I mean so far it's good, it's Bernard was talking about it last night. It's amazing what's happened.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And people want you know, when Obama used to say people want change, they got it. That's the wrong kind of change. They want the right kind of change. And I know how to make this country great.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Thanks for [Inaudible] program. Always, nice to talk with you. Thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you do have a great friend in Lupica. You just take care of yourself, okay?
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Donald Trump here in Imus, in the morning program. It's 10 minutes until the hour.
