<John Dickerson> <Negative> Mr. President, you and the administration said to North Korea, "Don't test a missile." They have tested a missile. Is the pressure not working?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I didn't say, "Don't test a missile." He's going to have to do what he has to do. But he understands we're not going to be very happy. And I will tell you, a man that I've gotten to like and respect, the president of China, President Xi, I believe, has been putting pressure on him also. But so far, perhaps nothing's happened and perhaps it has. This was a small missile. This was not a big missile. This was not a nuclear test, which he was expected to do three days ago. We'll see what happens.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> You say, "Not happy." What does that mean?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would not be happy. If he does a nuclear test, I will not be happy. And I can tell you also, I don't believe that the president of China, who is a very respected man, will be happy either.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Not happy mean military action?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. I mean, we'll see.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> The Chinese, our allies, have been allies with North Korea. How are you sure that they're not using this as a way to test you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You can never be sure of anything, can you? But I developed a very good relationship. I don't think they want to see a destabilized North Korea. I don't think they want to see it. They certainly don't want to see nuclear on -- from their neighbor. They haven't liked it for a long time. But we'll have to see what happens.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The relationship I have with China, it's been already acclaimed as being something very special, something very different than we've ever had. But again, you know, we'll find out whether or not President Xi is able to affect change.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Why do--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I hope he is.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Why do these missiles keep blowing up?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'd rather not discuss it. But perhaps they're just not very good missiles. But eventually, he'll have good missiles.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> You don't want to discuss it because maybe we have something to do with it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just don't want to discuss it. And I think you know me very well, where you've asked me many times over the last couple of years about military. I said, "We shouldn't be announcing we're going into Mosul." I said, "We shouldn't be announcing all our moves." It is a chess game. I just don't want people to know what my thinking is. So eventually, he will have a better delivery system. And if that happens, we can't allow it to happen.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> What do you make of the North Korean leader?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have -- I really, you know, have no comment on him. People are saying, "Is he sane?" I have no idea. I can tell you this, and a lot of people don't like when I say it, but he was a young man of 26 or 27 when he took over from his father, when his father died. He's dealing with obviously very tough people, in particular the generals and others.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And at a very young age, he was able to assume power. A lot of people, I'm sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle or anybody else. And he was able to do it. So obviously, he's a pretty smart cookie. But we have a situation that we just cannot let -- we cannot let what's been going on for a long period of years continue. And frankly, this should've been done and taken care of by the Obama administration. Should've been taken care of by the Bush administration. Should've been taken care of by Clinton.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> Let me ask you a question about the presidency. George W. Bush said this about being president. He said, "You think one thing going in, and then the pressures of the job or the realities of the world are different than you thought." Do you agree?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I can agree with that. I love doing it. I'm, you know, thoroughly enjoying it. It's always a challenge, like life itself is a challenge. But it's something that I really love and I think I've done a very good job at it.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> You said in an interview with Reuters that you thought it would be easier. Why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's a tough job. But I've had a lot of tough jobs. I've had things that were tougher, although I'll let you know that better at the end of eight years. Perhaps eight years. Hopefully, eight years. But I'll let you know later on. I think we've done very well with foreign policy. I think we've done very, very well with relationships with other leaders.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we're doing great on trade deals. It's set. And I think we're doing well. I mean, our country is being out-traded at every single point. We're losing tremendous amounts of money on trade. And I think actually, I've been very consistent. You know, it's very funny when the fake media goes out, you know, which we call the mainstream media which sometimes, I must say, is you.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> You mean me personally or?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, your show. I love your show. I call it Deface the Nation. But, you know, your show is sometimes not exactly correct. But when they talk about currency manipulation, and I did say I would call China, if they were, a currency manipulator, early in my tenure. And then I get there. Number one, they -- as soon as I got elected, they stopped. They're not -- it's not going down anymore, their currency.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> But that had been true before. That had been true--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> --during the campaign, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, not true to the extent that we're talking about. Much more important than that, as to when, but, you know, it did stop. And I was talking about it all during the campaign. And I would say that I was the one that got them to stop. But forget that.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> You were the one who got China--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He is working with us--
<John Dickerson> <Negative> --to stop manipulating their currency?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think so, during the campaign I talked about.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Even if they were doing it before?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, they were doing it before. I mean, there was no question. I mean, they were absolute currency manipulators before. But somebody said, "Oh, you didn't call him a currency manipulator." Now, you and I are just talking about how he's working -- I believe that President Xi is working to try and resolve a very big problem, for China also.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that's North Korea. Can you imagine if I say, "Hey, by the way, how are you doing with North Korea? Also, we're going to announce that you're a currency manipulator tomorrow." So the mainstream media never talks about that. They never say that. And that's, you know, unfortunate. It's just--
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Let me--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> --it's just one of many things, John.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> You're a negotiator. If you need something from somebody, you need China to help you with North Korea, doesn't that send a message to China, "We're not going to bug you about human rights, about intellectual property. In the South China Sea we're not going to put too much heat on you"? Aren't you breaking one of your own negotiating rules?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I think that, frankly, North Korea is maybe more important than trade. Trade is very important. But massive warfare with millions, potentially millions of people being killed? That, as we would say, trumps trade.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Let me ask you--
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay? You understand what I'm saying. And if I can use trade as a method to get China, because I happen to think that China does have reasonably good powers over North Korea. Now, maybe not, you know, ultimate, but pretty good powers. Now, if China can help us with North Korea and can solve that problem--
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Let me ask--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> --that's worth making not as good a trade deal for the United States, excuse me, right?
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> What do you know now on day 100 that you wish you knew on day one of the presidency?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, one of the things that I've learned is how dishonest the media is, really. I've done things that are I think very good. I've set great foundations with foreign leaders. We have you know -- NAFTA, as you know, I was going to terminate it, but I got a very nice call from a man I like, the president of Mexico.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I got a very nice call from Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada. And they said please would you rather than terminating NAFTA -- I was all set to do it. In fact, I was going to do it today. I was going to do as we're sitting here. I would've had to delay you. I was going to do it today. I was going to terminate NAFTA. But they called up and they said, "Would you negotiate?" And I said, "Yes, I will negotiate."
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> That's all you've learned, about the media? You knew from the campaign about the media. You said it all the time --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, but the media didn't cover it that way. The media said, oh, I didn't terminate NAFTA.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> So--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> First of all, if you look at my statements, I said--
<John Dickerson> <Negative> No, no, I meant--
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If I'm not able to renegotiate NAFTA, I will terminate NAFTA. Well, I'll make that statement right now.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Here's a question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I'm not able to renegotiate NAFTA, we will terminate NAFTA.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Let's step back a minute.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Presidents have to learn how to adapt. Every president comes into the job, it's different than they expect, they must adapt. Surely, you've learned something else other than that the media is dishonest.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, I'm just saying--
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> And how do you adapt?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> --it was one of my disappointments.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Give me another thing you learned that you're going to adapt and change because all presidents have to at this stage.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think things generally tend to go a little bit slower than you'd like them to go.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Just a system. It's just a very, very bureaucratic system. I think the rules in Congress and in particular the rules in the Senate are unbelievably archaic and slow moving. And in many cases, unfair. In many cases, you're forced to make deals that are not the deal you'd make. You'd make a much different kind of a deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're forced into situations that you hate to be forced into. I also learned, and this is very sad, because we have a country that we have to take care of. The Democrats have been totally obstructionist. Chuck Schumer has turned out to be a bad leader. He's a bad leader for the country. And the Democrats are extremely obstructionist.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All they do is obstruct. All they do is delay. Even our Supreme Court justice, as you know, who I think is going to be outstanding, Justice Gorsuch. I think that it was disgraceful the way they handled that. But, you know, I still have people, I'm waiting for them to be approved. Our chief trade negotiator. We can't get these people through.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> I want to get to--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are obstructionists. And you know what that's hurting? It's hurting the country.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> Let me ask you about health care -- Tucker Carlson interviewed you about six weeks ago when you were in the middle of health care negotiations. And you agreed with him that the health care bill wasn't going to help your supporters. That those who lived in rural areas, the older, were going to get hurt by that bill. And you told him--
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Excuse me, the health care bill is going to help my supporters.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> Well, hold on. Let me just finish the question, if I may, sir--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Otherwise, I'm not going to sign it. I'm not going to do it.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Well, this is why I wanted to ask you. You said to Tucker, "We will take care of our people, or I am not signing it." You said you were going to negotiate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's what I just said.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> So tell me what in the bill you've been negotiating to get--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But let me--
<John Dickerson> <Positive> --in that helps your supporters. I'm just trying to get the details of how your people--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let me just tell you.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> --will be helped.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I just watched another network than yours, and they were saying, "Pre-existing is not covered." Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I mandate it. I said, "Has to be."
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> So--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have, we're going to have lower premiums. And before you start there, let me just tell you something. Obamacare is dead. Obamacare right now, all the insurance companies are fleeing. Places like Tennessee have already lost half of their state with the insurance companies. They're all going. Obamacare, John, is dead. Okay, because we're being -- we're being compared to Obamacare. Just, so. Obamacare doesn't work--
<John Dickerson> <Negative> I just want to compare you to your own.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> One thing. No, no, it's important. I've got to compare it.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> No, no, but I want--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you were saying about Obamacare.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> No, but I'm not. I'm asking what--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> With Obamacare--
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> --you're going to do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> --the premiums are too high. The deductibles are through the roof, so you never get to use it. But more importantly, it's dead.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> So but in the bill, as it was analyzed, there were two problems. One, and you talked about this with Congressman Robert Aderholt, who brought you the example of the 64-year-old who under Obamacare the premiums--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But that was a long time ago, John.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> But has that been fixed?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Totally fixed.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> How?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How? We've made many changes to the bill. You know, this bill is--
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> What kind though?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> --very much different than it was three weeks ago.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> Help us explain because there are people--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The bill--
<John Dickerson> <Positive> --out there wondering what kind of changes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me explain. Let me explain it to you.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This bill is much different than it was a little while ago, okay? This bill has evolved. And we didn't have a failure on the bill. You know, it was reported like a failure. Now, the one thing I wouldn't have done again is put a timeline. That's why on the second iteration, I didn't put a timeline.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we have now pre-existing conditions in the bill. We have -- we've set up a pool for the pre-existing conditions so that the premiums can be allowed to fall. We're taking across all of the borders or the lines so that insurance companies can compete--
<John Dickerson> <Negative> But that's not in--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> --nationwide.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> --this bill. The borders are not in--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Of course, it's in.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> --this bill. It's in that third bill, right, because--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's in the second phase.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's called phase one, phase two. And that's, in effect, second phase, which will get approved, which will quickly get approved.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Let me--
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But let me just explain something. There will be such competition. Right now, there's no competition. There will be such competition by insurance companies so that they can get health care and the people taking care of health care.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> So--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The other thing we're going to have is groups. Groups of people can negotiate. What's going to happen is the competition is going to drive down the premiums. In my opinion, much, much more than people understand.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> So what you've just described is the bill that you previously had said you worried wouldn't help your people. And here's why I ask. You said, "Pre-existing conditions."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, there were things in the other bill, the first version, which were not as good.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But when I watch some of the news reports, which are so unfair, and they say we don't cover pre-existing conditions, we cover it beautifully.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Although--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you who doesn't cover pre-existing conditions. Obamacare. You know why? It's dead.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> In one of the fixes that was--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not going to be here.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> In one of the fixes it was discussed pre-existing was optional for the states--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sure, in one of the fixes. And they're changing it--
<John Dickerson> <Positive> --oh, okay. So it'll--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> --and changing.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> --be permanent?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Of course.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> Okay. Well, that's a development, sir. So you're saying it's going to be pre-existing to everybody?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> John, this has evolved over a period of three or four weeks. Now, we really have a good bill. I think they could have voted on Friday. I said, "Just relax. Don't worry about this phony 100 day thing. Just relax. Take it easy. Take your time. Get the good vote and make it perfect."
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Just to--
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Most importantly, we're going to drive down premiums. We're going to drive down deductibles because right now, deductibles are so high, you never -- unless you're going to die a long, hard death, you never can get to use your health care--
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Let me ask you something--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> --because the deductibles are so high.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Okay. So what I hear you saying is pre-existing is going to be in there for everybody, it's not going to be up to the states?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Pre-existing is going to be in there and we're also--
<John Dickerson> <Negative> And it's not up to the states?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> --going to create pools.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And pools are going to take care of the pre-existing.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> But on that crucial question, it's not going to be left up to the states? Everybody gets pre-existing, no matter where they live?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but the states--
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Guaranteed?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> --are also going to have a lot to do with it because we ultimately want to get it back down to the states.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> Okay. Is it a guarantee?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, because if you hurt your knee, honestly, I'd rather have the federal government focused on North Korea, focused on other things, than your knee, okay? Or than your back, as important as your back is. I would much rather see the federal government focused on other things--
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Let me.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> --bigger things. Now, the state is going to be in a much better position to take care, because it's smaller.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> People out there with pre-existing conditions, they are worried. Are they going to have the guarantee of coverage if they have a pre-existing condition or if they live in a state where the governor decides that's not a part of the health care, or that the prices are going to go up? That's the worry. The American Medical Association says--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We actually--
<John Dickerson> <Negative> --it could effectively make coverage completely unaffordable for people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> --we actually have, well, forget about unaffordable. What's unaffordable is Obamacare, John.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> So I'm not hearing you, Mr. President, say there's a guarantee of pre-existing conditions.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We actually have -- we actually have a clause that guarantees.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> Okay, excellent. We got there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have a specific clause--
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Let me ask you--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> --that guarantees.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> --about your tax plan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Tax plan came out this week. It's got some big deficit numbers. You've said that's going to be made up by growth. Congressional--
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, not only growth. It's going to be made up by better trade deals. It's going to be made up--
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Let me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> --by many different, reciprocal tax. As an example, we have countries where if we make a product and we send it to that country, they charge us 100% tax. If they make the same product and send it to us, we charge them nothing. You think that's smart? It's not.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> Look--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're going to come up with reciprocal taxes and lots of other things on those countries. But I view that more in trade. We're also going to fix all of our trade deals. We're going to have a very wealthy country again.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Let me ask you this, Mr. President. Congress may not go along with--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Always.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> --so they're going to try and find some spending. Let me ask you about the question of Medicare. They're going to want, in Congress, to make up on the spending side, to change Medicare. Will you allow that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're not going to have to do it.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> But, sir, will you allow it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're not going to have to do it. I'm just telling you we are--
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Does President Donald Trump want them not to do that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would much prefer them not to do that, that's right.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> It sounds as if, having covered you in the campaign, it sounds like you're leaving the door open. On the campaign, you were quite clear. You said, "I'm the guy who's not going to touch Medicare."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay, then let me more clear. I'm not going to touch it, because I said it. Now, waste, fraud and abuse, I'm going to touch. If there's something in Medicare that's been abused, I will touch that. There are certain things, as you know, that have been absolutely abused. There are certain provisions in Medicare that are horrible and abusive and there's been terrible things happening. So that kind of stuff, I will absolutely touch.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> So if I--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the concept of Medicare, I'm not touching.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> For me, if I have it now, or if I'm going to have it in the future, it's not getting cut?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Waste, fraud and abuse.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> And that's it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if there are things within Medicare that are being abused, I will touch that also.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Other than that, it's tightened up?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's right. That's what it is. But here's what we do. We're going to grow. The numbers just came out for Obama's last year. 1.6 GDP. That means nothing. That's, like, 1% GDP. So I have gotten to know as you know, I really get along with a lot of other countries. So I talk to the heads of countries. "How are you doing?" "Not well, not well." "Why?" "GDP is 8%. GDP is 9%. We are doing poorly." GDP -- Our GDP is, like, 1%.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> Let me ask you about your tax returns, sir. When your Treasury secretary was asked about whether you were going to release them, Secretary Mnuchin said, "The president has no intention." Is that right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I never spoke to him about it. Honestly, he's never asked me about it. I said, number one, I'm under audit. Right now, I'm under audit. After the audit is complete. It's a routine audit, but I have a very big tax return. You've seen the pictures. My tax return is probably higher than that from the floor. When you look at other people's tax return, even other wealthy people, their tax return is this big. My tax return is this high.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> I just wanted to make sure--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm under routine--
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> --you weren't changing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> --audit. And I think it's a very unfair thing because I have been under audit almost, like, since I became famous, okay?
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Have you--
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Not just political. I mean, I have been under audit, I'll bet you 12 or 13 or 14 years in a row. Now, I have friends that are wealthy people.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Let me ask you--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They've never been audited.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> You--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I think it's very unfair.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> You first said that you were under audit, were going to wait till that was done, about 14 months ago. That seems like a long time. When do you think this might happen? Are you asking them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It could happen soon. I don't know. I mean, I think--
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> When? Give me a sense of--
<Donald Trump> <Positive> --it's pretty routine, to be honest with you. But then I'll make a decision.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> A member of Congress suggested that a condition for getting tax reform would be releasing your tax returns. What do you think about that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I don't know who did that. I mean, I don't care who did that. These are the people, you know, the great obstructionists.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> So you're not buying that deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look where they are. Look where the Democrats have ended up. Hey, John, they had everything going. Now they don't have the presidency, they don't have the House, they don't have the Senate, and Schumer's going around making a fool out of himself.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> You said yesterday on Fox that Russia is a phony story. Which part of it is phony?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The concept of Russia with respect to us is a total phony story.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Meaning the Trump campaign?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Of course, it's a total phony story. In fact, I just heard where General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> But you don't mean--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me. I didn't realize this, when he went to Russia, it was 2015 and he was on the Obama clearance. When General Flynn came to us, as you now know, he already had the highest clearance you can have. I think the same clearance as the president of the United States would have. He had this really high clearance. And, by the way, they're so devastated because this only came up two days ago.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> Let me ask you this, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why wasn't this reported months ago?
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> I--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I watched one of your other competitors, and they were devastated--
<John Dickerson> <Positive> Look--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> --by this news, because you know what? That kills them. That's the end of that subject.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> You don't think it's phony that they, the Russians, tried to meddle in the election? You believe that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That, I don't know. I don't know.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> That you don't know or you do know?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I have a problem. You have Podesta, who, by the way, I understand has a company with his brother in Russia. Hillary's husband makes speeches in Russia. Hillary did a uranium deal with Russia. Nobody ever talks about that. But I don't know--
<John Dickerson> <Negative> You don't--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> --because the FBI was not allowed by Podesta to go in and check all of the records on their servers and everything else that you would normally have to check. That's number one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Number two, knowing something about hacking, if you don't catch a hacker, okay, in the act, it's very hard to say who did the hacking. With that being said, I'll go along with Russia. Could've been China, could've been a lot of different groups.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> So President Donald Trump is ambivalent--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it could've--
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> --about or not ambivalent, you're not just not sure?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. We have to find out what happened. I'd love to find out what happened.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> But you don't think it's the Russians--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can tell you one thing. Had nothing to do with us. Had nothing to do with this, and everyone knows it. And by the way, even my enemies on your show said, "We haven't found anything that the Trump campaign did wrong."
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> But--
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Do you agree with that?
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> But there is agreement in the intelligence communities and other places and investigative communities on the Hill that Russia was--
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm okay with it.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> --involved in the election.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Honestly, John, I'm okay. But why didn't Podesta and the Democrats, why didn't they allow the FBI to eject the server? They hired some company who somebody said some pretty bad things about, to go and check their server and give the information. So they were hacked. Why didn't they -- the Democrats allow the FBI? They told the FBI, "We are not going to allow you to do it." Why did they do that? Why did they do that, John? Why wouldn't they let the FBI go in and check? And by the way, why didn't the FBI complain about it?
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Mr. President, I think we're going to have to end it there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Mr. Trump, welcome back to Fox News Sunday.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> This may sound harsh, but are you in the process of blowing your campaign for president?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't think so. I just got great polls from NBC nationwide. I think that we're doing very well. Don't forget, you have been thinking about that or given me that question numerous times over the last, since June 16th. I've had that statement made many times, he just blew his campaign, only to end up having higher poll numbers.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But you like to talk about polls, let's talk about some. In a Wisconsin poll a month ago, you were leading Cruz by 10 points. In the same poll, the Marquette poll, out this week, you're now trailing Cruz by 10 points. In the latest FOX poll, 67 percent of women nationally now have an unfavorable view of you.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> If you had purposely set out to turn off voters, especially women voters over the last two weeks, I'm not sure you could have done a better job.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, you know, all I can do is do what I do. I'm self-funding my campaign. I'm not one of these politicians that's being controlled by the people that give them money. Believe me, they are totally controlled. I think I'm doing very well. Was this my best week? I guess not. I could have done without the retweet, et cetera, et cetera, but I think I'm doing OK.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> I want to talk to you about -- I want to talk to you about that. First of all, Wisconsin. How important is Wisconsin? How big a setback if you don't win there?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I'd like to win it. Is it a big setback? I would like to win it.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Do you think it would jeopardize your ability to get to 1,237?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It would always be better to win. I think I get there anyway, but I like Wisconsin, I like the people of Wisconsin, I think they like me, I've had tremendous crowds. We've had a tremendous response, and I think I'm going to do very well in Wisconsin.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> You say you've had better weeks. Let's talk about your comments this week, about what you would like to see if abortions became illegal. Here you are.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> [Begin Video Clip] Do you believe in punishment for abortion, yes or no, as a principle?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The answer is that there has to be some sort of punishment.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> For the woman?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes. There has to be some form. [End Video Clip]
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> It took you two written statements to clean that up.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it took me really two statements because they were sort of different statements and they were on different subjects.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But then the president of National Right to Life tweeted this, "The inept thing Donald Trump said about women who have abortions is making pro-lifers cringe." You did something pretty remarkable. You offended both the pro-life and the pro-choice movements with one statement.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, look, it was asked as a hypothetical, and talked about if it's illegal, and it was hypothetically asked.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But you gave that answer.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There would have been -- there would have been a very strong conservative, a very conservative group that would have said that was the appropriate answer. I'm not saying it was the appropriate answer. I'd say it's the doctor's fault or whoever performs the act, it's their fault. But there was a time when that would have been, and maybe today that would have been, but that was asked as a hypothetical question.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But why did you say the woman?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because it was asked hypothetically. I said the woman because it was asked hypothetically. I also corrected it and I made it very much so that I think everybody, it's acceptable now for everybody. But -- [Crosstalk]
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Do you agree it was a mistake?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I -- as a hypothetical question, I would have rather asked it -- you know, answered it in a different manner, yes. I would have rather answered it in a different manner.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> The growing knock on you, and you read everything, so you know this is what people are saying, is that you haven't thought these things through. You haven't studied, that you wing it too often. Do you think that's fair?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, let me just tell you. I've been a really successful businessman for a long time. I was never asked many questions. Like I was asked a question about NATO the other day by Wolf Blitzer. I think I gave a great answer. I said, it's obsolete, we spend too much money, we're not getting the benefits that we should be getting for the money.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're carrying a lot of countries, you have 28 countries, 68 years old. We are not being treated fairly by the world and I mean that. I've been a politician now for eight months.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> I understand.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm going to straighten out the country. We're going to make America great again. Politicians can't do that. I've been a politician for a very short period of time. I announced --
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> So, what are you saying, you've still got a learning curve?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There's always a learning curve. I don't care if you've been doing it all your life, there's a learning curve, especially with something like you're talking about NATO, when you're talking about -- because it is a very movable subject. I will say this: NATO is obsolete. NATO doesn't cover terrorism. NATO was based around the Soviet Union.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Wait, wait, OK, I was -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, no, but it's important to know, because when I talk about -- [Crosstalk]
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> OK, fine. Do you know how many NATO soldiers have died in Afghanistan helping us after the 9/11 attack on the U.S.? Do you know how many NATO soldiers have died?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm not saying -- I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I'm saying it's unfair --
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> A thousand is the answer.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Fine, I'm saying -- and it's a lot of soldiers. I'm saying it's a -- I'm saying it's unfair to us. It's unfair to us as a country.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But they've been defending us against terrorism.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Excuse me. We are paying so much money, disproportionately. We have countries that are being carried along. It's not fair to the United States, not fair to the citizens, and not fair to the taxpayers. And what I said was exactly right. Now when they cover it, they say, Donald Trump doesn't like NATO. I think NATO's fine.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think NATO has to be readjusted. I think we have to cover terrorism, because we're really not covering terrorism.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Well, in Afghanistan we are.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sure. But, we --
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Well, that counts, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have to -- excuse me. I'm sure it counts. But I'm saying, we have to be very specific on terrorism. NATO is no specific to terrorism. Why are we taking the burden of the cost when big beneficiaries are paying very little? And the reason is because they're ripping off the United States, just like everybody else that does business with us. They're ripping off our country, and that's why we owe $19 trillion.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> You talk about the fact that you've only been a politician for eight months, but there are other issues that you've gotten in trouble on in the last week or so that have more to do with just judgment and temperament. For instance, the fact that you spent days going after Ted Cruz's wife and her looks --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Excuse me, excuse me. Ted Cruz --
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Let me just ask --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Ted Cruz came after me --
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> No, he didn't.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, he did through my wife.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> No, he didn't.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He took a picture --
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> No, he didn't.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, of course he did, of course he did.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Do you have any evidence that he knew about the attack by the independent super PAC?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> My evidence is total common sense. He knew those people, those people are 100 percent for them, they coordinated together. I have no doubt about it in a million years. He did that attack -- and this was just --
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Even if it he did it, was it worth you spending -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, I would say probably not. If I had it to do again, I probably wouldn't have sent it. I didn't think it was particularly bad, but I probably wouldn't have sent it. But this was a response. This wasn't me starting something, this was a response.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> The Michelle Fields battery case, your campaign manager said he never touched her, you said she made it up. Then, one of your surveillance videos, I've got to say, you've got your places covered showed --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am very well covered. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I was very happy to give them that tape.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> To show the fact that he didn't touch her, and then you said this.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Begin Video Clip] I think it's something that's disgraceful. I think that you, as a reporter, and all of you as a reporter, probably get treated a lot rougher than that on a daily basis. [End Video Clip]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I agree with it.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Question: why not just apologize to her?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because --
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> I mean, he did grab her.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because let me tell you why: loyal person, number one.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> I'm not saying you fire him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And when she wrote out, early on, before she knew she was on tape, that it was that she was practically thrown to the ground, I mean, I wish I had it here, I'd read her statement --
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> I know what she said.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That didn't happen. OK? Do you agree with that?
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> I agree with you. But why not just apologize --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Excuse me, Chris, no, but she lied. Do you agree that she lied?
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> I think she completely misrepresented it early on. I do.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Early on is all that matters.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But why turn one day into two weeks?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Chris -- well, at least it shows I'm loyal, because the easiest thing for me to do would have been to destroy that man's life. And I would have fired him immediately. Had she fallen to the ground, or almost fallen to the ground like she said -- she didn't even change the expression on her face. She kept walking.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> So, you have no regrets about letting this thing go on for two weeks?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Chris, I think, frankly, I don't think she would have accepted that. I think she would have used that as ammunition against. A lot of times, when you apologize, they use it as ammunition against. The easier thing would have been, Corey, you're fired. You're not very good at that, OK? But I don't want to ruin him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The man has a wife and four beautiful children. He lives in New Hampshire, he's a good person. I don't want to destroy him.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> You weighed in this week on foreign policy national security. Here is what you said about Japan and South Korea defending themselves against North Korea. Here it is.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> [Begin Video Clip] So you have no problem Japan and South Korea having nuclear weapons?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> At some point, we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea. We're better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself -- [End Video Clip]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What do they have to pay us? We're defending Japan. We can't afford it. We're a better nation.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> I understand that. But that's the question -- that's not the question. The question is, letting them develop their own nuclear program. For more than half a century, U.S. policy has been that we protect those countries with our nuclear umbrella so they don't --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And lose a fortune.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> I understand, but the idea is not to have a nuclear arms race in the Northern Pacific, on the Korean peninsula.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Are you ready?
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> You want to throw that all away.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Are you ready? No, no, I'm not throwing anything away. This is common sense. This is like trade. We lose on every trade deal. Sometimes you're better off saying, hey, wait a minute. We're defending Japan, we're -- I mean, what we're doing is costing us a fortune, and not only Japan, South Korea. We have 28,000 soldiers on the line.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And part of that defense is nukes, right? At some point, they have to pay us, because we cannot continue --
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But they do pay us.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They pay us peanuts.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> They pay us almost $1 billion, South Korea. I think $2 billion in Japan.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's peanuts compared to what we're talking about and compared to the real threat.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> You want to have a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In many ways, and I say this, in many ways, the world is changing. Right now, you have Pakistan and you have North Korea and you have China and you have Russia and you have India and you have the United States and many other countries have nukes.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Understood.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's not like, gee whiz, nobody has them. So, North Korea has nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> With nukes?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Maybe they would be better off -- including with nukes, yes, including with nukes.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> In South Korea, with nukes?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> South Korea is right next door, just so you understand.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But that means you can have a nuclear arms race on the Korean Peninsula.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You already have it, Chris. You already have a nuclear arms race. When a guy like Kasich gets up and talks about, Trump wants to give everybody missiles -- I don't want to give missiles. And by the way, I'd leave it the way it is, ideally. My number one choice is, leave it the way it is, but they have to pay us because we cannot afford to continue to lose the billions and billions of dollars that we're losing in order to defend Japan and Germany and South Korea and Saudi Arabia.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> This week, you said you no longer continue to pledge that you will support the Republican nominee for president. Then on Thursday, you had a meeting with the RNC that you said was very nice and they treated you well. So, are you pledging to support the nominee or not?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I will be looking at who the nominee is and I think people will be very happy with my decision.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But here's the point. In South Carolina, it turns out, you took a pledge to support the nominee. If you break that pledge, then you lose all those delegates. So, are you going to keep the pledge or not?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What the real point I made, and that whole transaction or, you know, talking point that you're talking about, was that I release Ted Cruz. He does not have to endorse me if I win. I think I'm going to win, but he doesn't have to endorse me. I don't need his support. I have the support of the people.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But you still need their support if you're going to beat the Democrats. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look, I was very popular in North Carolina.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Don't you want a united party?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'd like to see a united party, but I also watched the turmoil in his brain when they were talking about Trump and support and, well, I don't, oh, you know, he's going crazy. All I want to do is relieve the pressure. This man does not react well under pressure. I've watched him. He's a basket case. So, in order to relieve the pressure, I'm telling you, Ted, don't worry about it, you don't have to endorse me.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Are you ruling out running as an independent third party candidate? Are you ruling that out?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look, I'm by far the frontrunner as a Republican. I want to run as a Republican. I will beat Hillary Clinton.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But if you don't get the nomination?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're going to have to see how I was treated. I'm going to have to see how I was treated. Very simple.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> So you're not ruling it out?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I just want to be treated -- it's not a question of win or lose. It's a question of treatment. I want to be treated fair.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> After the last two weeks, after all of these controversies, and plans to change your campaign? Any plans to lay off the personal attacks? Any plans, maybe, to study some of these issues more?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Originally when I went out with 17 people, we're down now to three. I have two leftovers, OK? I call them leftovers. They haven't been nice to me. I will beat them. After I beat them, I'm going to be so presidential, you're going to be so bored, you're going to say, this is the most boring human being I've ever interviewed.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Mr. Trump --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> It's always interesting. I don't think you could be dull even if you wanted to be.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think I if I act very presidential, it'll be dull. But that will be fine. [End Interview]
<Charles Feldman> <Negative> What about also those that also say that your being, in recent months, awfully thin-skinned?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Video Cut] I've always been thin skinned. I've been thin skinned from day one. When people say something false, I attack those people. Because the news gets away with murder. The news media, they get away with murder. [Video Cut]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's very tough in terms of libel laws, because the media is so protected, and it's ridiculous that they're so protected, but they can write virtually anything. The difference is with me, at least, they pay some price, and I think more people should have that attitude, and I think you'd find a lot more accurate reporting, including yours.
<Charles Feldman> <Negative> What was inaccurate so far?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought your demeanor was inaccurate. I thought that questions that you were posing to people in my organization were inaccurate, and false and unfair.
<Charles Feldman> <Neutral> Well, questions by definition can't be inaccurate. They're questions.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I think, I think the questions themselves were put in such a way that... that made them statements, and they became statements, as opposed to questions, and I think that's not good reporting.
<Charles Feldman> <Neutral> Such as?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It doesn't matter. I mean I don't, I don't think your viewers would be very interested in it, nor do I want to embarrass you.
<Charles Feldman> <Negative> I don't think I would be, but let's talk about what we talked about yesterday. Those in the financial community I'm talking about, and we talked about this on the phone, who have said, and this is them saying this, not me
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is them? What do you mean by them? This is one or two people, and what about the positive people?
<Charles Feldman> <Negative> Five or six. [Video Cut] But the ones who said negative things and...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Here we are. Back to the negative.
<Charles Feldman> <Negative> Back to the negative.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what? Do the interview with somebody else.
<Charles Feldman> <Neutral> But we talked about this yesterday on the phone? This is exactly...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do the.. Do the interview with somebody else, really. Here, you don't need this. Do it with somebody else, and have a good time. Because, frankly you're very negative guy and I think it's very unfair reporting. Good luck.
<Charles Feldman> <Negative> I disagree with you. Sorry you feel that way. There's nothing that we didn't discuss on the phone, Donald.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, nice to talk to you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hello, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, we had all hoped for better job numbers at the end of the week. Well, of course, we're always hoping for better job numbers. But I'm curious, your assessment and what it means long term and how it reflects on what's going on in the economy now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, the numbers obviously were not good. And yet the way they're recording the numbers is even worse because it actually shrunk. Everything shrunk. The actual percentage should have gone up instead of down. But regardless, there's nobody that's saying the numbers were good.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Now, you say the way they're recorded -- I mean, that's just sort of the natural way that we have historically recorded the numbers. Like, it isn't like there's some sort of game going on with the -- - with the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the Labor Department, right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, in the old days, when you had jobless numbers, you'd get real jobless numbers. And today when you get them, you don't know what they are. You don't know what they represent, people getting out of looking for a job because they're just tired of it because they can't find one. And all of a sudden, those numbers aren't being recorded.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So people that gave up looking for a job, those numbers are no longer reflected. Not good. And it's not accurate.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, unemployment typically a lagging indicator. Numbers weren't good last week, but probably more disturbing is the sort of the sluggish numbers -- the numbers indicating that the economy is sluggish. It's not robust. It's not going recover quickly, at least it doesn't look like right now. Am I right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I've heard, according to some of the so-called great economists, if there is such a thing, that this is the weakest recovery that they've ever seen or the weakest one that they've seen at least since World War II. So it is not certainly much of a recovery, if it's a recovery at all.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, do you assign that responsibility for the weak recovery to President Obama or just simply the way -- the difficulty of trying to get an economy up and roaring? And do you think that a President Mitt Romney would do -- would do anything differently in terms of the robust nature of the economy?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think you have to give a president credit when things are good and you have to give them sort of a little bit of a scolding when things aren't so good. And things are not good for the country. We're not a vibrant country, like we once were. As you know, I just got back from Europe. And I looked at different places, and it's amazing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I stopped at Istanbul. It's through the roof. I went to the country of Georgia. It's like everybody in the world is studying it to find out what they're doing. They're going up like rocket ships. And in the meantime, we're doing going down and we're not -- you know, we're not, obviously, doing very well.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So it's sort of interesting. They took our old philosophy and they're really doing very well with it. And I guess we took their old philosophy and we're not doing so well.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, to take a word you just used, "scolding" -- do you give President Obama a scolding? And is it something that he is deliberately doing or is this an ideology or is it just bad luck because of the nature of the economy? What is it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I don't want on to use the word "scolding" when it comes to a president. He's trying to do something, and nobody knows exactly what that is, but I'm sure he does. And it's sort of not working. It's not working for the country. It's not working for jobs. It's not working for employment. And I think it's probably working for other countries because they're taking our jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, so many other countries are doing what we used to do right here, whether it's outsourcing or whether it's certain countries making our products. We just don't really make what we used to make anymore.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, when the economy is sluggish, though, is there anything different -- I know you've endorsed Governor Mitt Romney, but could he make a profoundly different strategy or some up with a different idea -- would it be profoundly different with -- in your opinion, with a President Mitt Romney?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think absolutely. For one thing, he understands what China is doing for us. And one of the reasons I endorsed him is I watched what his stance was on China. It really took place during one of the debates, and then I realized that he's very strong on not allowing China to get away with what they're getting away -- the manipulation of their currency, making it impossible for us to do business with them.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But the reverse is always, you know, like, easy, like we're a bunch of patsies. And I saw this. So that's one thing. I know his stance on OPEC is very strong. But more importantly, I know his stance on drilling and taking the energy that we have right under our feet. It is very, very strong. That would make a huge difference for this country.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You mentioned China. Would you have handled the issue or -- well, I guess it's sort of an ongoing issue with the blind Chinese dissident.? Give me your assessment of how that's been handled by the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look, I think we are devoting more time to the dissident, and we don't know this dissident. We don't know. Does he love this country or does he not? He's certainly using the country very well. I'd rather devote more time to what they're doing to us economically because they're trying to destroy us economically than us worrying about their dissidents because we don't know this dissident.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have no idea who he is and what he represents. And yet we're willing to go to war over this individual dissident, but when it comes to them sucking out trillions dollars from our country, we're not willing to do much about that. So I think we have our priorities a little bit turned around.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> So that nobody grabs this sound bite and misuses it, by you mean -- "go to war," you mean a fight. You don't mean a real war over this one dissident. You're not -- you don't mean to suggest... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it's a war. It's not a war with bullets, but it's certainly a war. Maybe some day, it ends up with bullets because, frankly, they're building a military like you wouldn't believe. They're building a navy and they're trying to do it very quietly, but they're building a navy and ships like nobody ever thought was possible.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So you know, but we -- I use the "war" in a financial sense and an economic sense, at least for now.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, suppose -- suppose, though, that your president or Governor Romney, your candidate, were president and we got the call -- we're in China -- that -- we got the call that this dissident needs to go to get picked up. Now, he was picked up, apparently, brought -- picked up by us, brought to the U.S. embassy.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And what I've just read recently on the wires, that he showed up at the U.S. embassy bleeding profusely and that the State Department feared that he had an advanced case of colon cancer. So they as soon as they could got him to the hospital. Now, does that in any way sort of complicate things how you would handle this in terms of how this has developed because I think a lot of people are very critical, or at least some people, of how this has been handled?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look, human rights is always very important. But how many countries are we going to be running? If you're talking about human rights, we could name right off the bat 20 countries that are probably worse than China, if that's possible. So are we supposed to be running the world? In the meantime, we have $16 trillion in debt.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We don't know what we're doing. We're losing a fortune every year, trading with people that we used to beat and now we're losing to them, every single one of them. So you know, really, are we going to be the policeman of morality for the rest of our lives throughout the world? I don't think we can do that and...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> So would you have ignored -- so would you have ignored him? How you would have handled it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I wouldn't have ignored anything. I would have said, Look, you know, let's get going here. What's going on? Now, you know, when you say colon cancer, this is the first I've heard of that one. He's a very young guy, but it's certainly the first I've heard of that one. But you know, somebody walks into our embassy and we're supposed to end up fighting like hell for the person.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We don't know who the person is!
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, I don't -- it just says that they suspected. Its said that he was bleeding. They don't -- I don't know if there's been an official diagnosis. But that's sort of what has set off the chain of events to send him to the hospital, apparently. All right...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, we can't be the morality factor for every single nation throughout the world and what they do and how they do it and how they treat their people. We have enough time treating our people fairly.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Do you see some sort of link, though, between having a robust economy, being strong economically, and being very successful in the world and thus having some sort of almost moral leadership with it? Are those connected to you at all?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think they're connected. I think if we were the country that we were, that we used to be, where China respected us and tried to be like us, and many other countries respected us, you wouldn't have these kind of problems. The level -- the word "respect" is very, very important. You wouldn't have the kind of problems.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There is a total lack of respect for our country that, frankly, until a number of years ago, we never had. We were on top of the heap. We're not on the top of the heap anymore. We're not respected as a nation like we once were. And if we were, things like this wouldn't be happening with such regularity.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Last night, Charles Barkley, who's an analyst for TNT at the Celtics-Hawks game -- and this was a game that Governor Mitt Romney attended -- he said this, apparently, on the -- over the broadcast. Let me play the sound bite for you and get your thought.
<Charles Barkley> <Neutral> [Begin Video Clip] Mitt Romney...
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> [Inaudible] at the game [Inaudible] [End Video Clip]
<Charles Barkley> <Neutral> [Inaudible] listen baby, we're going to beat you like a drum in November. Don't take it personally. I like -- he seems like a nice guy. But you're going down, bro.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Any problem with sort of mixing sports, broadcasting comments about it, or is that all in good fun and good politics? You got a problem with it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, Charles is friend of mine and he's actually a great guy. And he's having fun and he obviously -- he's supporting President Obama and he's having a little fun. Look, there are many bad things said about Obama, many bad things said about Romney, and that's just the way it is. I know Charles. He's a great guy, and he means nothing by it, other than, obviously, he's not supporting Mitt Romney.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, big surprises in Europe over the weekend. There is a new French president. President Sarkozy lost the election. How is that going to change things? Or what's your prediction?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, the big questions is how long will Carla Bruni stay with Sarkozy? That's to me the big question, OK, of all of it. How long will...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Do you have a prediction on that? Do you have a prediction on how long his wife will stick it out?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Personally, I don't think too long, but these are minor details, OK? We'll see what happens with France. France has a very, very new and untested product. And it's not going to be, I think, a very good thing for the free world as we know it. It's not going to be very good thing for entrepreneurship. It's not going to be a very good thing for free enterprise.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This is somebody that wants to tax people into oblivion. I think it's going to be very negative, much more negative than a lot of people are saying.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, we -- it's very important to us, is it not, how Europe does financially. I mean, we're now a global economy, so for better or for worse, we're linked together. And do you see the change in France, and of course, the impact it might have with Chancellor Merkel in Germany -- do you see that as having sort of any big sort of European effect that may then have an impact on us?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think it's very negative for the world. I think it's very negative for the part of the world that we know. But just remember these countries all bound together, they all got together in order to hurt the United States. They wanted to create something as big or bigger than the United States, so they could do Airbus and they could do lots of different companies that would compete against Boeing and other of our companies.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So when you look what's really happening -- and I've said it a long time and I've said it loud and clear, we have a chance to even go bigger and better if they get weaker. But we'll see what happens. In the meantime, Germany is trying to take over the world economically. They weren't able to do it militarily.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I think a lot of countries are going to go back to their own currency, and I think the euro is going the way of dust. I don't think the euro's going to be around too long. You can't impose this kind of austerity on people when the people aren't used to it. Now, a depression can do that. When the depression comes, if that should happen, then everybody gets it. But you can't have somebody that's doing very well that's living in a place say, By the way, from now on, everybody's going to get it. It just doesn't work that way from a human standpoint.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, let me bring -- let me bring up a question based on what you said. It's sort of a historic sensitivity. You said that Germany didn't take over the world militarily, which I assume is a historic reference, but you say they're trying to do it economically?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, if you look what's happening with the euro, who's dominating it and who's buying out the debt and who's the one really calling the shots, it's Germany. They're doing unbelievably well as a country. They are doing very well because of the euro and what's happened. But other countries, whether it's Spain or Italy or certainly Greece, I guess, would be the worst of all -- you look what's going with them -- now, I'm not blaming Germany, but I think Greece made a terrible mistake going into the euro.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They should have kept their currency and [Inaudible] something out. But you look at what's going on. Germany is dominating the euro. And I think Germany likes it, but they may be in it too deep.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, Spain has unemployment record right now of 24 percent, which is horrible. You've got Italy. You've got Greece. You've got a change in leadership in France. And do you see Germany as -- when you say that they're trying to take over economically -- do you see it as they're trying to sort of help the economy of Western Europe and all the nations in the EU, or you seem them as trying to take it over?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I'm trying to understand what you mean.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, I think Germany is trying to help Germany. And I think that's -- was, you know, one of the primary creators and the primary creator of the euro to start off with. And again, this was done not for the betterment of the United States. This was done for the betterment of Germany and those countries that participated, so they could better compete with the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So now it's going bad. I think it's an experiment that has to fail. We'll see what happens, but I think many of the currencies and many of the countries will go back to their own currency.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, the enthusiasm factor in the 2012 election -- - and tell me if you think that this is any indicator. President Obama spoke to -- made this announcement on Saturday in an 18,000 arena, only 14,000 showed up. Of course, he was competing with a big hockey game. You've got President -- you've got Governor Romney, who's -- who's got a very sort of -- he's got a big tent now.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> He's got the Tea Parties and he's got the evangelicals and he's got the others within his party. Do you see 2012 as either candidate being able to get that incredible enthusiasm to get voters out to vote?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look, I think there's going to be enthusiasm on both sides. I don't think the president will have the kind of enthusiasm that he had four years ago. You had the youth that was all going crazy over change. Now they've gotten change and they're saying, Wow, is this what change is all about? It's not working.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I do think there'll be enthusiasm on both sides. I can tell you, from the Mitt Romney standpoint, there's tremendous enthusiasm.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, which would be a better strategic choice for Governor Romney as vice president, somebody who has a background in politics or somebody who has a background in business, in recognition of the fact that he himself is a business guy?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't think you can answer the question. I think there are some great people in politics, some great people in business. I don't think you could actually answer. You'd would have to be specific. There are some people that I think would be tremendous. I don't want to go into it right now, but there are some people that I think really could be great.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I think there are some people with tremendous minefields around them that would not be good and would not be a good choice. But there are some people that really -- both in politics and business that would be terrific.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, who'd be the biggest with the minefield? I got to ask you that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I can't tell you that, but maybe for another day. But there are some. There's no question about it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, we'll save that for another day. Donald, thank you, as always.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you very much, Greta.
