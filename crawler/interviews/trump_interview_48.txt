<Lawrence Smith> <Negative> Mr. President, Louisville's mayor sent you a letter urging action on gun control. Senator McConnell also getting pressure in that regard, after the mass shootings. What are you prepared to support, in terms of gun control?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're doing background checks. We already have a lot of background checks. You know, we've done the FixNICS program and a lot of other things, but we're doing some loopholes and we're doing some changes, and I think it's going to be quite good. I think it'll be very popular with a lot of people. We always have to protect our Second Amendment.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very importantly, we have to make sure that there's no slippery slope where they end up taking your protection away. We won't let that happen. And we're working very much with Mitch and everybody else on getting something done that's meaningful, but that really protects gun owners, because that's very important, because, you know, if you go along a certain path, you won't have any form of protection and you won't have your Second Amendment.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And with me, you're always going to have your Second Amendment. You have to remember -- and I think it's very important to say -- the gun doesn't pull the trigger. You know that. It's the person that pulls the trigger, and we have a tremendous mental health problem, and we're going to be working on that as well.
<Lawrence Smith> <Positive> You're about to talk to a bunch of veterans. I talked to several yesterday, and their big concern is health care for veterans -- access and quality. What are you prepared to tell them about that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we've done a lot for the vets, especially with choice. You know, before I came, you didn't have Veterans Choice. Now you have Veterans Choice, which nobody in their wildest dream really thought -- they've been trying to get it for 44 years, and I got it for the veterans. So, the veterans are liking me a lot and I like them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, now if they have to wait on a line -- you know, they were waiting three, four, five weeks to see a doctor. Now, if there's a wait, they go out, they see a doctor, we pay for the cost of it. And, it's the least important thing, but frankly, we save money, and we take care of our vets, and that's a good combination.
<Lawrence Smith> <Positive> You're here, of course, also, to support Governor Matt Bevin. Does he need your support to win next fall?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know, but he's been a terrific governor. He's really done a good job. In fact, he's done such a good job that some people weren't happy. He had to straighten out the pensions or the state was going to have a lot of problems, and he really has worked very hard. He loves the state, as I do, and he asked me to come, and I'm coming for him, in his honor.
<Lawrence Smith> <Neutral> You'll return again in the future for a larger rally --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think -- well, I'll be in Kentucky a lot, including for Mitch. You have a great gentleman in Mitch McConnell. I mean, he's done more for the court system -- you look at what's happening. We'll have 150 federal judges appointed, approved, all through the Senate. We'll have 150 within a couple of weeks, and we'll end up with 179 before we start going again, and nobody thought this was possible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And of course, two great Supreme Court judges, and Mitch McConnell and I worked very hard.
<Lawrence Smith> <Negative> You're very popular in Kentucky. You didn't win Louisville, though. What do you do to appeal to urban voters -- to get them to take a look at you and your policies and -- [Inaudible] some of the ways they view you, which you know?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I used to bat with a Louisville Slugger. [Laughter] No bat like it. So, I used to use a Louisville Slugger, so maybe they know that and they -- they feel differently. I think that we're doing very well in Kentucky. I mean, I'm many, many points up and, you know, really at the top of the heap in that sense, and I love the people of Kentucky, and I think we're going to do very well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think, just generally speaking, that's why I'm here. I mean, Matt asked me to come and see if we could help him out, and he's in a very tight race, but I think it's a race he's going to win, because he's really been a great governor.
<Lawrence Smith> <Negative> What do you say to appeal to African-Americans, who look at you skeptically, frankly?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think with the African-Americans, our poll numbers have been very good. We have the best job rating we've ever had,in terms of unemployment numbers. The unemployment for African-Americans are the lowest they've ever been in the history of our country, and if you look at jobs, we have 160 -- almost 160 million jobs for the country, the highest number we've ever had.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So -- also, criminal justice reform. I got that done. Nobody thought it could be done. I'm the one who got that done. You know, with all the talk you hear about other people, and other people that are going to do it, I'm the one that gone criminal justice reform done, and opportunity zones -- I got that done with Tim Scott -- very largely with Tim.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Tim is a fantastic man, who is, as you know, a senator with South Carolina, and we worked on that very hard, and opportunity zones have been incredible, and African American folks just think it's incredible, what's happened. But, lowest unemployment number in history for African Americans.
<Lawrence Smith> <Positive> Your final word -- message -- to the people of Louisville and Kentucky as you come to our state again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's a state I love. It's a state I won -- very... by a lot. I mean, not by a little bit, but by many, many, many points, as you know, and far beyond the relationship just to Republicans and Kentucky. It's a special place. I have so many friends here and I, you know, I expect to do very well in Kentucky.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hope so.
<Lawrence Smith> <Neutral> One last question.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Lawrence Smith> <Negative> We have an opioid problem here as you know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Lawrence Smith> <Negative> What are you prepared to do to help with that serious addiction problem that many Kentuckians are suffering?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right. We're spending billions of dollars. I have billions of dollars approved. And, as you know, we're down about 17 percent from what it was a year and a half ago, with the opioid, and opioid is a serious problem. One of the things we're doing is trying to come up -- and we're pretty close, I think -- to a painkiller with -- that's not addictive.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This opioid stuff is just horrible. You go to the hospital, you have a broken arm, you end up being a drug addict, you're addicted so quickly. So, we're working on -- through various things that we do, including grants of money. And I -- it's really at my direction. I want to come up with a painkiller that's not addictive, and we're very close.
<Lawrence Smith> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Lawrence Smith> <Positive> Nice talking to you again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great interview.
<Lawrence Smith> <Positive> Enjoy your stay here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> Mr. President, are you -- are you with us?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am with you. Hi, Joe.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Hi. Great to have you on thank you for calling in I guess Mr. Brilliant, who was on from the chamber of commerce, you got to see a part of that interview, Mr. President what did you make of it? Or what was the points that you had a problem with that he was trying to make there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I guess he's not so brilliant. Look, without tariffs, we would be captive to every country, and we have been for many years. That's why we have an $800 billion trading deficit for years. We lose a fortune with virtually every country. They take advantage of us in every way possible, and the U.S. Chamber is right there with them, and I assume, and I'm a member of the U.S. Chamber -- maybe I'll have to rethink that, because when you look at it, the chamber is probably more for the companies and the people that are members than they are for our country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because without tariffs, we would be absolutely, outside of something that I won't even mention, we would be absolutely in a competitive disadvantage, the likes of which you've never seen. Now, people haven't used tariffs, but tariffs are a beautiful thing when you're the piggy bank, when you have all the money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everyone's trying to get our money, China -- and the China deal's going to work out you know why. Because of tariffs. Because right now China is getting absolutely decimated by companies that are leaving China, going to other countries, including our own, because they don't want to pay the tariffs. And China will, in my opinion, based on a lot of facts and a lot of knowledge, China's going to make a deal because they're going to have to make a deal.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> Mr. President, the deal that you arrived at on Friday with Mexico -- there's something you've alluded to that you haven't made clear that you're going to make it clear later on something that was also included and you heard some of the criticism that you then levied some criticism at "The New York Times" for them saying that this was all in the works and nothing happened from the tariffs.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> Can you go into exactly what else was part of that deal that you haven't really outlined yet?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm going to tell you that most people understand that the people having to do with borders and illegal immigration and immigration of any kind, they understand exactly what that is. But we purposely said we wouldn't mention it for a little while. It's going to be brought up because it has to be brought by their legislative body.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's got to be taken to a vote. So we didn't bring it up, but most people know that answer, Joe. And it's another very powerful tool in addition to the very powerful tools we got. We had none of these tools -- or virtually none, or they were just being talked about. They've been talked about for 20 years with Mexico, until I said -- and it wasn't a threat.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought we would be receiving billions of dollars, frankly and you know what happens with tariffs, companies will move out of Mexico and they'll move out of china, and they'll come into the United States or other countries also. But in the case of Mexico, I say we'd get virtually 100% of the companies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They make a product and they sell it into our country. We lose a tremendous amount of money every year with Mexico for years, we've lost over $100 billion a year on trade with Mexico and of course, then we get into the second problem we have with Mexico, which maybe frankly is the first, and that's drugs and drugs coming across the border.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, we want to have very, very powerful borders, and you can't do it unless you have these deals with Mexico. And "The New York Times" wrote a story, like I already made the deal. It's nonsense. We talked about it for months and months and months, and they wouldn't get there, and we just said, hey, look, if you don't get there, we're just going to have to charge you hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes and we would have been just fine, because what would have happened -- you know, all these babies, these -- I don't know if they can honestly believe it -- you got it, Joe.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I noticed you were just about 80% there. Not quite 100%, but you were 80% there. But what will happen is the companies will move into the United States, back where they came from. They took 30% of our automobile companies, of our carry companies. They moved into Mexico. All of the people got fired. They would all move back if they had to pay a 25% tax or tariff.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They would all move back. It's a very simple formula. Now, that would leave Mexico in an unbelievably bad position. We don't want that either. And I spoke with the President of Mexico. I get along with him very well, and we made this deal. But this is something the U.S. Has been trying to get for over 20 years with Mexico.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They've never been able to do it. As soon as I put tariffs on the table, it was done. It took two days.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> A lot of times I just -- you know what devil's advocate is, and with Myron, he just made it -- he was so dogmatic about never use tariffs, so I was kind of kidding around with him and pushing back. But 80% is good. That's a good grade for me. I'll take it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Joe, he's protecting companies who are members -- he's got most of them --
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> They're worried about their quarterly results.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's not protecting our country. He's doing a very big disservice and frankly, I've never had support from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce because they know where I stand on these things. I don't need money. I don't care how things are. The only thing I care about is our country. And he's protecting all of those companies that are members that like it just the way they are.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they have companies in Mexico and they have companies in China. I mean, if you look at what General Motors did, they moved so much into China. Well, they can't be happy about paying tariffs like we're charging, 25% for cars. General Motors was charging 45%. If you look at what was going on, they built -- they built massive car factories, automobile plants in China.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, what happened is China has a tariff for 45%. We have a tariff of basically zero. It's 2.5%, but basically it's zero. So, they sell us a car, it comes right into our country, no problem. We sell them a car, we have to pay 45%. It doesn't work that way, and it's not working that way anymore. And a lot of companies -- and I will say this -- companies and countries, but a lot of countries have changed their habits because they know they're next.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Without the power of tariffs by the richest, most successful country -- you know, we've picked up trillions of dollars in worth since I've been elected. China has lost many, many trillions of dollars. They're way behind. They were going to catch us. Had a democrat gotten in, namely, the one we're talking about, China would have caught us by the end of her term.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're nowhere close. They'll never catch us. Not with what I'm doing. They'll never catch us.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> Mr. President, most economists, and I know you've heard this, I don't know how you've responded, but most economists say it's a tax on U.S. consumers. Tariffs are simply a tax on U.S. consumers. They hurt U.S. consumers. How do you respond? And even, I think one of your guys and one of our guys, Larry Kudlow, kind of conceded that at least a major part of it could be on the U.S. consumer.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> How do you respond to that? Because I know you've heard the economists say that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sure. I hear it all the time and I hear the other also. But I hear it all the time. And with Larry, in all fairness to Larry, they didn't let him finish his answer. He had further to go and nobody put that on. He put some of it on, but they didn't put it on the way that they should have. So, you know, that was a little bit of the media.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, it depends on what country you're talking about. If you're talking about China, it's different than Mexico. China will subsidize their product because they want to keep people working. So, China is going to pay a lot. We have put 25% on $250 billion of Chinese goods coming into our country, including $50 billion of high-technology equipment and things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You haven't seen any, or virtually any price increase, because what China does -- it's basically their companies -- they subsidize their companies because they want to keep people working, they want to stay competitive. We have another $300 billion to go with China. I haven't done that because it's a very big thing for them, not for us. For us, it's not going to matter because we'll be able to buy the product in other countries that don't have the tariffs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it's not going to have an effect. With Mexico, what's going to happen is all the companies would immediately move into the United States. You'd have car plants going up all over our country, and there would be no tariff. So from my standpoint, it's a no-brainer, and it's only the Chamber of Commerce who's representing many of these companies, like General Motors I'm sure is a member, and most of these companies that we would talk about, they'd be members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, General Motors does not want to see us put a 25% tariff on China, and now they send their cars in before -- when they built those plants, there was no tariff. So they build a car in China and they send it into the United States. Same with Ford, same with others. Now with a 25% wall, those plants don't work anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They made a bad investment. So, they're going to say, "Oh, Trump's a bad guy, he doesn't know what he's doing about tariffs." No, what's going to happen is they're going to have to come to the United States to build their plant. And the same with European Union at the right time, they're going to come in. They've been a very, very difficult negotiator.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say maybe more difficult than China in certain ways and nobody understands that.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> We decided not to call --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A lot of it comes from Europe.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> We decided not to include China as a country that devalues or manipulates its currency.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Totally.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> But now in response to the tariffs, there are some that say China has tried to offset the tariffs from letting the yuan fall. Do you think that that has been something China has done that needs to be addressed?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely. They devalue their currency. They have for years. It's put them at a tremendous competitive advantage and we don't have that advantage because we have a Fed that doesn't lower interest rates. We have a Fed that raises interest rates the day before a bond issue goes out, so we have to pay more money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You tell me about that thinking, okay. We should be entitled to have a fair playing field, but even without a fair playing field -- because our Fed is very, very destructive to us -- even without a fair playing field, we're winning, because the tariffs are putting us at a tremendous competitive advantage --
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> Let's talk about the Fed just --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People want our goods -- they want our money. We're the piggy bank. We're the bank.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> Let's talk about the Fed for a second. Do you think they should cut in June? Have they come around to your thinking, or has the stock market volatility or the economy? Do you think they've listened to you or they've arrived at the decision themselves maybe to cut rates? And when do you think they should?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, they haven't listened to me. And you know, we have people -- it's more than just Jay Powell. We have people on the Fed that really weren't, you know, they're not my people, but they certainly didn't listen to me because they made a big mistake. They raised interest rates far too fast. That's number one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Number two, they did quantitative tightening. They were taking in $50 billion a month, $50 billion a month and they've now eased that, but it's still $25 billion a month, which is ridiculous. Now, China's doing just the opposite. They're pumping money in. So, I'm not -- I'm winning, but I'm not winning on a level table.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I had a table -- don't forget, the head of the Fed in China is President Xi. He's the president of China. He also is the head of the Fed. He can do whatever he wants. They devalue, they loosen, or you would just say they pump a lot of money into China, and it nullifies to an extent, not fully -- it nullifies the tariffs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I will say this, they're also devaluing their currency to a point. Makes it better up to a point. It's very hard for them to buy oil. Oil becomes very expensive. They have to buy a lot of things outside of China. So, that's where the devaluation is bad for them. But it's good for them in terms of selling product and it's good for them in terms of sort of negating to a certain extent the tariffs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But with China, if we don't make a deal, you'll see a tariff increase of, you know, we have three -- they do $100 billion with us. We're doing close to $600 billion with them. So, we have the big, big advantage. Plus, we're the one that everybody is so used to taking advantage of as a country because we had, frankly, presidents that either didn't understand it or they were bored by it or they weren't smart enough to get what's going on. But those days are over, and we're doing great as a country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're doing -- but I just want to say to the United States Chamber of Commerce, if we didn't have tariffs, we wouldn't have made a deal with Mexico. We got everything we wanted. And we're going to be a great partner to Mexico now because now they respect us. They didn't even respect us. They couldn't believe how stupid we were with what's going on, where somebody comes in from Mexico and just walks right into our country and we're powerless to do anything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Whereas they had very strong immigration laws. They don't have to take anybody. They can say, out, you get. So, we're going to be essentially using to a large extent the very powerful immigration laws of Mexico. And Mexico wants to do a good job. They're moving 6,000 soldiers to their southern border. Do you think they agreed to do that before?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they're paying them. They're moving 6,000 soldiers to their southern border. That means the people from Guatemala, the people from Honduras and El Salvador, in theory, if they do it right, they're not going to be able to get through. Nobody's going to be able to get through. And then they're also going to protect our southern border.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, it should have a big impact. Now, with all of that being said, the Democrats refuse to do anything on illegal immigration. They want open borders and they don't mind crime, they don't mind human trafficking, they don't mind drugs. You tell me if that's a good campaign issue, because i think they get clobbered on that issue.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Mr. President, my co-anchor, Becky has question, you know Becky Quick.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi, Beck. I know Becky for a long time. Hi, Becky.
<Becky Quick> <Positive> Hi, Mr. President. Mr. President, just on China, we had our correspondent from Beijing telling us today that the Chinese ministry won't confirm that you are going to be meeting with President Xi at the G20. If they don't come, if President Xi doesn't come, will that mean that the tariffs on China for the additional $300 billion in goods go on immediately?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, it would. And I think he will go and I think we are scheduled to have a meeting. I think he'll go. I have a great relationship with him. He's actually an incredible guy, a great man. He's very strong and very smart but he's for China and I am for the United States. It's a very simple -- it is a simple stat.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's for China, I am for the U.S., so we are going to have our differences. But I think the differences can be worked out very easily. I would be surprised if he didn't go. I think he is going, I haven't heard that he's not. We are expected to meet. If we do, that's fine and if we don't, that's fine. Look, from our standpoint, the best deal we can have is 25% on $600 billion, okay?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then those companies are going to move into other locations and they are going to send -- and there won't be a tariff. You know, our business people in this country are very sophisticated. They are very good. If a product goes up in price, they go to Vietnam or they go to one of many other countries or they make the product in the United States, which is my favorite.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But that's what will happen. No, if we don't have a deal -- if we don't make a deal, then we will be raising the tariffs, meaning putting the tariffs on more than -- you know, we've only taxed 35% to 40% of what they send in. They have another 60% and that'll be taxed absolutely.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> And Mr. President, I just -- on an aside, and it's just -- we're the envy of the world, as you know, in terms of innovation and technology. And I guess the worry is we certainly don't want to kill the goose that lays a golden egg. Do you think Facebook and Google and Amazon, are these companies are too big now?
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> Do you think the antitrust company is warranted and do you think they should be broken up?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I can tell you they discriminate against me. You know, people talk about collusion. The real conclusion is between the Democrats and these companies. Because they were so against me during my election run. Everybody said, 'If you don't have them, you can't win.' Well, I won, you know, and I'll win again because we are doing well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We are not fools anymore. We are not the foolish country that does so badly. You look at India, a very good friend of mine, Prime Minister Modi, you take a look at what they have done, 100% tax on a motorcycle. We charge them nothing. So, when Harley sends it over there, they have 100% tax. When they send it, they make a tremendous number of motorcycles.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When they send them, no tax. I called him. I said it's unacceptable. He reduced it by 50% with one phone call. I said it's still unacceptable because it is 50% verses nothing. It's still unacceptable. And they're working on it. But if I didn't -- if we did not have the power of what we have, and if we weren't the bank -- well, if we weren't the bank, we wouldn't even be talking about it because nobody would care.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we're the bank that everybody wants to rob. And that's what they've been doing for a long period of time. $800 billion we have in trade deficits with other countries. So, you tell me who made those deals.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> We also had a big -- I know you'd like a strong defense and it would be nice to get prices down for those things. So, do you think United Technology Raytheon merger accomplishes that? Is that something that makes sense and is good for the country?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I am the one -- I'm a budget cutter and I have cut the budget. But on defense, I don't want to do any cutting. Because President Obama, and President Bush -- you know, he was fighting the wars in the Middle East -- I was left a very depleted military. And I feel just the opposite. I am very much of a cost cutter.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want to have a great budget. But before a budget, I have to have a great military. So, as long as I am here, we are going to have a great military and they're not going to have to worry. We've rebuilt, we've ordered many F-35s, we've ordered ships and planes and missiles and we are ordering the best stuff in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Plus, I am a sales man for the country. I'm getting other country to buy tremendous amount of our military. You know, you could ask any of the folks run our military companies --the different companies what they are doing because of me. I get nothing. I'm sitting there in the oval office, saying, 'You've got to buy our helicopters.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you don't, we are not going to be happy with you,' and they end up going out to buy our helicopters and our F-35s. Look at how many F-35s Japan and other companies are buying. So, you know, it's good as long as I'm there. I am a little concerned about United Technologies and Raytheon because one of the things that I bring up all of the time, we used to have many plane companies.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We used to have many, many. They've all merged. Now we have very few. We have the two main ones, as you know, and you have Lockheed and Boeing and you have a little bit some others, just a little bit. But they're all merged in, so it is hard to negotiate when you have two companies and sometimes you get one bid.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When we had 10 and 12 companies, now that may not be sustainable because they all go bust. And so, that's the purpose of what they did. But never the less, I can tell you because I get involved in negotiations. I got the plane cost down a lot. So, when I hear United Technologies, which is a great company, I know it well because I bought many an Otis Elevator over my lifetime.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It is a great company but when I hear United, and I bought a lot of carrier too, by the way -- when I hear United and when I hear Raytheon, which is another incredible company, the missile systems they make are incredible, when I hear they're merging, does that take away more competition? It becomes one big fat, beautiful company.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I have to negotiate. Meaning the United States has to buy things and does that make it less competitive? Because it is already so very less -- it's already not competitive. You look at the budgets of other major countries: take a look at Russia, they spend $68 billion a year on military. Take a look at China, they're $200-$250 billion a year.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we are many times that. And part of it because we spend so much money and part of it is we have no competition. We really don't. We don't have competition.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Mr. President, the treatment of you, set aside with Google and Facebook, just in terms of market size and market dominance, do you think that there is a monopoly antitrust problems with those big companies? Setting your personal feelings aside with them that needs to be address or an update on competition, competitor laws or monopoly laws.
<Joe Kernen> <Neutral> What do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there's something going on, Joe. And I will tell you this: the European Union, which is a fantastic group of negotiators, actually a very, very prominent person who you know well, who's on your show a lot, said the person at the European Union that's in charge of taxation hates the United States more than any person anywhere in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I really believe that's true. Every week you see them going after Facebook and Apple and all of these companies, that are, you know, great companies but something is going on. But I will say the European Union is suing them all the time. We are going to be looking at them differently. We have a great Attorney General, we are going to look at it differently.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When they give European Union $7 billion and $5 billion and $2 billion, and you know, Apple gets sued for $10 billion. And you know, right now, it is going on but they'll end up settling. They get all this money. We should be doing that -- they're our companies, so they're actually attacking our companies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we should be doing what they're doing. They think there is a monopoly. But I am not sure if they think that. They just figure this is easy money, we'll sue Apple for $7 billion and we'll make a settlement or we'll win the case. So, I think it is a bad situation. But, obviously, there is something going on in terms of monopoly.
<Becky Quick> <Negative> Mr. Trump, Mr. President, you mentioned UTX and Raytheon, that it's tougher to negotiate with them when you have fewer companies. Most of the analysts we talked to today said they don't think there will be a problem with regulators with UTX and Raytheon to merge. Do you think there is a problem there?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, only if they have the same products. They have some overlap, from what I understand. But only if they have the same products. That would be the thing that bothers me most. I mean, I can tell you from the airplanes, you want to buy a plane and you will have one bid. You don't have the people that make them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The companies that make them are incredible. They make them incredibly and they are great companies. But you don't have any competition. It is crazy. We have given up making like the F-22 fighter jets and that was a joint venture between Lockheed and Boeing. It was the greatest fighter jet, in my opinion, it was the greatest ever.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we gave it up because it was costing so much. You have the two companies in a joint venture, and from what I hear, I wasn't here then, that was a while ago, but from what I hear, you could not negotiate with them. This is what we want them, and the government says we'll take it. Okay. So, I just want to see competition, the two great companies, I love them both.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I want to see that we don't hurt our competition.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> Mr. President, do you see -- while we have you, do you see Huawei as a national security threat or a moving chest piece in the overall trade negotiations with China? What is in your view?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I do see it as a threat. At the same time, it could be very well that we do something with respect to Huawei as part of our trade negotiations with China. China very much wants to make a deal. They want to make a deal much more than I do. But we'll see what happens. Look, I don't mind taking in billion of dollars.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, the 3.2 we had in the first quarter, a lot of people said we picked up one point because of all the tariffs that we are taking in from China. Just remember, they're charging us tariffs. You know, some of the folks that I really like but some of the senators come to me, 'Well sir, it's not really good because it is not free market.' Like, you take India where they are charging 100% -- and by the way 100% is nothing compares to what some companies charge.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, France charges us a lot for the wine and yet we charge them little for French wine. So the wineries come to me and they say -- the California guys, they come to me: Sir, we are paying a lot of money to put our products into France and you're letting -- meaning, this country is allowing this French wine which is great, we have great wine, too, allowing it to come in for nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is not fair. And you know what, it's not fair. We'll do something about it.
<Joe Kernen> <Negative> While I have you, I just feel like there is so many things going on. T-Mobile and Sprint, do you have a feeling on telecom and 5G, are we behind in 5G? Will the actions against Huawei, will that set us back? Can we do it here?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I made a priority for 5G, before I got here, we were way behind. Now we are actually going to be leading very shortly. We are leading in everything. We are -- if you look at China, China, as great as they are and they are great, they are near the capability of our geniuses in Silicon Valley that walk around in under shirts and they were not $2 billion a piece.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. They don't have nearly the genius these people have. And they practically admit it. They don't want to exactly and say that. They try to go out and buy the company. Now we have restrictions on that, too, which we put in under my administration very recently. Because they were buying all of our companies.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They could not do it. But we have the most brilliant people. We have the most brilliant. Huawei is very powerful and very strong, don't forget ZTE, I did something with them where I closed them up and they paid me -- they paid us as a country, $1.2 billion fee and we changed their board, changed their management, we allowed them to open, but ZTE is a much smaller -- that was $1.2 billion done in one week.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was you know a good deal. And you know I don't want to put their companies out of business. I want China to do well. I don't want them to do as well as us, I have to be honest with you. You know when they say China, 25 years, you don't see them anymore. It says China 25. And what they mean is that in 25 they're going to be much bigger and they're going to be dominant in 25. I told President Xi, listen, that's very insulting to me. Can't do that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They took it off -- they don't use China 25 anymore because he understood exactly what we meant. Look, I said it before, we picked up $10 trillion more than that in value. And they've lost $15 to $20 trillion in value since the day I was elected. We are doing great. I hope the Raytheon deal -- I hope it can happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I don't want to see where we have one less person that can compete for an order. I don't want to see that. It's no good. And as far as the U.S. Chambers of Commerce, they have to start representing the United States and not just the companies that are members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> Mr. President, that seems like a good note to end on. We appreciate it. I am glad that we booked that gentleman from Chairman from Chambers of Commerce, and I am glad you got to catch part of that interview and respond to it. And I think that everyone benefits from it. But thank you very much. We appreciate all of the time you gave us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you Joe. And thank you Becky. Thank you very much.
<Joe Kernen> <Positive> President Donald Trump. Thank you.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> Mr. President, nice to see you sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> Mr. President, we're here in Argentina, and the United States, Canada and Mexico have signed a new trade agreement updating NAFTA.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> hat's right.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Senator Elizabeth Warren back in the United States, who may run against you in 2020, says it doesn't go far enough. What do you say to that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I guess it's easy for somebody like that to criticize because, you know, maybe she's running, maybe she's not. I thought she'd be disqualified by now after she did her whole Native American thing. I really assumed she would have been disqualified, but I can do that with any deal. Any deal you have, I can say, 'Hey, didn't go far enough.' This deal is much better than NAFTA.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a great deal for the United States. It's a deal we really like. We've gotten tremendous reviews on it, and I will say we have literally -- I have not heard one person hit it. They really have liked it. Now, the other countries, if you're talking about a little bit of a hit, they get a little bit of a hit, but I think they made a good deal also. It's great for the three countries.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Now, one of the parts of it has to do with autoworkers, auto parts. Is that in any way going to specifically address one of the issues the United States has, with GM closing plants and 14,000 losing jobs?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it is, and it's not only that. It's going to keep auto companies from moving. One of the things I really wanted was plants and auto companies, just in general -- I mean jobs, factories -- I don't want them leaving the United States. That was very important to me, and we're not leaving the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I think one of the strongest elements of the new -- and I call it the USMCA -- one of the really important things is you won't see companies leaving once that gets signed. We have to get it through Congress, and if it gets through, which I think it will, that'll be great, and if it doesn't, we're very happy the way it is now.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> The G-20 is about global economics. As you sort of step back and look at the globe, what do you see is sort of the biggest threat, realistic threat, in the near future to the global economy?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you have many threats, but the United States really has been ripped off by so many different countries. I'm not giving you any secrets when I say China, the numbers that China has done on us for so many years, 25 years …
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Which you've been saying to me for years before you were even ever a candidate for president.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've been saying that for a long time. When I was a young developer, I was saying that to you and everybody else. I mean, I've been talking about it for a long while. Japan, I used to use Japan. Now it's a little bit less Japan, but Japan is very active also. But it's almost everybody. It was almost like we had nobody that knew what they were doing about negotiating, trade, negotiating deals.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have almost an $800 billion trade deficit, and I'm changing that. We start with the USMCA, which is the replacement to NAFTA. We just made a great deal with Korea, South Korea, and I think that you're going to see some very big changes very quickly. We're talking to the European Union. That's been brutal for the United States, and again we're having dinner as you know with President Xi of China, and something could very well come out of that.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> As you call out China as one of the countries that you say is ripping off the United States, China's global footprint is expanding. They're already in North Africa, they're building a huge port in Pakistan, they have great deals -- investment deals in Panama and Latin America. Sort of coming very close to the United States, geographically.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Do you trust the strategic goals of China? Are you a little bit worried?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think they're going to have less money than they have right now, because the deal that I make, and if you look at -- we have $250 billion right now at 25 percent. That means we're going to be taking in billions and billions of dollars. Plus, I can double that up, and then I can double it again, and they could never do what they did in the past with other presidents, because -- and you see what's happening with China.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to do this, but they are not doing very well now compared to what they were doing, and again, I think that we are doing well. We picked up $11.7 trillion in worth since my election, and China's lost a great deal of worth, and we are now a much bigger economy than China. Which a lot of people don't know, but we're a much bigger, and really a much more powerful economy than China.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> But as a national security point, you know, with their investment in Latin America and all over the world, it does seem that they are making a bigger footprint around the world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know, but they have a debt problem and they have to pay for that debt. It's a tremendous amount of money that they're spending. Do I like it? Probably not, but I also know it's very expensive for them, and a lot of those places aren't going to work out.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> You were going to, or at least you had considered meeting with President Putin, and you have declined to. Had you met with him, what was your agenda with the president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I just said that, you know, frankly, in light of what happened with Ukraine with the ships and the sailors, it just wouldn't be the right time. But I will meet with him. I think we have a very good relationship, and I think we're going to have a very good relationship with Russia, and China, and everyone else.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, I think it's important. So I'll meet with him at the appropriate time.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What do you think he's thinking about doing with Ukraine? Why did he seize the sailors and the vessels?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can't read his mind, and nobody can, and he knows what he wants to do, but we can't allow certain things to happen. You know, it happened, and I just can't be a part of it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> One of the issues of a global economy is climate change. That's a discussion here. What's your position on climate change and how it has affected the economy worldwide?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very simple. I want the cleanest air and the cleanest water on the planet. I want crystal clean water, and that's what we have. We've been doing very well with respect to the environment, and that's what I want. But I'm not going to put the country out of business trying to maintain certain standards that probably don't matter.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When you look at China, and when you look at other countries where they have foul air, they have not good air that comes over to the United States. People don't want to talk about it, but it comes over. So we're going to be clean, but they're not, and it costs a lot of money. Well, the fact is, we are absolutely clean, but we're not going to spend trillions of dollars and make it good for others but not make it good for our -- you know, I have a very simple policy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's called America First. At the same time, we're going to be a great neighbor to the world. But we have to treat ourselves fairly, so that's the way it is.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Are you going to mention to President Xi about climate change?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We'll talk about it. We're talking about a lot of things. The big thing we're talking about is trade. That's what people want to hear, and you know, he's got to do something with his climate, his climates, a little bit, though. But, and I'm sure he will. I think he's -- he's a friend of mine and a good man, but you know, we have a little bit of a dispute.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And again, our country has been taken advantage of for many years, and that's just not going to happen anymore.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> There's a big vote coming up in the House of Commons in the UK. Prime Minister Theresa May is here. Brexit is a trade issue -- how is she handling it? And what's the impact on the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's a very tough thing. I told her I would've done it somewhat differently -- actually quite a bit differently -- but I think she's a good woman and she's really working hard. I mean, what she's going through, she's -- that is a hard situation for her. I would've done it differently. I would've had a much different attitude.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think the concept of what they're doing, you know, separating is good. That's a good thing. They want their own identity; they want their own immigration laws; they don't want to be told who they want and who they don't want. But she's working very hard, I will say that.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> In terms of, though, the impact on the United States, is the United States sort of a spectator to what's going on with Brexit, or is it directly impacted?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we told her, yeah, it is -- we are a spectator, to a certain extent.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> It has no impact on the United States?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's their country. I mean, they have to do what they have to do, and we'll see if they get to a parliament. It's going to be very interesting to whether or not they do. European Union, it's a tough group. I will tell you they are just about as rough as china on trade with us, and they're going to be next.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They'll be next, but the fact is they're very bad on trade with us. They have tremendous barriers. They have great barriers, tremendous. They have nontariff trade barriers also, and they have tariffs, they are -- we lost with them over the last couple of years $151 billion a year. That's the European Union, you know?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You think about it. Sounds so nice, but they've been very tough on trade, so they were tough with her. But we'll take care of our share, I can tell you that.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> All right, now, our domestic economy. Next week there's a vote possibly on a government shutdown. First of all, do you think there's going to be a U.S. government shutdown, and does that have any sort of global economic impact?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I can't tell you if there's going to be a shutdown because nobody knows. But I will tell you we're going to have border security. We're going to have a lot of border security. You saw what we did with the all of the caravans coming up, and now they're starting to head out, they're starting to go back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we are going to have security. We're not going to let people come into our country illegally. We're going to have people come in on merit. We need people, you know? We have the lowest unemployment rate we've had in 51 years. We need people in this country. We have companies moving in. In fact Prime Minister Abe of Japan just told me they're moving two car companies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're going to be opening up two massive plants, you know. You don't hear that often, but a lot of that is happening. You hear about General Motors, and I don't know what happened with General Motors, but the trend is exactly the opposite. And I will say this: Our economy has never done better. We're doing unbelievable numbers, you see that. And a lot of good things are happening.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> $5 billion is what you want for the wall, this would go around. So far, Congress is saying that it won't. So what happens?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We'll have to see what happens.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> Are you willing to negotiate?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, I'll just tell you this. We're going to have border security. And if we're not going to have border security, some very tough things are going to happen. But we're going to have border security. We can't have people pouring into our country like they have over the last 10 years. And you see what's happening when you have MS-13 and these gang members, and look at the caravan.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now they have over 650 people that are absolutely stone-cold criminals. I don't want them in our country. I'm not going to have it. If you don't have borders, you don't have a country, Greta. And I'm not going to have it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> One last question, and I'll give you a chance to educate there -- at least talk about the American media. What is it the U.S. media collectively doesn't understand about the economy? When you look at things, hear our reporting, do you have any thoughts on our reporting?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think they understand the economy. They know how well we're doing. They just don't like to say it because that's good for me, so they don't want to say it. Look, I call it fake news. I don't say the media, I say you have so much false reporting. But we have a phenomenal economy, they know that. We have the best unemployment numbers, as a group, that we've ever had.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You look at African-American unemployment and Asian and Hispanic American. You look at all of it, they're the best numbers in history, the best -- I mean, these are historic lows. So the media knows how well we're doing. They tend not to want to write it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> So you like discussing economy with these world leaders?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. I mean, we have the best economy in the world. Actually, every leader came up to me, virtually, and they said congratulations on the great economy.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> Mr. President, nice to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Greta. Nice to see you. Thank you very much.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> When Americans votes in next month's midterm elections. it's like President Trump and his agenda will be motivating them as much as any candidate or local issue on the ballot. Almost two years ago, when we last interviewed then-President-Elect Trump, he seemed surprised that he won, not that he'd ever admit that to us.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Well, when we sat down with him this past Thursday in the White House, we found him confident and boastful as he told us he has learned on the job. He was eager to joust over the issues of the day: the economy, China and Russia, and of course, fake news.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> But we started with very real news: the suspected murder of a Saudi journalist, and the catastrophe of Hurricane Michael, which has devastated parts of the Florida panhandle, claiming at least 19 lives, leaving hundreds of thousands without power across the Southeast. Michael comes on the heals of a series of superstorms: Florence in the Carolinas, Maria in Puerto Rico, Harvey in Texas.
<Bill Whittaker> <Neutral> The story will continue in a moment.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Do you still think that climate change is a hoax?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think something's happening. Something's changing and it'll change back again. I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference. But I don't know that it's manmade.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will say this. I don't wanna give trillions and trillions of dollars. I don't wanna lose millions and millions of jobs. I don't wanna be put at a disadvantage.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> I wish you could go to Greenland, watch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean, raising the sea levels.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man. You don't know.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Well, your scientists, your scientists --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, we have --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> At NOAA and NASA --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have scientists that disagree with that.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> You know, I -- I was thinking what if he said, "No, I've seen the hurricane situations, I've changed my mind. There really is climate change." And I thought, "Wow, what an impact."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well -- I'm not denying.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> What an impact that would make.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm not denying climate change. But it could very well go back. You know, we're talkin' about over a millions --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> But that's denying it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- of years. They say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just had with Michael.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Who says that? "They say"?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> People say. People say that in the --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Yeah, but what about the scientists who say it's worse than ever?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You'd have to show me the scientists because they have a very big political agenda, Lesley.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> I can't bring them in.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look, scientists also have a political agenda.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Yes.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> the Saudi journalist, was he murdered by the Saudis? And did the prince give the order to kill him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody knows yet, but we'll probably be able to find out. It's being investigated. It's being looked at very, very strongly. And we would be very upset and angry if that were the case. As of this moment, they deny it. And den -- deny it vehemently. Could it be them? Yes.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Jared, your son-in-law. Got on the phone and asked the prince. Did he deny it? Did he --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They deny it. They deny it every way you can imagine. In the not-too-distant future, I think we'll know an answer.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> What are you options? Let's say they did. What are your options? Would you consider imposing sanctions, as a bipartisan group of senators have proposed?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it depends on what the sanction is. I'll give ya an example. They are ordering military equipment. Everybody in the world wanted that order. Russia wanted it, China wanted it, we wanted it. We got it.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> So would you cut that off --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I tell you what I don't wanna do. Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon, all these com -- I don't wanna hurt jobs. I don't wanna lose an order like that. There are other ways of -- punishing, to use a word that's a pretty harsh word, but it's true.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Tell everybody what's at stake here. You know -- -
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, there's a lot at stake. There's a lot at stake. And maybe especially so because this man was a reporter. There's something -- you'll be surprised to hear me say that. There's something really terrible and disgusting about that, if that were the case. So we're gonna have to see. We're going to get to the bottom of it and there will be severe punishment.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> You've had a string of wins lately. Let's see, the economy, the d -- the trade deal-
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> With Canada and Mexico, Kavanaugh --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And South Korea.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> And South Korea. And Kavanaugh, the confirmation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There has been no administration in the history of our country, and I say this openly and proudly, that in its first two years --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Say, this is modesty.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's not even that, it's a fact Tax cuts, regulation cuts, the biggest regulations cuts in history.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> What about North Korea? Talking about accom --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I consider it a, so far, great achievement. Look, we --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> You say "so far"?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's always so far, til everything's done. I -- I -- you know, deals are deals, okay? Whether it's a real estate deal or a retail deal, it doesn't matter. But I will say this. The day before I came in, we were going to war with North Korea. I sat with President Obama --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> We were goin' to war?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- and -- we were gonna -- I think it was going to end up in war. And my impression is -- and even in my first few months, I mean, that rhetoric was as tough as it could possibly get. Doesn't get any tougher than that. Nobody's ever heard rhetoric that tough. We were going to war with North Korea. Now, you don't hear that. You don't hear any talk of it. And he doesn't wanna go to war, and we don't wanna go to war, and he understands denuclearization and he's agreed to it. And you see that, he's agreed to it. No missiles.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Do you trust him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do trust him, yeah, I trust him. That doesn't mean I can't be proven wrong --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Why would --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> about it?
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> you trust him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, first of all, if I didn't trust him, I wouldn't say that to you. Wouldn't I be foolish to tell you right here, on 60 Minutes --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Well, remember what Reagan said. "Trust, but verify."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure. I know. It's -- it's very true. But the fact is, I do trust him. But we'll see what happens.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> But is it true that they haven't gotten rid of a single weapon, and they may actually be building more missiles-
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They want to --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> With nuclear --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I will tell you that they're closing up sites.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> But --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Setting it up.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Is what I said true, that they haven't? Gotten --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, nobody really knows. I mean, people are saying that. I've actually said that.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> What? That they're still building missiles, more missiles?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We don't really know, Lesley. We really don't know. But I assume --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Suspect that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let's say the answer is yes, okay? In the meantime, they haven't tested a missile. They haven't tested a rocket. They definitely haven't done a nuclear test because you know about them real fast. It sort of moves the earth. And we have a relationship now.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> One of the things that Kim has asked for is for you to ease the sanctions.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We haven't done that.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Are you prepared to do that? What -- what does he have to do --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, No. I --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Before you're --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No I'm not doing it. This isn't the Obama administration. I haven't eased the sanctions. I haven't done anything. I haven't done anything. We're meeting. I believe he likes me. I like him. We have a good relationship. It's very important.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Video Clip] And then we fell in love, okay. No really. He wrote me beautiful letters. And they're great letters. We fell in love. [End Clip]
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> I wanna read you his resume, okay? He presides over a cruel kingdom of repression, gulags, starvation -- reports that he had his half-brother assassinated, slave labor, public executions. This is a guy you love?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure. I know all these things. I mean -- I'm not a baby. I know these things.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> I know, but why do you love that guy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, look. I -- I -- I like -- I get along with him, okay?
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> But you love him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. That's just a figure of speech.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> No, it's like an embrace.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It well, let it be an embrace. Let it be whatever it is to get the job done.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> He's a bad guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look. Let it be whatever it is. I get along with him really well. I have a good energy with him. I have a good chemistry with him. Look at the horrible threats that were made. No more threats. No more threats.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> China.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I get along with him. It's very important. China, let's go.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> I'm skipping across the world here. You've slapped a lot of tariffs --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> $250 billion.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Gonna do more?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Might. Might.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Round three?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They wanna negotiate, Lesley. They wanna negotiate.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Are you ready?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Are you ready to --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a great chemistry also with President Xi of China. I don't know that that's necessarily going to continue. I told President Xi we cannot continue to have China take $500 billion a year out of the United States in the form of trade and others things.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> And how -- how --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I said we can't do that, and we're not gonna do that anymore.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> How much squeezing of them are you prepared to do when American products are gonna be more expensive for American consumers in the end of all this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay. Okay. So, so far, that hasn't turned out to be the case.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Some --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- if you think about it, so far, I put 25% tariffs on steel dumping, and aluminum dumping 10%.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> But they've --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- again.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> -- retaliated. That's what I'm asking.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They can retaliate, but they can't -- they don't have enough ammunition to retaliate. We do $100 billion with them. They do $531 billion with us.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Are you trying to sort of push them into a depression?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No no, although they're down 32 percent in four months, which is 1929.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Well that's what I'm asking.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want that. No, I don't want that. I want them to negotiate a fair deal with us. I want them to open their markets like our -- our markets are open.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> But you're in a --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it will be a fair deal --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> -- trade war right now. Trade war.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You call it war, I don't call --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> You -- you --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- it --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- you did today.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I called it a skirmish.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> I heard you, you called it a war.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I called it, actually I called it a battle. But, actually, I'm gonna lower that. I consider it a skirmish. And we're gonna win.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> You have also slapped some tariffs on our allies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, what's an ally? We have wonderful relationships with a lot of people. But nobody treats us much worse than the European Union. The European Union was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade, and that's what they've done.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> But this is hostile.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And yet, they -- it's not hostile.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> It sounds hostile.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what's hostile? The way they treat us. We're not hostile.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> No, but can't you deal with --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We've been -- we've been --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> -- them without --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- the stupid country for so many years.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Are you willing to get rid of that Western alliance?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, I like NATO, NATO's fine. But you know what? We shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect Europe. And then on top of that, they take advantage of us on trade. They're not going to do it anymore. They understand that.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Okay, but are, it does seem this, are you willing to disrupt the Western Alliance? It's been going for 70 years. It's kept the peace for 70 years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You don't know that. You don't know that.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> I don't know what?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You don't know that.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Is it true General Mattis said to you, "The reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances is to prevent World War III?"
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's not true.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> What's not true?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Frankly, I like General Mattis. I think I know more about it than he does. And I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness, that I can tell you.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> I'm gonna try one more time. Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know -- and, Lesley, you don't have to try again. I know exactly what you're saying --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Well, answer my question.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The answer is this. I will always be there with NATO, but they have to pay their way. I'm fully in favor of NATO, but I don't wanna be taken advantage of.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Putin.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Okay, people don't understand why you never have a harsh word for Vladimir Putin.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, you ready?
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> I don't understand it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have been -- you don't know what I talked about with Putin in the meeting prior to the press conference --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> No, I mean publicly. You never say anything harsh about him --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- publicly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't? I'm the one that gave Ukraine offensive weapons and tank killers. Obama didn't. You know what he sent? He sent pillows and blankets. I'm the one -- and he's the one that gave away a part of Ukraine where Russia now has this --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Well, I mean him personally Vladimir Putin --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I'm very tough with him personally. I had a meeting with him. The two of us. It was a very tough meeting and it was a very good meeting.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Do you agree that Vladimir Putin is involved in assassinations? In poisonings?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Probably he is, yeah. Probably. I mean, I don't --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Probably?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I rely on them, it's not in our country.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Why not -- they shouldn't do it. This is a terrible thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Of course they shouldn't do it-
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Instead do you believe --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's your [Inaudible] --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- do you believe that the Russians interfered in the 2016 campaign election? Our election-
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They -- they meddled. But I think China meddled too.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> But why do you --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I think other countries --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> -- say China meddled too?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you wanna know something?
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Why do you say Chi -- why don't you just say --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, let me ask you --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- the Russians meddled?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because I think China meddled also. And I think, frankly, China --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> This is amazing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- is a bigger problem.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> You are diverting the whole Russia thing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm not doing anything.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> You are, you are
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm saying Russia, but I'm also saying China.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> [Voiceover] But it's the investigation of Russia's intervention in the 2016 election that hangs over his presidency and caused a rift with his Attorney General Jeff Sessions, because he recused himself from the inquiry.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> What about the attorney general, Jeff Sessions?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we'll see what happens come midterms. But --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> But everybody thinks, given the things you've said --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was disappointed that he recused himself and many people think I was right on that. I was very disappointed. Why should he have recused himself? So I was very --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> So --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- disappointed but --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> So can I assume --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- we'll see what happens.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Can I assume he's gone?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No. You can't assume that.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Will you. Will you pledge -- pledge that you will not shut down the Mueller investigation?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I -- I don't pledge anything. But I will tell you, I have no intention of doing that. I think it's a very unfair investigation because there was no collusion of any kind.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> But you won't pledge --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There is no collusion. I don't wanna pledge. Why should I pledge to you? If I pledge, I'll pledge. I don't have to pledge to you. But I have-
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Well --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have no intention of doing that.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> [Voiceover] To date, 32 people have been charged or pled guilty in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. President Trump's campaign chairman, top campaign aide, former national security advisor and longtime personal attorney are all cooperating in the inquiry the president calls a witch hunt.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do you really think I'd call Russia to help me with an election? Give me a break. They wouldn't be able to help me at all. Call Russia. It's so ridiculous.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> One thing the president loves to talk about, and for good reason, is the economy. Consumer confidence is higher than it's been in nearly two decades and unemployment, at 3.7 percent, is the lowest in nearly 50 years. And yet, there's an ugly mood in the air.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We are a country torn by angry, bitter partisan divisions. And there are many who say the president isn't helping. We talked with the president about that, the contentious Kavanaugh hearings, questions of chaos in his administration. And his record so far.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> So you've been president for almost two years. Is there anything that you wish you hadn't said, anything you wish you hadn't done? Do you have any regrets?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So when I won the presidency, I th -- I -- I -- the press treats me terribly. I thought very strongly that, you know, the one great thing will happen is the press will start treating me great. Lesley, they treat me worse. They got worse instead of better. Very dishonest.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Okay, this -- you're -- but you regret?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I regret that the press treats me so badly --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> I'm -- I'm really asking [Inaudible] --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And despite that, my poll numbers are very good, so.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Have you made any mistakes? That's my question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everybody makes mistakes.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> And what have been yours?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I could have been -- earlier with terminating the NAFTA deal. The problem was, I was getting to know the leaders. I was getting to know countries. I didn't wanna do it right outta the box. So I waited a little while, but I could have done trade a little bit earlier.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> What about the forced separation of children from their -- migrant children --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Well, that was --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> from the --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> the same as the Obama law. You know, Obama had the same thing.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> It was on the books, but he didn't enforce it. You -- enforced it. You launched that -- the zero tolerance policy -- to deter families with children coming --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but then everybody decided and the courts don't want separation. And frankly, when you don't do separa -- when you allow the parents to stay together, okay, when you allow that, then what happens is people are gonna pour into our country.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> So are you gonna go back to that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're looking at a lot of things. Really what we wanna do is change the immigration laws, 'cause they were -- they were a laughing stock all over the world.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Are you willing though -- I think that you're saying you're -- it's under consideration.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I want all the laws changed.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> But the children specifically --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> there have to be consequences, Lesley, for coming into our country illegally. And part of the r -- I mean, part of the reason, I have to blame myself, the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United States.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Can I just ask this simple question, yes or no.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Are you willing to reinstitute that policy? You said, "We're looking at everything."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Yes or no.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will only -- I can't -- you can't say yes or no. What I can say is this: There are consequences from coming into a country, namely our country, illegally.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> I'm not gonna ask it again --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You don't have to.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> 'cause I know you won't -- it --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it's the same as Obama.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Video Clip] It is vicious, it's full of lies, deceit and deception. [End Clip]
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Okay. Changing subjects again -- you are the first president of the United States who never had a political post before, nor never served in the military. You come up here, you've been here for almost two years, what's the biggest surprise and what have you learned since you've been president?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay. So I always used to say the toughest people are Manhattan real estate guys and blah, blah. Now I say they're babies.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Who's the toughest?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're babies, the political people. This is the most deceptive, vicious world. It is vicious, it's full of lies, deceit and deception. You make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with -- that table.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Give me an example.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't wanna give you an example. I'm not lookin' to -- in the meantime, nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do. Remember that. When you look at taxes, you look at regulations, you look at -- making deals with other countries. Nobody's been able to do anything like this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Actually, most people didn't even try because they knew they didn't have the ability to do it. But it's a very deceptive world. The other thing I've really learned is I never knew how dishonest the media was. I -- I -- and I really mean it. I'm not saying that as a sound bite. I never --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> I'd like to --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Knew how dishonest --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> I'm -- I'm gonna change the subject again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, no, even the way you asked me a question, like, about separation. When I say Obama did it, you don't wanna talk about it.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> No, I'm gonna run your --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> When I say I did it, let's make a big deal of it.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> I'm gonna run your answer, but you did it four times, so.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm just telling you that you treated me much differently on the subject.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> I disagree, but I don't wanna have that fight with you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, it's okay --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> All right, I'll get in another fight with you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Lesley, it's okay. In the meantime, I'm president -- and you're not.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> [Voiceover] It's a presidency like no other: he's redefined the office, with a governing style that's more freewheeling in-your-face New York than buttoned-up Washington. He's not shy about trumpeting his victories, but some have come with a cost.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> This country is divided, polarized. Within families, there aren't even people who can talk to each other. What does this say about where we are as a country right now, all this division and strife and --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah -- I think that --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> -- anger?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- what's going to happen -- I think the economy's bringing people together. It was very polarized under President Obama, unbelievably polarized under President Obama. I can see the country uniting. I can see it. We have people, Democrats, who behaved horribly during the Judge Kavanaugh -- you -- know what I'm saying.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> But when you won that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- during the hearings for the Supreme Court, we had senators that behaved horribly.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> But when you won, you won. No -- no one is gonna argue with that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I won --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> You won. And then after you won, instead of saying, "Oh, let's all come together, this is wonderful. Let's heal all of this," you come out and bash the Democrats.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I bashed their attitude. I bashed their statements --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> But why not try to --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because they were --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- bring us together?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- so unfair to Judge Kavanaugh. I've never --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> But why not --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> seen anything like it.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> -- why not try and -- we need to be healed. We need --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think they want to heal yet, I'll be honest.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Well, you don't wanna --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> heal yet.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I -- I -- I saw Hillary Clinton made a really nasty statement. I don't think they wanna be healed. I do wanna heal.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> I'm n -- I'm not talking about Democrat -- I'm talking about the country. You go out and you go to Mississippi.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The famous Mississippi speech?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Video Clip] I had one beer. Well, you think it was, nope! It was one beer. Oh good. How did you get home? I don't remember. How did you get there? I don't remember. Where is the place? I don't remember. How many years ago was it? I don't know. I don't know... I don't know... [End Clip]
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> And you mimicked Professor Blasey Ford. You mimicked her.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Had I not made that speech, we would not have won. I was just saying she didn't seem to know anything.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> No [Inaudible] --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you're trying to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Why did you have to make fun of her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't really make fun of her.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Well, they were laughing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What I said the person that we're talking about didn't know the year, the time, the place.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Professor Blasey Ford got before the Senate and -- and was asked what's the worst moment. And she said, "When the two boys laughed at me, at my expense."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ok, fine.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> And then I watched you mimic her and thousands of people were laughing at her.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They can do what they -- I -- I will tell you this. The way now Justice Kavanaugh was treated has become a big factor in the midterms. Have you seen what's gone on with the polls?
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> But did you have to --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think she was treated with great respect, I'll -- I'll --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> And -- but --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> be honest with you.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> but do you think -- you treated her with --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There are those that think she shouldn't have --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Do you think you treated her with respect?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so, yeah. I did.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> But you seem to be saying that she lied.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> W -- you know what? I'm not gonna get into it because we won. It doesn't matter. We won.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> [Voiceover] Ever since the Mississippi speech, he's been out campaigning, rallying his supporters for the midterm elections. But back in Washington, he's had to deal with reports of internal strife in his administration.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> The anonymous column that ran in "The New York Times." The author, we don't know who it is. Whoever it is.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Whoever it is. Maybe it was "The New York Times" too.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Paints a picture.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, it's -- By the way, you don't know how dishonest "The New York Times" is. It could've been "The New York Times." I doubt it. But it could've been.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Okay. I doubt it too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It also could've been any -- w -- well, don't count on it. It also could've been any one of 3,000 people.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> [Voiceover] The anonymous op-ed column told of a "resistance" within the Trump Administration, who've questioned his fitness for office.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> You have said that this administration is like a smooth-running machine. And yet, we keep hearing that the White House is in chaos.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's -- wrong, it's so false. It's fake news. I'm changing things around. And I'm entitled to. I have people now on standby that will be phenomenal. They'll come into the administration, they'll be phenomenal.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> More people gonna go?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, other people will go, sure.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> 'Cause so many people, you have kind of a record of -- on turnover.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think I have a great Cabinet. There're some people that I'm not happy with.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Who are you not happy with?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't wanna say that but
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Come on.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not I don't want to say that. But I have some people that I'm not thrilled with. And I have other people that I'm beyond thrilled with.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> What about General Mattis? Is he going to leave?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't know. He hasn't told me that. I have --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Do you want him to --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- a very good relationship with him. It could be that he is. I think he's sort of a Democrat, if you wanna know the truth. But General Mattis is a good guy. We get along very well. He may leave. I mean, at some point, everybody leaves. Everybody. People leave. That's Washington.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> The first lady, Melania. She said that there are still people in the White House that she doesn't trust and that you shouldn't trust.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I feel the same way. I don't trust everybody in the White House, I'll be honest with you.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> You go to a meeting, do you have to wonder, "Is he wearing a wire -- "
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm usually --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- or whatever?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not so much a wire. I'm usually guarded. And I think I'm guarded anyway. But I'm not saying I trust everybody in the White House. I'm not a baby. It's a tough business. This is a r -- this is a vicious place. Washington DC is a vicious, vicious place. The attacks, the -- the bad mouthing, the speaking behind your back. -- but -- you know, and in my way, I feel very comfortable here.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> It takes a president a while to find his sea legs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so. I mean, I felt comfortable at the beginning, other than it was a little surreal to say I'm the president of the United States, but I think that's true with everybody.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> POTUS.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now I very much feel like POTUS. I do. I feel like the president. You know, for a little while, it's like -- "Mr. President, sir." It's -- even my friends, they call me, they -- they don't call me Donald -- they call me Mr. President. And I say, "Will you please loosen up?" I've learned on the job. I have.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> And you feel comfortable?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I feel very comfortable, yeah.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And welcome to the "On the Record" one-hour town hall with presidential candidate and GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. And we are here in Indianapolis at the Hilbert Circle Theatre, home of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. I have many questions for Donald Trump and so does our audience. So now let's welcome presidential candidate Donald Trump.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Welcome, Donald. And now my first question to Donald. First of all, thank you very much for joining us.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This is really exciting, what a beautiful. [Applause] And we love Indiana. This is great. Thank you all.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. I'm going to start with the political news of the day. Senator Ted Cruz has announced that his vice presidential candidate is Carly Fiorina. What's your reaction to that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think it's really a waste of time, honestly. [Applause] I think it should be over. If Indiana treats us right, we're going to make America great again. We're going to get rid of these politicians. And we're going to do the right job. I mean, two days ago it was Kasich, they were going to form an alliance and they were going to collude and they were going to get together.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And then all of a sudden Kasich didn't live up to his side of the deal and they're fighting with each other. And now he's doing the Carly thing. I just don't see it. It's awfully early. Number one, it's very early. I mean, you're not supposed to be doing it this early. But I don't see it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. Who is on your list?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I have a lot of great people, I just don't want to talk about it now. I would like to finish the deal first. You know, Cruz has no path to victory and neither does Kasich. And I like to [Inaudible], we've got to get it done. And once the deal is done, you'll be -- maybe, I'll make you the first to know, right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We'll make it a first. But we'll let you know. We have some really great people. But I just think it's so early in the process. You have to first get the nomination. Here's the guy picking a vice presidential candidate, he has zero chance. He has no path. It's sort of crazy. So I think it's -- well, it gets him in the news cycle because he has been totally taken out.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He had a horrible day yesterday. And he came in third, meaning third out of three, most of the time. [Laughter] Most of the -- I guess four out of five he was third. And he picked up no delegates. And, you know, we're talking about major states like Pennsylvania, like Maryland. I mean, we're talking about big stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And Connecticut. He came in -- he got nothing. And I think he wanted to do something to get out of that negative cycle. And in that sense it was probably good for him. But people will not like it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. Today was the big foreign policy speech that you gave in Washington, D.C., among some of the things you said is you said, I will not send our finest into battle unless necessary and only if we have a plan for victory. How do you define necessary?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, necessary, and victory. Number one, I define necessary as protecting our country. That's what necessary is, is protecting our country. [Applause] [Inaudible]. It was interesting, I got a big hand, I appreciate it, because I said, I'm only going to send them in if we're going to win. We have to win.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We don't win. And, you know, as a country, you can look at trade, you can look at -- we don't win anymore. We just don't win. But even with our military we have these incredible people, but we're not taking care of them properly. It's being depleted. Our vets are being taken care of horribly. That's going to change immediately.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That I can tell you. [Applause] But we don't fight -- you know, when I was growing up, the United States always used to win. And it was a long time ago. We haven't been winning so much. But we certainly aren't winning now in any capacity.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Is there a point now that you consider necessary? If you were in the Oval Office now and president, would you be deploying any troops anyplace?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think what I'm -- to me, when I heard the other day, I heard President Obama say the single greatest threat to our country global warming. [Laughter] And I said, was he serious? Was he being serious? And the big threat we have is global warming, but it's of the nuclear variety. That's the biggest threat we have.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Applause] That is the single biggest threat we have. And frankly, if it weren't for that capability and the incredible power of weaponry today, I would have been out of there a long time. I said, and you know this because I've been saying this to you for years, don't go into Iraq, don't go into Iraq, because we totally destroyed the balance of power, we destroyed the whole equilibrium of the Middle East.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And now Iran is taking over the Middle East. And it's terrible. I mean, if we didn't do anything in the last 15 years, if we just forgot the Middle East was there we would be in such great shape today by comparison to what we've done, with the migration, with people pouring into our country, which is Obama's fault, in all fairness, because we're taking tens of thousands of people into the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have no idea, Greta, who they are. There's no documentation. There's no paperwork. But victory to me is victory. If we go in to fight, we have to fight to win and get it over with, fast. [Applause]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You brought up the issue of nuclear weapons. In January, North Korea did its fourth nuclear test. And there are reports now South Korea says a fifth test, nuclear weapons test, North Korea, is imminent. If you were president of the United States today, right now, what would you -- would you be doing anything about the fact -- and they've also just launched a missile from a submarine.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They're having a field day with us. And it's a form of extortion, if you want to know the truth. I mean, it really is. It's a form of extortion. And that's what I think they're doing it for. But, look, you have South Korea, we protect them, and they're a monster in terms of economics, OK? Any time you order a television set, whether it's LG or Samsung or whatever it comes from, essentially South Korea.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They build the biggest ships. They build everything. And we protect them. And they pay us very little. And we protect many other countries. Part of the speech was that. We have to get reimbursed. You know, this is a.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But what would you do about North Korea?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> All right. Here's what we do. Here's what we do. China has tremendous power over North Korea, tremendous, beyond anybody. Now they don't tell us that. They like to tweak us and say, well, we don't really. They have total control. China can't even survive without us because economically they've been ripping us for many years to come.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They've been sucking our blood. I look at Indiana, the jobs.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> How do you get them to act?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, no. You tell them, we're going to -- either you're going to have to straighten out this North Korea problem or we're not going to be doing so much business with you. They don't do so much business with us, Greta, they would have a depression the likes of which you've ever seen. We have tremendous power, economic power over China.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I want to get along with China. We're going to get along with China. But China can strangle because it comes in through China. And China is powerful. China can strangle North Korea. It can make them -- bring them to the table.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> How fast could you operate? Because North Korea.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think it can be very quick.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> . is going to do another test.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think it can be very, very quick. But, you know, at what point are we the guardian of the world? At what point are we willing to say, folks, you have to protect yourselves? Or you have to pay us properly, OK? Or you have to pay us properly. [Applause] And whether it's -- and a lot of people don't know this because I give the speeches and I talk and I'm a very -- you know, I'm a very business-minded person.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And the country is not business-minded. Politicians aren't business-minded. But I say it all the time, we protect Japan. Great people. We protect Saudi Arabia. We protect South Korea. We protect so many countries. And we could take Germany. Look at Germany. It's an economic behemoth. They have so much money, so much.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We protect Germany. Now it's OK to protect them. And I understand that we don't want them to arm ideally and all of that. But at what point do we say, we can't afford to do this anymore as a country? You'll have to protect yourselves or you're going to have to pay up. And whether it's South Korea, any of these.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look at Saudi Arabia, before the oil went down -- now they're still making plenty, but before the oil prices went down they were making $1 billion a day. We protect them. They wouldn't be there, in my opinion, Greta, they wouldn't be there, Saudi Arabia wouldn't be there for two weeks if we weren't protecting them.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It would be a mess like you've never seen before. So we have to get smart and we have to help our allies and we have to be good to our allies, but they have to remember that we're good and they have to take care of us. [Applause]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, you have an audience question from Kelly. And first of all, Kelly, have you made up your mind who you're going to vote for?
<Question> <Neutral> Definitely. I've always voted Republican. And I will only vote for Trump. [Applause]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. Your question for Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Did she say always vote for Trump?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> No, she said always vote Republican and she's going to vote for you.
<Question> <Neutral> I will only vote for Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, that's good. That's what I thought you said. [Laughter] Thank you very much.
<Question> <Neutral> My question is, my father owns a custom -- a small custom manufacturing company here in Indiana which employs about 50 people. And the two major problems that we face are the high cost of health care, the health insurance, and also that we're losing jobs to -- we're losing our customers to cheaper prices outside of the U.S. So I was wondering, Mr. Trump, when you become president what will you do. [Applause] What will you do to help my family keep our business?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK. So such a great question. And, you know, I was looking at Indiana because I always get these statisticians. I said, give me the list, always like 15 minutes before I get to a place. I did it last week with New York, New York State. And it's all the same problems. I did it with Pennsylvania. I did it with every place I've been to in the last couple of weeks.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I look at the numbers and our jobs, look at Carrier air conditioning, you know, in a way that's just a larger version of what's happening with your father where jobs are being just ripped out of our country, out of our states, but out of country. And we've got to a couple of things. When they want to play games with us, countries or companies, when a company wants to leave like Carrier, and they want to go to Mexico, and they're going to make air conditioners and they're send them, and we're not going to tax them, and they're going to let the 1,400 people from Indianapolis go, they're going to fire them, there has got to be consequences.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And the same thing with your father. When countries are able to do numbers on us, there are going to be consequences. And we're going to have to do some form of taxation. I believe totally in the free market, I think it's great. But our leaders are not smart. They're not smart people, or they're controlled by their special interest groups that have reasons for letting it be this way, one or the other.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Applause] Which, by the way, and it's one of those two things was, I'm self- funding, so I'm doing -- I'm going to work -- I'm working for you. I'm working for your father, OK? [Applause] But, so, what we're going to have to do, and very strongly, we're going to have to take the whole situation, we're going to have to tax these products coming in. And then somebody will say, oh, they're going to cost more.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And they're right. They're going to cost more. In some cases they're going to cost a little more. In some cases, like Carrier, they're not even going to cost more, but we have to tax the product coming in. And what's going to happen, the second part is we're going to have more workers. We're going to have more people.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're going to have more jobs. So maybe the product is going to be a little more expensive. But you're going to have more jobs. So that's the good news. As far as health care, we're going to repeal Obamacare. We're going to replace it with something great, OK? [Applause] You'll have your health care savings accounts.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, the amazing thing about health care, if we get rid of the lines wrapped around every state -- you know, because this is all done for the benefit of the insurance companies, where could have real competition, whether it's health care savings accounts or so many different things. There are so many things you could have privately to take care of health care.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Obamacare is out of control. Your premiums are going up 25, 35, 45, 55 percent. We're going to repeal it. We're going to replace it with something great. Thank you, great question. [Applause]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> We have a question from Steve. Steve, have you decided who you're voting for?
<Question> <Neutral> Who am I voting for?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Yes.
<Question> <Neutral> Well, I think my question might answer that question.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> OK. Well, then what's your question, sir?
<Question> <Neutral> Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Question> <Neutral> . I was likely going to vote for Governor Kasich in Indiana's primary next week, but feel that he and his campaign have turned their backs on Indiana with his agreement that he has now with Senator Cruz. What can you say now to convince me to vote for you next Tuesday instead of switching my vote to Cruz, as suggested by their strategy to defeat you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK. Well, first of all, I think you did the right thing by switching because I think that they're -- what they did in colluding like that, I think it was such a slap in the face of the people of Indiana, in particular. I thought it was a slap in the -- [Crosstalk] Both of them, both of them. And, you know, I think actually you couldn't go to Cruz because I think it was equal if not worse.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I just think it was terrible what they were doing. And I guarantee you if they had it to do again, especially Cruz, he would have never done it. Typical politicians, always make bad deals. And on top of it, Kasich then broke the deal. He said, no, I want you to vote for me in Indiana. He broke the deal.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So they're just typical politicians. I'm going to bring back jobs. I'm going to save your Second Amendment, which, by the way, is under siege from everybody. [Applause] I'm going to get rid of Common Core. And we're bringing education local. We have to do that. We're going to bring education local because our education, the system is a total wreck.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're going to strengthen our military, take care of our vets. We're going to go through a list of things and we're going to make this country so strong again, so great again, we have to strengthen our military. Our military is being absolutely depleted at the highest level. I mean, you look at -- I made a speech today and I was talking about the military compared to 10 years ago, it's incredible, it's just getting smaller, and yet the world is getting more and more dangerous.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But in terms of yourself, you look like you might be a businessman, we're going to lower taxes. I have the plan that lowers taxes more than any other person by far, more than any other candidate by far. [Applause] Larry Kudlow, a friend of Greta's, gave it his best review. Larry Kudlow is an amazing guy and economist, a friend of Greta's and everybody's, actually.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And he gave it his best review. But we're going to lower taxes. But we're going to bring jobs back. And the other thing is we're not going to let jobs go. If a Carrier came to me and said, we're going, we want to move to Mexico, I would say, that's OK, but you're going to pay a 35 percent tax every time an air conditioning unit is sold through that what will now be a strong border, and I will tell you something, they're going to say, sir, we're going to stay in Indiana.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So nobody can do more than that. [Applause]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And we will bring you much more from our "On the Record" town hall with Donald Trump. We have some surprise guests too. That's coming up. Don't go away. [Applause] [Applause] And welcome back to our special "On the Record" town hall with GOP presidential candidate and frontrunner Donald Trump. And we're coming to you from Indianapolis.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And in less than one week, it's Indiana's turn. Indiana voters will hit the polls. Let's get right back to our questions with Donald Trump. Donald, we have another audience member with a question for you. Isaiah, you have a question for him. First of all, how old are you?
<Question> <Neutral> I'm 18.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And so you're going to vote this November. Are you going to vote next week or -- right?
<Question> <Neutral> I am. Yes.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And have you decided who you're voting for?
<Question> <Neutral> I have not. That's actually why I'm here.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> OK. Good. Fire away. Ask your question.
<Question> <Neutral> Mr. Trump, thank you for meeting with us tonight. I'm actually a senior this year Traders Point, and heading off to Wabash College in the fall.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Good.
<Question> <Neutral> As we all know, candidate Sanders is offering free college tuition. I think that this is.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think he's leaving the race today, by the way. So he has got some difficulty. But go ahead.
<Question> <Neutral> I think that this is unattainable, and obviously unachievable.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sure.
<Question> <Neutral> It would also devalue a person's degree. However, being a high school senior, financial decisions play a massive role when deciding where to go to college. So my question is, do you have anything in place to combat the ever-rising cost of college tuition?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's really a good question. It's a question I get asked more than any other question, especially when I'm at, you know, where you have a lot of young folks going to college. And it's very sad. The students are -- literally they've borrowed up to here. And what the colleges have done is they haven't watched their costs, because basically the students are a conduit between the government and the college to get money.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And the college keeps going up, up, up, much faster than any other costs, if you take a look. And we're going to look into that seriously, because it's unfair. The students are borrowing up to here. The problem -- the other problem they have, and we're going to work on student loans, we're going to work on some kind of deal for low-interest and really good students loans, give them a longer term to pay it out, maybe you pay it out after they get jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They have to pay it back. I mean, look, it's -- we work a deal where the students can live with it, because they're not being -- they're not able to live with it right now. But the biggest problem is you go to college, you go to a good college that's a good college, you go to a great college, and you graduate, and you do well, and you get out, and you can't get a job.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And that's the biggest problem, because they can't get jobs. There are no good jobs. You know, even the other side admits the jobs we have are bad jobs. And the real unemployment rate is like 20 percent, it's not 5 percent. That was done so the politicians look good. Because if you go out looking for a job and then you quit looking for a job, they consider you for -- you know, statistically you're considered employed.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So here's what we do. We're going to work on jobs. We're going to bring our jobs back from Mexico and from China and from Japan.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> How? How?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How? We're going to make our products here. We're going to start making our products here. Countries. [Applause] Countries are abusing us. So believe me, folks, countries are abusing us. And the reason the politicians don't do -- they know the problem, you know, corporate inversions and everything else. They're leaving like you wouldn't believe it. Look, I looked at numbers, 40 percent of your manufacturing is gone in this area, 40 percent over a fairly short period of time.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're going to stop it. Companies are taking advantage of us. And countries are abusing us. And the way you stop is so easy. It's called consequence. If they want to play that game, and it's a dirty game that they're playing, again, free trading, I love it, I always want to defend it, but we can't do it because we don't have the people.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We don't have the smart people. What we're going to have to do is tariffs and taxes for the countries that don't behave. And you know what's going to happen? As soon as we say we're going to impose it, they're going to behave very, very nicely. The problem we have, and I'll tell you, it really is true, but the problem we have from the student standpoint, Greta, they're graduating from college.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They're wonderful. They're great. They graduate high in their class. They can't get jobs.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> We have a question, Donald, from Steven in the audience.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi, Steven.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Steven, do you know -- have you decided who you're voting for?
<Question> <Neutral> I have.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And?
<Question> <Neutral> He's sitting on the stage with you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, I love it. [Applause] I can tell.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And you still have a question for him?
<Question> <Neutral> I do. Thank you for taking this question directly, Mr. Trump. Early in your campaign you made the comment that you would be neutral on Israel. I believe that this takes the handcuffs off Israel to operate nationally as a sovereign nation whereas you were criticized in the media for this statement. How do you envision our role in Israel and the Middle East going forward?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK. It's a great question. And look, I want to see peace. I want to see if it can be done. You know, when you talk about the all-time deal in terms of toughness, that's it, a deal between the Palestinians and Israel. That's, to me, the all-time -- you know, we talk -- we all have our -- like it's called our dream deal.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What's the deal that you would most like?
<Question> <Neutral> The next book.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would love to be able to do it. Everyone tells me it can't be made. The Israeli tells me, you know, I've never met a person from Israel, and I know so many of them, that didn't want to make a deal. But they say that's the hardest deal, because it's years and years, it's centuries of -- it's like ingrained.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I will be trying to make that deal. I am a big fan of Israel, I have to tell you. There's no bigger fan of Israel. [Applause] And I want to be able to get both sides together and see if we can do something. But there is nobody that will be more loyal to Israel than Donald Trump. And we're going to make.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Applause] You know, it's one of great allies. And honestly, when you look at this horrible deal that Obama made -- that President Obama made with Iran where we give them $150 billion -- we got nothing out of the deal, $150 billion. We actually got nothing. Even our prisoners, they didn't come back until we gave them the money.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I'll tell you what, you'll never see deals like that made with me. And you understand that, Steven, that's why you're with me. But we have to protect Israel. We have to take care of Israel. They're really sort of a bastion, all by themselves right now. And they have been great. I will say this, and I've said it and some people get upset with me on the Obama side when I say it, President Obama is the single worst thing that I have ever seen happen to Israel.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's unbelievable. It's unbelievable. [Applause] And we are going to take -- I love the question, Steven, but we are going to take great care of Israel. We're going to protect and cherish Israel. But we're going to see if we can make a deal. I just have to do that. It's almost from a competitive standpoint now.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And they all say you can't do it, it can never be done. I say you can do it. Though we'll see what happens. So thank you, Steven.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> We're going to take another quick break. We have more questions for Donald Trump in the second half of our "On the Record" 2016 town hall. Plus we have two special guests. That's next. [Applause] And we are back in Indianapolis for our special On the Record town hall with GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And we are coming to you from the historic Hilbert Circle Theatre in downtown Indianapolis. And now, a special guest, someone who certainly doesn't need an introduction here in Indiana and probably not anyplace across the country, former Indiana University basketball coach, Bobby Knight. [Applause]
<Bobby Knight> <Neutral> OK. [Applause]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> It's good to see you. [Applause]
<Bobby Knight> <Neutral> Hi. [Applause]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, Coach, nice to see you and I... [Crosstalk] I've already given the coach trouble backstage because Indiana beat Wisconsin just too many times, but anyway, I'm -- I'm delighted to talk to the coach. Coach, why are you a Trump supporter?
<Bobby Knight> <Neutral> Because I think, you know, I'm not a Republican and I'm not a Democrat. And I've always voted... -- because I think that voting is a special thing that we have in this country that isn't in a lot of different countries. But I've always voted, but I've always voted for the person that I thought was the best for the job.
<Bobby Knight> <Neutral> And there's no question... [Applause] There's no question in my mind that the man standing between the two of us is far and away the best person to lead America where... [Applause] -- we all want to be led. And that's the guy that can do it, right here.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, thank you. [Inaudible]. [Applause]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> So who contacted who? Donald, did you contact Coach or Coach contact you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I'll tell you, it was a funny story. Now, I've been a fan for many years, but I didn't know Bobby [Inaudible]...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You and the whole state.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The whole country. I mean it's not the state. I mean it's everybody. But I get a call about a year ago from Bobby. He said, if you run for office, I'm endorsing you. And I haven't even really decided at that point whether I was going to run. But he just called up out of the blue. I said, you know what, Coach, do me a favor.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Give -- first, I had to make sure it was really him. I said, Bobby Knight. [Laughter] That is like a big deal for me. But I said, would you do me a favor, give me your number and, you know, let's see what happens and I'll call you back. And about a week ago, I said, hey, we're going to Indiana. And we all love Indiana, but who's more Mr. Indiana, who's done more for Indiana?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean look at all the championships that... [Applause] And -- and the beauty is... [Applause] -- it's -- it's not even that. [Applause] He's an unbelievable leader. He's tough. He's smart. And he's just -- he knows how to win, because we don't win anymore, Bobby. We were saying before they don't win anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I said, hey, and I called the number. He picked up. Yes? I said, Coach, it's Trump. Do you still want to endorse me? He said, absolutely, I've been waiting for your call. [Laughter] So anyway, so that was... [Applause]
<Bobby Knight> <Neutral> That, to me, is a little indication of the kind of man we're talking to right here. And he's absolutely right in how things worked with me having a friend call him and get a chance to talk to him. And I kind of said, well, you know, I hope that works out, because I would really like to be in a position where I can be of some help to him, not really thinking, well, I'll tell you, on the exact day that he told me he would call me about two or three months later, that morning, at 7:00, he called me to ask me if I was ready to go. Now, I think that most people in his status would have forgotten about that a long -- a long time ago.
<Bobby Knight> <Neutral> But let me tell you, when he tells you he's got to do something, and when he's on the side of what has to be done, he never ever forgets what he's doing, I'll tell you that right now. And what he's doing, the best man there is for the development of the United States. [Applause]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you. ; [Applause] Thank you.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> [Inaudible] and Coach, we have a question from a member of the audience, Boris, who is part of the greatest generation, served in World War II, has a question for Donald Trump. [Applause]
<Question> <Neutral> [Inaudible]. [Applause]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And, sir, thank you. Thank you, sir.
<Question> <Neutral> As an Indiana University graduate and a World War II vet, I have a tremendous respect for the general, Bobby Knight. [Applause] And Mr. Trump, how do you compare your successful career and philosophy with Coach Knight?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it's a great -- that's actually a great question. I just love his philosophy. I mean we're in a different world and he was in the world of sports and nobody did better. And, you know, one of the great things about Bobby that a lot of people don't know is he really trained a lot of great coaches, some of the best, like you look at Duke and you look at so many of the different places where they have the great coaches, they were trained and they worked with Bobby.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But Bobby was, you know, in his field, a tremendous leader and what he's done is phenomenal. So I'd like to put myself in a category even close to Bobby as far as that. You talk about the word leadership, that's leadership. Thank you. [Applause]
<Bobby Knight> <Neutral> That was very nice of you to say that. I appreciate it. But let me say another thing about Mr. Trump. And I think we're a little bit alike in that regard. If we're involved in something where we want to win, and particularly something that's necessary, if there's something out there where we need to win, we're going to try and beat your ass every time we can.
<Bobby Knight> <Neutral> [Applause]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Thank you very much for joining us. Thank you very much for joining us. We're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back with more questions for Donald Trump, candidate for president of the United States. The On the Record 2016 town hall continues next. Thank you, Coach. [Applause] [Applause] Welcome back to Indianapolis for an On the Record town hall with GOP frontrunner, Donald Trump.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Indiana is the biggest delegate prize until California. And right now, let's get back to the questions. And Donald, I'm going to ask you one. Um, it's no secret our country doesn't have a lot of money. We're -- we're in debt. Um, what would the foreign aid policy be of a Trump administration for -- and this is a two part question -- one is to use money as coercion for countries that we aren't particularly friendly with and may not deserve it, but we want to get them to do something.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And the other is for humanitarian aid like I was just down in Ecuador, where the earthquake where there are earthquake victims. And you've got Nepal and you've got Haiti and all these countries where people are desperate. So what would you be doing with our foreign aid policy and our money?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can see both, to be honest with you. I mean we do help countries that we're not in love with them, but if we don't help them, it's going to be bigger problems. And I can sort of see both. At the same time, we give money and we give a lot of things and a lot of help to countries that absolutely don't deserve it, they absolutely -- they're not our friends, they don't do anything good for us. It's like a one way street.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You look at NATO as an example. We have 28 countries. We protect them. And many of those countries right now are delinquent. They haven't paid up and they have the money to pay up. And we have trillions, probably, trillions of dollars out there of past due. And I said I want these countries to pay up and we'll protect them and we'll take care.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean we're protecting them. They're not doing anything for us. They've got to pay up. And I said not only do they pay up, they have to pay us all of the past arrears.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But what about a country like -- well, let's take a country like Pakistan has sometimes double dealt us...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, Pakistan is...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> -- and we've given them money and they've double dealt us.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, but the problem with Pakistan, where they have nuclear weapons and -- which is a real problem. Again, our -- the single biggest problem we have is nuclear weapons, you know, countries with them. And it's not only a country, you have nine countries right now with nuclear weapons. But it's semi-unstable.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And we don't want to see total instability. And it's not that much, relatively speaking. And we have a little bit of a good relationship. And I think I'd try and keep it. And it's very much against my grain to say that, but a country -- and that's always the country, I think, you know, we give them money and we help them out, but if we don't, I think that would go on the other side of the ledger and that could really be a disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> At the same time, if you look at India and some of the others, maybe they'll be helping us out, because we're going to look at it. But we have many, many countries that we give a lot of money to and we get absolutely nothing in return and that's going to stop fast.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What about the countries that may have deep need but, you know, whenever I do these stories, like on Ecuador, people say what about here?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, that's a problem. I mean you have to understand, though, Greta, we're a debtor nation. We owe $19 trillion. You know, we used to be the policeman -- we are now the policeman of the world. We take care of everything. Everybody says our military -- we spend many, many times what any other country spends on the military.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But we don't really spend it for ourselves, we spend it to protect everybody else. We're protecting everybody. It's not our military. Our military is -- as I said before, it's depleted. So you look at that. We have to start, you know, getting rid of debt, balancing budgets. We just can't continue to keep giving, giving, giving.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> So you...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now there are countries...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> -- would you [Inaudible]...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- that can do it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> -- would you cut out giving some of this humanitarian aid...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'd...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> -- to these countries...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- I'd try j
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> -- that are hurting?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would try so hard to keep some of these countries going, but, Greta, we are a debtor nation. We are sitting on a bubble like you wouldn't believe. We owe $19 trillion. We're going to be at $21 trillion like almost immediately because of the horrible omnibus budget that was just passed, which, by the way, funds ObamaCare, it funds people pouring into the country, it forms people coming in from the Syrian migration and we have no idea who they are.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They could be ISIS. We have no idea who they are. So the answer is -- and I know how involved you are in that. And I'm not even that surprised to have this question, to be honest with you, because you are amazing. She goes all over the world helping people. And we're going to try but we do have problems.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We are a debtor nation. We do have problems. And we have to -- you know, I -- I gave a speech this morning and one of -- I mean the primary theme was America first. We have to fix our country. It's so broken. We have to fix it. [Applause]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And our conversation with 2016 GOP presidential candidate and frontrunner, Donald Trump, continues in just moments. Plus, we have another special guest. [Applause] [Applause] Welcome back to Indianapolis. And we are at the Hilbert Circle Theatre for the On the Record town hall with Donald Trump. And we are now joined by one of his two -- one of his three sons, Donald Trump, Jr. Nice to see you.
<Donald Trump, Jr.> <Neutral> Great to be here, Greta. How are you? [Applause]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> OK, how much fun was Tuesday night with the five primaries and the sweep?
<Donald Trump, Jr.> <Neutral> Oh, it was amazing. I mean I can't be more proud of what he's done as an American, as a father, uh, just to see this and see the voice that he's giving to the people of this country for a change, it's just amazing. I...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Did you expect it like that?
<Donald Trump, Jr.> <Neutral> Listen, I...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Those numbers?
<Donald Trump, Jr.> <Neutral> -- you know, I think they even surprised us. But, you know, the people are getting it. They're seeing the system is rigged against them. They're seeing that their voice oftentimes doesn't matter. And they're looking to change that. And a resounding win, like we had that night, is going to actually give them that voice again.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You know, Donald... [Applause] -- one -- one of the fun things about my job is I get to meet all the candidates' children over the years. Um, you're proud of your kids, aren't you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am. I have great children. I have five children. And -- and the older ones are really helping me with the, uh, campaign. And Ivanka, Don and Eric and Tiffany, also. She's -- she's been terrific. And Baron is a little young right now, but he's -- he'll be there. He'll be there eventually. But, uh, they are fantastic children.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And there's nothing like -- you know, people oftentimes they say, you know, they're impressed by success. The most successful people that I've met, because the happiest, are the people with great families, mores than the people with money. I know them all. I know them all. [Applause] And the really successful people are the people that have the great families, just, you know, but these are the happiest people.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, has there been a family discussion in the event that your father is the nominee and -- and goes on to win in November, um, how are you going to serve -- extricate him from the business and who's going to -- who's going to do what?
<Donald Trump, Jr.> <Neutral> Well, listen, I think, you know, if there's one thing he's given us over the last few years -- I mean it took us a while to have to prove ourselves to him and he wasn't just going to turn over a company that employs tens of thousands of people and just say, hey, congratulations, my kids, you get it, like good luck.
<Donald Trump, Jr.> <Neutral> [Laughter] He's too loyal with that. And that's perhaps why he didn't run in 2008 or 2012, because he still had that obligation to those people who have served him so well for so long. He's the only one up here who's actually created jobs. He's actually signing the front of a paycheck. [Applause] That's a big deal.
<Donald Trump, Jr.> <Neutral> And that's a big deal to me. [Applause] So him... [Applause] -- standing over the last decade, I think we've really proven ourselves to him and, you know, we work incredibly well, uh, as a family between Eric, Ivanka and I. And, you know, it's just gone very well and he's -- he's given us that autonomy to do it. And him doing this, I mean I think is the ultimate show of trust, that he believes that we can do it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> [Inaudible] he's obviously very proud of... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They'd better do it right or they... [Laughter]
<Donald Trump, Jr.> <Neutral> Listen. [Applause] [Inaudible].
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, do you have a... [Applause] You have another question, uh, from Melanie, who joins us. Melanie, have you decided -- thank you for joining us. Melanie, have you decided how you're going to vote?
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> I'm undecided. That's why I'm here.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> OK. Um, then just fire away.
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> OK.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Here's your chance to ask candidate Donald Trump a question.
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> And thank you for being here.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you.
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> And Mr. Trump, I -- it was brought to my attention On the Record by Greta the amount of wasteful spending in the government.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's tremendous.
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> And the lack of accountability.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> And my question is, what will you do about that and would you consider a woman who is very informed, caring and smart, like Greta, as part of your cabinet?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's not a bad idea. [Applause] That is not a bad idea. [Applause] She would be [Inaudible].
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I think -- I think more than an hour with me would be enough for -- for Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The truth is...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- she's doing -- yes, she's doing so well, I'm not sure she'd want it, if you want to know the... [Laughter] But...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What about [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- I will say this -- I will say this, it's such a great question and nobody ever asked that question. You know, we talk about how do you get money and bring the jobs back and all of that's going to be easy. In a way, the easiest thing for me is cutting, because we have wait -- we call it waste, fraud and abuse.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have billions and billions and billions of dollars. And you see it, where a highway is going to cost X dollars and it costs five times more than it's supposed to. You can imagine the money that these contractors are making on these things that they're building all over the country where it's totally out of control, including military spending.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, military spending is -- is tremendous and very important to me. And we're going to rebuild our military. But things cost twice as much as they were supposed to cost, three times as much. It's not supposed to happen that way, OK. It won't happen that way with the right contractors, frankly, and the right people knowing how to negotiate a contract.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So there's tremendous waste and there's tremendous fraud and abuse. And we are going to save billions and billions of dollars. It's such a great question, because -- and it's so easy. It's so easy. That's one of the easiest things. So very good. I hope you're going to vote for me, by the way. [Applause]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Let me take another short break. [Applause] Coming up, closing thoughts from the On the Record 2016 town hall. That's straight ahead. [Applause] [Applause] And we're in downtown Indianapolis at the historic Hilbert Circle Theatre with presidential candidate, Donald Trump, and Donald Trump, Jr. And we just have a few closing thoughts.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, um, now that we're getting down close to the convention, um, we're looking sort of at the numbers and whether, you know, whether you'll get the 1,237, or whether the other two could even numerically do it, um, do you think that when all is said as -- and done, that you could work with Governor Kasich and Senator Ted Cruz?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think so. I really do. I think, uh, it's going to happen. And so many people have called me up over the last couple of weeks, because we've been doing so well. We had the big victory in New York, far beyond anybody's expectation. I mean we had -- it was a blowout. And then last night, as you know, it was a total blowout -- five -- five states that everybody -- every one of them was beyond expectation.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I'll tell you what, I've been getting so many calls from people that I'll see on your show and other shows, that say the worst things about me. It's like...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You say bad things, too. You can...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, no, no...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> -- you can fire back just as hard.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But, no, no, but they're... [Laughter] -- that's true. But -- but they'll say these things about me...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Your son nodded yes, by the way.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, well. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump, Jr.> <Neutral> I know him well. It's true.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That -- no, but Greta, they're saying -- they say such bad things and then they call me over the last couple of weeks, they want to get on board. They want to come in. They want to come into the cam -- I say -- I actually said to a couple of them, how can you -- after what you said about me, how can you -- it's OK, I -- I want to have you, but how can you possibly do that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And they say don't worry about it. And you know why, because they're politicians. They can do it. You know, it doesn't matter. But they all want to come. So tremendous numbers of people are coming on board. They will be announced pretty soon. But a lot of people. And people that you wouldn't have believed, people that said the worst things.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And they're going to, you know, no problem.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> It -- it's -- politics is a unique business.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's a strange world here, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Thank you, two. Donald, Jr. and Donald Trump, a big thanks to both of you for joining us and for our town hall tonight. That's all for now. We'll see you again tomorrow night right here at 7:00 p.m. [Inaudible]. [Applause]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Good night from Indianapolis. [Applause]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But right now, Donald Trump. He wants to know if President Obama's hiding something. What is it this time? Plus, Donald Trump is planning to do something very, very major at the Republican national convention. Here is Donald Trump.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, nice to talk to you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> So Donald, the Republican convention's coming up. Are you going? That's the first question. Secondly, if you are, do you intend to be speaking to the audience
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, they want me to go. And I'm going to be in Sarasota the night before, where I'm being honored by the Republican Party in Florida as the statesman of the year. And that will be very interesting and I look forward to that. And I probably will be going, but they do want me to go, yes.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> How about speak? Have you been asked to speak?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'd rather not say that yet, but they do want me to do something very major at the convention.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, well, something very major. Now you've have certainly teased us. What's the very major? Can you give us a hint?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't. I'm not allowed to say, but it's something very, very major.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. The nominee of the Republican Party, Governor Romney, has not yet named a vice president. We're getting down to the wire. I'm curious whether or not you think -- not who would you necessarily like to see so much, but what would be the politically most shrewd choice, if he wants to get elected in November?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I do think he should get somebody that's going to help him get one of the swing states. So if you look at the different people -- you know, you have Florida, Rubio -- excellent. You have Chris Christie, excellent. He's an excellent guy and a friend of mine, but an excellent guy, done a great job as governor of New Jersey.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Portman -- you know, we need to get Ohio. We need to get other states. So I do think -- and by the way, Bob McDonnell in Virginia is a fantastic guy and doing an amazing job as governor. I have a lot of property in Virginia. He's done an amazing job as governor. So those are great names, and I think that those names can help swing a certain state.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> All of those states are very important.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You know, I've been looking at the numbers of those states you've identified. But a recent number has caught my attention, and that's the women vote. And something has happened in the month that's quite extraordinary, is that in July, the beginning of July, President Obama was up with the women vote by 8 points over Governor Romney.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Now, one month later, President Obama has widened that margin and he's up 19 points with the women vote over Governor Romney. Governor Romney has lost a lot of ground in the last month. I'm curious, in light of that, should the governor be looking very -- very strongly in the direction of choosing a woman?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I'm surprised to hear those numbers. I think that he's been, you know, an amazing campaigner. I think he's done really well. And his real campaign hasn't come out. I think that'll really start to happen after the convention. But I am very surprised to see those numbers, actually shocked. And I don't know if those numbers are real.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't think they're meaningful because I would be very, very surprised if those numbers were real.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, the numbers are fluid. That's one month, so this month -- and you know, things do change. But I thought it was extraordinary, at least that poll. All right, the controversy with Senator Harry Reid and the tax returns. Should Governor Romney -- I mean, tell me your view on it first.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think it's a very strong statement that Harry made. And I've known Harry and I like Harry. But I think it's a statement that he probably wished he didn't make. I don't think there was a source. A lot of people don't think there was a source. If there was a source, it's probably not allowed and it's probably not even legal.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, who would be able to do that? Who would be allowed to do that? I don't think there is a source. So he made a statement. It was a very strong statement. I think that, frankly, and you -- I've said it many times and I'll continue to say it, that what Governor Romney should do, in my opinion -- and he's a very different person and he's got a different attitude, and I understand that -- - is say, I will give my tax returns if you open up your records because as you know, President Obama spent over $4 million trying to hide so many different things from his past, whether it's college applications, college records, passport records.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And you know, nobody brings this up! Nobody says, Open up your passport records. Open up your college applications. Open up your college records. Let's see your life. And nobody brings this up. By the way, most presidents have given their college records. All presidents have given, to the best of my knowledge, their passport records.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So why is he spending $4 million on trying to keep them secret? So I would say, I will open up my tax returns -- and his tax returns are perfect. But I would open up my tax returns, but we want to see your records. I think they should place the shoe on the other foot. And I would think that you would probably not hear any more talk, frankly, about the tax returns, which are 100 percent according to Hoyle.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> If -- I thought that the birth issue had been put to rest with you to your satisfaction. Most Americans, it is, that people are satisfied...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I disagree with that. I don't think people are satisfied at all. And it doesn't matter. And that's not my big issue. My big issue are jobs and the fact that we have 8.3 unemployment now. It just went up, as you know, last month, 8.3 percent unemployment, and that's terrible. But the real number is 16 percent because so many people aren't included in the unemployment rolls that should be. And the real, real number's probably 21 percent unemployment.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So when you look at the kind of jobs that we are doing, that's my issue. But no, have I been satisfied? No, I have not been satisfied.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, let me -- what would you expect to find on the college records? I'm curious what you're looking for there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't want to get into it. I want to get into the fact that jobs -- you asked me a question and I responded. That's what I would say. I would say when he wants tax returns, we want to see, Why are you spending $4 million on trying to keep things in hiding? So I would say that would be my response. And I think it's a very good response.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And by the way, if you did that and did that strongly, people would stop asking for the tax returns. Now, the problem with him giving the tax returns is that he had a very significant success. He is a very significantly successful person. And the tax returns are complicated, done by big firms, highly respected firms and highly respected lawyers who sign off.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now, you can take any one of hundreds and hundreds and probably even thousands of lines and find one little thing and try and make a big deal out of it. And that's very, very unfair. So I understand exactly what Mitt is doing. He thinks it's unfair, and I know it's unfair. Now, Obama, who's made nothing, has very simple tax returns.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So it's easy for him to say, I'm giving my tax returns. But it's not easy for Mitt Romney to do that. But it's a great trade, and that's what I would do, if I were him, but he and I are very different people.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, in order for that to be a good trade, the tax returns for the college records, I mean, there's got to be something that you think -- you know, some use of the college records. And I'm still baffled what you would expect to see in the college records. What do you want, his grades or...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, no. I'd love to see his college records, just like I'd like to see lots of other things. I'd like to see his passport records. And by the way, I hope they're 100 percent OK. As an American and as a good American and somebody that loves this country, I hope they're 100 percent OK. But I'm trying to figure out why would somebody spend $4 million to try and keep those records silenced?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Where did you get the $4 million number? I mean, there's so much going on...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That was reported. That was reported.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. Well, it's, like -- I got to -- I have to tell you that I'm somewhat perplexed in the city. People report all sorts of things. We've got Senator Harry Reid claiming things with unnamed sources. Now we got $4 million. I mean, we really -- you know, in this city, we have a hard time sort of nailing down, you know, the facts and the sources.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, that was a reported number, and I think it's pretty well documented that he spent a fortune on lawyers to try and keep things secret. So I don't know how he can keep things secret, but Governor Romney is not supposed to keep things secret. So I think it's very unfair. I think it's a very, very bad double standard.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, suppose that President Obama got a C in history in college. Does that make any different at all at this late date? I understand -- the tax returns are recent history, but the president -- he's a 51-year-old man. And his college records -- I'm still perplexed on that one.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, I don't think it would. And I'm not necessarily looking at the marks. I'm looking at other things also. And that would be what I would like to see. But again, the Romney group, they're going to have to make that determination for themselves. I think it's been a very dirty campaign. It was a very dirty campaign waged against Hillary by Obama.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And if you look at Obama's campaigning, it's extremely dirty against everybody that's ever run against him. And I think the Republicans had better be careful because what's happening to them is the same thing that's happening to other candidates that ran against Obama. It's a very dirty campaign. And Hillary Clinton -- - you know, I've read recently where they consider Hillary to be one -- it was one of the meanest campaigns ever run against her.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, so far, I think this one is even meaner. So we'll see what happens. But sometimes -- the expression is, you have to fight fire with fire. And if he doesn't fight fire with fire, it's going to be not so easy.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What do you -- what -- how -- how is it going to be -- what's the fire back on President Obama on this?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I just think you have to be extremely aggressive. And I think they will be. But you know, they're going to have a convention, and the convention, I believe, is going to be very, very successful. There's a lot of spirit for Mitt Romney. And I think he's going to be really a good candidate and really a really good president.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now, I have to say this. If you remember back, the biggest problem he had was going into Florida. And I always talk about because I'm a big sports person, and I always talk about people react under pressure. Some people can react well under pressure and some people can't. Mitt Romney went to Florida under great pressure, unbelievable pressure.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He had to win Florida, and it wasn't looking good. He had two debates. He won both debates. He did brilliantly in both debates. He then won the state of Florida in a very, very large number. I think it's going to be very interesting, but I believe Mitt Romney is somebody that reacts very well under pressure.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There aren't too many of these people around.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> We only have a minute left. It is reported that we have as many as 14,000 government buildings that are empty in this country and have cost us a fortune just sitting there. I know that you recently cut -- worked out some deal with the old post office here in D.C. -- 14,000 buildings. Do you have some advice for the federal government, business advice what to do with the 14,000 buildings?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, you know, real estate is my primary thing in life. I love real estate. And I would say certainly that they could be auctioned off. You'll see if they're good. If they're not good, perhaps you can't auction them off. But this is a time when buying real estate is a good thing. You can buy real estate.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> People would like to buy real estate. And certainly, auctioning them off or hiring good brokers to sell them would not be a bad idea. Now, also, it could be that the government needs those buildings. Now, if they need the buildings, you can't do that. But if they're sitting empty and unnecessary, probably the auction process would not be a bad one.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I'm curious whether there are some sort of regulations or impediments because that would seem like the smartest thing to do, is that we have 14,000 buildings, let's unload them quickly. And even, you know, if we have to take 70 cents on a dollar or something, or whatever, it would make sense, rather than have the 14,000 buildings sit there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it's possible there are regulations. I mean, there's regulations for everything in this country, and that's part of the problem the country has. But certainly, if they're empty and doing nothing, I would say auctioning them off would be very much an interesting thing. And I would be at the auction.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, thank you. And if you're at the convention, will you join us "On the Record"?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I certainly will.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Great. Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You're booked. Thank you. Thank you, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi fellas, how you doing?
<Peter Baker> <Positive> Good. Good. How was your lunch?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was good. We are very close. It's a tough -- you know, health care. Look, Hillary Clinton worked eight years in the White House with her husband as president and having majorities and couldn't get it done. Smart people, tough people -- couldn't get it done. Obama worked so hard.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They had 60 in the Senate. They had big majorities and had the White House. I mean, ended up giving away the state of Nebraska. They owned the state of Nebraska. Right. Gave it away. Their best senator did one of the greatest deals in the history of politics. What happened to him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I think we are going to do OK I think we are going to see. I mean, one of my ideas was repeal. But I certainly rather would get repeal and replace, because the next last thing I want to do is start working tomorrow morning on replace. And it is time. It is tough. It's a very narrow path, winding this way. You think you have it, and then you lose four on the other side because you gave. It is a brutal process. And it was for Democrats, in all fairness.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, you think of Hillary Clinton, and you look, she went eight years -- very capable -- went eight years as the first lady, and could not get health care. So this is not an easy crack. The one thing I'll say about myself, so, Obama was in there for eight years and got Obamacare. Hillary Clinton was in there eight years and they never got Hillarycare, whatever they called it at the time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am not in here six months, and they'll say, "Trump hasn't fulfilled his agenda." I say to myself, wait a minute, I'm only here a very short period of time compared to Obama. How long did it take to get Obamacare?
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> March, March 2010.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So he was there for more than a year.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Fourteen months.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I'm here less than six months, so, ah, you know. Something to think about.
<Peter Baker> <Negative> We wrote the same stories, though, in August of 2009. "Obama can't get it."
<Michael S. Schmidt> <Neutral> It died several times.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Several times.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it was a tough one. That was a very tough one.
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> He lost that election.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nothing changes. Nothing changes. Once you get something for pre-existing conditions, etc., etc. Once you get something, it's awfully tough to take it away.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> That's been the thing for four years. When you win an entitlement, you can't take it back.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But what it does, Maggie, it means it gets tougher and tougher. As they get something, it gets tougher. Because politically, you can't give it away. So pre-existing conditions are a tough deal. Because you are basically saying from the moment the insurance, you're 21 years old, you start working and you're paying $12 a year for insurance, and by the time you're 70, you get a nice plan. Here's something where you walk up and say, "I want my insurance." It's a very tough deal, but it is something that we're doing a good job of.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> Am I wrong in thinking -- I've talked to you a bunch of times about this over the last couple years, but you are generally of the view that people should have health care, right? I mean, I think that you come at it from the view of É
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, yes. [Inaudible, Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I told them today, I don't want to do that. I want to either get it done or not get it done. If we don't get it done, we are going to watch Obamacare go down the tubes, and we'll blame the Democrats. And at some point, they are going to come and say, "You've got to help us."
<Peter Baker> <Negative> Did the senators want to try again?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think so. We had a great meeting. Was I late? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was a great meeting. We had 51 show up, other than John.
<Peter Baker> <Positive> Senator McCain.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's a lot. Normally when they call for a meeting, you have like 20.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> How about the last one in June? Do you guys remember how many came?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Ah, 49. It was actually 48, but John McCain was there. But I guess we had 51 today, so that counts. That shows the spirit.
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> Who is the key guy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they are all key. The problem is we have 52 votes. Don't forget, you look at Obama, he had 60. That's a big difference. So, we have 52 votes. Now, I guess we lose Susan Collins. I guess we lose Rand Paul. Then we can't lose any votes. That is a very tough standard. Statistically, you want to bet on that all day long. With that being said, I think we had a great meeting. I think we had a great meeting.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Where does it go from here, do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I say, let's not vote on repeal. Let's just vote on this. So first, they vote on the vote. And that happens sometime Friday?
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Next week.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Or Monday? Monday. And then they'll vote on this, and we'll see. We have some meetings scheduled today. I think we have six people who are really sort of OK They are all good people. We don't have bad people. I know the bad people. Believe me, do I know bad people. And we have a very good group of people, and I think they want to get there. So we'll see what happens. But it's tough.
<Michael S. Schmidt> <Negative> How's McConnell to work with?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like him. I mean, he's good. He's good. It's been a tough process for him.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> He's taken on some water.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. It's been a tough process for him. This health care is a tough deal. I said it from the beginning. No. 1, you know, a lot of the papers were saying -- actually, these guys couldn't believe it, how much I know about it. I know a lot about health care. [Inaudible] This is a very tough time for him, in a sense, because of the importance. And I believe we get there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is a very tough time for them, in a sense, because of the importance. And I believe that it's [Inaudible], that makes it a lot easier. It's a mess. One of the things you get out of this, you get major tax cuts, and reform. And if you add what the people are going to save in the middle income brackets, if you add that to what they're saving with health care, this is like a windfall for the country, for the people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I don't know, I thought it was a great meeting. I bet the number's -- I bet the real number's four. But let's say six or eight. And everyone's [Inaudible], so statistically, that's a little dangerous, right?
<Peter Baker> <Negative> Pretty tight.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hope we don't have any grandstanders. I don't think we do. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it will be pretty bad for them if they did. I don't think we have any -- I think it would be very bad for -- I think this is something the people want. They've been promised it. [Break in Transcript]
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> I don't think I've seen you look like you were enjoying yourself that much since the convention, really.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have had the best reviews on foreign land. So I go to Poland and make a speech. Enemies of mine in the media, enemies of mine are saying it was the greatest speech ever made on foreign soil by a president. I'm saying, man, they cover [Inaudible]. You saw the reviews I got on that speech. Poland was beautiful and wonderful, and the reception was incredible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then, went to France the following week, because it was the 100th year. [Inaudible] The Paris Accord -- I wasn't going to get along with France for a little while, because people forget, because it is a very unfair agreement to us. China doesn't get [Inaudible] until 2030. Russia goes back to 1994 as a standard -- a much, much lower standard.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> India has things that are [Inaudible]. I want to do the same thing as everyone else. We can't do that? We can't do that? That's OK Let me get out. Frankly, the people that like me, love that I got out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> After that, it was fairly surprising. He called me and said, "I'd love to have you there and honor you in France," having to do with Bastille Day. Plus, it's the 100th year of the First World War. That's big. And I said yes. I mean, I have a great relationship with him. He's a great guy.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> He was very deferential to you. Very.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a great guy. Smart. Strong. Loves holding my hand.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> I've noticed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People don't realize he loves holding my hand. And that's good, as far as that goes. [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, really. He's a very good person. And a tough guy, but look, he has to be. I think he is going to be a terrific president of France. But he does love holding my hand. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> At that note, the cameras are gone. I was standing there with him, with probably hundreds of thousands of people.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> It was a very crowded [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it was one of the most beautiful parades I have ever seen. And in fact, we should do one one day down Pennsylvania Ave.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> I wondered if you were going to say that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've always thought of that.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've always thought of that. I've thought of it long before.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the Bastille Day parade was -- now that was a super-duper -- OK I mean, that was very much more than normal. They must have had 200 planes over our heads. Normally you have the planes and that's it, like the Super Bowl parade.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And everyone goes crazy, and that's it. That happened for -- and you know what else that was nice? It was limited. You know, it was two hours, and the parade ended. It didn't go a whole day. They didn't go crazy. You don't want to leave, but you have to. Or you want to leave, really.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These things are going on all day. It was a two-hour parade. They had so many different zones. Maybe 100,000 different uniforms, different divisions, different bands. Then we had the retired, the older, the ones who were badly injured. The whole thing, it was an incredible thing.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> It was beautiful.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you are looking at the Arc [de Triomphe]. So we are standing in the most beautiful buildings, and we are looking down the road, and like three miles in, and then you had the Arc. And then you have these soldiers. Everyone was so proud. Honestly, it was a beautiful thing. I was glad I did it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People were surprised because I'd just come back from Hamburg. So I was back for three days, and then I had to go out again. But when he [Mr. Macron] invited me, he and I have a very good relationship. I have a very good relationship with Merkel.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do you know what happened with Merkel? So I am sitting in the chair. We'd been sitting there for two hours. So it's not like, "Nice to see ya." So the press comes in. So I guess someone screamed out, "Shake her hand, shake her hand!" I didn't even hear. So I didn't shake her hand, because I'd been with her for so long. I'd been with her for a long period of time. So I didn't shake her -- the next day, "Trump refused to shakeÉ" [Inaudible] [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She actually called me, and she said, um, "You know, I think we get along very well." I said we do, we really do. I said, "You gotta put more money into NATO," No. 1. And No. 2 is like, our trade imbalance is ridiculous. You know, it's a money machine. [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's been a long time. Nothing changes. Wait till you see what we're going to do on trade.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> Sounds like it's going to be very interesting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Much more interesting than anybody would understand.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> OK [Break in Transcript]
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> Will you go to Britain? Are you going to make a state visit to Britain? Are you going to be able to do that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> As to Britain?
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Will you go there? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Ah, they've asked me. What was interesting -- so, when Macron asked, I said: "Do you think it's a good thing for me to go to Paris? I just ended the Paris Accord last week. Is this a good thing?" He said, "They love you in France." I said, "OK, I just don't want to hurt you." [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We had dinner at the Eiffel Tower, and the bottom of the Eiffel Tower looked like they could have never had a bigger celebration ever in the history of the Eiffel Tower. I mean, there were thousands and thousands of people, 'cause they heard we were having dinner. [Crosstalk, Inaudible]
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> You must have been so tired at, by that point.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. It was beautiful. We toured the museum, we went to Napoleon's tomb É [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Napoleon finished a little bit bad. But I asked that. So I asked the president, so what about Napoleon? He said: "No, no, no. What he did was incredible. He designed Paris." [Inaudible] The street grid, the way they work, you know, the spokes. He did so many things even beyond. And his one problem is he didn't go to Russia that night because he had extracurricular activities, and they froze to death. How many times has Russia been saved by the weather? [Crosstalk, Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Same thing happened to Hitler. Not for that reason, though. Hitler wanted to consolidate. He was all set to walk in. But he wanted to consolidate, and it went and dropped to 35 degrees below zero, and that was the end of that army. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But the Russians have great fighters in the cold. They use the cold to their advantage. I mean, they've won five wars where the armies that went against them froze to death. [Crosstalk] It's pretty amazing. So, we're having a good time. The economy is doing great.
<Michael S. Schmidt> <Positive> The markets are doing great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're going to really go up if we do what we're doing. I mean, cut regulations tremendously. Sometimes -- you know, one thing they hadn't thought about at The Times, where they said I didn't really cut regulations as much. I heard that because I said -- it could have been a little slip-up in terms of what I said -- I meant, for the time in office, five months and couple of weeks, I think I've done more than anyone else. They may have taken it as more than anyone else, period. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I'm talking about for my time. I heard that Harry Truman was first, and then we beat him. These are approved by Congress. These are not just executive orders. On the executive orders, we cut regulations tremendously. By the way, I want regulations, but, you know, some of the -- you have to get nine different regulations, and you could never do anything. I've given the farmers back their farms. I've given the builders back their land to build houses and to build other things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The energy stuff is going really well. We're going to be an exporter -- we already are an exporter of energy. We're doing well. I mean, the banks, you look at rules and regulations, you look at Dodd-Frank, Dodd-Frank is going to be, you know, modified, and again, I want rules and regulations. But you don't want to choke, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People can't get loans to buy a pizza parlor, to buy a -- you know, I saw out on the trail -- people say, Mr. Trump, we've dealt with banks, my own bank, and they can't loan me anymore. I've never had a bad day with a bank. You know? So we'll put -- yeah, because of statutory [Inaudible], they can't loan to that kind of a business. And they're good businesses to loan to. So I think we've -- I think we're set to really go [Inaudible]. [Break in Transcript]
<Peter Baker> <Negative> As long as we're on the record, a lot of people are curious about your conversation with President [Vladimir V.] Putin at dinner. Not surprising. But what did you all talk about, and --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, that dinner was a very long time planned dinner. And what it was was an evening at the opera. It was a final night goodbye from Germany and from Chancellor Merkel. It was her dinner. It was, you know, everybody knew about it. It was well-known. [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So when we got there, it was with spouses, and when we got there, there were a thousand media. You guys know, were you guys there?
<Peter Baker> <Negative> No, it was Julie and Glenn Thrush.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So, it was tremendous media. And we took a picture of everybody, the wives and the leaders, and then the leaders, and, you know, numerous pictures outside on the river. Then everybody walked in to see the opera. Then the opera ended. Then we walked into a big room where they had dinner for not only the leaders -- Lagarde was there, who I think is terrific, and various others
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You had the E.U. people there, people other than just the leaders, but quite a few people. I would say you have 20 times two, so you had 40, and then you probably had another 10 or 15 people, you had Christine Lagarde, you had some others also.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I was seated next to the wife of Prime Minister Abe, who I think is a terrific guy, and she's a terrific woman, but doesn't speak English.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Like, nothing, right? Like zero?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Like, not "hello."
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> That must make for an awkward seating.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's hard, because you know, you're sitting there for --
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Hours.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So the dinner was probably an hour and 45 minutes. [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You had an opera, and then you had a cocktail party for the people at the opera, and then you had the leaders with the spouses, and other leaders in Europe and maybe other places, go in. We sat at this really long table, which held, has to be at least 60, 65 people with room. OK, it's a very big table, big room. But there was nothing secretive about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was like, that's where we're going. And I think it even said on the list, at the request of the German chancellor and Germany, it's going to be the opera, it's going to be cocktails, it's going to be dinner. I think the crowd thinned out for the dinner -- you know, it was the leaders, primarily. But the leaders and Lagarde. And [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK, so we're sitting at this massive table. And the wives are separated from their husbands, which sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. But they did. It's always easier when they don't do it, because you always have somebody to talk to, right? And I was sitting next to the president of Argentina -- his wife -- Macri -- nice woman, who speaks English.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the prime minister of Japan's wife, Prime Minister Abe. Great relationships. So I'm sitting there. There was one interpreter for Japanese, 'cause otherwise it would have been even tougher. But I enjoyed the evening with her, and she's really a lovely woman, and I enjoyed -- the whole thing was good.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And now Melania was sitting on the other side of the table, way down on the other end, very far away. She was sitting next to Putin and somebody else, I don't know. She was sitting next to Putin.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> She had been the whole time?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes. She was sitting next to Putin.
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> Does she speak Russian at all?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No. She speaks other languages.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She was sitting next to Putin and somebody else, and that's the way it is. So the meal was going, and toward dessert I went down just to say hello to Melania, and while I was there I said hello to Putin. Really, pleasantries more than anything else. It was not a long conversation, but it was, you know, could be 15 minutes. Just talked about -- things. Actually, it was very interesting, we talked about adoption.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> You did?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We talked about Russian adoption. Yeah. I always found that interesting. Because, you know, he ended that years ago. And I actually talked about Russian adoption with him, which is interesting because it was a part of the conversation that Don had in that meeting. As I've said -- most other people, you know, when they call up and say, "By the way, we have information on your opponent," I think most politicians -- I was just with a lot of people, they said [Inaudible], "Who wouldn't have taken a meeting like that?" They just said --
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> The senators downstairs?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A lot of them. They said, "Who wouldn't have taken a meeting like that?"
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> You asked them about it at lunch?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nah, a couple of them. They -- now, that was before Russia was hot, don't forget. You know, Russia wasn't hot then. That was almost a year and a half ago. It wasn't like it is, like it is radioactive, then. Russia was Russia.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Then can I ask you --
<Peter Baker> <Negative> Sorry to interrupt. The email, though, said something I thought was really interesting, and I wonder what you thought of it. It said this "is part of Russia and its government's support of Mr. Trump." So whatever actually happened at the meeting --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I never saw the email. I never saw the email until, you know --
<Peter Baker> <Negative> Right, but now you have. So, what do you interpret that to mean, now that you have seen it? [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Hillary did the reset. Somebody was saying today, and then I read, where Hillary Clinton was dying to get back with Russia. Her husband made a speech, got half a million bucks while she was secretary of state. She did the uranium deal, which is a horrible thing, while she was secretary of state, and got a lot of money. [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She was opposing sanctions. She was totally opposed to any sanctions for Russia.
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> When was that?
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Do you remember when that was? I don't remember that. [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just saw it. I just saw it. She was opposed to sanctions, strongly opposed to sanctions on Russia.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> This is post-Crimea, I'm assuming? Is that what we would be talking about?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't really know. É But in that time. And don't forget, Crimea was given away during Obama. Not during Trump. In fact, I was on one of the shows, I said they're exactly right, they didn't have it as it exactly. But he was -- this -- Crimea was gone during the Obama administration, and he gave, he allowed it to get away. You know, he can talk tough all he wants, in the meantime he talked tough to North Korea.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he didn't actually. He didn't talk tough to North Korea. You know, we have a big problem with North Korea. Big. Big, big. You look at all of the things, you look at the line in the sand. The red line in the sand in Syria.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He didn't do the shot. I did the shot. Had he done that shot, he wouldn't have had -- had he done something dramatic, because if you remember, they had a tremendous gas attack after he made that statement. Much bigger than the one they had with me.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> It was sarin as well?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sarin. And, and tremendous numbers of people were killed, young people, children. And he didn't do anything. That was a famous weekend where they were all asking him to do it, do it, do it. They thought they had it, and then he -- not easy to do, I will say this, 'cause when I had to make that decision, I was with the president of China, and General Mattis said, "We're locked and loaded, sir," and I'm saying [Inaudible], you know. [Inaudible] Look, you're killing people.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You hate it, it's tough. Obama -- you know, I can understand it in a way, but some things you have to do. But it's, it's a tough, it's a tough decision to make.
<Peter Baker> <Negative> I do want to come out, on the email, now that you have seen that email that said Russia's government -- I mean, how did you -- did you interpret it that way?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I thought originally it might have had to do something with the payment by Russia of the D.N.C. Somewhere I heard that. Like, it was an illegal act done by the D.N.C., or the Democrats. That's what I had heard. Now, I don't know where I heard it, but I had heard that it had to do something with illegal acts with respect to the D.N.C.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, you know, when you look at the kind of stuff that came out, that was, that was some pretty horrific things came out of that. But that's what I had heard. But I don't know what it means. All I know is this: When somebody calls up and they say, "We have infor -- " Look what they did to me with Russia, and it was totally phony stuff.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Which, which one?
<Michael S. Schmidt> <Neutral> The dossier.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The dossier.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> The dossier. Oh, yes. [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, that was totally made-up stuff, and in fact, that guy's being sued by somebody. É And he's dying with the lawsuit. I know a lot about those guys, they're phony guys. They make up whatever they want. Just not my thing -- plus, I have witnesses, because I went there with a group of people. You know, I went there with Phil Ruffin --
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Oh, I didn't know that. [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I had a group of bodyguards, including Keith --
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Keith was there, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Keith was there. He said, "What kind of crap is this?" I went there for one day for the Miss Universe contest, I turned around, I went back. It was so disgraceful. It was so disgraceful. [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When he brought it to me, I said this is really made-up junk. I didn't think about anything. I just thought about, man, this is such a phony deal.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> You said that to him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, don't forget -- [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said, this is -- honestly, it was so wrong, and they didn't know I was just there for a very short period of time. It was so wrong, and I was with groups of people. It was so wrong that I really didn't, I didn't think about motive. I didn't know what to think other than, this is really phony stuff.
<Michael S. Schmidt> <Negative> Why do you think -- why do you think he shared it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think he shared it so that I would -- because the other three people left, and he showed it to me. [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So anyway, in my opinion, he shared it so that I would think he had it out there.
<Michael S. Schmidt> <Positive> As leverage?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, I think so. In retrospect. In retrospect. You know, when he wrote me the letter, he said, "You have every right to fire me," blah blah blah. Right? He said, "You have every right to fire me." I said, that's a very strange -- you know, over the years, I've hired a lot of people, I've fired a lot of people. Nobody has ever written me a letter back that you have every right to fire me. [Crosstalk]
<Peter Baker> <Negative> Do you think in hindsight, because of what's happened since then --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Comey wrote a letter.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Which letter?
<Michael S. Schmidt> <Neutral> To you? To the FBI staff or to you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I thought it was to me, right?
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> I think he wrote it to the staff, saying --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It might have been --
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> That "the president has every right to fire me."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It might have been. It was just a very strange letter to say that.
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> But do you think in hindsight, given that --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What was the purpose in repeating that?
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> Do you think what's given that --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do you understand what I mean? Why would somebody say, "He has every right to fire me," bah bah bah. Why wouldn't you just say, "Hey, I've retired É" [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was very -- a lot of people have commented that.
<Peter Baker> <Negative> Given what's happened since then, though, was it a political mistake to have fired him, given what's happened?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I did a great thing for the American people. [Break in Transcript]
<Michael S. Schmidt> <Negative> But look at the headache it's caused, you know?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's okay. I have headaches, that's what I have, I have headaches. É But you know what, I think I did a great thing for the American people.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> Do you wish you had done it on Day 1? When you got in? Because I honestly had assumed that you, if you were going to do it, that's when you would do it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it could've been. It could've been. I feel like it was very dishonest when he wouldn't say what he knew he said to the public. I thought that was very honest. And I thought that he did that for the reason I just said. [Break in Transcript]
<Michael S. Schmidt> <Positive> What do you understand to be the four corners of what Mueller [Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the Russia investigation] can look at, if he steps -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. Nobody has contacted me about anything. [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because I have done nothing wrong. A special counsel should never have been appointed in this case.
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> Can we put that on the record?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because so far, the only -- yeah, you can put it down.
<Michael S. Schmidt> <Negative> Was that Sessions's mistake or Rosenstein's mistake? [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, Sessions gets the job. Right after he gets the job, he recuses himself.
<Peter Baker> <Negative> Was that a mistake?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job, and I would have picked somebody else.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> He gave you no heads up at all, in any sense?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Zero. So Jeff Sessions takes the job, gets into the job, recuses himself. I then have -- which, frankly, I think is very unfair to the president. How do you take a job and then recuse yourself? If he would have recused himself before the job, I would have said, "Thanks, Jeff, but I can't, you know, I'm not going to take you." It's extremely unfair, and that's a mild word, to the president. So he recuses himself. I then end up with a second man, who's a deputy.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Rosenstein.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Who is he? And Jeff hardly knew. He's from Baltimore. [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, what Jeff Sessions did was he recused himself right after, right after he became attorney general. And I said, "Why didn't you tell me this before?" I would have -- then I said, "Who's your deputy?" So his deputy he hardly knew, and that's Rosenstein, Rod Rosenstein, who is from Baltimore. There are very few Republicans in Baltimore, if any. So, he's from Baltimore. Now, he, we went through a lot of things. We were interviewing replacements at the FBI Did you know Mueller was one of the people that was being interviewed?
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> I did, actually.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was sitting in that chair. We had a wonderful meeting.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> Day before, right?
<Michael S. Schmidt> <Neutral> Did he want the job?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The day before! Of course, he was up here, and he wanted the job.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> And he made that clear to you? He would have -- [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, now what happens is, he leaves the office. Rosenstein leaves the office. The next day, he is appointed special counsel. I said, what the hell is this all about? Talk about conflicts? But he was interviewing for the job. There were many other conflicts that I haven't said, but I will at some point. So Jeff Sessions, Jeff Sessions gave some bad answers.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> You mean at the hearing?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, he gave some answers that were simple questions and should have been simple answers, but they weren't. He then becomes attorney general, and he then announces he's going to recuse himself. Why wouldn't he have told me that before?
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Why do you think it was? What do you think it was?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know.
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> What would cause you -- what would be the line beyond which if Mueller went, you would say, "That's too far, we would need to dismiss him"?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, there are so many conflicts that everybody has. Then Rosenstein becomes extremely angry because of Comey's Wednesday press conference, where he said that he would do the same thing he did a year ago with Hillary Clinton, and Rosenstein became extremely angry at that because, as a prosecutor, he knows that Comey did the wrong thing. Totally wrong thing. And he gives me a letter, OK, he gives me a letter about Comey. And by the way, that was a tough letter, OK Now, perhaps I would have fired Comey anyway, and it certainly didn't hurt to have the letter, OK But he gives me a very strong letter, and now he's involved in the case. Well, that's a conflict of interest. Do you know how many conflicts of interests there are? But then, then Comey also says that he did something in order to get the special prose -- special counsel. He leaked. The reason he leaked. So, he illegally leaked. [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So think of this. Mike. He illegally leaks, and everyone thinks it is illegal, and by the way, it looks like it's classified and all that stuff. So he got -- not a smart guy -- he got tricked into that, because they didn't even ask him that question. They asked him another question, OK? [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He said I said "hope" -- "I hope you can treat Flynn good" or something like that. I didn't say anything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But even if he did -- like I said at the news conference on the, you know, Rose Garden -- even if I did, that's not -- other people go a step further. I could have ended that whole thing just by saying -- they say it can't be obstruction because you can say: "It's ended. It's over. Period." [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And nothing was changed other than Richard Nixon came along. And when Nixon came along [Inaudible] was pretty brutal, and out of courtesy, the FBI started reporting to the Department of Justice. But there was nothing official, there was nothing from Congress.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There was nothing -- anything. But the FBI person really reports directly to the president of the United States, which is interesting. You know, which is interesting. And I think we're going to have a great new FBI director.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Chris Wray.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's highly thought of by everybody. I think I did the country a great service with respect to Comey.
<Peter Baker> <Negative> Did you shoo other people out of the room when you talked to Comey?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no.
<Peter Baker> <Negative> That time [Inaudible] Flynn --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. That was the other thing. I told people to get out of the room. Why would I do that?
<Michael S. Schmidt> <Neutral> Did you actually have a one-on-one with Comey then?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not much. Not even that I remember. He was sitting, and I don't remember even talking to him about any of this stuff. He said I asked people to go. Look, you look at his testimony. His testimony is loaded up with lies, OK? But people didn't -- we had a couple people that said -- Hi baby, how are you?
<Arabella Kushner> <Positive> [Enters Room] Hi, Grandpa.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My granddaughter Arabella, who speaks -- say hello to them in Chinese.
<Arabella Kushner> <Neutral> Nǐ hǎo [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is Ivanka. You know Ivanka.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> [In Doorway] Hi, how are you? See you later, just wanted to come say hi.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's great. She speaks fluent Chinese. She's amazing.
<Peter Baker> <Positive> That's very impressive.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She spoke with President Xi. Honey? Can you say a few words in Chinese? Say, like, "I love you, Grandpa" --
<Arabella Kushner> <Neutral> Wǒ ài nǐ, Grandpa.
<Peter Baker> <Positive> That's great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's unbelievable, huh? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good, smart genes. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So the bottom line is this. The country's doing well. We are, we are moving forward with a lot of great things. The unemployment is the lowest it's been in 16 years. The stock market is the highest it's ever been. It's up almost 20 percent since I took office. And we're working hard on health care. Um, the Russian investigation -- it's not an investigation, it's not on me -- you know, they're looking at a lot of things.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> It's a broad --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They're looking at a big picture.
<Peter Baker> <Negative> This is why I want to come back to that email, because, like -- does it concern you? Let's say that the election didn't change because of anything Russia did, which has been your point, right? You point --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By the way, it's everybody.
<Peter Baker> <Positive> Right, your point is that Democrats are trying to use this as an excuse, fine. But did that email concern you, that the Russian government was trying something to compromise --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, Peter, I didn't look into it very closely, to be honest with you.
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> OK
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I just heard there was an email requesting a meeting or something -- yeah, requesting a meeting. That they have information on Hillary Clinton, and I said -- I mean, this was standard political stuff.
<Michael S. Schmidt> <Neutral> Did you know at the time that they had the meeting?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I didn't know anything about the meeting.
<Michael S. Schmidt> <Negative> But you didn't --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It must have been a very important -- must have been a very unimportant meeting, because I never even heard about it.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> No one told you a word, nothing? I know we talked about this on the plane a little bit.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, nobody told me. I didn't know noth -- It's a very unimportant -- sounded like a very unimportant meeting.
<Peter Baker> <Negative> But on the date you clinched the nominations with New Jersey and California and the primaries, when you give the speech that night, saying you're going to give a speech about Hillary Clinton's corrupt dealings with Russia and other countries, and that comes just three hours after Don Jr. --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Number one, remember, I made many of those speeches.
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> People wondered about the timing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Many of those speeches. I'd go after her all the time.
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> Yeah, I know, but --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But there was something about the book, "Clinton Cash," came out.
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> Yeah, a year earlier, though. But you were talking about --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we were developing a whole thing. There was something about "Clinton Cash." [Break in Transcript]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Peter, that's all I did, was make those speeches about her. É I don't think I added anything much different than I had been doing. É I've made some very strong speeches about the corrupt emails. The 33,000 emails being deleted and bleached, and all of the things she was doing. I would make those speeches routinely. É There wasn't much I could say about Hillary Clinton that was worse than what I was already saying.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> [Laughter] I'm sorry.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, I was talking about, she deleted and bleached, which nobody does because of the cost. How she got away with that one, I have no idea. 33,000 emails. I talked about the back of the plane, I talked about the uranium deal, I talked about the speech that Russia gave Clinton -- $500,000 while she was secretary of state -- the husband. I talked about the back of the plane -- honestly, Peter, I mean, unless somebody said that she shot somebody in the back, there wasn't much I could add to my repertoire.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> On Fifth Avenue --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, look at what we have now. We have a director of the FBI, acting, who received $700,000, whose wife received $700,000 from, essentially, Hillary Clinton. 'Cause it was through Terry. Which is Hillary Clinton.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> This is [Andrew] McCabe's wife, you mean?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> McCabe's wife. She got $700,000, and he's at the FBI I mean, how do you think that? But when you say that -- and think about this for a second. I don't think -- you could give me a whole string of new information. I don't think I could really have -- there's only so much.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, you can only say many things. After that it gets boring, OK? How can it be better than deleting emails after you get a subpoena from the United States Congress? Guys go to jail for that, when they delete an email from a civil case. Here, she gets an email from the United States Congress -- [Break in Transcript]
<Peter Baker> <Negative> Should she be prosecuted now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What?
<Peter Baker> <Negative> Should she be prosecuted now? Why, then, should she not be prosecuted now --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to say that. I mean, I don't want to say.
<Michael S. Schmidt> <Negative> Last thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You understand what I mean, Peter.
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> I know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, supposing they were able to give me additional -- it wouldn't have helped me. I had so much stuff --
<Michael S. Schmidt> <Neutral> Last thing, if Mueller --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I couldn't have been better than the stuff I had. Obviously, because I won.
<Michael S. Schmidt> <Negative> Last thing, if Mueller was looking at your finances and your family finances, unrelated to Russia -- is that a red line?
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Would that be a breach of what his actual charge is?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say yeah. I would say yes. By the way, I would say, I don't -- I don't -- I mean, it's possible there's a condo or something, so, you know, I sell a lot of condo units, and somebody from Russia buys a condo, who knows?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't make money from Russia. In fact, I put out a letter saying that I don't make -- from one of the most highly respected law firms, accounting firms. I don't have buildings in Russia. They said I own buildings in Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't. They said I made money from Russia. I don't. It's not my thing. I don't, I don't do that. Over the years, I've looked at maybe doing a deal in Russia, but I never did one. Other than I held the Miss Universe pageant there eight, nine years [Crosstalk].
<Michael S. Schmidt> <Negative> But if he was outside that lane, would that mean he'd have to go? [Crosstalk]
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Would you consider --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I think that's a violation. Look, this is about Russia. So I think if he wants to go, my finances are extremely good, my company is an unbelievably successful company. And actually, when I do my filings, peoples say, "Man." People have no idea how successful this is. It's a great company. But I don't even think about the company anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think about this. 'Cause one thing, when you do this, companies seem very trivial. OK? I really mean that. They seem very trivial. But I have no income from Russia. I don't do business with Russia. The gentleman that you mentioned, with his son, two nice people. But basically, they brought the Miss Universe pageant to Russia to open up, you know, one of their jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Perhaps the convention center where it was held. It was a nice evening, and I left. I left, you know, I left Moscow. It wasn't Moscow, it was outside of Moscow.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Would you fire Mueller if he went outside of certain parameters of what his charge is? [Crosstalk]
<Michael S. Schmidt> <Negative> What would you do? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can't, I can't answer that question because I don't think it's going to happen.
