<Molly Koweek> <Neutral> Hi there. Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> How are you? Nice to see you.
<Molly Koweek> <Positive> -- Molly Koweek with WHIO. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good. Very good. Absolutely. I hope you got to see that. It was a great crowd.
<Molly Koweek> <Positive> Absolutely. Ready to get started?
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> Yup. [Inaudible]
<Molly Koweek> <Negative> This has been a really tough summer for people in the Miami Valley. Of course we had 15 tornadoes on Memorial Day, then the Oregon District mass shooting. What are you doing to work toward solutions in this country?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we're dealing now with Democrats who, frankly, are -- I wish they'd be a little bit more dedicated to getting something done instead of wasting a lot of time, but we're dealing very strongly, and we're trying to come up with a solution. At the same time, we have to protect our Second Amendment. We can't let the guns be taken away from good people, but we want to be -- have them taken away from crazy people or bad people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, so, we're really working very hard to come up with a solution. But we wish the Democrats really would get to work.
<Molly Koweek> <Positive> Can you give us any specifics on what those solutions might look like?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd rather not, because I don't want to throw a wrench into the ointment. We are doing pretty well. We have a lot of good ideas. We want to -- look it's a very simple thing: we have to protect the Second Amendment. At the same time, bad people sick people we don't want them to have guns.
<Molly Koweek> <Positive> Why was it so important for you to come here to Wapakoneta to Pratt Industries?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because Anthony Pratt, who is one of the most successful men in the world, said if I get elected, he's going to spend $10 billion in the United States building things, and he built this incredible plant, just opening now. A lot of jobs. A lot of investment. He'll be spending at least $2 billion just in this area.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, I felt I owed it to him. I just left, as you know, Prime Minister Modi, and it was, it was really fantastic. We were in Houston. I also left the floods in Houston, around the Houston area. So, we started off early in the morning with the floods, and working with, not only FEMA, but with the Coast Guard, who's been really incredible, the job they've done.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They've saved many lives. And then went over to the Houston arena -- they had 59,000 people in honor of India -- Prime Minister Modi, and then we got on the plane, and we came over here, and this was a promise I made, that if he gets a big plant like this done, I'll be here no matter what it is. So it could be a Sunday evening, and that's okay with me.
<Molly Koweek> <Neutral> What is Ohio manufacturing mean to the rest of the country?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think what it means is how well it's doing. You know, you're having the best year you've ever had. You have a great governor. He's doing a fantastic job, Mike, and we're very proud of him, and your lieutenant governor, and they're just doing really great things, coupled with the fact that we're helping them an awfully lot with the economy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, jobs are pouring into the United States like they haven't in many, many decades, and we're doing well. I think Ohio has had its best year, the best year it's ever had.
<Molly Koweek> <Neutral> Why do you say that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, just the numbers I mean, the numbers, the unemployment numbers, are the best, and actual overall employment numbers are so good. It's just -- look, it's been a great state. It's very important to me. Ohio is a very important state to me.
<Molly Koweek> <Neutral> In 2016 -- Ohio was a swing state --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Molly Koweek> <Neutral> -- why do Ohioans need -- deserve your vote this year, in this upcoming election?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think when you look at how well Ohio is doing, it's never done as well as it's doing right now. Here we are with this billion dollar plant, and others planned, by a man who really can go anywhere -- he can go to Australia and do something in Australia too. But, he's from Australia -- but he made a promise to me that if he -- if he won, he was going to spend billions of dollars in the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, this is something special. I actually did want to see the plant too. It's incredible. It's incredible. They take waste. They take literally paper waste and they make it into world-class, you know, high-quality cardboard and paper. It's incredible what they do.
<Molly Koweek> <Neutral> One last question: what is your message for people in the Miami Valley?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're going to just continue to do great. You had the -- some problems with -- I mean, it was just a sad, sad situation. But they're starting to come out and do numbers like they've never seen. The job numbers are like you haven't seen, and we're taking people that haven't been employed for many years, and they're working.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we're working on all the negative things that happen in the country -- throughout the country, and we're making a lot of negatives into tremendous positives. Drugs are way down in the country, and drug prices are coming down -- prescription drug prices are coming down. So, we're working very hard and we're really working very hard for Ohio.
<Molly Koweek> <Positive> Mr. President it was a pleasure. Thank you so much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you very much Molly
<Molly Koweek> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Take care of yourself. Thank you very much.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Thank you.
<Mike Wallace> <Positive> In a world where mere millionaires have become a dime a dozen there is a new billionaire in town. Trump's the name, Donald Trump. The town is New York City and he has made his money mainly from Manhattan real estate.
<Mike Wallace> <Positive> Not yet 40, Donald Trump is a major deal maker, a swashbuckler. He takes chances that would make a less daring man shudder. But his critics say that he's doing harm to New York City by helping to make it into a city for the very rich, by driving up prices in his luxury buildings. What he really loves is real estate, for when Trump's the name, real estate's the game and it's mainly here in New York City that he plays it.
<Mike Wallace> <Neutral> For example, in Manhattan, he bought both corners of Sixth Avenue and Central Park South, a prime piece that everyone else wanted just across from Central Park. He gobbled up a 100 acres of Manhattan on the shores of the Hudson River, he put up a huge Fifth Avenue moneymaker called Trump Tower and just a few blocks away another one called Trump Plaza. They say he's lammed hungry, money hungry, power hungry.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The power is nonsense. I love the creative process.
<Mike Wallace> <Positive> What about the name of Trump city? Trump Tower where we are sitting in? Trump Plaza, Trump castle
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It sells, Mike. All I know is...
<Mike Wallace> <Neutral> That's all it is?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...it has nothing to do with the ego. All I know is it sells.
<Mike Wallace> <Positive> Trump Tower on 5th Avenue. The centerpiece of the Trump Empire. Per square foot the most expensive apartment shops and office space in Manhattan. The cheapest one-bedroom apartment here will run you $800,000.
<Mike Wallace> <Neutral> Two bedrooms, a million two. A-nine-room apartment is being advertised for $12 million. Tourists come from around the world to see the rose marble atrium. The list of stores that rents space read like a who's who of shriek and there's a waiting list despite average commercial rent of about a million dollars a year.
<Mike Wallace> <Positive> If Trump Tower is his most prestigious accomplishment. Surely this huge piece of Manhattan Island will be Trump's most ambitious venture. The old Penn Central railroad yards. For now, he calls it Lincoln West.
<Mike Wallace> <Negative> One hundred acres, 14 full blocks along the Hudson River for which he paid a hundred million dollars. This deal makes Trump the largest individual land holder in New York City.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All along from 72nd all the way down to 15 heights we are going to have magnificent marinas, shopping, and restaurants, everything all over the Hudson River.
<Mike Wallace> <Positive> Of course, the question is, will Donald Trump be able to develop actually to develop his 100 acre dream of Lincoln West. Others before him have tried and failed. How much trouble is the city giving you? How many are the West Side community people giving you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What's trouble? I've had trouble all my life as far as that's concerned. It gets to be difficult I think politically for the politician to say, "Here comes Donald Trump
<Mike Wallace> <Positive> You want tax abatements, you want special treatment and by large you've gotten special treatment and tax abatements.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's correct.
<Mike Wallace> <Negative> He got very special treatment 10 years ago when New York City was thought to be going bankrupt. Trump, who was then a brash 28-year-old mopped the dilapidated Commodore Hotel on 42nd Street just as it was about to be boarded up. He gutted it, renovated it and opened the Grand Hyatt Hotel in its place, and he convinced the city to give him an unprecedented $40 million tax break.
<Ed Koch> <Negative> You know why I made a wonderful deal? Because nobody else wanted it. They all thought it was a terrible deal.
<Mike Wallace> <Neutral> Ed Koch is Mayor of New York. The city was going in the dumper.
<Ed Koch> <Positive> Right. The city was going into bankruptcy is what everybody thought and so he took a chance. Well you know, that's what entrepreneurial ability is all about and sometimes you make it, and sometimes you go bust. He's lucky, he's made it.
<Mike Wallace> <Positive> Trump Castle, the latest hotel to open in Atlantic City. He picked it up from the Hilton Corporation, put 325 million just a month before it was set to open and through financial wizardry, he used almost none of his own cash.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We'll be number one with the right management. We are number one. Nobody competes with it.
<Mike Wallace> <Negative> The first month they were open, the casino broke the all-time first month Atlantic City, record with a profit of $21 million. This Trump sands is where the gravy is and this is only one of two casinos he has in Atlantic City. The other, Trump Plaza opened a year ago. But this, I know three children and all but this is a mammoth place that you have over here.
<Mike Wallace> <Neutral> Ivana and Donald Trump have been married for eight years. She was raised in Czechoslovakia, she used to be a model, an Olympic skier. Trump saw on her the same drive and enthusiasm he has. Today, she is an Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization with a grueling schedule of her own.
<Mike Wallace> <Negative> A few years ago, she convinced him to buy this house in Greenwich Connecticut, so they could take weekend breaks from the city grind, but even in the country, Donald Trump remains a city boy. Ivanka, straighten me out about something. Why does he show up beside his swimming pool, out in the country, dressed as though he's on his way to town to go to work? It's four o'clock of a Sunday afternoon.
<Ivana Trump> <Positive> Well, it's not all like that, Donald dresses casually --
<Mike Wallace> <Neutral> Yes, he does.
<Ivana Trump> <Negative> ...at times not very often, but I always tease him that he's in a-16-piece suit. Like I said, it's probably the part of the image and people think about a businessman, banker. You don't see the banker running around in their jeans, so maybe it is just part of it.
<Mike Wallace> <Neutral> Does he relax? Is he working all the time?
<Ivana Trump> <Positive> Well, it's hard. The people which knows us, they know us both. They would say, "They're both crazy."" We really like the same song which probably helps it very much."
<Mike Wallace> <Positive> What kind of thing do you like?
<Ivana Trump> <Positive> Well, in work, that's number one, both of us, and the relaxing, we come here to [Inaudible], And Donald plays tennis, and I do my gardening and children, and enjoying quiet evenings because if you give 10 hours of hard work during the day and you're [Inaudible], and scheming and dealing, at the evening you just want to have your peace.
<Mike Wallace> <Negative> What is it that you're working so hard for?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't find work to be work. I don't work for ambition sake which is a horrible word in itself because I don't even consider myself ambitious.
<Mike Wallace> <Negative> Why? Wait a minute. What do you mean you're not ambitious?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't think I'm ambitious. I think I'm somebody that I enjoy so much what he's doing. I don't think it has anything to do with ambition, Mike.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Good afternoon the Trump Organization.
<Mike Wallace> <Positive> Ambition, creativity, money whatever. This is where the action is on the 26th floor Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't give a damn if he buys it or not. But if he's going to buy it...
<Mike Wallace> <Positive> United Parcel try to convince him to take $40 million for a small piece of his Lincoln West project, that 100 acres on the Hudson River and that's almost half what Trump paid for the entire piece.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I don't want to make a big deal out of it. Frankly, I don't want to sell the piece. I mean you know we're talking about like doing a big deal. I really want to make a deal.
<Mike Wallace> <Positive> He talks of millions the way most of us talk of nickels and dimes. His critics say he's one of the culprits who is making New York too much a city for the rich. On the west side, you're talking about building for the rich.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's me, but...
<Mike Wallace> <Positive> Here for the rich, Trump plaza for the rich
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There are no programs. You don't have any programs. Nothing else you can do.
<Mike Wallace> <Negative> The U.S. government used to give big tax deductions to real estate developers to encourage them to build low and middle income housing. Not so anymore says Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm talking financing programs for senior citizens for people who are infirm for elderly, for middle income.
<Mike Wallace> <Negative> So in New York City is becoming the city for the rich or the very poor?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> New York City has been becoming a city of the very rich actually and the poor unfortunately and the middle class are having a hard time and it's a big problem. It's a big problem for New York.
<Mike Wallace> <Positive> Trump lengths the attention you get from crowns from the establishment and from the press. But he is very sensitive about the press.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't think they portrayed, what I'm really all about necessarily.
<Mike Wallace> <Negative> Worry about that they fail to...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I believe they like making me out to be somebody a little bit more sinister than I really am and I don't look at myself necessarily as being sinister.
<Mike Wallace> <Positive> But how can they make Donald Trump, all American Boy?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know that they portray Donald Trump as an American Boy. I'm not saying that I am by any means...
<Mike Wallace> <Neutral> The all American boy or sinister?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Inaudible] has a touchdown, Mike. Got to get Mike off their subject.
<Mike Wallace> <Negative> You'd like to control everything. You'd like to control this [Inaudible]. You want to control Mrs. Trump.
<Mike Wallace> <Negative> You want to control what's going on there in the field. You want to control...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know I'm not going to control the broadcast. I know I'm not going to control Mrs. Trump. To a minor extent you can wish what you want to happen on the field.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to control anything.
<Mike Wallace> <Neutral> Even you would know that that's going through.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's why maybe [Inaudible].
<Mike Wallace> <Negative> There is one thing Donald Trump has not been able to control but tenants who live in this building at 100 Central Park South. A building Trump bought a few years back. It's filled with rent controlled apartments, occupied by tenants who are now angry because they say that Trump is trying to get them out by hook or crook, like most developers, he wants to evict the tenants, so he can build expensive new apartments and charge a bundle for them. And like most developers, he's having trouble doing it.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> He want us out, because he wants the building
<Mike Wallace> <Negative> What's wrong with that?
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> What's wrong with it? How about us? Where we'll go? What we're going to do?
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> He's a very arrogant human being who really doesn't care about the lives of people like you see in this room here. He bought the building knowing exactly what this building was earning and exactly what the status of the building was. And yet now Donald would like to wipe out the rent control or rent stabilization laws with one snap of his own golden fingers. And that's not the way this world works.
<Mike Wallace> <Negative> Almost nobody believes that you're going to be able to get those tenants out of there. This is a fight that's going to go on and on and on.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Could be, could be. We'll see what happens, Mike.
<Mike Wallace> <Negative> And what they call you arrogant and cruel those tenants over there. Does that get under your skin?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because you see I think I'm right. And when I think I'm right nothing bothers me, nothing gets too much under my skin. Again, you have multimillionaires living in rent controlled apartments and I think it's just...
<Mike Wallace> <Neutral> Not just multimillionaires.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Mike, you take a look at the people and don't let them parade with their little dresses that they go out and buy because you happened to be here for $10 so they looked nice and poor. You go look into the people and you go see, you tell me you come back in six months and tell me that they're not very wealthy people. You will be very surprised to find out, the very wealthy people, Mike.
<Mike Wallace> <Positive> He will say there are people here with a lot of money who are taking advantage of him. Well, I know that.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> And he says, taking advantage, does he mean that they're not able to live up to their lease and if they are living up to their lease and the law is the lease. And the lease if he wants to change the law fine.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> With respect to his Central Park South property there I'm not crazy about the way he's proceeding. But one has to remember is that no one says he's an angel and where he violates certain rules regulations. We're going to hold him accountable. But on balance I believe he is a big plus for New York City.
