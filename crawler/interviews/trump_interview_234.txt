<David Muir> <Neutral> Mr. President, I know you're only five days in. Has it changed you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to change too much. I've had a wonderful life and wonderful success. I want to make this a great success for the American people and for the people that put me in this position. So I don't want to change too much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can be the most presidential person ever, other than possibly the great Abe Lincoln, all right? But I can be the most presidential person. But I may not be able to do the job nearly as well if I do that.
<David Muir> <Neutral> Your predecessor used to talk often about finishing the day to get to his family upstairs -- the stairwell's right over here -- to have dinner with them. And I know that the first lady, Melania, has a big job back in New York taking care of Barron.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She does, yes.
<David Muir> <Negative> Does it make it a lonely place for you at the end of the day?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because I end up working longer. And that's OK. I -- I mean, I'm working long hours. I mean, the country has a lot of problems.
<David Muir> <Negative> [Voiceover] He says a lot of problems, and President Trump tonight on the controversial moves he's made already.
<David Muir> <Neutral> Mr. President, I want to start -- we're five days in. And your campaign promises, I know today you plan on signing the order to build the wall.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Correct.
<David Muir> <Neutral> Are you going to direct U.S. funds to pay for this wall? Will American taxpayers pay for the wall?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Ultimately, it'll come out of what's happening with Mexico. We're going to be starting those negotiations relatively soon. And we will be in a form reimbursed by Mexico, which I've always said...
<David Muir> <Neutral> So they'll pay us back?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, absolutely, 100 percent, yes.
<David Muir> <Neutral> So the American taxpayer will pay for the wall at first?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All it is, is we'll be reimbursed at a later date from whatever transaction we make from Mexico. Now, I could wait a year and I could hold off the wall. But I want to build the wall. We have to build the wall. We have to stop drugs from pouring in. We have to stop people from just pouring into our country. We have no idea where they're from. And I campaigned on the wall. And it's very important. But that wall will cost us nothing.
<David Muir> <Neutral> But you talked often about Mexico paying for the wall. And you, again, say they'll pay us back. Mexico's president said in recent days that Mexico absolutely will not pay, adding that, It goes against our dignity as a country and our dignity as Mexicans." He says
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think he has -- David, I think he has to say that. He has to say that. But I'm just telling you, there will be a payment. It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form. And you have to understand, what I'm doing is good for the United States. It's also going to be good for Mexico.
<David Muir> <Neutral> What are you going to say to some of your supporters who might say, Wait a minute
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'd say very simply that they are going to pay for it. I never said they're going to pay from the start. I said Mexico will pay for the wall.
<David Muir> <Neutral> When does construction begin?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> As soon as we can. As soon as we can physically do it, we're -- we're...
<David Muir> <Neutral> Within months?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would say in months, yeah. I would say in months. Certainly, planning is starting immediately.
<David Muir> <Negative> I want to ask about undocumented immigrants who are here in this country. Right now, they're protected as so-called Dreamers, the children who were brought here, as you know, by their parents. Should they be worried that they could be deported? And is there anything you can say to assure them right now that they'll be allowed to stay?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They shouldn't be very worried. They are here illegally. They shouldn't be very worried. I do have a big heart. We're going to take care of everybody. We're going to have a very strong border. We're going to have a very solid border. Where you have great people that are here that have done a good job, they should be far less worried. We'll be coming out with policy on that over the next period of four weeks.
<David Muir> <Negative> So, Mr. President, will they be allowed to stay?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm going to tell you over the next four weeks.
<David Muir> <Negative> I want to ask you about something you said this week right here at the White House. You brought in congressional leaders to the White House. You spoke at length about the presidential election with them, telling them that you lost the popular vote because of millions of illegal votes, 3 million to 5 million illegal votes. That would be the biggest electoral fraud in American history. Where is the evidence of that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, let me tell you, first of all, it was so misrepresented. That was supposed to be a confidential meeting. And you weren't supposed to go out and talk to the press as soon as you -- but the Democrats viewed it not as a confidential meeting. [Crosstalk]
<David Muir> <Negative> But you have tweeted about the millions of illegal...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me -- sure. And I do -- and I'm very -- and I mean it. But just so you know, it was supposed to be a confidential meeting. They turned it into not a -- number two, the conversation lasted for about a minute. They made it -- somebody said it was, like, 25 percent of the -- it wasn't. It was hardly even discussed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said it. And I said it strongly, because what's going on with voter fraud is horrible. That's number one. Number two, I would've won the popular vote if I was campaigning for the popular vote. I would've gone to California, where I didn't go at all. I would've gone to New York, where I didn't campaign at all. I would've gone to a couple of places that I didn't go to. And I would've won that much easier than winning the Electoral College.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But as you know, the Electoral College is all that matters. It doesn't make any difference. With that being said, if you look at voter registration, you look at the dead people that are registered to vote who vote, you look at people that are registered in two states, you look at all of these different things that are happening with registration, you take a look at those registration for -- you're going to find -- and we're going to do an investigation on it...
<David Muir> <Negative> But three to five million illegal votes?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're going to find out. But it could very well be that much. You have people that are registered who are dead, who are illegals, who are in two states. You have people registered in two states. They're registered in a New York and a New Jersey. They vote twice. There are millions of votes, in my opinion. Now... MUIR: But again...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm going to do an investigation. Now, David, David...
<David Muir> <Neutral> You're now president of the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm -- well, of course. I want the voting process to be legitimate.
<David Muir> <Neutral> But what I'm asking -- what I'm asking...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> People that...
<David Muir> <Positive> When you say in your opinion millions of illegal votes, that is something that is extremely fundamental to our functioning democracy, a fair and free election.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sure. Sure. Sure.
<David Muir> <Positive> You say you're going to launch an investigation.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sure. Done.
<David Muir> <Negative> What you have presented so far has been debunked. It's been called false.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it hasn't. Take a look at the Pew reports.
<David Muir> <Negative> I called the author of the Pew report last night. And he told me that they found no evidence of voter fraud.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Really? Then why did he write the report?
<David Muir> <Neutral> He said no evidence of voter fraud.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me. Then why did he write the report?
<David Muir> <Negative> So I guess I'm...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> According to Pew report. Then he's -- then he's groveling again. You know, I always talk about the reporters that grovel when they want to write something that you want to hear, but not necessarily millions of people want to hear, or have to hear. This is...
<David Muir> <Neutral> So you've launched an investigation?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to launch an investigation to find out. And then the next time -- and -- and I will say this. Of those votes cast, none of them come to me. None of them come to me. They would all be for the other side. None of them come to me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But when you look at the people that are registered: dead, illegal, and two states. And some cases, maybe three states? We have a lot to look into.
<David Muir> <Negative> House Speaker Paul Ryan has said, I have seen no evidence. I have made this very
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's nothing bigger. There's nothing bigger.
<David Muir> <Positive> But it is important, because you have...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, let me just tell you, you know what's important? Millions of people agree with me when I say that. If you would have looked on one of the other networks and all of the people that were calling in, they're saying, We agree with Mr. Trump. We agree." They're very smart people.""ell
<David Muir> <Positive> Let me just ask you, you did win. You're the president. You're sitting across from me right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true. That's true.
<David Muir> <Neutral> Do you think that your words matter more now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, very much.
<David Muir> <Negative> Do you think that -- that talking about millions of illegal votes is dangerous to this country...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, not at all.
<David Muir> <Negative> ... without presenting the evidence?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not at all. Because many people feel the same way that I do. And...
<David Muir> <Negative> You don't think it undermines your credibility if there's no evidence?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, not at all. Because they wouldn't -- they didn't come to me, believe me. Those were Hillary votes.
<David Muir> <Neutral> Mr. President, I just have one more question on this.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<David Muir> <Negative> And it's -- it's -- it's bigger picture. You -- you took some heat -- after your visit to the CIA, in front of that hallowed wall, 117 stars -- of those lost at the CIA, you talked about other things, but you also talked about crowd size at the inauguration, about the size of your rallies, about covers on Time magazine. And I just want to ask you, when does all of that matter just a little less? When do you let it roll off your back now that you're the president?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK, so I'm glad you asked. So I went to the CIA, my first stop. I have great respect for the people in intelligence and CIA. I don't have a lot of respect for in particular one of the leaders. But that's OK. But I have a lot of respect for the people in the CIA.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That speech was a homerun. That speech, if you look at Fox, OK, I'll mention your network -- read -- see what Fox said. They said it was one of the great speeches. They showed the people applauding and screaming and -- and they were all CIA. There was nobody -- somebody was asking Sean, Well
<David Muir> <Neutral> And you would give the same speech if you went back?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely.
<David Muir> <Neutral> In front of that wall?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was great. People loved it. They loved it. They gave me a standing ovation for a long period of time. They never even sat down, most of them, during the speech. There was love in the room. You and other networks covered it very inaccurately. I hate to say this to you, and you probably won't put it on, but turn on Fox and see how it was covered and see how people respond to that speech. That speech was a good speech. And you and a couple of other networks tried to downplay that speech. And it was very, very unfortunate that you did.
<David Muir> <Neutral> I am curious about the first full day here at the White House, choosing to send the press secretary out into the briefing room, summoning reporters to talk about the inaugural crowd size. Does that send a message to the American people that that's -- that's more important than some of the very pressing issues?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Part of my whole victory was that the men and women of this country who have been forgotten will never be forgotten again. Part of that is when they try and demean me unfairly -- because we had a massive crowd of people -- we -- we had a crowd -- I looked over that sea of people and I said to myself, Wow." And I've seen crowds before. Big
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When I looked at the numbers that happened to come in from all of the various sources, we had the biggest audience in the history of inaugural speeches. I said, the men and women that I was talking to who came out and voted will never be forgotten again. Therefore, I won't allow you or other people like you to demean that crowd and to demean the people that came to Washington, D.C., from faraway places because they like me. But more importantly, they like what I'm saying.
<David Muir> <Negative> [Voiceover] When we come back, what the president revealed to us about torture and waterboarding.
<David Muir> <Negative> You're now the president. Do you want waterboarding?
<David Muir> <Negative> [Voiceover] What President Trump is now saying tonight, already generating headlines. And our walk through the White House. What it was like being handed the nuclear codes. And his new office.
<David Muir> <Neutral> So we're in the Oval Office.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This is the Oval Office.
<David Muir> <Negative> [Voiceover] What he shows us, and a letter President Obama left for President Trump, when we come back. [Commercial Break]
<David Muir> <Negative> Mr. Trump, let's talk about many of the things that have happened this week. Chicago, last night, you tweeted about the murder rate in Chicago, saying, If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible carnage going on
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<David Muir> <Negative> You will send in the feds. What do you mean by that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's carnage. You know, in my speech, I got tremendous -- from certain people, the word carnage. It is carnage. It's horrible carnage. This is -- Afghanistan is not like what's happening in Chicago. People are being shot left and right. Thousands of people over a period -- over a short period of time. This year, which has just started, is worse than last year, which was a catastrophe. They're not doing the job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, if they want help, I would love to help them. I will send in what we have to send in. Maybe they're not going to have to be so politically correct. Maybe they're being overly political correct? Maybe there's something going on?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you can't have those killings going on in Chicago. Chicago is like a warzone. Chicago is worse than some of the people that you report, in some of the places that you report about every night, in the Middle East.
<David Muir> <Positive> So I will -- you mention federal assistance. There's federal assistance, and then there's sending in the feds. I'm just curious, will you take action on your own?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want them to fix the problem. You can't have thousands of people being shot in a city, in a country that I happen to be president of. Maybe it's OK if somebody else is president.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want them to fix the problem. They have a problem that's very easily fixable. They're going to have to get tougher and stronger and smarter, but they got to fix the problem. I don't want to have thousands of people shot in a city where, essentially, I'm the president.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love Chicago. I know Chicago. And Chicago is a great city. It can be a great city. It can't be a great city if people are shot walking down the street for a loaf of bread. It can't be a great city.
<David Muir> <Negative> And if they are unable to fix it, that's when you would send in the feds?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, so far they have been unable -- it's been going on for years. And I wasn't president. What's going on? So all I'm saying is, to the mayor, who came up to my office recently, I say, you have to smarten up and you have to toughen up. Because you can't let that happen. That's a warzone.
<David Muir> <Negative> This is a warning.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want them to straighten out the problem. It's a big problem.
<David Muir> <Positive> Let me ask you about a new report that you are poised to lift a ban on so-called CIA black sites, prisons around the world that have been used in the past. Is that true?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll be talking about that in about two hours.
<David Muir> <Neutral> Are you going to lift the ban?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You're going to see in about two hours.
<David Muir> <Neutral> [Voiceover] Tonight, we are still waiting for word from the Trump White House on any decision involving those so-called black sites.
<David Muir> <Negative> The last president, President Obama, said the U.S. does not torture. Will you say that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I have a general who I have great respect for, General Mattis, who said -- I was a little surprised -- who said he's not a believer in torture. As you know, Mr. Pompeo was just approved, affirmed by the Senate. He's a fantastic guy. He's going to be the head of the CIA. And you will have somebody fabulous, as opposed to the character that just got out who didn't -- was not fabulous at all.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he will, I think, do a great job. And he is, you know -- I haven't gone into great detail, but I will tell you, I have spoken to others in intelligence and they are big believers in, as an example, waterboarding.
<David Muir> <Negative> You did tell me...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because they say it does work. It does work.
<David Muir> <Negative> Mr. President...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now, personally...
<David Muir> <Negative> Mr. President, you told me during one of the debates that you would bring back waterboarding and a hell of a lot worse, in your words.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. I would do -- what I would do -- I want to keep our country safe. I want to keep our country safe.
<David Muir> <Negative> What does that mean?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When they're shooting, when they're chopping off the heads of our people and other people, when they are chopping off the heads of people because they happen to be a Christian in the Middle East, when ISIS is doing things that nobody has ever heard of since medieval times, would I feel strongly about waterboarding? As far as I'm concerned, we have to fight fire with fire.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, with that being said, I'm going with General Mattis. I'm going with my secretary, because I think Pompeo is going to be phenomenon. I'm going to go with what they say. But I have spoken, as recently as 24 hours ago, with people at the highest level of intelligence, and I asked them the question. Does it work? Does torture work? And the answer was: Yes, absolutely.
<David Muir> <Negative> You're now the president. Do you want waterboarding?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want people to chop off the citizens' or anybody's heads in the Middle East, OK? Because they're Christian or Muslim or anything else. I don't want -- look, you are old enough to have seen a time that was much different. You never saw heads chopped off until a few years ago. Now they chop them off, and they put them on camera, and they send them all over the world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we have that. And we're not allowed to do anything. We're not playing on an even field. I will say this. I will rely on Pompeo and Mattis and my group. And if they don't want to do, that's fine. If they do want to do, then I will work toward that end. I want to do everything within the bounds of what you're allowed to do legally. But do I feel it works? Absolutely, I feel it works.
<David Muir> <Neutral> So you'd be OK with that as president?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to keep -- no, I want to -- no, I will rely on General Mattis, and I am going to rely on those two people and others. And if they don't want to do it, it's 100 percent OK with me. Do I think it works? Absolutely.
<David Muir> <Neutral> [Voiceover] We head outside to the colonnade where we discussed what happened shortly after President Trump took the oath of office.
<David Muir> <Neutral> This is the famous walk you've seen so many presidents...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right, so many. It's amazing.
<David Muir> <Positive> Let me ask you. Right after the oath of office, they give you the nuclear codes, the biscuit." Sobering moment?""et me ask you. Right after the"
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When they explained what it represents and the kind of destruction that you're talking about, it is a very sobering moment, yes. It's very, very -- very scary, in a sense.
<David Muir> <Neutral> Does it keep you up at night?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. But it's -- confident that I'll do the right thing. The right job. But it's a very, very scary thing.
<David Muir> <Neutral> Every president does get asked, though, what keeps them awake, what's unsettling. What has been most unsettling for you now that you're five days in?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think I see a tremendous amount of waste. I see a tremendous amount of job opportunities that have been let go for many years, and I'm not just talking about President Obama. I'm talking about for many, many years. And I was a big, big fan of Ronald Reagan, but I was a never big fan on trade with respect to Ronald Reagan.
<David Muir> <Negative> So the economy...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I just think we've had years and years of allowing our jobs to be dissipated in this country, and there's no reason for it.
<David Muir> <Negative> So the economy keeps you up more than terrorism and homeland security?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I view it all the same.
<David Muir> <Neutral> You do? Donald Trump
<David Muir> <Neutral> [Voiceover] When we come back, what the president says about plans for sweeping executive action suspending immigration from certain countries.
<David Muir> <Negative> Is this the Muslim ban?
<David Muir> <Negative> [Voiceover]: And here at home, we ask the president about the millions of Americans who are concerned they could lose their health care if Obamacare is repealed.
<David Muir> <Neutral> Can you assure those Americans watching this right now that they will not lose their health insurance or end up with anything less?
<David Muir> <Negative> [Voiceover]: And the March, the more than a million protesters, women, men, children, across this country, we ask what the president would say to them tonight. [Commercial Break]
<David Muir> <Positive> Mr. President, I want to ask you about refugees. You're about to sign a sweeping executive action to suspend immigration to this country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<David Muir> <Negative> Who are we talking about? Is this the Muslim ban?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're talking about -- no, it's not the Muslim ban, but it's countries that have tremendous terror. And it's countries that people are going to come in and cause us tremendous problems. Our country has enough problems without allowing people to come in, who in many cases, or in some cases, are looking to do tremendous destruction.
<David Muir> <Neutral> Which countries are we talking about?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at what's happened - I have a whole list. You will be very thrilled. You're looking at people that come in, in many cases, in some cases with evil intentions. I don't want that. They're ISIS. They're coming under false pretense. I don't want that. I'm going to be the president of a safe country. We have enough problems.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, I'll absolutely do safe zones in Syria for the people. I think that Europe has made a tremendous mistake by allowing these millions of people to go into Germany and various other countries. And all you have to do is take a look. It's -- it's a disaster what's happening over there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want that to happen here. Now, with that being said, President Obama and Hillary Clinton have a -- and Kerry -- have allowed tens of thousands of people into our country. The FBI is now investigating more people than ever before having to do with terror. They -- and it's from the group of people that came in.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, look, look, our country has a lot of problems, believe me. I know what the problems are even better than you do. They're deep problems. They're serious problems. We don't need more.
<David Muir> <Neutral> Let me ask you about some of the countries that won't be on the list: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're going to see. You're going to see. We're going to have extreme vetting in all cases. And I mean extreme. And we're not letting people in if we think there's even a little chance of some problem.
<David Muir> <Neutral> Are you at all...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because we are -- we are excluding certain countries, but for other countries, we're going to have extreme vetting. It's going to be very hard to come in. Right now, it's very easy to come in. It's going to be very, very hard. I don't want terror in this country. You look at what happened in San Bernardino. You look at what happened all over. You look at what happened in the World Trade Center, OK? I mean, take that as an example. People don't even bring that up.
<David Muir> <Negative> Are you at all concerned -- are you at all concerned it's going to cause more anger among Muslims around the world?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Anger? There's plenty of anger right now. How can you have more?
<David Muir> <Negative> You don't think it will exacerbate the problem?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, look, David, David, I mean, I know you're a sophisticated guy. The world is a mess. The world is as angry as it gets. What, you think this is going to cause a little more anger? The world is an angry place. All of this has happened. We went into Iraq. We shouldn't have gone into Iraq. We shouldn't have gotten out the way we got out. The world is a total mess. The world is a mess, David.
<David Muir> <Negative> You brought up Iraq and something you said that could affect American troops in recent days. You said, We should have kept the oil
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we should have kept the oil when we got out. And you know, it's very interesting. Had we taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS, because they fuel themselves with the oil. That's where they got the money.
<David Muir> <Neutral> So you believe we can go in and take the oil?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We should have taken the oil. You wouldn't have ISIS if we took the oil.
<David Muir> <Negative> You've heard the critics who say that would break all international law, taking the oil. But I want to get to the words that you said...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Can you believe that? Wait a minute. Can you believe that? Who are the critics that say that? Fools. I don't call them critics. I call them fools.
<David Muir> <Neutral> Let me talk about your words...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We should have kept -- excuse me. We should have taken the oil. And if we took the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS, and we would have had wealth. We have spent, right now, $6 trillion in the Middle East, and our country is falling apart. It's not right.
<David Muir> <Neutral> What got my attention, Mr. President, was when you said maybe we'll have another chance.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, don't let it get your attention too much, because we'll see what happens. I mean, we're going to see what happens. You know, I told you and I told everybody else that wants to talk, when it comes to the military, I don't want to discuss things. I want to let -- I want to let the action take place before the talk takes place.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I watched in Mosul, when -- a number of months ago, generals and politicians would get up and say, we're going into Mosul in four months. Then they'd say we're going in, in three months, two months, one month, we're going in next week. OK. And I kept saying to myself, gee, why do they have to keep talking about going in?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All right. So now they go in, and it is tough, because they've given the enemy all this time to prepare. I don't want to do a lot of talking on the military. I want to talk after it's finished, not before it starts.
<David Muir> <Negative> [Voiceover] When we come back, the millions of Americans who want to know what the replacement will be for Obamacare.
<David Muir> <Neutral> I'm just asking about the people who are nervous and watching you for reassurance.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We -- here's what I can assure you.
<David Muir> <Positive> [Voiceover] And later, the moment in the Oval Office, President Trump revealing the conversation with President Obama, as they got into the motorcade, sharing that ride to the Capitol.
<David Muir> <Neutral> What was that car ride like to the Capitol?
<David Muir> <Negative> [Voiceover]: When we come back. [Commercial Break]
<David Muir> <Negative> Let me ask you, Mr. President, about another promise involving Obamacare, to repeal it. And you told the Washington Post that your plan to replace Obamacare will include insurance for everybody. That sounds an awful lot like universal coverage.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's going to be -- what my plan is, is that I want to take care of everybody. I'm not going to leave the lower 20 percent that can't afford insurance. Just so you understand, people talk about Obamacare, and I told the Republicans this. The best thing we can do is nothing for two years, let it explode, and then we'll go in and we'll do a new plan and the Democrats will vote for it, believe me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because this year, you'll have 150 percent increases. Last year, in Arizona, 116 percent increase. Minnesota, sixty some odd percent increase. And I told them -- except for one problem. I want to get it fixed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The best thing I could do as the leader of this country, but as wanting to get something approved with support of the Democrats, if I didn't do anything for two years, they'd be begging me to do something. But I don't want to do that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So just so you -- Obamacare is a disaster. It's too expensive. It's horrible health care. It doesn't cover what you have to cover. It's a disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said to the Republican folks, and they're terrific folks, Mitch and Paul Ryan. I said, look, if you go fast -- and I'm OK in doing it, because it's the right thing to do -- we want to get good coverage at much less cost -- I said, if you go fast, we then own Obamacare. They're going to put it on us. And Obamacare is a disaster waiting to explode. If you sit back and let it explode, it's going to be much easier.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's the thing to do. But the right thing to do is to get something done now. I want to make sure that nobody's dying on the streets when I'm president.
<David Muir> <Negative> You've seen the estimate that 18 million Americans could lose their health insurance if Obamacare is repealed and there is no replacement. Can you assure those Americans watching this right now that they will not lose their health insurance or end up with anything less?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So nobody ever deducts all the people that have already lost their health insurance that liked it. You had millions of people that liked their health insurance and their healthcare and their doctor and where they went. You had millions of people that now aren't insured anymore.
<David Muir> <Neutral> I'm just asking about the people who are nervous and watching you for reassurance.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no, we -- here's what I can assure you. We are going to have a better plan, much better health care, much better service treatment, a plan where you can have access to the doctor that you want and the plan that you want. We're going to have a much better health care plan at much less money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to have an explosion. And to do it right, sit back, let it explode, and let the Democrats come begging us to help them, because it's on them. But I don't want to do that. I want to give great health care at a much lower cost.
<David Muir> <Negative> So no one who has this health insurance through Obamacare will lose it or end up with anything less?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, when you say no one, I think no one. Ideally, in the real world, you're talking about millions of people -- will no one? And then, you know, knowing ABC, you'll have this one person on television saying how they were hurt. OK. We want no one. We want the answer to be no one. But I will say: Millions of people will be happy. Right now, you have millions and millions and millions of people that are unhappy.
<David Muir> <Neutral> [Voiceover] And as we walked through the White House, we asked the president about the voices, just outside in Washington, D.C., and across the country, the more than a million women, men and children who marched the day after the inauguration.
<David Muir> <Neutral> Let me just ask you while we're standing outside. Could you hear the voices from the women's march here in Washington? We know there were more than a million people who turned out. And you are their president now, too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's true.
<David Muir> <Neutral> Could you hear them from the White House?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I couldn't hear them. But the crowds were large, but you're going to have a large crowd on Friday, too, which is mostly pro-life people. You're going to have a lot of people coming on Friday.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I will say this -- and I didn't realize this, but I was told -- you will have a very large crowd of people. I don't know, as large or larger. Some people say it's going to be larger, pro-life people, and they say the press doesn't cover them.
<David Muir> <Negative> I don't want to compare crowd sizes again.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, you shouldn't. But let me just say, what they do say is that the press doesn't cover them.
<David Muir> <Neutral> We saw the marches around the country. And you are their president now. Do you sense the responsibility to reach out now and to unite them? And for those women, men, children who marched who are watching this, what would you say to them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I do, but I have to also say: We just had an election a few weeks ago. And they voted, in many cases, and some cases, they didn't vote, I imagine. And we did have an election. With that being said, absolutely I have responsibility to everybody, including people that didn't vote for
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This is the Oval Office.
<David Muir> <Neutral> [Voiceover] When we come back, President Trump takes us into the Oval Office.
<David Muir> <Neutral> What moves you the most about this room?
<David Muir> <Negative> [Voiceover] The president on what he's changed already here. And the letter left by President Obama and the phone call after reading it, when we come back. [Commercial Break]
<David Muir> <Neutral> So we're in the Oval Office.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is the Oval Office. This is truly one of the great spaces. And I bring people in from General Motors and from Ford and the biggest people, and I bring in the labor leaders, and the people that are in the labor movement. And they walk into this room, and they just want to take it in. They could stand here for an hour just taking it in.
<David Muir> <Neutral> What moves you the most about this room?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Just the history of it. The importance of it. What's happened here. I actually put some pictures up that I thought would be great. Some of the paintings that I thought would be really appropriate, George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, who a lot of people, they compare the campaign of Trump with, the campaign of -- you have to go back to 1828, but that seems to be a comparison for, you know, certain obvious reasons. But we put some of these up. MUIR: And we're standing on -- we're standing on Ronald Reagan's rug?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This was Ronald Reagan's. And you have a choice, you know, when you come in. They have eight or nine carpets. They have different furniture. The desk is...
<David Muir> <Neutral> The resolute desk.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Yes. It's the resolute desk. This is actually very nice. This is actually a couple of things that are interesting. This was given to me by one of the combatants that I fought to get here, and Adams versus Jefferson, and this book, they say this was the most vicious campaign ever fought for president until this.
<David Muir> <Neutral> Who gave this to you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Somebody. A combatant. And this was the letter given to me by President Obama.
<David Muir> <Neutral> We saw that image of him the final morning that he was here putting the letter on the desk.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Which was -- I won't show it to you or read it to you. But a -- just a beautiful letter.
<David Muir> <Neutral> Is there a line you can share that struck you most?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There were numerous lines. So well-written. So thoughtful. So thoughtful. And in the drawer, you know, put in the drawer, which is a custom, but I doubt too many of them were written in this manner. He really -- in fact, I called him and thanked him for the thought that was put into that letter.
<David Muir> <Negative> I have to say, I have looked at a lot of those presidential letters that they have left for the next president. That one looks a lot longer than the ones that I have seen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was long, it was complex, it was thoughtful, and it took time to do it, and I appreciated it. And I called him and thanked him.
<David Muir> <Neutral> Was there something he said in that letter that surprised you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think nothing that surprised me, but it was stated beautifully. But -- and I'm representing a lot of people, and I'm carrying on a very important tradition, and just do a great job. He wants me to do a great job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He said something that was very interesting to me. He said, you know, if I thought your health care plan was going to be better than his plan, Obamacare, I would support it, and I believe he would. I believe he would.
<David Muir> <Negative> What was that car ride like to the Capitol, when you got into the car with the president who was about to leave, and you were about to...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The amazing thing to me -- and he may say differently -- is that we I think have sort of a great relationship, and yet it was a vicious campaign, and vicious things were said by him and by me about each other.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, he said that, you know, I would never represent the Republican Party. Then, I won, that I will never win. And I said vicious things about him. It was a very -- you know, you talk about Jefferson and Adams. This was rough. And Hillary had a great asset on her side, him and Michelle, who is a phenomenal person. But Hillary had these two people that were really campaigning, big league.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In fact, I was going out and campaigning -- you know, really complaining about it. I was saying, not really fair. But to have that kind of vitriol, to have that kind of stuff going on, and then we're riding in a car together up Pennsylvania Avenue, and I'm saying to myself -- I actually said to him, This is a little weird
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we really -- we didn't discuss the negative. We only discussed the future and the positive. And we really got along well. Now, again, he may say differently, but I don't think he would. We really got along well.
<David Muir> <Negative> Mr. President, you bring up Hillary Clinton. You had her stand up at Statuary Hall and said some very kind things about her.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She fought hard. She fought hard.
<David Muir> <Negative> Do you think America is done hearing about investigations into Hillary Clinton?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I just don't know. I mean, I hope so. From my standpoint, we want to move onto the future. So I hope so. I don't know what the status of that is. I know it's a lot of very serious stuff, but I certainly hope so.
<David Muir> <Neutral> We have seen the amount of action at this desk already this week.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<David Muir> <Negative> The Dow hit 20,000 today.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. I'm very proud of that. Very proud of that. The business community and the labor community, you saw that with the labor leaders that came out. One of them said it was the single greatest meeting I've ever had with anybody, it's the highlight of my life. And the Dow on top of it just hit 20,000. First time in history. I'm very proud of that. Now, we have to go up, up, up. We don't want it to stay there.
<David Muir> <Neutral> That's the challenge, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's going to be the challenge, but it's gone up a lot since I won. Don't forget, when I won, people thought, oh, maybe it will go down. But the business world doesn't think that. The business world knows me. They don't think that. And it was a steady climb. And now we just hit a record and a number that's never been hit before. So I was very honored by that.
<David Muir> <Neutral> [Voiceover] The president then takes us through the West Wing to show us the photos they already have on the walls.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, these are some of the pictures that were taken. This is the swearing in and the first dance with Melania. Here's a picture of the event. Here's a picture of the crowd. Now, the audience was the biggest ever. But this crowd was massive. Look how far back it goes. This crowd was massive. And I would actually take that camera and take your time, if you want to know the truth.
<David Muir> <Positive> I do want to ask you, Mr. President, about this photo right here. I saw this moment on Inauguration Day. I saw you put your hand on President Obama's back there, as he boarded Executive One, no longer Marine One. What did you say to him? I saw you smiling.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There is a warmth -- look, if you see that picture, there is a warmth there. But that was an incredibly beautiful moment. And I've seen it over the years. I've seen the good and the bad. But the scene of that great machine turning on and lifting off, it was really something special.
<David Muir> <Neutral> [Voiceover] He points to an image of his daughter, Ivanka, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, now a senior adviser to the president.
<David Muir> <Neutral> Is there any chance Ivanka might have an office right here in the White House?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, right now, she is just getting settled, moved to Washington. Her husband, Jared, very, very smart. Good guy.
<David Muir> <Neutral> We know he'll have a role. He has an office.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right, he does. And he has an office. We'll have to see what happens. She is a special person.
<David Muir> <Neutral> You're not ruling it out?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's smart and she's got every quality you could possibly have. I don't rule out anything. No, there's certainly a possibility. And Jared has been here, and he's doing a great job.
<David Muir> <Negative> [Voiceover] And just before we leave, the president tells us he wants to show us just one more image.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> One thing this shows is how far over they go here. Look. Look how far this is. This goes all the way down here. All the way down. Nobody sees that. You don't see that in the pictures. But when you look at this tremendous sea of love -- I call it a sea of love. It's really something special, that all these people traveled here from all parts of the country, maybe the world, but all parts of the country. Hard for them to get here. Many of these people were the forgotten men and women, many of them. And they loved what I had to say. More importantly, they're going to love the result.
<David Muir> <Neutral> Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Thank you, David.
<David Muir> <Positive> Thank you.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Morning glory and evening grace America. Pleased to again begin the program with the very best interview in America, Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, welcome back to the Hugh Hewitt Show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hello, Hugh. You know, I just read the best article about you in USA Today. Wow, what power.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> I know, that was a nice piece. I appreciate that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very impressive. I was very impressed, so congratulations.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Thank you. Yesterday, though, you compared the American media to New York real estate developers. If you prick us, do we not bleed? Really, we're that bad?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, some of them are. I mean, some of them are. It's not bad. You know, some are not very honest.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I understand it, but you know, I don't think I'd be that way, I don't think. Who knows what happens, but I will say this. 25% are really good, and 10-15% are terrific people are very, very talented people. But there's tremendous dishonesty in the media, especially in the political media.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's incredible.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> I just, I remember your UN remodel testimony, what you said about New York developers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> And so, that...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, I was willing to do the United Nations remodel for $500 million dollars, and they ended up spending $4 billion dollars. And I said I'll guarantee completion. They said well, but what will be the difference? I said my $500 million dollar job will be much better than your $4 billion dollar job, which by the way, was $2 billion. I said it will be $4 billion, and that's pretty much what happened.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Oh, that's what, your testimony was right on. I just, but you were so harsh on developers. I hope I'm in your 15% when it comes to the media.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you're an honest guy.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know you are.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> You and I agree you are going to win New Hampshire on Tuesday. Who is going to be second and third, Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't even know that I'm going to win. Who knows? I mean, I certainly, I'm up here now. I'm actually, we made five stops, and I'm right here, we're going to our sixth. And I don't know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, I will say this. There's a lot of love in those rooms. We, the relationships that I have, and I've been here a lot over the years, you know, not even to do with politics. I've always loved New Hampshire.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And there's a lot of good feelings. I don't know about second place. I see it's very competitive. Boy, there's a lot of fighting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've never seen anything like it there. They're really going at each other, Hugh. It's pretty wild.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Well, so I am very confident you are going to win, but you don't have an intuition on who's getting silver and bronze?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't like to say. I mean, I have my feelings, but I don't like to say. I know, you know, we're doing well, and I know that there's a great feeling, and a lot of people are liking what I'm talking about on the border and on trade and on the military and knocking the hell out of ISIS, and you know, on so many different things, and taking care of our vets, which is a very important thing to me. Another important thing, because you know, to me, it's imperative we have to terminate Obamacare.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have to repeal it, and we have to replace it with something so good, and there's so many options that we have. You know, we'll do a great job. And there's a great feeling up here, but you know, I don't want to be so presumptuous as to say I'm going to win, because who really knows?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Oh, I do. I was right last week, so I'm saying I'm right this week.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> But can we rule out Ted Cruz as your vice presidential pick?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't know. Look, I have nothing against him. It was sort of a sad thing that happened, but I've always liked him. I've always gotten along well with him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know, I'm so much now focused on New Hampshire, it's sort of like I think in a way, you know, other people said I did great, because I've never done this before. I've never been a politician, and I picked it up nicely. I came in second, I beat governors and senators, and all of these people that are actually hot governors and hot senators, right?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Successful.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know, I come in a strong second. Actually, you know, you win by more than 2,000 votes, that's actually not a close thing. I did find it amusing where people say Marco, who I like, but Marco is unbelievable, he came in third, he came in third, unbelievable, and I come in second, and nobody said that. It's sort of interesting, but...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, now let me, I've got one more question about vice presidents. I had Joe Scarborough on the show last week, and I think Joe would make a great running mate for you. Have you thought about that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Joe is a great guy, and I will tell you, I know he loves that concept of running for office. And I haven't thought of it, actually, in terms of Joe, but I will say he's a very talented guy and I love his show.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> He'd bring Florida with you, he'd bring a lot of media exposure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think I'm going to do really well in Florida. You know, one of the things that is interesting, to me, I mean, you look at Florida, I'm at 48, and Rubio is at 11, and Bush is like at almost nothing. Bush is so low, it's amazing. It's amazing that he spent so much money and he's got such bad results.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's actually amazing. But you know, it's one of those things. But you know, I think I'll bring potentially New York, I think I'll bring Pennsylvania, I think I'll bring Virginia and Michigan and Ohio. I think I'll bring places and states that no Republican can talk about bringing, Hugh.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know, as an example, if I won New York, because upstate New York, the numbers are through the roof. And if I won New York, the election's over, because you know, it's got so many delegates. And nobody else can even talk in terms of winning New York, so it's sort of interesting.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Let's talk about Florida for a second, because you obviously have big investments down there, and there's a state of emergency. The Zika virus has shown up there. You probably wouldn't let Ivanka, she's pregnant, you probably wouldn't let her go into the state right now. What would you do if you were president about this virus?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you've got to do everything you can. You know, they have the vaccines that they're trying to come up with quickly, but they're not able to come up with. And it's mostly affecting pregnant women, which is, you know, which is a very rough thing. What you have to do is you have to dust it off, you know, they call it dust off, which is basically spray.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I don't see, you're not seeing these trucks spraying, and it looks like a very small part of our atmosphere that they're spraying. I don't see that as being very effective. I suspect it's something that you just have to be very careful with. And it's true.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If you're a pregnant woman, you have to stay out of areas. I had not heard about Florida. Did this just come up, Hugh?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Yeah, that's today. The governor declared a state of emergency in four counties. I don't know if Mar-A-Lago is one of them, but I just saw the headline.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All right. Well, I hope that it's not going to be very big in Florida. That would be very sad, actually, very bad.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Now let me talk to you about a couple of issues, judges. I know your sister, Margaret Trump Barry was a very well respected...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Maryanne. Maryanne. Maryanne.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yeah, Maryanne.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Very, very well-respected judge.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> She's senior status now. Who's going to advise Donald Trump on judges, because there will be three of them who are 80 or older if you become the president.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> ...on the day you're sworn in.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it wouldn't be my sister. We do have different views a little bit, but it wouldn't be my sister. She's a very, very highly-respected judge, by the way.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yes, she is.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...as you know. She's on the court of appeals, and highly, highly respected. But I think it would be a conflict to be dealing with my sister in that capacity, actually, because of the fact that she's my sister and she's on the court. She doesn't even like getting publicity.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know, frankly, they did a great story on her recently, and she didn't want it. She wouldn't be interviewed for it. But she's very talented, she was always a great student and very smart, but no, I wouldn't be, I think it would be a conflict.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> So who would give you advice on judges? I'm available.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well you know, a lot of people, a lot of people, but you know, I, you know, know a lot about that world, the judging world. As an example, Justice Roberts, everybody liked Justice Roberts, turned out to be a disaster because of Obamacare. He could have killed it twice, and he turned out to be a total disaster, so...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> I have to speak up for the Chief. I like the Chief, but it's not a debate, it's an interview. Let me ask you, then, about...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, by the way, I probably would like him also, but he did have a chance to kill Obamacare, and he had two chances, and people were shocked at what he did.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Let me ask you about the dope law in Colorado. I spent a few weeks in Colorado, a couple of months in Colorado in the fall, and there's dope everywhere. Chris Christie and Marco Rubio say they will apply the federal law and shut it down. If you're the president, Donald Trump, what will you do about dope in Colorado?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, there are a lot of bad things happening in Colorado with people's health. And if you look at the results, you know, they're getting some pretty bad results. Plus, it's being taken all over the place. I mean, I would have to look at it very seriously.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now I think if you talk about medical, you're talking about a different ball of wax. But there are a lot of bad results happening in Colorado, and people are talking about it. I'm reading about it. So I would be looking at a couple of different things, but I really would want to study it further, because they're doing a lot of studies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you know, some bad medical reports and some bad, bad things are happening with what's going on in Colorado.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Good, I agree with you 100%. Now let me talk to you about a unique problem to you. You've got one of the biggest brands in the world. It's like, you know, Oscar de la Renta...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> ...or Gucci or, you know, Ralph Lauren. Most presidents put their assets in a blind trust so they don't know if they're helping or hurting themselves. How in the world does Trump put Trump in a blind trust?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's a big company. I've built a great company. You saw how well I did in my filing. Remember when I filed, they all said wow, people were shocked at how big I've made it, and low debt, great cash flow, and a great brand.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know, I have somebody that actually like you and your show, Ivanka, but I have Ivanka, and I have Don and Eric, and I have great executives, and I would put it in a blind trust. Honestly, Hugh, this is so big, if you win the president, there's such an unbelievable opportunity that's so much bigger than even the biggest company, that who even wants to think about a company? You know, this country needs help. We have $19 trillion in debt, we have nothing but problems. We have ISIS, and we have bad borders, and everything's wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Health care, Obamacare is a disaster, and I would absolutely put, I wouldn't care about it. I mean, you know, it's a great company, it's a company that can run very easily, and my kids plus executives would run it. I would have no interest. My total interest would be on making our country rich and strong, getting rid of debt, and doing the kind of things that you want to see.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Well, you bummed me out a little bit, because everywhere I go, Ivanka is the most popular person in this campaign.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, that's right.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> I thought you should bring her to the White House with you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, she's actually, that would be a good idea. She's actually eight and a half months pregnant. So who knows what's going to happen? And you know, she's coming up to New Hampshire tomorrow, and she's a great person. She's really a very smart, young lady, but she's a great person.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All your kids have turned out to be great campaigners.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They are.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> But let me go abroad. Angela Merkel, all of a sudden, Germans don't want her. She's blown it. She's in deep, deep trouble.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> What do you think of her? What do you think of her policy vis-ˆ-vis the immigrants?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think she's terrible. I think what she's done to Germany is a disgrace, and I've talked to you about this before. I think what she's done is an absolute, it's a catastrophe. She's going to destroy Germany.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I, you know, everybody thought she was a great leader. I don't know if she got carried away with herself. She's putting people in the country. They have no idea where these people are coming from, and there's tremendous crime.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you see what's going on, rapes and crime and problems that Germany didn't have.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> No assimilation, and that brings me to the President's speech...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that's the word. And by the way, Hugh, that's the word. There's no assimilation. They don't want, half of them want Sharia law, which is a disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They want women to be treated terribly. They want, you know, the whole thing is ridiculous. I mean, they, there's not going to be assimilation, and Germany and Sweden and every other country where this is happening, it's a disaster.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Well, that's why I liked when the President went to the mosque yesterday. He talked about American Muslims. He saluted the Muslims who serve in the military. I liked the speech.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Some people didn't like the speech. But I thought he was stressing assimilation for citizens. Isn't that what we have to stress?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, assimilation is okay, but they have to assimilate. You know, if they're going to want Sharia law, which many of them do, and if they want to live under their own banners but on our soil, or in the case of Germany, on German soil, then the whole thing is ridiculous. It's never going to work.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> No, it won't. It won't.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I thought it was a surprising thing that he went to a mosque, actually. I mean, he could also go to a church, by the way, and he could also go to a synagogue. But he chose a mosque. And I thought it was surprising in light of what's going on today.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> And also, a foreign policy question, Israel and Palestine have been fighting for as long as Israel has been a state, since 1948. Do you think a two state solution is viable, Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's very, I think the whole thing is very, very tough. The level of animosity, the level of hatred and distrust is so, so tough. I've been with the greatest experts on the subject, and they think the coming together, you know, and wouldn't it be wonderful if it would work. It's a little bit like we're talking about in Germany where you know, assimilation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a very, very difficult situation. I always say you know, when we talk about difficult deals, I always say that may be the most difficult deal in the world to put together. The relationship is just so bad. And it's ingrained.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, it's ingrained for years and years and years, and the relationship, Hugh, is so bad. I use that as an example. If somebody could put that together, if somebody could create real peace over there, that would be, that would be the great dealmaker of all time. But it's going to be very tough.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Who's giving you advice on the Middle East? Who's your go-to guy or gal on the Middle East?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have numerous people. I don't want to give all names, but we have Walid, we have, you know, I have many, many people that I'm talking to, plus I read a lot, Hugh. I watch a lot and a I read a lot.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> I know you watch everything. I don't think you ever miss anything I say about...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, but I do watch. I watch a lot, you know, late in the evenings. I have a wonderful thing called Tivo and/or its equivalent. It's great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I do watch, and I do read a lot. And you know, like I get the whole Middle East. The Middle East is a disaster. Don't forget, I said don't, as a businessman, I wasn't a politician, I said do not go into Iraq.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're going to destabilize the Middle East, and Iran is going to take over everything, and that's what happened, coupled with ISIS, because of the horrible policies of the leaders of Iraq, if you want to call them leaders. It was a disaster. But because of the horrible policies, this subgroup for them, and it's called ISIS, and ISIS has turned out to be a total disaster. So you know, I was the one that in '03 and '04, right at the beginning, said you're going to destabilize the Middle East.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And that was, you know, turned out to be a pretty good prediction.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, let me turn to the general election. If you're the nominee, you'll be up against Hillary Clinton. First of all, there's a new show on TV tonight about O.J. He was guilty, but he walked away.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Madoff was guilty, he went to jail. Do you think Hillary Clinton is guilty of breaking the law? And is she going to get away with it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think she's guilty. And you know, that's based on, you know, a little legal work that I've done and I have great lawyers surrounding me all the time for lots of other reasons where, you know, just deals and business. They tell me, and also reading and watching, they tell me absolutely guilty. I have a feeling that she's going to be protected by the Democrats, and I think it's very unfair to General Petraeus and to lots of other people that have suffered greatly doing far less than she has.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if you see the way that she's reacting to the President, where everything he says is great, she doesn't really feel that way, like on Keystone Pipeline all of a sudden, she changed her vote to, you know, her voice, to what he wanted. I think it's, absolutely, I think she's guilty. I think they're going to protect her, and I think that's going to be a very, very bad thing for our country. It's going to set up an almost a double set of laws, very, very unfair, and very unfair to the people that have suffered.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> They've always had two sets of rules for the Clintons, though, haven't they, Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Whitewater was a disaster, and everybody said that she was totally guilty of that. I was with a friend of mine that was very involved in that, and said it really was something that she should have paid a bigger price for. You know, she got away with it by a whisker. You know, that was by a whisker.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was almost a flip of a coin like she won the six flips. We have to find out that coin.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> (laughing)
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Find that coin. Can you imagine winning an election by flipping a coin? That is so unbelievable.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> I know. I want that coin for the Browns.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Somehow, it doesn't...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> I want that coin...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, it doesn't sound like the American way, I have to tell you.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, now Bob Woodward was on MSNBC this morning, and he said about Hillary, ÒI think a lot of it with Hillary Clinton has to do with her style and delivery, oddly enough. She shouts,Ó he added, Òsomething unrelaxed about the way she is communicating.Ó And everybody came down on Woodward like a pile of bricks calling him a sexist. How do you think she speaks? And is it because she's a woman that she sounds so bad?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I didn't, you know, I notice that over the last couple of weeks, she has been shouting very much. I think he's really somewhat right. I mean, it looks uncomfortable, and a lot of people would say the woman, you know, I think that she has been, you know, very, she has been raising her voice a lot. I think it's painful.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's painful. I think it's going to be painful for her. It does look like she's really, really shouting, so I would have to agree with Bob Woodward on that. I think it's uncomfortable, and I don't think that's necessarily pleasant to watch.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would think it's very hard for her to do.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, now...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So you know, it may not be politically correct, but everybody knows it's the fact. And it seems to be that way more over the last week and a half, two weeks, that I've ever seen it.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> She's rattled, but Ted Cruz earlier today said you're very rattled. What do you think of that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I'm doing well. I'm a very solid person, and you know, Ted, you know, where that whole thing is with, everybody agrees the most solid person. You know, you can't build a great, great company by you know, being even a little bit rattled. Rattled has not been my thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've been a winner all my life, and frankly, I think we're going to see a good result up in New Hampshire, and we'll see. But one thing I've handled all my life, you have to be able to handle pressure, and I love pressure. I've always liked it better than even without pressure. And I think you know, you've seen it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Don't forget, I've never done it before. I've been a politician for seven months. I've never done it before, and I'm doing pretty well.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> You know, I've worked my entire legal career for developers. They have been housing developers, primarily, on the West Coast and Hawaii.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> And they make big bets. They make big bets. They win big, sometimes they lose big.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Is that mentality the one you're bringing to this race?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, a lot of people said no matter what happens with me, I can't lose, because I've comported myself very well. I've done very well. They're writing books about it. They're writing stories about it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And a person who you would know very well, but one of the most respected writers called me, and you know the story. He said you know, you could, it's been the summer of Trump, and it's been the whole autumn of Trump, and it's been amazing. I said no, it's only amazing if I win. And he said no, no, even if you don't win, it's been amazing what you've accomplished, because you've changed the whole political landscape, including the way you run for office.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So my attitude is I want to win. I don't want to just do an amazing job so that the people say nice things about me in ten years from now.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Okay, last...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I find it, I find it very interesting.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Last question, Donald Trump, some people say you're divisive. Other people say you want to make America great again. I listened to your supporters very closely. You know, I went to Roman Catholic schools where they taught patriotism, they taught civics, they did assimilation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Can you bring this country together, because it is very deeply divided?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's totally divided. Our President is a great divider. He divides everybody. He is just the most divisive person.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And this will sound strange to you, but I'm actually somebody that brings people together. You have to understand. I started out, I was running against 17. We had 17 people, and they're coming at me from every angle.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you have to be tough, and you have to be quick, and you have to be smart. And people are saying oh, he's divisive. Well, you know, now they're dropping out quickly, and they're dropping out. Every day, we seem to lose a couple.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know, you had to be tough, and you had to be sharp. Now, it's sort of getting to be the way I like it. Now, I like it better. But you know, I am somebody that brings people together.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And if I'm elected, our country will be brought back together.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> You will have to pick a running mate. If you had to pick a running mate from those that are on the stage with you this weekend, who would you pick?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I wouldn't say, but I will say I have great respect for a number of people that have been running, some of them are gone now, but have been running and are running. And at the right time, you and I will talk. Right now, I have to win first.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right. Donald Trump, I will talk with you after New Hampshire. I put my money on you winning this thing. So don't collapse here in the last three days.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll do my best.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Bye.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> I want to welcome back, in the meantime the leading, according to the latest polling data, Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump to the EIB microphones. Mr. Trump, great to have you back here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi, Rush. How are you doing so far? Can you tell a number? Are you allowed to say the number that you've raised so far?
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> Well, I try to stay away from actual hard numbers 'til the end of the program is over.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it might influence what I'm gonna do 'cause I'm trying to figure out like the scope. You know, I don't know what the scope is but it's an incredible cause. So I have to sort of ask. Can you give me, like, an idea? What did you raise last year, Rush?
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Last year, we did about a million-and-a-half to two million when it's all said and done.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Wow, that's great.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Neutral> Within one three-hour program.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think that's fantastic. Okay, so here's the story. You ready?
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay -- and you can treat me terribly after I do this. It doesn't make any difference to me how you treat me.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> Wait a second. Donald, I was wrong, it was over $3 million last year.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So in honor of you, because I love your show and whenever I can, I listen -- and it's not easy when you're a business guy, right?
<Rush Limbaugh> <Neutral> I know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because, you know, the timing isn't so great.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> That's exactly right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I listen a lot. In honor of you, $100,000.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Oh, my gosh!
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's in honor of you, and now you can go and really beat me up. Go ahead, Rush.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> I've gotta tell you, you may not know this -- well, you probably know this -- but there's a polling outlet out of North Carolina that generally tends liberal, Public Policy Polling. You are up leading the entire Republican field now with 26% of the vote. Huckabee is in second place at 17%. Does this surprise you?
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> When you started this, did you think that you would be at the top of the heap this quickly?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I didn't --
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> People didn't know for sure that you were running.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't think it would go this fast, Rush, but to be honest with you -- and I don't even know if it's me or the message -- the fact is I look at what's happening to this country, I look at the way China is just ripping us off, I look at OPEC the way they are ripping us off with the oil prices. I mean, people are gonna be paying six and seven dollars a gallon for gasoline very, very soon; and you're gonna be up to $150 a barrel; and they wouldn't even be there if it weren't for us. I look at South Korea.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What they do to us is unbelievable. Even a smaller country, Colombia, they're signing a trade packet. We lost last year -- let's call it "lost" -- $4 billion with Colombia, fourth largest country in Latin America, $4 billion. With China this year, Rush, we're gonna lose $300 billion, and that wouldn't happen if I was there.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Neutral> What does it tell you...?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People hear it and they like me, I guess.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Neutral> What does it tell you that the ChiComs say that they're gonna start divesting themselves of our T-bills? What does that tell you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They won't divest because we have the power. They don't have the power, Rush. Rush, if we ever wanted them to stop manipulating their currency, which makes it almost impossible for our companies to compete -- and I know because I build buildings, and I have to get so much stuff whether it's curtain walls or other things from China, and I hate do it. But they manipulate their currency to such an extent that it's very hard, almost impossible for our companies to compete; and if you ever said to them, "Folks, the game is over." You know, we're rebuilding China, Rush.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're rebuilding China. They're building bridges like twice the size of the George Washington Bridge.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The George Washington Bridge is like a small bridge. They are building airports, they're building cities, with our money -- and it's mostly from us because we have leadership that doesn't know what they're doing. If you ever said to them, "There's a 25% tax, a 25% tax on all of your products coming in," we would, first of all, never really probably have to oppose the tax because they would come to the table -- if you meant it, if you really meant it -- so fast. Now, if they didn't come to the table, we'd make a fortune. We'd take in a lot of money and guess what? Jobs would start going to Alabama and North Carolina and all our places. So when you ask me about the polls, people know -- and I made a lot of money with the Chinese, believe me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Both in terms of selling them very big apartments -- I sold one for $33 million recently to a Chinese gentleman -- but also in terms of deals. I made a lot of money with the Chinese, and I know the Chinese very well. By the way, they don't love us. I will tell you that. Just in case anybody has any question. They don't. When I see Obama having a dinner at the White House, Rush, for the president of China -- who's been screwing us worse than anybody other than OPEC -- for years, it's not the right and appropriate location for a dinner, believe me. So there are ways of handling it, and they need us, Rush. That's the one thing. They always say, "Oh, but they have our debt." Think of it they take our money and then they loan it back to us and we have to pay 'em interest. It's very... It would be something to solve very easily, if you have the right messenger. We don't have the right messenger. Obama is the wrong messenger.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Now, years ago, three years ago, you thought Obama had the potential to be "great." You did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was hoping. No, no, he was just... You know --
<Rush Limbaugh> <Neutral> What did you see in Obama three years ago that's changed?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, Rush. Three years ago, or, you know, he got elect -- he gets -- he wins the election, right? And people came to me, and I said, "I hope he's great. I think he's gonna be great. We all love him." We were... I want him to do great, Rush, and I'll go a step further. I'm a Republican, but if I had my choice of running or having Obama -- or somebody, but Obama, even Obama -- be a great president, the greatest president ever, I'd be so happy for the country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But he's not a great president. He won't be a great president. He doesn't have the capability to be a great president, and the world is laughing. We're like a joke. As a country, we're becoming like a joke. Everybody is ripping us off. But honestly, I love my business. I love it. Like you love your business, I love what I'm doing, I'm doing great -- and, by the way, if I run, then you'll see how great I've done.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because I'll put in a financial statement which will knock people's socks off. Just knock their socks off -- and, you know, I'm very proud of it. So I'll make a decision prior to June, and we'll see what happens.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> Donald, you accurately describe what's happening to the country domestically, international policy. You describe Obama. The question that I have and a lot of people have: Are Obama and the people helping him in his administration just incompetent, do they not get it, or is this being done on purpose? I mean, there's an assault on the private sector of this company.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> There's an assault on wealth generation and creation. Is it these people are just rose-colored theoreticians who just don't know how wrong they are, or is it worse than that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, there are two theories. There's one theory that he wants to destroy the country and create a socialistic country. There is that theory, and I've read a lot. This isn't necessarily my theory. I personally think they're incompetent. You know, we know and you know some of the great business leaders in this country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're fantastic. And I know many of them, almost all of them, I guess. I mean, I know so many. I know the politicians on both sides, Rush, but I know the great business leaders. I know guys that are so tough and so mean, they make you look like a nice guy, Rush. Okay?
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> [Laughs]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're so smart and so good, and I would put people to negotiate, let's say, with China. And guess what? We would do absolutely great. But we use diplomats to negotiate -- and, you know, when China sends over their people to negotiate, they pick their meanest, smartest, most vicious guy; and these guys, they don't play games.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They don't laugh, they don't cry, they have no emotion. They just want to make money, and they just want to rip our country to shreds. But I know people that are tougher and smarter than them. We don't use 'em. So I think they're incompetent. One thing Obama is: He's a good campaigner. He's a terrible president.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he's gonna go down as the worst president ever, frankly. I used to say that about Jimmy Carter but I think he's gonna be surpassed. But I think that the one thing he is, he's a good campaigner. He just campaigns well. If you ask me about Obama, the only thing he does well is campaign.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Debt ceiling and the budget battle just fought. You're running for president -- or you're toying with the idea. You have demonstrable success in making ends meet; you have to, one way or the other. What's your opinion of watching this take process place, the debt ceiling fight coming up and a budget battle where we're supposed to feel good over cutting either $38 billion or $352 million or whatever it was?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I heard your statement last week and it was sort of interesting because when they called me, we were in the billions, in the $38 billion range; and they asked me a question, and I heard $38 billion. Now, I wasn't happy with $38 billion, but I said, "Well, we'll have another fight, and that will take place in a few months and then we'll be fine," but then I heard the $38 billion -- long after I did the interview with Greta Van Susteren who's terrific, by the way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I did an interview with her, and the interview took place before people found out that the $380 billion was actually a lot lower. So I would have had a lot different opinion, because I wasn't even happy with the 380 number. So that's one thing. As far as the budget, I don't like raising the ceiling.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, you can solve the problem now. Why should we keep waiting? That's the problem. We keep waiting and waiting and waiting. But I will say, Rush, the Republicans have to be careful. And I'm a fan of Paul Ryan, but he shouldn't get too far out with some of these plans, because they're gonna belabor it. One thing with me: If I decide to run I am gonna cherish senior citizens.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the Democrats, and I know 'em all because as you know I come from New York and it's virtually a hundred percent virtual Democratic, right?
<Rush Limbaugh> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I've dealt with these people, Schumer and -- and everybody.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> I want to ask you about that when we come back from break.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay, very good. But the Republicans shouldn't get too far out because they're already making plans to say, incorrectly, that the Medicare is gonna be terrible for the seniors, et cetera, et cetera. This is Obama's fight, and he should be leading it as the president. We shouldn't get too far out in front.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Donald Trump is with us as we attempt to cure leukemia and lymphoma -- and, by the way, thank you again for that donation. That was totally unexpected. Mr. Trump has thrown $100,000 into our effort here today.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> We welcome back Donald Trump. I need to ask you something about Paul Ryan and what you meant. You said that he's gotta be very careful not to be too far out. You mean too many years out in his planning or too far out in his thinking?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Too far out with the plan itself. He's doing a plan, he's done a plan, he's come out, and what the Democrats -- and I see it more and more and I hear from them because, again, you know, living in New York that's what I see is Democrats all over the place -- are going to do is say it's attack on Medicare. And Medicare to a lot of people means seniors, and that this is a very strong attack on Medicare.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I honestly think you have to go down the line in a bipartisan way. You have to go down with the Democrats. I don't think they should be too far out in front. Don't forget, we don't have the president yet. Hopefully, we will have. We don't have. He's supposed to be leading this attack, not us. And they can do rejects, they can criticize his plan, but in my opinion... You know, there's an election in 2012, right?
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In my opinion, he has to be very careful because when he mentions even the touching of the word "Medicare" -- and Medicaid to a lesser extent, perhaps -- but when he mentions even the touching of Medicare, they're gonna attack him unmercifully.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> They're gonna attack --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just think it's a bad position to be in when you have an election coming up.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> They're gonna attack him anyway just like they're gonna attack you. Now, his plan doesn't touch current recipients. That's one thing he's very clear about.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> But you, you. Last time you were here I shared with you some questions I had from members of my audience uncomfortable with donations that you have made to Democrats: Rahm Emanuel, Chuck Schumer, and so forth.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> You explained that. You have to do business in the places you live. They're the ones that hold power, hold office. You mentioned compromise just now. Donald, what are you gonna do if you're elected and all of a sudden they start accusing you of wanting to kill babies and kill old people, which they will.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> That's what they do. Your friendship's gonna go out the window with these guys when it comes to their political power, Donald. They're gonna come after you the same way they go after anybody else in the Republican Party.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, you're right, Rush, but I will say this. You know, I've dealt with Democrats and Republicans all my life, and somebody said, "Oh, do you have that much experience politically?" You know, I've dealt -- and understand this better than anybody. I've dealt with politicians all of my life. I've also dealt with foreign countries.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm doing jobs all over the world. I've dealt with foreign countries for a long period of time. The fact is, I think somebody that got along with the Democrats -- and I do get along -- now, you know, that could change instantaneously. You understand that. But the level of animosity... You know, in the old days "across the aisle" wasn't the worst thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People got along. Today, the level of hatred, the level of anger -- and I'm the most militaristic person there is, if they treat me improperly. But I think having a little bit of a relationship on the other side of the aisle is not so bad, Rush, where deals can be made. But good deals, not the deal like Obama gave the other day.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That wasn't a deal, that was a campaign speech. That was his first campaign speech.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> But they're not gonna want you to succeed at anything. They will stop progress for America. Your relationship with them will change once you become elected. If you become president, you might have the ability to bring them in line, but they will not start that way. They will be out to destroy you to preserve their way of life, their political ideology.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Remember, their power derives from creating more and more people dependent on government for their daily needs.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Neutral> You don't believe that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Rush, you're probably right and probably it won't work out in the kind of manner which makes sense and would be good and then they'll see the real Donald Trump, because I do much better under adversity than I do the other way. I'd love to see it work where people could actually get together and go down the line and straighten out this country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're probably right, and that's fine, and then I'll do I think an even better job.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Well, it would be fascinating to me because you do know them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know them so well it's unbelievable.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> You have socialized with them. I think that if they tried to attack you the way they attack every other conservative or Republican, you might have a leg up on them because you've got years and years of being able to say, "Well, Chuck, you never said that to me before. You never accused me of wanting to kick old people out of their houses.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Why do you think I want to do it now?"
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Mmm-hmm.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> So, you would have that opportunity. So you're thinking you might announce this on the upcoming episode of The Apprentice?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. What I may do is: The finale is on May 22nd, and I may announce on the finale the date of the news conference where I'd make the determination.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Oh, I see. By the way, The Apprentice --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that will be, in any event, sometime prior to June. Because, you know, somebody said to me the other day, "Oh, let's do it in June." I said, "No, I can't do that." They said, "No, no, it would be perfect." I said, "No, I can't do that, because I have been saying for six months 'sometime prior to June.'" They said, "Oh, no, it doesn't matter. If you say June..."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said, "No, you don't understand. When I say 'prior to June,' that doesn't mean 'June.'" So I will be making an announcement sometime prior to June -- and I may surprise you, Rush.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> You always surprise people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Heh.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Look, I appreciate your time here today and everybody appreciates your donation to the Cure-A-Thon effort here. That was a shock and totally surprising. Before you go, it's probably a silly question, but have you stopped to think how your life will change were you to be elected president? I mean, it's nothing like your life.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Neutral> For example, would you move to the White House?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I guess you'd sorta have to but the truth is it would be a lot different -- and, again, if I had my choice, I wish this country were running great. I wish I could stand up and say, "Wow, this place is really running fantastically," and, by the way, if it were I wouldn't be getting poll numbers like I'm getting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because, you know, people look at me as somebody that can really -- that knows what he's doing. Whether they love me or don't love me, they think I know what I'm doing and that people aren't gonna be taking advantage of the country, and that's why I think I'm doing very well in the polls. And, by the way, I see the other politicians, and, you know, I don't think that's gonna be happening.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So if I had my choice, I'd love to keep doing what I'm doing. The country is in serious, serious trouble, like it's never been before. And that's why I'm saying: Would I rather stay in Trump Tower? Would I rather stay and lead the life I'm leading -- and you know something about my life. It's very good.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> I do. Yes, I do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The answer is, yes, but I love the country, Rush.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Donald Trump. I appreciate your time. Thank you very much, and we'll talk to you again soon, I'm sure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Rush.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Neutral> Donald Trump, talking to us from Trump Tower in New York.
