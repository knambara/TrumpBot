<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Hi everybody, Brian Kilmeade. "The Brian Kilmeade Show” is back. It is our privilege to bring in the President of the United States from the White House. Mr. President, how are you today?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi, Brian.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Thanks for doing this. I appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you very much.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> The focus everybody is looking at right now is this Hurricane Dorian. It missed Puerto Rico --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> -- heading to Florida. You have an acting FEMA director and a good friend, but a brand new Governor. Are you concerned about Florida being ready for the hit?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, they're going to be totally ready, and Puerto Rico was totally ready. FEMA and all of the first responders did an incredible job with Puerto Rico, then we got lucky, it took a different course. We got really lucky, but we were ready in Puerto Rico and we’re very ready also in Florida, and we have a great governor there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He’s incredible, doing an incredible job; very popular too. Became -- he won the election, and he’s really become even more popular. He’s doing a really fantastic job -- Ron DeSantis -- and he’s all set. He called me up last night. I called him up, and we were talking and unfortunately the bad news is it looks like it’s going to be making a turn into Florida.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It looks -- I don’t know with certainty, but according to the folks over at weather, they seem to think it’s going to be making a pretty decisive turn into Florida.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Well, we’ll keep an eye on that and of course that’s going to matter. And one thing about Florida, they’re used to these situations. They’ve had to deal with it way too much and you have properties there, so you’re familiar with it as well.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That’s right.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> I’m looking now -- I’m looking now at the market. It’s up almost 300 points this morning. So they’re feeling good about what’s going on and a lot of focus on China in particular.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> I know that that’s your focus too and I’m looking at what they’re doing and not doing with fentanyl. I look at the way they’re stealing our intellectual property. They’re building up a military seemingly just to fight ours. I’m wondering, Mr. President, how long can you call President Xi a friend when they seem to act like this while backing off a deal that you had virtually done a couple of months ago?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well let’s see what the end product is. I think that’s what you have to judge it by, whether to see what the end product is. I will say that for 25 years China has been ripping off the United States. You know that. I talked about it a long time ago.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> You did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That’s one of the reasons I’m probably here as president. I’m in the White House. And they’ve been ripping us off for billions and billions of dollars like babies. Obama was ripped worse than anybody, Bush and everyone -- Clinton. Nobody did anything about it, and I am. I’m doing what had to be done. I mean I’m doing there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I’m doing North Korea. I was given a lot of bad --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- bad hands and I’m taking them and I’m going to win with them – we’re going to win with every one of them, but we’re dealing with China. They really want to make a deal and the reason they want to make a deal is they lost millions and millions of jobs. They’re losing thousands of companies that are leaving China.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Their chain is being broken and we’ll see what happens, but I will tell you I think -- I think they want to make a deal. I sort of think they have to make a deal and we’ll see what happens.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> But also on top of that, Mr. President, they’re very aware of our political system. They know your base is -- a lot of it is in the Midwest. A lot of them are blue collar -- a lot of them are farmers and they’re targeting those people seemingly to hurt you, which hurts the country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. China plays a vicious game. They’ve targeted our farmers and I’ve made up for it by -- for two years now, $12 billion they did previously then they did $16. I asked Sonny Perdue, our head of agriculture is doing a fantastic job, what was the number they spent in their biggest year. And it was approximately $16 billion and out of the much more billions of dollars that we’re receiving.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, we’re getting in tens of billions of dollars from China. We never got $0.10 from China in tariffs and they’re -- we’re really -- it’s being paid thus far by their devaluations and by them putting cash into the market because they don’t want prices to go up.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you take a look. You know, it’s been covered incorrectly like almost every other story about me is covered and what I did was I gave the farmers $12 billion the previous year, $16 billion this year to make up because the farmers have been targeted. That’s how vicious they play the game. They actually target because they know that the farmers like Trump and Trump loves the farmers actually.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I love what they do. They’re incredible people. They don’t want any subsidies. They don’t want handouts but they also know --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- something has to be done with China and they’re with me all the way.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> And the -- and the country that gives you facial recognition and wants to fine you and give you -- take points out for smoking in a no-smoking zone, are we expected to believe that they can’t control the fentanyl leaving their country, going to Mexico and going across our border? So that’s a direct -- also a direct attack.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that’s part of my deal, Brian. And yes, it’s part of my deal and I said to President Xi, who’s a very strong leader, got a lot of strength, and I said you got to get rid of this fentanyl and I’m a little surprised they haven’t done more. They have done -- by the way, it is better. They made little moves but they didn’t make the moves that they said.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And much of it comes out -- you can almost say almost all of it comes out of China.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And that’s a big part of our trade deal. The fentanyl is a part of our trade deal, whether people like it or not, that’s the way it is. And we’re doing well. We’ll see what happens. And we just made a tremendous deal with Japan and hopefully it’ll be signed over the next three, four weeks, a tremendous trade deal, incredible for ecommerce but really incredible for farmers and ranchers.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And it’s a very big -- one of the largest deals --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- made. And that’s done. We’ve done the deal with South Korea. We’ve done a lot of deals. And the biggest one is China. But China’s -- they’ve been taking a lot of money out of our country for a long time. It’s hard for them to get used to the fact that it can’t be that way. I mean, we just can’t --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- let that continue.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Do you have talks scheduled next week with China?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have talks scheduled. There is a talk scheduled for today at a different level. And yes, they’ve been talking and the fake news tried to say we weren’t talking last week and then the Vice-Premier of China said no, no, we have been talking. He spoke to people and he’s the Vice-Premier.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, we have been talking. We continue to talk. Look, this is having a tremendous impact on China. I don’t know if it’s having an impact on us. I don’t think so. I mean, other than --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Pat Toomey says it is.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- we’re getting richer.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Pat Toomey, who I know you respect, Republican from Pennsylvania says, “There’s no question the trade uncertainty is contributing to the slowdown in our economy.” Is he right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So what does Pat Toomey want me to do? Does he want me to say, let me put my hands up China, continue to rip us off? Just continue. Tell Pat. I like Pat. Tell Pat. Continue to rip us off. Let me give up right now, China, even though we’re winning. Let me give up right now. You continue to take out $400, $500, $600 billion out of our ... Continue to steal our intellectual property.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Continue to do all of the other horrible things you’ve been doing to us for 30 years. You continue and I’m going to -- for Pat Toomey and some others that want to give up, I’m going to -- I promise I’m going to --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- give up. There’s nothing you can do but tariffs in terms of -- and I’m doing other things also by the way, but other than the primarily thing is tariffs. It’s having a devastating effect and they’re coming to the table and we’ll see whether or not they make a deal. But when --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- Pat Toomey says, oh, I don’t like that, that only means one thing. That means raise your hands and get used to paying $500 billion a year to China plus --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> I hear you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- plus, plus.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> All right. So let’s talk about the USMCA, a deal you cut and we need Congress to pass. And a lot of Democrats say it’s almost there. And some at moderate districts said -- are support -- pressuring the Democratic leadership to pass, come this fall. Have you had conversations with Democratic leadership to get this thing to a vote in the House and Senate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. The U.S., and it’s Mexico and Canada, USMCA, is a very popular deal. The farmers love it. The unions like it. And so much better than NAFTA, which is one of the worst deals ever made by this country. I mean it just cleaned out our country. They cleaned our clock. We lost 60,000 businesses and a lot of them went to Mexico and Canada and other places --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Mr. President, Republicans always liked NAFTA and Democrats didn’t, so you’re singing their song. Do they -- are they afraid to give you a win? Is that the only reason why this wouldn’t go up for a vote?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I’m a Republican and I hated NAFTA from day one. From the day --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> I know.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don’t know if you remember Ross Perot --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> I do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- saying it had that suck-in feeling. And he meant by that the money and the factories and the jobs are going to be sucked out of our country and that’s what NAFTA did. You have to see Mexico. They have a -- you know, they sold -- they took -- and I happen to like them right now, because they've been great on the border.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They have 27,000 soldiers on our border because the Democrats will not do anything about asylum and loopholes. But I'll tell you what, Mexico took 30 percent of our automobile business during NAFTA and it's a disgrace. So, the new deal is much different than NAFTA, and it's a great deal for us. And it's great for everybody.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it has very strong support. Hopefully Nancy Pelosi will put it up for a vote, it means a lot of jobs. But even the unions like it. The unions like it, manufacturers like it, the farmers are in love with it. Got to be approved.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, the only reason you wouldn't do it is for politics, and maybe they won't do it because they think it will be good. I view it as a bipartisan deal and I told Nancy Pelosi, look at it as a bipartisan deal, not as a Trump deal. Look at it as a bipartisan deal.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> And maybe they'll do it and she has not indicated to you they will, but there are some people who feel as though this come up. So, can you imagine if something actually got passed in 2019?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, this will be an incredible shot.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This deal is --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> For farmers at home --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, in terms of dollars, this is as big as China, in some ways it's bigger. It's a tremendous deal. In some ways it's bigger. You know, what we do at the border that we have with Mexico is the biggest in the world economically, by far the biggest in the world, actually, not even close, in terms of commerce from an economic standpoint.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's the biggest border in the world and we -- we're going to straighten it out.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Got you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the other thing it really does is it keeps our companies in the United States. It's just going to make -- it makes it prohibitive to keep moving around to other countries and firing everybody.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Mr. President, one of the great things at Fox, you meet a lot of military people and they're really hardened by, when you took over, you got aggressive in Afghanistan.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> And you said -- what you -- you said last week was also reassuring to some when you said, Afghanistan is the Harvard University for terrorists. And now we understand a deal -- we don't know what it looks like, and the ninth round is two days away, possibly, with Afghanistan and saying the Taliban will guarantee no Al-Qaeda ISIS and therefore we could pull out.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> And a lot of people's concern is, our national security would be in the Taliban's hands and they have no interest in cracking down on our number one or number two enemy, ISIS and Al-Qaeda. Are you pledging to keep a presence in the area, while maybe --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh yes, you have to keep a presence. Look, for some reason, and I don’t even know if anybody really knows why, it's a confluence, lots of countries sort of hit that tip, hit that spot, but -- and this -- it's also very rough mountainous terrain where you can hide and for whatever reason, a lot of terrorists -- that’s where they were trained for the World Trade Center, in Afghanistan.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Of course.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, we're going to keep a presence there. We're reducing that presence very substantially and we're going to always have a presence and we're going to have high intelligence, and I will put this word out, and I've already said it, but if they ever did anything from Afghanistan, we will come back with a force like they've never seen before.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They will --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> So, we have -- we have 8,000 --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- like you wouldn't believe if they do that. And I don't see that happening. Don't forget, there are other places in the world where things can happen, too.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> True.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we can't control every place, but we will leave it. Happens to be a very -- it's an amazing area for terrorism. It's just -- I call it the Harvard University of terror. That's where they --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Mr. President, the Congress is saying, can you keep 8,000 -- they want the 8,600 there. Right now they say there's four -- you would know better, obviously, there's 14 of our guys, 8,000 of NATO.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, that's right.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> What is the threshold that you will tell Kalazod (ph), who is doing your negotiating, that we're going to have, because Taliban thinks we're going down to zero, and you're saying right now we're not.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, we're going down to 8,600 and then we make a determination from there as to what happens. We'll make a determination, but we're going down to 8,600, we're bringing it down. We have it very well controlled. You know, we're not fighting a war over there, we're just policeman over there. We could win that war so fast -- if I wanted to kill 10 million people, Brian, which I don't. I’m not looking to kill a big portion of that country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I’m not looking to do that.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don’t want to do that --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> But in your mind -- you remember, you were on with us when President Obama pulled everybody out of Iraq and then we got ISIS and you were very critical. I feel -- do you feel as though if you did the same thing in Afghanistan you’d be doing the same thing he did?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I’m not doing that. He pulled everybody out very quickly and by the way, I’m not so sure -- look, we should have never been in Iraq. I’ve said that from day one and I was a civilian and it was covered but it was -- you know, I was a civilian so who cares, right? But I said from day one, we should not go to Iraq.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was a tremendous mistake. It turned out to be a mistake because they didn’t have weapons of mass destruction. We went there for weapons of mass destruction, which it turned out they didn’t have. OK? He was talking about it but he didn’t have them. And it was a horrible thing. And then in Afghanistan, I mean people went to Afghanistan from other countries, one in particular, frankly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they went to Afghanistan where they were trained and then they did the World Trade Center attack but I believe all except the one was trained in Afghanistan, so we have to watch Afghanistan. But we’re bringing it down to -- if the deal happens. I don’t know that it’s going to happen. I mean it’s getting close but if it happens -- who knows if it’s going to happen.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know my attitude of those things, Brian.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do deals. That’s what I do for a living.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> You’re not going to telegraph it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It’s worked out very well.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Yes, you’re not going to telegraph it. And I’m just concerned, the Taliban Five that was led out for (ph) Bowe Bergdahl --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> -- they are evidently part of the Taliban contingent that we’re dealing with -- actually talking peace with, which is mindboggling.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well the whole Bowe Bergdahl thing was a disgrace. He left. We may have lost as many as six people going out and looking for him. He deserted, as far as I was concerned, and then they got some judge in the military that gave him, I guess, the softest sentence anybody can even think about and it’s a disgrace what’s going on.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then you have some of these people -- look, some are -- some are not a good situation but they’re very rough on some of the military people that frankly love our country and they went overboard and they went too far in some cases but the Bowe Bergdahl deal was a disgrace, what happened to him. He deserted; he left.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People were probably killed, and it could have been as many as six, trying to find him and then he gets a slap on the wrist. It was a disgrace, in my opinion.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> So Mr. President, there was a big story yesterday and we see the video of the new wall going up with the bollard fencing --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> -- and the word went out and the story came out that you told your people, put the wall up and if you get sued, don’t worry about it, I’ll pardon you. And then everyone’s --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, fake news. More fake news, just like Lawrence O’Donnell had -- listen, Lawrence O’Donnell said the Russians guaranteed a loan for me and it was -- look, this guy and almost all of them have been lying for years about me. Lying, saying also -- as an example, I built an unbelievable company, unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because I don’t need many banks because I have a lot of cash and I have a lot of cash flow, they say, oh the banks don’t want to do business. The banks wanted to do business with me. In fact, people don’t realize -- and you remember this. Deutsche Bank, if you go back 10, 12, 15 years ago when I dealt with Deutsche Bank, that was the Rolls Royce bank.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That was Germany you were dealing with. That was the strongest, the biggest…
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> … that was one of the great banks of the world. Now they make it sound like, you know, because Deutsche Bank, nothing to do with me, Deutsche Bank has had a lot of problems over the last five or six years. But when I was dealing with them, they were the Rolls Royce. They were Germany. They were the Triple-A standard and now they say, oh, he couldn’t do business with other banks.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That’s a phony deal, too. Total phony stuff. And if -- you know, when I do a deal --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> So did you have an oligarch cosign?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When I put up cash -- hey Brian -- when I put up cash to do a deal, because I don’t need a bank --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- they say he can’t -- he had to put up cash. Well, how would I have the cash to put up? If I don’t need a bank, I just wouldn’t do the deal. So what happened is they try and demean and diminish and it’s such a disgrace. But Deutsche Bank was a -- was really the -- I would say just about the ultimate bank then.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now it’s come upon hard times but has nothing to do with me. And because I don’t borrow a lot of money, they go around saying the banks didn’t want to do business with him, totally false. I could’ve had -- there were so many lenders. There was --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- lenders all over the place. Anybody, I mean most people
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> So, he said he had a single source that said an oligarch cosigned a loan. Is that true?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don’t believe he had a single source. And if he does have a single source, he should sue the source because it’s made him look like -- you know, it’s exposed him for being a fraud because, look, Lawrence O'Donnell has been lying about me. If you remember, we had a big dispute in The Apprentice. He said I was never paid anything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I said I was paid a fortune. And then the statement came out, it was released; he had to apologize, just like --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- he did last night. And when he apologized, he was crying because it was very embarrassing to him because we --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I made a big bet. I said if it wasn’t a certain amount, I’ll pay your whole year’s salary for you. And he had to apologize. And believe it or not, it was your friend in the morning, Joe Scarborough, that demanded he apologize because it was on his show. So that was --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Interesting.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- in the gold old days when --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- Joe had good ratings.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He doesn’t have them so much anymore --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- Bad ratings.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you know -- no, Lawrence O'Donnell has been saying stuff for four years. It’s just as wrong. But this was one that he was forced by NBC to apologize for and what they say is just MSNBC and CNN and all of them for the most part.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they’re just really despicable people.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It’s horrible. It’s fake news and it’s a shame. And it’s so -- Brian, it’s so bad for our country. And despite that, I win, because I have incredible people that are really smart, millions and millions and tens of millions that follow me. And the polls are phony, too.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Now --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The polls are phony, too. I mean -- and in all fairness, among my worst polls always is Fox. I have to say that. But I have the worst --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Well, I know you were critical of Fox yesterday. You came out and you tweeted --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> -- Fox News sadly promoting the Democrats through the DNC Communications Director spewing out whatever she wanted.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> So you were very upset --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I’m not happy with -- I’m not happy with Fox. I think -- people think Fox is for me. Fox is good. Look, Sean and Laura and Tucker has really been very good, well Tucker is a little tricky, but that’s OK. But he’s been very good. And many of them, you guys in the morning, Ainsley and Steve and you, you become -- you were a solid -- you know, I used to say you were a solid six, maybe a seven but --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- you’re getting much better. You’re getting great.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> But the thing that people should know about us is that -- from the time you were hosting The Apprentice, if you and I disagreed, you didn’t mind. You know we disagreed. We talked about --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> True.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> -- President Bush.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> True.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> We talked about different things. And it was still OK.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> So you don’t mind --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That’s true.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> So I don’t understand, so if Fox comes on and they’re critical of one -- if somebody comes on and they’re critical of one thing about you, it never used to bother you like this. Now yesterday I read those tweets hoping to get you on today and you’re so kind to come on, I appreciate it. And I thought to myself, what’s bothering you about it? Because our channel prides itself on diversity and getting everybody in so you don’t have to flip around.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. So let me just --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> What’s changed in your mind?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me just tell you. CNN is 100 percent, they would never -- in fact they just fired Steve Cortez, a phenomenal guy. They fired Jeff, they fired -- they have virtually nobody. They have panels where they have panels that all Trump haters on. You know Jeff Zucker is just -- I mean, give me a break. I could tell you stories about him, Jeff Zucker.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And MSNBC, I think, is worse, OK, if you want to know the truth. I actually think they’re worse. They fight to see who’s worse.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they don’t have diversity, meaning my view.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They never put my view on. Although, I guarantee you this, they have both, but CNN, in particular, is begging me to do an interview, and I just think it would be disloyal to my followers to -- what are they going to ask me?
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> No, I don't think you should do an interview over there either.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think it would be very disloyal to people that are Trump fans and people that voted for me and people that are going to vote again. And by the way, I see these phony polls. We have very strong polls in house, but I see these phony polls, that's another form of fake news. You know, it's called suppression.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They suppress their feelings, and --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Well yes, are you getting worried about Elizabeth Warren's crowds?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, that's another thing. I have crowds that are many times what her crowds are. Nobody ever talks about them. Nobody wants to talk about them. With her the other day they say she had 15, if you really count them up it looked like about eight or nine, and the biggest story was her crowds. That's like a small crowd for me and nobody even talks about my crowds.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody even likes to show. Do you ever hear me when I'm at the speech, I say, show this crowd, and the cameras won't turn around.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Yes, well they do now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said, no, I want to you -- you know, I'm like in a Madison Square Garden type arena --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- it's packed.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll go a step further. Two weeks ago in New Hampshire I was packed.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> And you've got a big one coming up in North Carolina. And Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm always -- I'm always -- well, I haven't had an empty seat.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Well, let's --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But they never talk about that. But Elizabeth Warren has a crowd this big. No, there's a total double standard. They treat our people -- now I'm president of all people, that's number one, I want you to know that. And I love them all, but they treat certain people very, very unfairly, I have to say that.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Got you. Mr. President, can't thank you enough for the time you just gave us. I appreciate it. And I lastly, congratulations on your 10th grandchild.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Your life's not slowing down personally or professionally.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I guess not. It's amazing.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ten grandchildren, if you can believe that one, that's great.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> All right. Thanks so much, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Thank you, Brian.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> I appreciate your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You take care of yourself.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> All right, you got it. The President of the United States.
<Tom Hauser> <Positive> You're good?
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Yeah.
<Tom Hauser> <Positive> Mr. President, I appreciate you taking time --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Tom Hauser> <Positive> -- for an interview today. Interesting discussion out there with a lot of people who support the tax bill, even though it gave tax cuts to at least two out of three Americans, maybe more.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Much more.
<Tom Hauser> <Negative> There's still a majority of Americans who don't believe it. Have you and Republicans done a good enough job of selling what the tax bill did?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we did a great job in getting it approved, but we -- may be, a lot of the Republicans, including myself, haven't explained to people how much they're getting. Now they know it. A lot of stories are coming out with how incredible it's been for people. So they're learning, but it's had a tremendous impact -- could be seven, eight, nine thousand dollars in some cases.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a tremendous tax cut for people, and people are really learning. I don't have to explain it. They're just seeing a lot more money show up in their check that they didn't see a couple of years ago.
<Tom Hauser> <Positive> And you said $5 billion in savings here in the state of Minnesota --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Tom Hauser> <Neutral> Is that according to, who?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> $5 billion, according to whoever does that kind of thing. $5 billion saved in the state of Minnesota alone.
<Tom Hauser> <Negative> Has enough of it gone to middle-income Americans and Minnesotans?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, if you look at the job numbers, the job numbers are at record numbers -- including in Minnesota -- the job numbers are at record numbers, and we're creating records in almost every way. Industry, you look at the money that is pouring back into the country. Money that was gone, that was going to be spent in other countries, is now coming back from overseas, because we gave an incentive to bring the money back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So tremendous numbers of jobs are being created by businesses that are all thriving. Small businesses, big businesses. The estate tax is gone from the small farms and businesses, so that people can leave their farm or their business to their children, and they have to pay tax. A lot of things are happening that are very, very good.
<Tom Hauser> <Negative> As you know, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar wants your job. Today, she released her 2018 tax returns. She challenges you to do the same, and she is also critical of the tax bill. Could you beat Amy Klobuchar in a race in Minnesota?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't think she's a factor, certainly nationwide. I don't even see her showing up on the charts. She seems like a very nice person. I don't know her. As far as taxes, as soon as I do -- they audit, you know, they have been doing an audit of me for a long time, different audits. I have a big company.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very big. Lawyers for anybody in the midst of an audi -- audit would not give tax returns, and as far as Minnesota is concerned, you look at the pipeline, and so many other things that the Democrats are stopping. We'll get it done. But the Democrats are stopping very important projects in Minnesota. I've opened up the range, as you know, you take a look at the Iron Range, and all of the things that we've done, and tremendous numbers of jobs are pouring in. You have a record low unemployment in Minnesota.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was caused by what I've done with the taxes, and also, I think importantly, with the regulations.
<Tom Hauser> <Positive> Are you confident you can win Minnesota regardless of who the Democratic candidate is?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think so. I think Minnesota has been treated very unfairly, really unfairly, in terms of immigration. What they've done with Minnesota for immigration has been very, very unfortunate and unfair. And, yeah, I think I'm going to win Minnesota. Almost won it last time, first time in many, many decades that a Republican would be in that position.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think if you look at the Iron Range, if you look at all of the things that we've done for Minnesota, and Minnesota is a big beneficiary of wh -- of what I've done, especially maybe taxes being lowered, but especially with regulations. So I think we're going to win Minnesota. I think we're going to win Minnesota big, and I'm going to treat Minnesota fairly on immigration.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have been treated so badly.
<Tom Hauser> <Negative> Congresswoman Omar sent out a release last night saying that your tweet from a couple of days ago has led to direct threats on her life. Any second thoughts about that tweet, and the way it was produced and put together?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, not at all. Look, she's been very disrespectful to this country. She's been very disrespectful, frankly, to Israel. She is somebody that doesn't really understand, I think, life real life, what it's all about. All she does is criticize people. Take a look at her, take a real good look at her. She's got to respect what's happened in this country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's got to respect people that have been helpful to us, and not always criticize. So I think that it's unfortunate. She's got a way about her that is very, very bad, I think, for our country. I think she's extremely unpatriotic, and extremely disrespectful to our country.
<Tom Hauser> <Positive> One final question. Thursday, it sounds like the redacted Mueller report might come out. Do you have any concerns about what that might show?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it showed that it's a total phony. I don't have to say that -- I mean, you just take a look at the conclusion. Uh, the, uh, they -- they, you -- you just take -- any any any aspect of that report, I hope it does come out, because there was no collusion whatsoever. No collusion. There was no obstruction, because that was ruled by the Attorney General.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Where there was collusion, and where there was obstruction, and where there was crime was on the other side, because how did this whole thing start? It was a big con job, and everybody knows. It was a total con job, and I think it's a shame. So, I heard it's going to come out on Thursday. That's good, and there can't be anything there, because there was no crime.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There was no anything. The crime was committed by the other side. This crime was all made up. It was all a fabrication. And that's come out loud and clear.
<Tom Hauser> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you for your time. I appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Thank you.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Just about 30 minutes before On the Record started, we spoke to Donald Trump and the news had just broken out of Nice about the terrorism. I asked Donald Trump about what we were seeing on the screens, and here is what he had to say to us.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, thank you for joining us.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, very disturbing news out of Nice, France right now. We are still getting more information. Dozens killed. Someone in a truck drove into a crowd. It's Bastille Day. We're hearing there's total panic. Locals are told to stay indoors. They don't know what's going on. But it looks like it's possible that this is terrorism striking Nice.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Your thoughts?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it sounds like here we go again. It's going to be a whole different world. We're living in a whole different world. That there is no respect for law and order. There is no respect for anything or anybody. And this has to be dealt with very harshly. And when I come out with my non-politically correct statements that a lot of people love and some people think are so terrible, and then you have attacks like this and so many other attacks, I mean, let's see what happens with this one.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's early to tell. But I would think that perhaps you are not wrong the way you started this question. We have to get awfully tough and we have to get very, very smart and vigilant. And if we don't, we're just not going to have a society. We're not going to have a world anymore. This is crazy, what's going on.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I don't want to jump too far ahead. This is so early in the investigation, but it has all the hallmark of terrorism. We saw that last November 13th in Paris. And we've seen it many other instances. So naturally we all jump to conclusion, it's terrorism. Assuming this is terrorism and assuming you were president of the United States, what would you be doing right now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I would be making it very, very hard for people to come into our country for one thing from terrorist areas. I would be so extreme in terms of documentation. We have people that Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more than Obama. And Obama is allowing a lot of people to come in. We have no idea who they are.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If they are from Syria, maybe, but they have no paperwork many times. They don't have documentation proper. I would make it -- I would not allow people to come in from terrorist nations. I would do extreme vetting. I would call it extreme vetting, too. And, you know, our country has tremendous problems. We don't need any more of the problems.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right now, we have more investigations of this kind going on than we've ever had in the history of our country. And we're going to allow thousands and tens of thousands of more people coming in. And then you see a situation like in Nice, France. It's a horrible thing. And we better get awfully tough. And I'm talking about our country.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I'm almost talking about the world because look at what's going on in France. Look at what's going on in other countries. It's bedlam.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. You know, like I keep noting for both of us is that, you know, we don't know. This is just an ongoing investigation. But we have the situation, for instance, in Orlando. That was home-grown terrorism, essentially. These are not people trying to come into the country. And we don't know if this terrorism in France, whether it's someone who is a French citizen or from some place else.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But is there something the president should be doing? Should he -- is there something to convene? Should we be calling President Hollande, new Prime Minister May, Angela Merkel? Is there some way to sort of step this up? Because we do see a lot of attacks in this world.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, you do. And second generation turns out to be very bad for whatever reason, that second generation. And, again, who knows the new one in France? Maybe it's not. But you probably have a pretty good gut instinct. But you look at what's happening and, yes, I would be calling heads of countries and I'd be saying we have to tie things up. But I can tell you for our country, we have to tighten it up. Look at San Bernardino.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What happen there? The way they came in. She probably radicalized him. 14 people dead. Many, many, many injured. Still horribly injured, permanently injured. You look at Paris, prior to this. You look at Paris. 130 people dead. Hundreds of people still in the hospital. I mean, what are we doing? We're trying to be so nice.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're trying to be so civil. We're so weak. The world has gotten to straighten up. And we have to be very tight with our borders. It's now a different world, Greta. This isn't 40 years ago and 80 years ago. This is a different world. We're trying to be so politically correct. And we're making such big mistakes.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. Well, let me jump into the politically correct. You know, the rumors out there I'm sure. I know you have denied that you have made a decision. You haven't released it. But Governor Mike Pence, the media is reporting that they think is your vice presidential nominee. He said back in December, "Call to ban Muslims from entering the United States are offensive and unconstitutional." In light of the remarks, you have made about a temporary ban, how would you reconcile that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, you know, I'm not going to agree with anybody. I mean, I have interviewed many, many people would like to have this position. You see what's happening with the polls. The polls are very strong and getting up and stronger and stronger every day. And a lot of people want this position. A lot of people that you don't know about want this position.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And there is nobody that agrees with me fully on anything. There's always going to be somebody where they disagree on a border or they disagree on a Muslim ban or they disagree on something. So I fully understand that. Probably less with the Mike than most. But I haven't made my final, final decision. I mean, I've got three people that are fantastic.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think Newt is a fantastic person. I think Chris Christie is a fantastic person. He's been a friend of mine for 15 years. Just a fantastic person. And there is Mike. And Mike has done a great job as governor of Indiana. You look at the numbers. And it's been a great -- you know, he's done really a fantastic job.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So, you know -- but I haven't made a final, final decision.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. Well, let me go back to what's going on in Nice and this terrorism. What do you think that President Obama is going to be doing tonight about this, and contrast to what you would be doing tonight?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, the first thing he should do is say it's radical. If it is and it may not be. And so, you know, I want to preface that because -- for both of us, because you are in the same position as I am. But generally speaking, I don't think the people come out of Sweden, OK? It's probably, possibly but if it is indeed radical Islamic terrorism, it's about time that he would say so, OK? It's about time.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because you are never going to solve this problem unless you are going to define it. And it would be about time that people would die with relief if he would say it, but he doesn't want to say it. So let's see what happens. I mean, it just happened now. And let's see who did it and what it's all about. But if it is indeed again like in Orlando, like in San Bernardino, like in Paris, like in the World Trade Center, like so many other places, if it's radical Islamic terrorism, he ought to say it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And then what?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And then not let people in -- and then not let people into our country, Greta. We are taking people into our country. We don't know who they are. We can't let people from terrorist state and all of this people pour into our country because, you know, it only takes one or two people to create havoc. And we are allowing thousands of people.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have no idea who they are. We have to be tough. Look, somebody said it the other day that Trump is the law and order candidate. I'm the border candidate. I'm the great trade candidate. We will make great trade deals. But I am indeed the law and order candidate. And Hillary is weak and ineffective. She created ISIS with her stupid policies.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So, if this turns out to be yet another attack from radical Islam, then we're going to have to take our president is going to have to finally admit and do something about it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, thank you for joining us. This was not exactly what I planned on us talking about tonight, but obviously there is breaking news out of Nice. It takes, you know, front and center of all of our attention. [End Video Clip]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It is so sad to see, Greta. It's so sad and it's constant. It's constant. We don't do anything about it. We are weak and we are weakly led and ineffective. Thank you, Greta, very much.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Thank you, Donald.
<Buck Sexton> <Neutral> Have you reviewed the memos yourself? What do you expect them to show, if so?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have not reviewed them. I have been asked by many people in Congress as you know to release them. I have watched commentators that I respect begging the president of the United States to release them. We're sitting with one right here, we're sitting with two, you're right. More than once. And I have had many people ask me to release them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not that I didn't like the idea, but I wanted to wait. I wanted to see what, you know, where it was all going. And I think this whole, it's a hoax. You know Gregg Jarrett wrote a book called the Russian Hoax. It actually is a hoax. I call it a witch hunt, but it's a hoax. Beyond a witch hunt.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When you see the two lovers and you see their most recent texts come out. It is very, very sad for our country to look at that. When you see him talking about the leaks and then say, 'No we were trying to stop leaks in the FBI,' OK. That didn't work out because the following day others came out. But when you see the one about 'We have to get this while Andy is still there.'
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In other words, Comey was a bad guy. He gets fired. They only have Andy left because they know they're doing wrong. So, we have to get this while, Andy's, you know the one I'm talking about John.
<John Solomon> <Positive> Yes absolutely, it came out this week.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought that was terrible. And maybe I thought. And maybe it didn't pertain to me as much, but the one where he said, 'Great going Page, the story just hit' something to that effect. You'll quote it accurately, you know. But, and the other one I guess, Strzok, said 'great going.' And then he goes, 'now I can go and essentially investigate them.' In other words, he'll go up to a door of some person and say, yeah pretext.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And say, 'hey this story just appeared, what's going on.' I mean, number one, how illegal is it. But number two, how low is it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he's congratulating her just the way a lover would congratulate another. 'Way to go Page,' you know. The whole thing, and I thought that was disgraceful. I thought it was disgraceful and when you look at it, it all goes back to the insurance policy. One of the earlier ones because they thought she was going to win, but just in case she didn't win, we're going to have an insurance policy, and what we have now is an insurance policy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it's been totally discredited. Even Democrats agree, that it's been discredited. They are not going to admit that, but it's been totally discredited. And I think frankly more so by text than by documents. I think the texts, not only theirs, many others. So honestly Buck, I have been asked by so many people that I respect, please — the great Lou Dobbs, the great Sean Hannity, the wonderful, great Jeanine Pirro. [Laughs]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, she takes it so personally. And that's not, let's say they like me. But this is beyond liking me. They know that this is one of the great scandals in the history of our country. Because basically what they did, is they used Carter Page who nobody even knew, who I feel very badly for, I think he has been treated very badly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They used Carter Page as a foil in order to surveil a candidate for the presidency of the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And if you think about it, I've been under investigation, even though they say I'm not under investigation and I'm not a target. You do know I'm not a target and I'm not under investigation. But, this has been going on from seven months prior to the election. And then you had, the appointment of Mueller, who's highly conflicted.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Highly conflicted.
<Buck Sexton> <Negative> Mr. President, would you call this a deep state? People use that term.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't like to use it because it sounds so conspiratorial and believe it or not I'm really not a conspiratorial person. But I think it's a sad day for our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think that I hope to be able to put this up as one of my crowning achievements that I was able to do through the help of a lot of good people including you two, and all of the support we have. We have tremendous support by the way, to expose something that is truly a cancer in our country. When you look at the FBI, you know you have eight people or so fired now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And what we've done is a great service to the country, really. You know, I hope, I hope to be able to call this one of, along with tax cuts and regulations, and all of the things I've done. You know you've been seeing, you probably saw the news conference I just did.
<John Solomon> <Neutral> We did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're making great trade deals. In its own way, this might be the most important thing because this was corrupt. When you look at Bruce Ohr, whose wife was getting paid by people that did a totally phony deal. And they got a tremendous amount of money, the money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean the millions of dollars. And how about Papadopoulos who I didn't know other than I sat with him for 15 minutes at a table, unfortunately, where they have a picture of this. I never even talked to the guy. I didn't know who he was. And I didn't know, one thing I will say about Carter Page. He never went around saying he knew me. He never went around saying the president is my best friend.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They put him on some committee. Some person put him on some committee. They were both on the same committee.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that was not a good committee for me, OK. [Laughter] But they put him on the same committee and that was it. But he never went around talking about the president is my best friend. From day one he said, I never met the president. I didn't know the president, but I was put on his committee. And I say that.
<Buck Sexton> <Neutral> How much time has this taken up of your presidency by the way? The whole Russia thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It takes a lot. Because if I don't do it you know bad things can happen. I'll give you one thing and Papadopoulos. I didn't know him at all but once he, once he went public and I watched him, he was treated really badly. The guy with the tape recorder who got paid money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, he got paid a tremendous amount of money. I didn't know the FBI had the right to pay somebody like that. I mean that's. He got paid more than anybody at the FBI gets paid by a lot. Right?
<Buck Sexton> <Negative> I used to work at the CIA. I have some sense of what these guys get paid. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but you understand what they gave him. I mean I heard reports from $500,000 to $2 million.
<John Solomon> <Negative> Let me ask you, sir, if one of the issues is whether the FISA court's been misled. If it's later proven that people in the Justice Department misled the FISA court, are you prepared to take action against them in the Justice Department?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it looks to me like, just based on your reporting, that they've been misled. I mean, I don't think we have to go much further than to say that they've been misled because the dossier is a phony deal and so much of what's been done is just bad stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Um, one of the things I'm disappointed in is that the judges in FISA didn't, don't seem to have done anything about it. I'm very disappointed in that. Now I may be wrong because as we sit here and talk maybe they're, you know, maybe they're well into it and we just don't know that. Because I have purposely have not chosen not to get involved until just — all I want to do is be transparent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I could have fired everybody. I could've done many things. I've chosen not to do that. I don't know if that's wise or not wise, probably, you know, who knows?
<John Solomon> <Neutral> History will tell us.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Someday you'll tell me if that was right [Laughs] but um, so I'm very disappointed, unless they are doing it, that they have not taken very strong action, does that makes sense to you?
<John Solomon> <Neutral> It does.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because they've been abused by reporters. They've been, I mean, the FISA court has been laughed at and scorned by what's gone on here.
<John Solomon> <Negative> Without a doubt.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then you see 99.99 percent of the things get approved, it was supposed to be just the opposite I remember when they first started talking about the FISA court, you've learned a lot through what I've, you know, gone through. They were saying how tough it is to get to — then the report comes out like, 99.9 percent of the things that get in front of it, so they knew that and so they put fraudulent stuff in front of it.
<John Solomon> <Neutral> So, would you be open to a reform of the FISA court after all you've experienced on your case?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I have to see what they've done, John, they might be working, they might be really deep into it, and I only hope that's the case for the good of the country. Because they're reading the same articles by you guys and by others. Even the other side knows how wrong this whole thing is. They just can't write it. At some point I really believe they will.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know there's Pulitzer Prizes here. Big ones. This is, somebody was saying last night, this is the big, oh, Maria Bartiromo, she said it so beautifully, did you see her on Sunday — she said, "This is maybe the greatest scandal in the history of our country."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the fake news reporters will not pick it up. You can do something that's monument shaking and they just don't want to pick it up and at some point, you would think you would have to and it's getting to a point where they're starting to talk about it.
<Buck Sexton> <Negative> Mr. President, I want to switch gears for a second, you've got this upcoming Senate hearing on Monday. Do you have any concerns about the credibility of the accuser here? Do you have any concerns about getting Kavanaugh through on schedule and if so, do you have a contingency plan in place?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Can you give me an update because I just left the stage ... has she …
<Buck Sexton> <Negative> Do you have any concerns about the accuser's credibility?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let me do this before I do that — has she agreed to testify yet?
<John Solomon> <Neutral> Not yet, it's still an open question as of four o'clock.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a very big thing, if she doesn't. So, I have said right from the start and people have been very happy with what I've said that we have to let both sides speak, we have to take a look at his absolutely incredible record, a record like almost none other that I've seen. You know, between the schools, the intellect.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know I said yesterday, "not a blemish on his record." And you have to look at what she has to say. So, I don't want to comment on her until I see her.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> … The Democrats have had this letter for three months. They could have brought it up at the hearing during, you know, in course during the hearing. Dianne Feinstein knew all about it and if she knew about it that meant Schumer knew about it. And every Democrat knew about it. This is no different than the Russian witch hunt, what they've done is they make up a lot of stuff and try and obstruct and resist.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've always said that the Russia hoax was an excuse for them losing the election. Even though actually, amazingly that started seven months before. That started when it looked like I may have a chance to win, OK? But see that didn't do anything to me because I didn't know about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> One thing on that again, also, if they thought there was something with Russia, and I'm one of two people that are gonna be the president of the United States, they should have come to me and said, "Sir, you're dealing with people that may have something to do with Russia. We want to let you know." And I'd say, "I'm sorry whoever it may be, you gotta go, sorry."
<John Solomon> <Negative> They never did that, did they?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They never did it, no, they never did it. No, but wouldn't you think they'd say hey, you know there's two people that have a chance.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They, they should have come to me and said "Hey, you know we have an obligation," like they did with Dianne Feinstein with her driver. You have somebody that is possibly a Chinese spy, now she had the guy for 20 years. But they notify her, they don't investigate her. They notify her, and she immediately fires the guy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They certainly did it with Hillary Clinton. I mean what, that, that's the other thing that people are so upset about.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not only that it's fraudulent what they did, it's not only that you have the 17 angry Democrats, I mean look at these people. Look where they come from. Weissman, he was at Hillary Clinton's thing going crazy, OK? I call it the funeral. You know, it started off as the party and ended up being the funeral.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Going crazy. How can he possibly be allowed to do this? And how can you pick every single prosecutor as a Democrat? You would think even if you did have bad intentions, which he does, you would say let me get half and half, it's actually more effective.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK and as you know he has — Comey is his best friend. I had a very, very nasty business transaction with Bob Mueller, very nasty. You've heard about that, maybe. To me, that's — plus he wanted to be head of the FBI. And I didn't do that and the following day he's appointed special counsel. Those are three, unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, we have a nasty, business transaction. I'll tell you what, if I'm in business and I have a nasty business transaction with somebody, a hostile business transaction, and then I become a judge and 10 years later I meet that guy in court, I would try and be neutral but probably you're not able to be. He should be, he's conflicted, out.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Bob Mueller is totally conflicted.
<John Solomon> <Positive> There is something Rudy told me. Let's see if you remember it. He said that he began advising you in November-December 2016 to get rid of Comey based on his behavior on the Clinton investigation and you held off and gave him a chance, but it really wasn't about stopping Russia. It was about you didn't trust his judgment after seeing him in action.
<John Solomon> <Positive> Is that an accurate statement?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, it's accurate. If I did one mistake with Comey I should have fired him before I got here. I should have fired him the day I won the primaries. I should have fired him right after the convention. Say, 'I don't want that guy.' Or at least fired him the first day on the job. If I did one mistake it was, you know, I, I really did fire him, you know I fired him a couple of months in, so it's not like.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I would have been better off firing him or putting out a statement that I don't him there when I get there."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is on the record. Funny thing about Comey is that everybody hated Comey. The Democrats hated him far more than the Republicans until I announced that I was going to fire him. You go back — or that I did fire him. You go back and look at those statements. Podesta, I think, the day before said Comey should be fired.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Schumer was just brutal. To show you how horrible and political it is, in fact naively, when I fired him, I said, 'Finally I'm going to do something in a bipartisan way.' I thought I would be popular for the Democrats. I actually thought that firing James Comey, they hated him more than anybody. And so did the Republicans, because the Republicans viewed him as letting her get away with murder.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They viewed him a different way, but the Democrats hated him even more than the Republicans. Until I fired him. And then they made a decision, and all together, I guarantee you Schumer called them all fast and say 'We love Comey.'
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But honestly when I did it, I didn't do it for this reason, but when I did it, I really said this is one that's gonna be really popular also with the Democrats. And you know what? They're a bunch of phony obstructers and they all changed. The problem, the one thing they can't do is get rid of all their statements they made the day before, meaning in the days before.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because they went for a long period of time just, the hatred for Comey was probably as great or greater than almost anybody by the Democrats, and now they act like he's a saint. Although now they're not acting that way.
<Buck Sexton> <Negative> Mr. President, why haven't you replaced your attorney general, given all the things you've said and everything else that's come out about his actions, or inactions?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm so sad over Jeff Sessions because he came to me. He was the first senator that endorsed me. And he wanted to be attorney general, and I didn't see it. But he came very strongly he really wanted to be. And, I let him be.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then he went through the nominating process and he did very poorly. I mean, he was mixed up and confused, and people that worked with him for, you know, a long time in the Senate were not nice to him, but he was giving very confusing answers. Answers that should have been easily answered. And that was a rough time for him, and he won by one vote, I believe.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know he won by just one vote.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He won by one vote, and it's so sad what happened. Then he gets in and probably because of the experience that he had going through the nominating when somebody asked him the first question about Hillary Clinton or something he said 'I recuse myself, I recuse myself.' And now it turned out he didn't have to recuse himself.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Actually, the FBI reported shortly thereafter any reason for him to recuse himself. And it's very sad what happened. In the meantime, I don't have an attorney general. It's very sad. I'm not happy at the border, I'm not happy with numerous things, not just this.
<Buck Sexton> <Neutral> Are we going to get a wall Mr. President?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK, well, let me just finish this. We'll see what happens, I mean, we'll see what happens. A lot of people have asked me to do that. And I guess I study history, and I say I just want to leave things alone, but it was very unfair what he did. And my worst enemies, I mean, people that, you know, are on the other side of me, in a lot of ways including politically, have said that was a very unfair thing he did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, you've seen that, when he recused himself. So anyway, so, so we'll see how it goes with Jeff. I'm very disappointed in Jeff. Very disappointed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, we have started the wall. We got 1.6. We got another 1.6. We've fixed a lot of existing, we've started an 80-mile stretch. The entire Democrat life is to try and make sure we don't have a wall, not because we don't need it because we do. But because that was a promise that I made, and they want to try to make sure I don't deliver on that promise.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we have a majority of one in the Senate because we have the filibuster rule, which we shouldn't, um, you can't get 10 votes. In other words, Buck, we got a majority of one. We got to get to 60. So, 10 Democrats are controlling the Senate. We shouldn't have the filibuster rule. The first thing that Chuck Schumer would do if he ever took control of the Senate is get rid of the filibuster rule.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And for whatever reason and nobody can explain it, they just won't do it. Which means we need to get nine more, Republicans. So, it's very tough thing, even though we need it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I'll be doing things over the next two weeks having to do with immigration, which I think you'll be very impressed at. So, we are building the wall, I could build it — you know what I do best is build — I could build the whole thing in a year, but um, there was a picture that was sort of great. I wish I had it. I had a picture of where I was this weekend.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They built this gorgeous wall where the plane went down in Pennsylvania. Shanksville. And I was there. I made the speech. And it's sort of beautiful, what they did is incredible. They have a series of walls, I'm saying, "It's like perfect." So, so we are pushing very hard. As you know we've gotten approved in the House but the Senate cannot get it approved.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There are many things the Senate can't approve, you know, including Kate's law, including I could name many things. The problem is that with the filibuster rule they have to, they need 10 more Republicans elected. And I'm very opposed to that, but that's the way it is.
<John Solomon> <Positive> Do you still feel good about a red wave? Do you think you could pull that off?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think this — we probably have the greatest economy in history, so they've tried many narratives with me. You know, I took that test when I got my last physical, and the doctor said that's one of the highest scores we've ever seen. I did that not because I wanted but I did it, I was always good at testing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But if there's anything great about me it's stability, and I'm a good manager. Always been a good manager, but you know, I have a vision. And I had just beaten 17 — because it was actually 18, including Gilmore, just so you know. People say 17 but it was actually 18, you know he was the governor of Virginia, so it was 18. And I had just beaten 17 people including the Bush dynasty.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I then beat the Hillary Clinton dynasty. You can's give me credit for Bernie Sanders and all because I was part of it, but you know. So I beat the Bush dynasty, the Clinton dynasty, 17 people, and I never left center stage once, you can check. I never left center stage meaning I had lead in republican primaries from day one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I had, and I went through 14-12 debates, 12-debates before Hillary. And I never left center stage, and then they make up a thing, well, maybe he's losing it, maybe. No, I, I would know that so fast.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, when you start asking me questions maybe someday, and I say, 'Hmm I don't know those answers,' I may say, 'Well, it's time to hang it up, OK?' But the opposite, and I will say that the narrative, the different narratives, they've tried all different narratives. They've tried that, they tried, 'he's a dictator, he's a fascist.' One of them did, one of them did, 'he's losing it,' and the next week they went into, 'He's the most brilliant mind.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's taking over the country. He's a fascist, he's a dictator, and he's gonna make the eight years into life.' OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said wait a minute, last week, I was incompetent and now, I'm, you know, taking over the world. OK? It's incredible. It's sick. But, the various narratives that they do are just so bad, they're just so bad for the country. It's just really so bad. And they're such opposites in a sense. Like, if you take insurance they want single payer, which can't be afforded, and we want really great health care where people get a great price.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, really great stuff where people get a great price. I mean there are such differences, I could go on, on almost every subject. So, it's hard to bring everyone together unless there's a, maybe very large national problem, which we don't want. Maybe that brings people together, like it did for about a day with the World Trade Center, you know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the way the worst single mistake ever made in the history of our country — going into the Middle East by President Bush. Obama may have gotten 'em out wrong, but going in is to me the biggest single mistake made in the history of our country. Because we spent $7 trillion in the Middle East. Now if you wanna fix a window some place they say, "oh jee, let's not do it. $7 trillion and millions of lives — you know, 'cause I like to count both sides.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Millions of lives.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> To me is the worst single mistake made in the history of our country. Civil war you can understand. Civil war, civil war. That's different. For us to have gone into the Middle East, and that was just, that was a bad day for this country, I will tell you.
<John Solomon> <Negative> How do you convince people not to vote Democrat? What's your argument to say, keep Republicans in charge?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, to finish that, I think we're going to do much better than anyone thinks because the economy is so good, and people do like the job I'm doing. You know, they like the job, and to finish it off with just a little extra, when people say, you know, there's a lot of action going on, I'm going through an illegal witch hunt.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I didn't have that, you asked me a very good question before, do you spend much time on it? You have to spend time on it. I'm not supposed to be spending time on it. You know, part of this whole thing is that I'm not supposed to be spending any time on it. But I am.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Despite that, I think I've done more than any president in history. If you look at the things we have done, with the tax cuts, and all of the things that we've done, including hopefully now two Supreme Court justices, we'll have more judges put on than any other president other than one. Do you know who the one is? George Washington.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Percentage-wise. I'll have more than him, too, but percentage-wise [Laughs].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said that the other, you know I have 145 judges, plus hopefully two Supreme Court judges. And that's assuming nobody leaves the bench which they will over the next period of time. It'll be number one. I outta say, "Who has highest percentage of federal judges." They say, "you do." I'll say "no, no. I got killed." They said "who? George Washington because he appointed a hundred percent of the judges."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, Buck, I have, in addition to what I'm doing, I have this thing which I wanna run. I wanna manage, but this was used as an excuse, even though it actually started long before I won. You know, and we only found that out through the texts. This was a hoax before. But the Democrats used this as an excuse for having lost the election, when the Electoral College is totally their way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, I had to run the entire East Coast, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania. I had to win places that haven't been won in years. I won Wisconsin. I won Michigan. I had to run states that nobody thought were possible to do, except me, and some people and some pollsters, and some good pollsters.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Rasmussen was very good I have to tell you. So, you know, we're really happy with the job. And just in finishing I was just gonna say that, so they like to say, chaos in the White House. You're here. It's running so beautifully. And expect for the one area that you asked me about before, Mike Pompeo is a star, everyone of my Cabinet members is doing great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just have one group that's not been good. You know what that group is.
