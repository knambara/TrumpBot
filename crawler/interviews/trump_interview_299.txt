<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's right, Robin. And that's all cleared up. All right, look. We've got a busy show today.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Now let's get to something really important. Donald Trump is on the phone.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Donald Trump is on the phone again?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right. And he's not...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> We haven't talked to him in years, and now it's like once a week.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Mr. Trump fights back, too, you know. He...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What's going on?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Good morning.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very unimportant, actually, but...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Very important in your world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have such an audience, Howard. And everybody told me that Mark Cuban was on. And he said wonderful things about my family and myself, and it was all nice.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He did.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But he did say one thing that we should at least correct the record.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> He said that his show, whatever the hell it's called.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Shark Tank.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Shark Tank.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Really not his show. He's one of four or five people on the show. You know the difference, right? As opposed to the superstar that's known as Trump. Totally different.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, you make a point...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They actually called me the King of All Media. I said, no. I have -- somebody wrote an article and said I'm the King of All Media. And I actually wanted a retraction. I said there's only one King of all media, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But you make a point. Your show, The Apprentice -- well, let's back up. Mark Cuban was on the other day. He was talking -- we were talking about years ago, he had a show that was very similar to The Apprentice.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Called The Benefactor.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> The Benefactor.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Which was really a knock-off of The Apprentice.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And you got on there...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There were 16 of them, by the way, so he shouldn't feel bad because we had 16 knock-offs. We had one the other day that died. It was called The Job. It was on CBS, and it died after 2 shows.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Which I know pleases you because your...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I love it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Your show was the original version.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. I love it, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And you love then the original, so Mark Cuban was trying to be a show like yours. And you even said on the air to me, his show won't work, you know. And it sounds like sour grapes, blah, blah, blah. But meanwhile, you were right. The show went off the air.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Mark did something that was a little bit rough because he went out. And you know, I've gotten along with Mark over the last year or so, but he went out with his show, The Benefactor, and he really went after me. You know, instead of saying, hey -- and I spoke to him recent -- you know, before the show went out, and he was totally nice. And you know some idiot told him to go and attack Trump. This way, you'll get publicity for The Benefactor. So he went after me. Naturally, of course, I go then after him.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What did he say at the time [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, you know. My show is going to be better. It's going to be bigger. It's going to be this and that, you know. Meantime, I had, like, the #1 show on television.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And you felt like you had your back up against the wall and you had to defend yourself.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I had to defend myself, Howard. I've watched you do that all your life. I've watched you [Inaudible].
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes. And for years -- so years go by, Mark Cuban does get on Shark Tank. Shark Tank is, as you say, an ensemble cast. It is not his show
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well, don't go so fast. So benefiter -- The Benefactor goes on, and it's a total bomb. And I wrote Mark a very nasty letter. It was really nasty. It was terrible. And then I heard he has that letter framed. I think it was a terrible letter.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He says the letter is framed on his desk.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was an all-time classic Trump letter.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What did you write? Do you recall?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. Just terrible.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What did you say?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Terrible. I can't imagine. I wouldn't say. But I would have tried to -- I would have burned it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know why saved it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I know. It's motivation. I think that's cool.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, it's a motivator.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I think that's cool. I mean, I was surprised that he did it. But I heard about it. I thought it was very cool. Anyway, we've gotten along very well over the last year or so. And The benefactor goes off, and then all of a sudden, Shark Tank comes on. So Shark Tank goes on during the week, you know, which is much more important than a Friday night, and it totally bombs. So they think they're going to terminate Shark Tank. And what they do is they put it on Friday night as a little bit of a filler. You know, Friday night is called death valley.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I see.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know that. You know, you have a show on Friday night, it's not a good thing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it sort of -- it did okay for a Friday night. It actually did better than a Friday night than it did during the week. Because during the week, it was a total bomb. They thought they were going to have to take it off. And what happens is it did okay. And that was it. So -- and it's doing okay on Friday night. But Friday night is not a television night. So what if -- maybe they should move it back to a real night, see how it does. So Mark goes on your show, said nice things, but then he did make the statement that the show, Shark Tank, which, again, is a show of four or five people that go -- you know, do different things, that it did better in the ratings. And I said, "whoa
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I knew it didn't. I mean, you know, I knew that, but -- so I called up the Nielsen people. You know, I have people that do this. And they called up the Nielsen and the NBC Universal people, and I sent you a little copy of the Nielsen ratings, where basically, we kill them.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I see.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, if you're going to do this, not only kill them, but we're the 13th season. This isn't a brand-new show.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> After -- you know, you look at what happens with American Idol. You know, in the first season, we were beating American Idol. And in the first season, we were the, on many evenings, the #1 show and -- on television. And that was a great honor and all that stuff. But we did very well. But this is the 13th season. And not only did we beat them, you know, we're looking at last season because this is just going on, on Sunday night. I hope all your viewers and listeners are going to watch it. But what happened, not only did we beat it, but we had to go up against the Academy Awards last year. How would you like a show that goes up -- they programmed it incorrectly.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, it's a show open against the Academy Awards. I said, "you know
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So your point is that...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just like the truth.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You want the truth...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm an extremely truthful person.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Some people would say, why does this matter to you? But I think everything matters.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Everything matters to me.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Everything matters to you. Things get under your skin.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Every -- not under my skin, no. You know what, if -- let's say I was -- let's say he beat me in the ratings...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would say -- I wouldn't be calling you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'd call you but I wouldn't be talking about that. I'd try and get off that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You'd try to keep it quiet.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I've tried -- I did. I sort of -- but when it's incorrect and when Nielsen -- I mean, Nielsen is the king in terms of this, whether we like them or don't like them, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And that Nielsen has been very truthful over the years about The Apprentice, and The Apprentice is a monster. And you know, that's why for -- you know, it's on in like 80...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> So what do you want to say to Mark Cuban?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nothing. I just -- no, I'll tell you what I just want to say...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He just wants to set the record straight.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was so nice to my children and to me and so respectful, and talking about how my children are amazing and all that stuff. So I don't -- you know, I don't want to say anything. I think he's, you know, I think it's fine.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why don't you buy a basketball team and beat his basketball team?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, ask every one of my friends who owns a basketball team, they're miserable.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hey.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They don't sleep at night or sports day. I mean, I see these guys. You know, George Steinbrenner, as you remember, was one of my best friends.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You want to see a miserable evening, go to George to a baseball game, I tell you. [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. He loves to be [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Negative> This is worse.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I used to say, it was exhausting to sit with George in a game. If Derek Jeter didn't get a home run, he'd say, Donald, I'm telling you, he's no good. George was brutal. He was brutal.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You don't want to live your life like that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the truth is, these guys live and die by victories. Most of them lose. You know, most of them don't do a very good job, and I see it. And they say -- you know, they're just really miserable. They live and die. And with all the teams, there's only one team that's going to win ultimately.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right. I know. It's not good odds.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> And they're very unhappy people. So...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you dealing...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Donald did try to get into the sports game at one point. Remember that knee [ph]
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh, yes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, I've had a lot -- and you know, don't forget -- well, at 5 quarters, chief of football, you know, I figured I could get into the NFL [Inaudible]. So...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right, right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was really one of those harassment deals, when you can get into the NFL for no money. You know that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. Well, you try and you see what happens.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I -- yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you own...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You know -- but I've been -- I've had more Mike Tyson fights than anybody else. I have a lot of fights. And I'm very much involved in sports in a lot of ways.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do you own Miss Teen...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> USA.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I own Miss Teen and I own Miss USA, and Miss Universe. I own the pageant.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So the big news this week was that Miss Teen Delaware was in a porno.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. And we had to tell her to get a letter of resignation very quickly, yes.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Why, though? Why?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Well...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She was in a porn.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So what?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible] question.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You know, you think about it. Think about our country.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So what?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Kim Kardashian's a big star because she was in a tape. Paris Hilton was in a tape.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do you think Kim Kardashian is beautiful?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No. I mean...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Do you think she's good looking?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I think she has a beautiful face.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You think so, okay?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I don't like that big trunk.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she's got a huge trunk.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. What do you make of that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's seriously big.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. So what do you think of her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think she's a very nice person. She was on The Apprentice. So I think she's a very nice person.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. So I understand that. But I'm saying...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, no. I think she's a very nice person. Howard -- you know looks, though. I'm not that kind of a person. Looks don't matter to me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> The looks of a woman, they don't matter.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They don't matter, matter. They don't matter at all.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now that he's married.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> No, they don't matter. I don't look at them look through their beauty. I look at women for what's inside. Okay, Howard?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay. But what kind of porno was she on, by the way?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you see the porno?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I didn't see it. Now what happened is, Miss Teen USA, a very, you know, lovely young woman...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it's hard to say, I don't look at looks, and yet, I own the Miss Universe.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's what I mean. I can't believe you're for real.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sort of. Well, I'm trying to be very politically correct.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, this is a world of being politically correct. And -- which is destroying our country, by the way. Everyone's so politically correct, you can't...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You can't even call anyone fat anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You can't call anybody fat.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You can't.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They accused me. I actually -- they said that I called Rosie O'Donnell a big, fat slob. And I said, "that's not right. I didn't use the word fat.'' And -- but I've got..."
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're still angry with her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I don't care about Rosie. Rosie's is gone. I mean, Rosie is -- I mean, she's gone.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I like her.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You do, really?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, I really do. I've had her to my home. We have dinner together.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's exciting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, if Rosie's finally says something nice about Donald, Donald will feel that, though, right? Because you're a guy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm going to bring you guys together.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It doesn't matter. Don't bother. It's okay. But I've been through --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm going to bring you together.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's just fine. I don't really think about her, to be honest. But what happens is the young woman from the Miss Teen USA, beautiful young woman, got very much involved with the whole porno deal, and she actually -- you know, we suggested it to her because it's nicer. But she actually was -- you know, she gave her letter of resignation. You know, that system, that beauty pageant system, people don't give it enough credit. It's an amazing system. These parents, the way these girls, some of -- you know, most of them are grown. I mean, it's amazing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How does it work, though? Do you...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Like a military regimen.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes, but how does it work? Did she try to cover -- like -- she was in a porn, obviously, years ago or something?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She was in a porn, and it did came out. And because she...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It couldn't have been years ago. She's not that old.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Within the world of the beauty pageants, Miss Teen USA, that's, you know, potentially a Miss Universe candidate and Miss Universe.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, in some countries, like in South America, if you become Miss Universe, you don't pay taxes for the rest of your life. You know, there's no bigger -- in Venezuela, as an example, and we had Diana Mendoza, you remember the great Diana Mendoza 2 seasons ago at The Apprentice, how beautiful she was. She was like the most beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Super hot.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But again, I didn't notice that. Anyway... But you know that in Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, if you become Miss Universe, you're like the biggest star. You're bigger than any soccer star. You're bigger than them. That's the biggest thing. So it's...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But explain to me how it works. So does she try to, like, hide the fact that she was in a porno. And then like you guys discover it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We don't know whether or not she hid it, but it came out. And the problem is, because she's, you know, Miss Teen USA, you know, all of a sudden, she has a lot of notoriety. And probably one of her friends that's jealous of her, because that's the way life works, everyone's jealous. They're all jealous of you, Howard. You know, they all kiss your ass, and then they, behind your back, they say you're terrible.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But what was she thinking being in a porno?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I don't know what because it was before she did this.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Was it a home tape?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> She didn't know she was going to be Miss Teen USA.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She didn't know. I mean, she should -- she'll do porn, she'll make some money, and then she'll become Miss Teen USA, unrelated, and that's what happened. She won Miss Teen USA...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Will you watch the porno? I want to see it because...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you should. Will you call me and let me know how good it is?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're going to watch it. Because you know what, she must be insanely hot. When do you see a girl that insanely hot in porn?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she's supposed to be very beautiful. I mean, I've met her once quickly. But she's supposed to be very beautiful. But she got involved, and she actually offered her letter of resignation and we had to accept it. You would not have. You would not have accepted it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Oh, no. I would have made her [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You would have said; "you're a double with her
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well, if she hadn't resigned, what would you have done? Would you have just fired her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we probably would have had to. You know, it's a very unique system. I mean, these -- the parents would have gone nuts. The people that -- and it's a big -- you know, I look at the different magazines, and I see how they're dying, right? They're just dying.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. It's over.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You look at pageant, did you ever hear of a word magazine pageantry?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's the things like [Torches]. You never saw anything like it?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm heterosexual. Of course, I've never.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, okay, pageantry. But it's a magazine on beauty pageants.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it's, like, through the roof. And it's just amazing. It's a big deal. And she did this and she was forced to -- and she was asked to, but she resigned. And she did the right thing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did your Twitter account get hacked?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, it got hacked.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How does that happen?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Somebody -- well, you know, you've got a lot of geniuses out there, and I have a hot Twitter account @realDonaldTrump. Will you tell your people to hook in? So @realDonaldTrump.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Isn't it crazy to you that, like, somebody that smart is busy wasting their time, hacking into your Twitter?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. It doesn't do them any good. They may get them arrested. You know, it's like crazy. So we're looking at it...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> If you had that ability, wouldn't you spend every minute, like, inventing stuff and becoming very wealthy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they hooked in and they put a quote from Little Wayne on my account.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> On your account?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And for 10 minutes, I was really ridiculed. You know, all the enemies that Trump has lost though that this was something to do with the hoes. And all women are hoes. So you know, I just -- the thing came out, and I'm going to have like, in a very short period of time, over 3 million people. And it's a big deal.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I think they pick up 20, 000 to 25, 000 sometimes a month. And you know, just going through the...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How many tweets do you do a day?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I just thought [Inaudible]. Mine's new compared to some of these. What?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How many Twitter followers does Mark Cuban have?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know. I didn't check.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Don't you -- you have to check.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hope he has a lot. I didn't check.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Don't you check every day to see if you have more followers than Mark Cuban?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. But I have other people that I do check that with.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And you tweet...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know. I do have other people. And not only that...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who do you check?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who do you check?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have very important followers. I have, you know, haters. And I have losers, and I have reporters, and I have -- everybody's on mine.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But I know you. You must have actually researched this whole Twitter thing. And you probably have people who know how to cultivate it and how to, like, you know, handle this Twitter.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have great people. But you know what? More importantly, well, it's my thought. I mean, it's my thoughts. Nobody else will give thoughts like this. And you know, I don't know if that's good or bad, but it is my thought. Like for instance, the pope. Why is he -- he should just [Inaudible] and die.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Ride it out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He looks so bad. Everyone is saying, what did he do wrong? You know, they said, "it wasn't the first time."" I said
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But the pope should just sort of sit back and enjoy and relax.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Of course.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Put some other people an run it and you die. You know, I'm used to watching old popes, like Pope John. I mean, the guy couldn't even walk. He was bent over like a pretzel.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he cool.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But the thing is, Donald, you must imagine that something very bad is forcing him out of office.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, no. He was probably -- there probably was. But I don't know. This pope didn't resonate, a little bit like Mitt Romney.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Mitt Romney should have won the election. And I liked them. And I do like him. He's a nice man, but he didn't resonate.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. He doesn't -- you don't warm up to this pope?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I like Mitt Romney, and I call them the same. This pope didn't resonate. First of all, he comes from Germany. Somehow, you know -- hey, I'm part German. You know, a German pope. I'm not sure that worked.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What do you think of the New Black Pope maybe? That might be a big deal.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That'd be very exciting. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Donald wants to see a birth certificate.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Do you want to see a birth certificate on the black pope?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That would be very exciting.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That'd be exciting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, but listen, on the Twitter -- still on the Twitter. So it's like, I'll have 3 million, 4 million people within whatever period of time, right? So for a year, millions of people. So essentially, I own more than the New York Times by a lot.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I don't have to sustain the losses.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's true.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, the New York Times used to have a lot of power. Now it's a whole different thing, and it loses its sass. You know, the newspaper business is going to be over very soon. When people see me reading in this paper, like my kid, Ivanka, comes in, she said, "Daddy
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What is that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She doesn't understand what I'm doing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know. It's...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're getting your hands dirty with that, said, "Why are you doing that
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Don't you -- isn't there something you love about still holding a newspaper in your hand?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. I think we're old fashioned.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Me, too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Me, too. But you get about 10 years younger, it's like they look at us like, forget it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hey, do you lay in bed and watch the Oscars? And do you tweet during the Oscars?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I did this time, and I got...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you laying in bed with your wife when you were watching the Oscars?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Generally speaking, yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Were you completely nude and she was nude?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, let's not comment on that. But she has -- at least she has a great figure.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Do you did your tweet, we're here completely nude.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. But we won't comment to that, but she has a great figure. But I did tweet on the Oscars, and I...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. You didn't like the Oscars so much.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought they were -- I think I didn't -- first of all, I thought the set was terrible. It was so tacky. It was disgusting. I really thought Seth MacFarlane was fine.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought that -- I don't liked him. You know, he did me on the Comedy Central roast. They roasted the hell out of me, by the way.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. I remember it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was the guy, and he was terrific. It was terrific then, but it could really be -- Seth, he was held back. Even though they said he went too much, he was held back.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I thought that there was a lack of glamour. I mean, even the woman who won, she falls down the stairs. You know, that's not glamorous.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And that dress. I mean...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Come to think of it. Think of it. In the old days, Vivian...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They knew how to do it.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But you know, you're right, in a way.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> [Inaudible] did not fall. [Inaudible] didn't -- was fine.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're right. Her falling down was sort of the symbol, if you will, of the whole thing falling apart.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. The whole -- no, I thought it was fine, but I didn't find -- and I tweeted it. I said, where is the glamour? Because I'm a romantic. People wouldn't know that about me, but I'm a major romantic. But I said, "where is the glamour? Where is the beauty?""There's no beauty. There's no glamour."
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why can't I warm up to that Anne Hathaway? I find her annoying.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what. I'll tell you what, it's going to happen. She lived in Trump Tower. I like all people that live in my building.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Anybody that lives in my building, even if they're really unattractive, I consider them to be beautiful.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right, right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So what happens is she lives in my building. She lived there with the Italian scoundrel. You know the scoundrel?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh yeah, yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we didn't know. He paid his rent on time until the very end. He was one of those. But she got lucky when she got rid of this guy. But she lived in my building so I got to see her up close and personal. I wasn't a fan at all, but she's grown on me. You know, it's like the Mona Lisa. A lot of times, you have a painting. Friends of mine that really do the paintings, big league, a lot of times they won't like it, but in the end, they almost fall in love with it. They're like infatuated with it. They can't leave. I mean, they become sickos. They want to sit in a room and look at paintings.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She's a terrific actress, but when she makes those speeches...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Nobody can [Inaudible] you, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But no, when she makes those speeches with, oh my god. It's very...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that's all phony rehearsed stuff.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It's all actress-y to me, you know?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, when they get up and they want to thank people, and they forget, and they don't really forget but they want to make it like it's a big deal because they're so excited, it's all bullshit.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You know why I disagree with you on?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I feel this movie, Django Unchained, was one of the greatest movies of all.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No, I didn't think so.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you watch it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm with you, Donald.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Wait a second. Did you watch it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was a movie that -- first of all --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Donald loves movies.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, for those of us --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> It's great, and it's not racist.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] but like the sick kid up in Massachusetts, that was up Canada, a whacko kid, that dirty, whacko kid... Lan -- was it Lanceworth?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Now if a kid like this is going to see this movie, you know, here, a little bit off to start off with, that movie it's not good for people to see. Okay. Because I've never seen a movie where so many bodies exploded as a bullet hit them.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I mean, that was -- I've never seen a movie that bad in terms of that. And you know, I just thought it was terrible movie. I thought it was a totally racist movie.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. How -- why would you say that?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It's not racist.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, i thought it was racist.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'll tell you why it's not racist.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> First, he had the white guys killing the blacks. Then you have black guys killing the whites -- I thought it was a terribly racist movie, and I thought it was really vicious and really -- I thought it was -- you know, these people to talk about gun control and should we have guns and shouldn't we have guns. But when you look at that movie, that movie can really screw up some kids that's [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I admire that movie, and I'll tell you why. It reminded me, even though it's a fantasy, it reminded me that our country was based on something so horrible, so horrific as slavery. And that if anything, it had the opposite effect on me. It made me feel more empathic with the black life.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Well, I didn't like it, and I thought it was a totally racist movie, so what are you going to do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Wow.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I think you're very -- you're reaching, Howard. You're saying that movie did that for everyone. That did that for you and no one else.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm surprised. I'm a little surprised.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It was totally...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Howard is trying to be politically correct.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Not at all.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Absolutely.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I return -- I was at -- halfway...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> Halfway through the movie, I turned my wife and I said, "Quentin Tarantino is a genius
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because you're adding something to the movie that's not there.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Bullshit. You're all crazy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Trying to be politically correct.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He's being outrageous.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Robin, this is going to be a headline tomorrow [Inaudible] and the Daily News.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm not trying to be politically correct.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This would be headline tomorrow: Howard Stern tries to polite -- because...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No!
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How long have you been [ Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donald, this is how I really feel.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> First time ever that he's been politically correct.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> No. I'm telling you my really -- my true belief. I've always been honest.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] written this movie, Howard, and it was a shitty movie, in my opinion. I...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Probably the best movie that's ever made.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It was totally just a revenge movie. That was -- it was nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought it was a nothing movie. And I thought -- you know, when a bullet hits the body, the body doesn't have to explode for 2 blocks away. You know what? The whole thing was disgus -- and that happened, like, hundreds of times. I thought it was disgusting. And I thought it was very bad for young people to see that movie because I think it can really influence them.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you have sex during the Academy Awards?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No. I didn't.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> When was the last time you had sex?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He paid a [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> When is the last time you had sex with your wife?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let's see, what time is it?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Come on, be honest.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What time is it, Robin? Be honest.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Be honest.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I won't say that, but I have a great...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Has it really been that long?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a great wife. I do. I have a great wife, a beautiful wife. She was on the cover of Avenue Magazine. She's been on many, many covers, including Bogue. She's a great person.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Will we ever see her --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And a very nice person.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Will we ever see her doing nude layout?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think so.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's a shame.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I tend to doubt it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Very sexy woman.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I tend to doubt it. I think if we do, I will not be a happy camper.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And that woman stays in shape, man.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, she's in shape. You know -- but she's naturally in shape. It's not a big work at all or anything, which is nicer, to be honest.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, she knows with you, she's got to stay in shape. She [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I saw a woman the other day. She's in shape, but then I touched her arm, and it was like, you know, makes a steel.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't like that. You know, she's naturally in good shape. Absolutely. She's a very beautiful woman. Considered one of the great beauties of the world. So I don't know how I got her because, you know, beauty doesn't matter to me.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> That's right. Yeah, you...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I told you that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Did you wake up wondering, oh my god, she's actually beautiful.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. [Inaudible] what happened.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You fell in love with her personality first.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Fell in love with her heart.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, listen to me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I fell in love with her soul. So listen, Howard. You know I'm going to do the Today Show now, so I have to run. But I will tell you see -- see who I do first? I do our Howard first, then Robin.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. Who will...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Is Robin so important to you, Howard? Do you have any idea how lucky you are, Howard?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I thank God every day.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I mean, you know, Robin is just great. She's got such a way.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Aww...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She's fantastic.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, that's true. And I mean -- I've it a long time ago [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She is fantastic.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You know, this is not a major breaking story, but she is [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're absolutely right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do love her. So Howard, I just wanted to call you up. The Nielsen ratings. And you look at The Apprentice versus that other show, Shark Tank, which is fine, by the way. I think it's fine. But if you look -- The Apprentice blows it away. Do you have Nielsen ratings in front of you?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I have it in front of me.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You confirm that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I am confirming it right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. We love you.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> By the way, answer this one question. How old is Melani allowed to get before you cut off her age?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd love to give you an answer there, Howard, because I could -- but then if it becomes a headline, then I'm -- so I would say this. We -- when she's 80, 90, I would still consider her a great beauty and a great wife.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. I think this marriage is going to last. I always said it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she's very strong and very nice. I mean, she understands me. She gives me my space, which I really need.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> See Donald Trump on All-Star Celebrity Apprentice premiering this Sunday night at 9:00 on NBC. That's very important to get out there.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, it is. It is.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know -- one quick story on Melani because I have a couple of minutes. They just told me, but one quick sec because I do love this show. One quick sec. So Tom Cruise calls me, and he wants to go to the Wellman's skating rink. So I call up Melania. I said, can you believe it? Tom Cruise called. Do you believe it? She goes, but why do you tell me this? You are a much bigger star than him. [Inaudible]. He is nothing.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Wow.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He was just a movie star, grew up to be the biggest star in the world. There is no bigger star.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's amazing.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> She knows how to get you hard.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And so I go, look, I said, "Really? Do you believe that?""""Yes. Of course."" Why are you even wasting my time by telling me about Tom Cruise? And I say
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She loves. She does.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, and I love you, guys. And take care of yourselves. And I just want to set the record straight.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who will be interviewing you on the Today Show?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Matt Lauer.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right. Very good.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> So long.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So long.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Bye, bye.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> The wonderful and vivacious Donald Trump, who reminds us that he is beating Mark Cuban in the ratings even still.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> It's amazing to me that he takes that kind of move and has that kind of attention to detail.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He cares.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It's part of what's made him who he is.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He cares. He honestly does.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, he protects his brand.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He sure does.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> And he doesn't even want anybody out there thinking what Mark Cuban said.
