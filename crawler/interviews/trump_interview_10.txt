<Kari Lake> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you so much for having us --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
<Kari Lake> <Positive> -- and welcome back to Arizona.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I love Arizona.
<Kari Lake> <Neutral> How does it feel to be back here?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's something special. We won this state, and it was my first -- my first speech as a candidate, as you remember, in the convention center, and it was a tremendous success. So we -- I love this state.
<Kari Lake> <Negative> People really took notice after that. Did you feel that there was something special there that day?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we came and we had 50,000 people, and it held a lot less of that. It was packed, and they had a lot of people outside, just like this -- this is even a bigger crowd today. But, people started saying, well that's a heck of a crowd. And that was actually my first speech as a potential candidate. So, it was something very special.
<Kari Lake> <Negative> People took notice. I have to ask you about something and you just retweeted it. When we got here a few hours ago when we saw the most amazing thing it was a couple men -- President Trump supporters -- and they were carrying down a World War II veteran and, I got a lump in my throat. A lot of people were crying when they saw that, yet your supporters get a pretty bad rap out there by some.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh really? No kidding. I saw the clip on television as I was coming in on Air Force One, and I saw them taking a vet, who was an older guy and a wonderful looking guy, and they were carrying him to the front row, and I saw that happen. I thought it was beautiful. I thought it was really beautiful. Why, is somebody giving that a bad rap?
<Kari Lake> <Positive> I hope not --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can't imagine that one. That would be -- but you never know --
<Kari Lake> <Positive> I know -- I know some some of your supporters have been called names, and I'm sure that doesn't make you feel very good when they do that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, no. Our supporters. We have tremendous support and tremendous supporters and our supporters get ahead of themselves very well. That's for sure.
<Kari Lake> <Negative> Well, there's a lot of them here tonight. I got to ask you about something that's on a lot people's mind, and that is the Coronavirus. How confident are you that China is being 100 percent honest with us when it comes to this scary virus?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm confident that they're trying very hard. I mean, I know President Xi -- I get along with him very well. We've just made a great trade deal, which is going to be a lot of business for Arizona and every other place. But, they are trying very, very hard, and I think the numbers are going to get progressively better as we go along.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're working it -- they built they built a hospital in seven days, and now they're building another one. I think it's going to work out fine. I think when we get into April, in the warmer weather, that has a very negative effect on that and that type of a virus. So let's see what happens, but I think it's going to work out fine.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think they're working very hard. I spoke to President Xi, and they are really working hard at it.
<Kari Lake> <Negative> So you're not losing sleep over that, but do you lose sleep over many things? If so, what do you lose sleep over?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't get that much sleep to start off with, so I don't want to lose too much sleep. But, I try not to. The economy is doing phenomenally well. Our country is doing fantastic. We've rebuilt our military. You look at what's happened with our vets. The vets have been, you know, the vets are in love with what we're doing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We got Veterans' Choice. We got Veterans' Accountability. We're protecting our Second Amendment. We cut our taxes at the highest level ever done. And the Democrats want to raise taxes, which is something maybe someday they'll explain, because nobody can explain it. But they want to raise taxes. We cut taxes and we cut regulations, and the country is doing great.
<Kari Lake> <Positive> I got to ask you about one thing affecting young people, and it's the student loan crisis.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, yeah.
<Kari Lake> <Negative> There's so many loans out there that people feel they're underwater, and they can't escape that. Is there any -- I know that they are -- they seem to be gravitating towards the Democrats, because they are talking about it, and providing solutions, maybe not what everybody wants which is forgiveness. But I don't hear Republicans talking about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, a lot of people don't like that. We're -- we're -- well, we are talking about it, and we're doing things about it. You know that was set up by President Obama as a subsidy for Obamacare, and which a lot of people don't understand, and it turns out to be a disaster. There's a tremendous default rate, and we're going to be doing something on it. The Democrats are talking, but they're never going to be able to do it because they can't get it through Congress, whereas I've gotten everything through Congress, whether it's criminal justice reform -- which everybody said couldn't be done, and many other things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we're going to be working on that very hard. It's a big -- it's a big issue, and it's a very tough issue for students, so we're going to do something really good. We will be announcing it in the not too distant future.
<Kari Lake> <Positive> Uh, okay. Thank you so much President Trump and we appreciate your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We can do another one. It's alright.
<Kari Lake> <Negative> Well, one of the things I want -- we have -- there's a saying that you see a lot on social media in Calif -- in Arizona, which is Don't California our Arizona. We're seeing a lot of people coming in from California.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Kari Lake> <Negative> -- and it's really changed the demographics, for better or for worse.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Kari Lake> <Neutral> How is that going to change the demographics for the people voting for you? Are we going to be a blue state? Are we going to be a purple state?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I won Arizona pretty easily last time, and I think that a lot of the people that are coming in are somewhat conservative. It's very interesting. They're coming in from California by the droves. They've been driven out of California by crazy policies. You look at San Francisco. You look at Los Angeles with the terrible homeless problem, and they're not taking care of it. But look at the streets and look what's going on. They're coming to Arizona.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think it's a conservative group that's coming to Arizona too. And we're doing fantastically with the Hispanics, as you know, and this is -- you have a lot of Hispanics, and we're doing really great with Hispanics, and we're giving you border protection, which is what you have to have.
<Kari Lake> <Positive> Well, this looks pretty full out there tonight.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is packed.
<Kari Lake> <Positive> And, you know, Elvis Presley, performed here. Nirvana, they filled it up, so you're probably in pretty good company.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think -- we broke all records tonight, they say, and there's thousands of people outside that can't get in. So look, it's been a great state from day one for me, and we love the people of Arizona.
<Kari Lake> <Positive> Excellent. Do you think -- who's going to win the debate on the Democrat side tonight?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well we're watching. We'll see about mini Mike. We're going to see -- I know him, and he's not -- he's not a debater. But it's going to be interesting. Bernie Sanders seems to have a big advantage now. The polls that just came out seem to have him with the biggest advantage for winning the whole thing. But we'll see what happens.
<Kari Lake> <Negative> If -- if he doesn't win, do you think you can take some of his supporters.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think last time we did. I think we will. The last time we had a lot of Bernie Sanders supporters. I think if they take it away from him like they did the last time, I really believe you're going to have -- you're gonna have a very riotous time in the Democrat Party, because they really -- they did a lot of numbers on him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think she actually won it, but it was very close, and then they had the superdelegates, and they took a lot of things away. They took a lot of liberties. I think if they do that again this time, you can have a really very difficult -- they can have a very difficult time. I hope they have a difficult time anyway, because nobody's done the job that we've done.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Our country is doing great.
<Kari Lake> <Positive> Are you feeling really good about this tonight --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. I really do.
<Kari Lake> <Positive> -- and when -- and when you come into a crowd like this, what does it feel like to step on that stage?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, when you see an arena like this, it's a big arena and it's packed, and you have thousands of people outside trying to get in, we have movie screens up, I don't know, it's a great feeling. To me it's a great feeling.
<Kari Lake> <Neutral> And your family is here with you tonight, part of 'em?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're here. Part of my family's here, and they're out there and they're cheering us on.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Mr. President, thanks so much for being with us tonight.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Laura.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Today, Mike Pompeo gave a very forceful press conference on the fallout from the Iranian jetliner going down. His concern is that people aren't understanding the imminent nature of the threat of Soleimani, and he was pressed on that today. He said there were large-scale attacks planned on U.S. facilities, but he didn't go more specific.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Don't the American people have the right to know what specifically was targeted without revealing methods and sources?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't think so, but we will tell you that probably it was going to be the embassy in Baghdad. You saw that happening. You saw with all of the men, very few women, circling it and circling it very strongly and very viciously, knocking out windows and trying to get and they were close to getting in, and I called out the military.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They said we'll have it there tomorrow. I said, nope, you'll have it there today. We're not going to have another Benghazi on our hands. And we did a really amazing job. I get no credit for it, but we never get credit for anything, and that's OK. In the meantime, we have the greatest economy we've ever had, a lot of other things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I think you would have had another Benghazi had we not acted quickly. That could have been stopped, and this was stopped. And we had our Apaches going there, the great helicopters, and they were dropping flares all over the place, and a lot of things were happening. They had acted real fast and everybody disappeared.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Did they have large scale attacks planned for other embassies? And if those were planned, why can't we reveal that to the American people. Wouldn't that help your case?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can reveal that I believe it would have been four embassies. And I think that probably Baghdad already started. They were really amazed that we came in with that kind of a force. We came in with very powerful force and drove them out. That ended almost immediately. But Baghdad certainly would've been the lead.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I think it would've been four embassies that had been military bases -- could've been a lot of other things too, but it was imminent. And then all of a sudden he was gone.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Why is Nancy Pelosi describing her briefing as dismissive and disdainful? Mike Lee said it was insulting, the Intel briefing. What wasn't said to mollify the concerns of some of your strongest supporters like Mike Lee?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, he is a great supporter. He's a friend of mine. He called me just a little while ago and he said I just wanted to get some more information. And he was -- look, I have also had calls from some of the senators; some of the congressmen said it was the single best briefing. One person said they have been there for 10 years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's the single best briefing they've ever had. One said 20 years, the single best military briefing they've ever had. I understand what Mike had, Mike wanted certain things said and we just couldn't say and we could probably say maybe individually to him. And he's certainly a trustworthy person.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Are you worried that the Democrats can't be trusted with classified information? Because that's kind of what it sounded like when Pence gave that interview and talked about sources and methods the other day.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am worried about it, certainly. I am worried about it. Can you imagine? Here we are, split-second timing, executed -- like nobody's seen in many, many years -- on Soleimani? Can you imagine they want us to call out and speak to crooked corrupt politician Adam Schiff? Oh, Adam, we have somebody that we've been trying to get for a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have a shot at him right now. Could we meet so that we can get your approval, Adam Schiff? And he'd say, well, let's do it in a couple of days. Oh, OK, let's wait a couple -- it doesn't work that way, number one. Number two, they leak. Anything we give will be leaked immediately. You'll see breaking news, we're about to attack in 25 minutes or do something.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the way, I'm not somebody that wants to attack. I probably could've attacked 5 times, 10 times having to do with Iran. I've been very guarded because I don't want to do that. But we may have to do something. We have to be in a position where we can do it even from the negotiating standpoint. But hopefully it won't be necessary.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have tremendous sanctions. They're doing very poorly. They have riots all over their country. And they can straighten it out easy but it's up to them.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> Speaking of sanctions --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Whatever they want to do.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> -- Ilhan Omar I think said today that this is akin to economic warfare against Iran, even though she supports sanctions against Israel.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. She hates Israel. She hates Jewish people. And you just have to take a look at her rhetoric. It's incredible what's happened to the Democrats in Congress. They used to be supportive of Israel. Today they are supportive of her and Tlaib. That's another real winner, Tlaib, and AOC who knows nothing. AOC knows nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Poor student, poor everything and then she comes and she talks about the Green New Deal and all these poor fools. Say, oh, isn't it wonderful? Isn't it wonderful? But as I said last night in Ohio, I don't like talking about the Green New Deal. It's too early. I want to save it for about two weeks before because they may change their mind.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Bernie Sanders was out, you're not surprised to hear this, last night discussing Iran, what happened and he basically said this.
<Bernie Sanders> <Negative> [Begin Video Clip] Just as we were led into Vietnam and Iraq by lies, the Trump administration is misleading us on Iran. They have justified the assassination of Qasem Soleimani by claiming that he was planning imminent attacks, and yet they produce no evidence that would justify this claim, not even in a classified setting. [End Video Clip]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't see it happening. We are there for a very, very strong reason. They cannot have nuclear weapons. The Iran nuclear deal signed by President Obama gave them $150 billion, and that's when the real terror started. They took that money and they used it all over the place. You look at Yemen, you look at all of the things that were happening, including Syria, they were using -- I want to say they gave $1.8 billion in cash -- $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion in cash.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Green cash, beautiful, green cash. You almost say where do they -- how do they have the power to do this? Plane loads of cash -- and instead of Iran saying thank you very much. That's really nice. Let's go and get along. Let's do well. Let's do deals together. Let's build buildings in Iran -- they said death to America and they said it when they were signing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When Kerry signed -- and by the way, Kerry violated the Logan Act.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> He's out there -- he's out there just slamming you -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, no. He totally violated. This man totally violated the Logan Act with his conversations, OK? But when Kerry was out there and making the deal, and they have people screaming, "Death to America. Death to America," I say, who signs a deal while they're screaming death to America? This was -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Well, they're saying you destabilized the Middle East after campaigning as a man of restraint, non-interventionism. Elizabeth Warren is saying this. Kerry's saying this. All the old Obama folks are out there, Susan Rice. They're all kind of waiting in the wings. They're like, see, he's the guy that we told you he was.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you look at the Middle East right now, it's much tamer than it was when I got in. When I got in, it was just all over the place. Number one, we got rid of the caliphate -- the ISIS caliphate. We have tens of thousands of ISIS prisoners. We've killed most of their fighters. We've gotten rid of ISIS. Now, they come back and we take care of it. Other people should take care of it. Other countries should take care of it. Europe did take them back [Inaudible] -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Is NATO going to actually step up? I know they've committed to doing more in the Middle East -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> But what specifically is NATO going to contribute that's going to take some of the burden off the American taxpayers?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So when I came in, as you know, NATO was virtually a dead organization. It had no money. Nobody was paying except us. Practically nobody was paying. If you look at a chart of money and funds received, it looked like a roller coaster down. Now, and Secretary Stoltenberg, I think he's terrific. In my first year, I raised $130 billion from them, not from us, and now he just announced $530 billion all because of me. He's my biggest salesman, my greatest salesman, Secretary Stoltenberg.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I said to him, look, you're there for Russia and Europe, OK? By the way, NATO's much more for Europe than it is for us, and yet we pay -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> What are we protecting them from now with all the money we're sending in NATO? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're protecting them -- we're protecting -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> What -- who are we protecting them from?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they build and office building for $3 billion. They do lots of things that they shouldn't be doing before I got here, but I raised a lot of money. We can use NATO in other locations. We can use NATO as an example in the Middle East, and that's what we should do. And frankly, it's more palatable to countries in the Middle East if an international force comes in rather than just the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And from our standpoint, let somebody else pay for it. Why are we always paying? We pay for everything. One thing, I moved my troops out of Syria -- on the border between Turkey and Syria. That turned out to be such a successful move, Laura. Look what happened. Now they protect their own -- they've been fighting over that border for 1,000 years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why should we do it? And then they say he left troops in Syria. You know what I did? I left troops to take the oil. I took the oil. The only troops I have are taking the oil. They're protecting the oil. I took over -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Why are we taking the oil, not taking -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, maybe we will. Maybe we won't. We -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> They're protecting the facility.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know. Maybe we should take it, but we have the oil. Right now, the United States has the oil. So they say he left troops in Syria. No. I got rid of all of them other than we're protecting the oil. We have the oil.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> The Wall Street Journal is reporting today that after the strike, "Mr. Trump told associates he was under pressure to deal with General Soleimani, to take him out, from GOP senators he views as important supporters in the coming impeachment trial in the Senate, associates said."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Sounds like you got a leaker here in the White House -- or someone -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's not -- it's fake news.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> What is -- is this fake?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They just made it up. It's fake news.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> OK. Wall Street Journal -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I used to think leakers. They just make it up. They're all very dishonest, most of them are really just -- I mean, 80 percent are dishonest, and I mean really dishonest. They made that story up.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> So no concern about --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You notice the way they --
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> Lindsey Graham, or --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well they don't -- no, not at all. By the way, absolutely not at all. We have tremendous support. Look, in the House we are 196 to nothing, and we got three Democrats. So therefore it was bipartisan, I guess you can say. We got -- nothing, they had nothing. We didn't lose one Republican vote, as you know, that's very unusual.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In the Senate, I think I have the same, if not more support. I don't have to do that. I would never compromise what we're doing with Iran and potential war, and all of the things that -- where we're doing so well --
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> We're not doing Bush 2.0 here. This is not Bush 2.0, this is not WMD --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what I want in the Middle East? I don't people having nuclear weapons because they'll use them. I don't want people having nuclear weapons. That's my biggest thing.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> John Kerry was up there yesterday saying, well, you guys got out of the Iran deal and that's what's caused all the tension --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know how bad the Iran deal was? The Iran deal, I did a great thing getting out of the Iran deal. They gave them 150 -- they gave them the 1.8 billion, forget that. You couldn't do inspections at the most important locations. And you know another big thing? They have the right to do ballistic missiles.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We couldn't go into areas and, look, we'd have to give massive notices. So if they were doing something, they could clean them up. It was ridiculous. But most importantly, it expires. This is a short-term agreement. And now, once it expired, they have an absolute, clear, unstopped path to have nuclear weapons, unstopped.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In a very short period of time, the deal that President Obama made with John Kerry, who may be the worst negotiator I've ever seen, that deal expires. And you know what? Once it expires, you can't do what I did, I mean, because they have a deal that says, once it expires, they can do what they want to do. You cannot let Iran have a nuclear weapon, that's what I'm doing.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Pete Buttigieg and other Democrats, I -- I predicted this when I talked to Mike Pompeo yesterday, are actually blaming your moves against Iran for the downing of that commercial jetliner in Iran, in Tehran the night of this the strike by Iran to our Iraqi facilities. Your reaction to that charge?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, a couple of people started that and they got hit real fast by a lot of different people, not me. I think it's just low life -- look, he's not going anywhere, he was a lousy mayor of a place that is not doing well, and Indiana is doing unbelievably well. Indiana, the state had the best year they've ever had, thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But that city was badly run. If you look at what's going on --
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> Jackie Speier's saying [Inaudible] --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's going nowhere, and she's another beauty. I mean, take a look at her past. Check out her past, please.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> The Iraqi Prime Minister has notified Mike Pompeo about potential plans, drawing up plans for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq period. You ran on pulling out of the Middle East.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Why not use this opportunity to say we're done?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm OK. I'm OK with it. By the way, listen -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> You're OK with removing our troops from Iraq?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- listen just so you understand. That's what they say
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> -- pulling out of the Middle East.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't --
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Why not use this opportunity to say we're done.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm OK with it. By the way --
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> You're OK with removing our troops from Iraq?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's what they say publicly. They don't say that privately. Because if we leave, that means they're not going to be able to -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> But why not leave?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not so bad with it. When I heard that, I said -- I have it down to 5,000 troops. We had many, many troops there in Iraq. And we're there only in the training. We train them. But if they want us to leave -- but they speak different publicly than they do privately.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> But are we sending more troops to the region as we speak?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're sending more to Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia's paying us for it. We're doing something that nobody's ever done. I said to Saudi Arabia -- we have a very good relationship with Saudi Arabia. I said listen, you're a very rich country. You want more troops, I'm going to send them to you but you've got to pay us. They're paying us. They've already deposited $1 billion in the bank.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We are going to help them but these rich countries have to pay for it. South Korea gave us $500 million. They've never gave us -- they gave us $500 million. I said you got to help us along. We have 32,000 soldiers in South Korea protecting it from North Korea. You've got to pay. And they gave us $500 million.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean you saw that breaking news because nobody wants to report that stuff. I'm not sure anybody knows it. It might be sort of saying you have some -- I mean, that's good stuff. But they're a wealthy country. They build all your television sets. They took that away from us. They build the ships; they've built a lot of things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said look, we're protecting you, you got to pay. They paid us $500 million. They're going to pay us a lot more.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> Do you think that Iraq should repay the American taxpayer for these bases --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure. [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> -- for what we've done there?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You heard that from me.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Yes. I -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely. I said we built one of the world's most expensive airport facilities anywhere in the world. I mean I wish we had it in New York. I wish we had it in Washington. We build runways that are 15,000 feet long. At LaGuardia they're 7,000 feet long. In fact, I think they're 20,000 feet long over there and deep thick concrete and steel.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nobody ever built runways like this. OK, it's way over built but that's OK. But we have billions of dollars into that. I said if we leave you got to pay us. If we leave, you have to pay us by embassies. You have to pay us for the money we put in.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> How are you going to collect?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we have a lot of their money right now. We have a lot of their money. We have $35 billion of their money right now sitting in an account. And I think they'll agree to pay. I think they'll agree to pay. Otherwise we'll stay there.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> Mr. President, we just learned that Nancy Pelosi has announced she's sending articles of impeachment next week to the Senate. What's your reaction?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think it's ridiculous. She should've sent them a long time ago. It -- it just -- it belittles the process, what they've done to impeachment, it's like -- I was interviewed by a very, very good writer -- reporter, somebody that you know very well, I could say, Bob Woodward. He said he's doing something.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And this time I said maybe I'll sit down. Because nobody's done more than me -- I mean no body -- if you're look at three years with the economy, with regulations, with the tax cuts, with everything -- one of the things, we've rebuilt our military -- our military was totally depleted. Our military was old and depleted.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he said, you know, you don't look like somebody who's under impeachment. As you know, he's slightly covered Nixon, and he covered Clinton. But Bob Woodward, he said, you actually look like you've won everything, you look happy. I said I am happy. So maybe I'm wired a little bit different, I don't know --
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Impeachment managers -- anyone that you would prefer to see? She hasn't named -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- well we have a team. We have a team.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> But her impeachment managers, they haven't named any -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I would love to ask a couple of their people some questions, like Schiff. Why did he lie? Why did he make up my statement? Totally made it up. But again the whole thing unraveled when I put in the transcript, because it's all about the transcript, and it's all about the president of Ukraine saying he did nothing wrong.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> How long do you think this will last?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We'll it depends if they have a trial, it probably takes a few days, or a week, and -- or unless we want to have a bigger trial, where we're bringing in the whistleblower, which I'd love to do. And I'd love to bring in the informant who disappeared. I'd love to bring in the second whistleblower who disappeared.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd love to bring in the inspector general, why did he bring it up there -- he should've never done it. He didn't want to see the call -- he didn't want to see the call. He took his whistleblower -- who's a fraud -- he took the whistleblower's report and he put it in. They said to him, you know, if it's -- if that's the case -- if you have to do that, what we'll do is we'll show you the actual call.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no, I don't want to see it. What's that all about? Why did he do that -- inspector general? So I'd like to interview the inspector general, why did he do that and put everybody through --
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Are you worried about future presidents, what's this is going to do to the presidency in the future?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it cheapened the word impeachment. I think impeachment's a very ugly word. But I think this cheapened the word impeachment. I think Nancy Pelosi and Schiff -- you know, because he's corrupt. I mean here's the guy stands up at the United States Congress and repeats a conversation -- except it was a fraud, he made up a conversation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was saying my conversation and was totally wrong, and he knew it. He said don't call me, I'll call you. That's from The Godfather, that's from -- that's a mafia statement. I never said that. He said eight times, "quid pro quo." It was no times. He made up a conversation and repeated it in front of Congress, and because he has immunity we can't do anything about it. I'd like to say why did you do that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, these people are frauds and it's very bad -- no, they cheapened the word impeachment. It's a bad word to start off -- I really say it's an ugly word. To me it's a very ugly word. But maybe it played to our benefit.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> When we talk about impeachment now, it looks like McConnell is agreeing with Josh Hawley's proposition --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> -- to dismiss these articles of impeachment if Pelosi doesn't send them over. My question to you is, why not have them dismissed today? Why would McConnell just say, we're done with these games? Or do you want a trial --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, in many ways I'd like a trial and I'd love to have sleepy Joe Biden, I'd love to have his son. I call him, where's Hunter. I've change his first name to where, where's Hunter. I'd love to have the whistleblower who wrote a fake report. The whistleblower is a person that is -- you know who the whistleblower is? By the way, everybody knows who the whistleblower is -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> The whistleblower is still working in the White House?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everybody -- I don't want to say, but everybody knows about the whistleblower and they know about the whistleblower's lawyer. But then do you remember, there was a second whistleblower. I want to know what happened to the second whistleblower, what happened to the informer? Remember that, an informer. They all disappeared when I gave the transcript because I gave the transcript and that blew everything apart because we have an accurate -- and the only thing covered by the hearings was that now people agree -- everybody, even our great lieutenant colonel -- please call him lieutenant colonel.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Our great lieutenant colonel agrees that the transcript was accurate. I think he had one word different, we changed the one word -- it meant absolutely nothing -- the transcript was professionally done by the best people there are -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Just one second. So we have a transcript, they never thought I'd release it -- they probably never thought I had it. I can only say thank goodness they had it. Because I -- otherwise I would've been falsely accused and it would've been sadly my word against them. But we had other people on that call -- think of this; I was going to do something wrong on a call where I know there are many people listening.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> Always.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The President of Ukraine said I did absolutely nothing wrong, he said I had no pressure whatsoever. He didn't even know what we were talking about. And we called them before I released the transcript -- because it's a terrible thing to have to release the conversation with a leader from another country, it's a terrible thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean what are other counties other than Ukraine, what are they saying? So anyway, they have no case --
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Why not call Bolton, why not allow him to testify? This thing is bogus -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will have no problem other than one thing. You can't be in the White House as president -- future; I'm talking about future -- many future presidents, and have a security advisor -- anybody having to do with security handling though and other things. [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> -- that privilege?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think you have to for the sake of the office. I would love everybody to testify. I'd like Mick to testify, I'd like Mike Pompeo to testify, I'd like Rick Perry to testify, I want everybody -- but there are things that you can't do from the standpoint of executive privilege. You have to maintain that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, we'll see where it all goes. But especially, a national security advisor -- you can't have him explaining all of your statements about national security concerning Russia, China, and North Korea -- everything -- we just can't do that.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> How about [Inaudible]?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think for the good of the others. Look, Nancy Pelosi will go down as probably the least successful Speaker of the House in the history of our nation. She has done nothing, the only thing she's done is she finally got done one of the best trade deals our country has ever made to USMCA, that's with Mexico and Canada -- but I did that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She doesn't even know what it says -- she has no idea what it says. She was forced to do that -- you know why? She wouldn't have done it, but she did nothing. So now she can say I signed something. She is obsessed with impeachment, she has done nothing. She is going to go down as one of the worst Speakers in the history of our country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, in all fairness, she's hurting our country. She's very bad for our country. And she's become a crazed lunatic. But she will go down as -- I think maybe the worst speaker in the history of our country.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> How do you get --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And she will be overthrown pretty soon because she's doing very little and the people are tired of it. And she's controlled by the radical left. She's controlled by AOC, she's controlled by this Tlaib -- that's another great one -- and she's controlled by Omar. That's who is controlling her, the radical left.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> We just heard that they are thinking about adding another article on impeachment, they're floating this, to include the events over the last few weeks. Here's what Chuck Schumer just said:
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So they can't win an election that's going to take place in 10 months, they know that, and they only thing they can do -- it's like with their Congressman Green, when he said, we can't beat him, we have to impeach him. And they all know that. They're making things up. This is the craziest thing anyone's ever seen, and the two articles that they put in, as you know, they're not crimes, they're not -- they're not even allowed to be put in. It's a disgrace.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Doesn't that show the weakness of their case, that they're still trying to rebrand this as something else?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think it --
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> I've never seen anything like this, this is --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I think it's incredible. I think it's really hurting them. Look, my numbers are the highest -- my poll numbers. You have this guy that goes on television all the time, he gives phony numbers. My poll -- as you know, my poll numbers right now, today, are the highest they've ever been. And by the way, people love that we took out this horrible terrorist, they love it, Soleimani.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They love that we took him out. They think it's so fantastic. He should have been taken out over the last 20 years by somebody. Te should have been taken out a long time ago. But my numbers are the highest they've ever been, and a lot of it because of the impeachment hoax. It's a hoax. How would you like to be two, two and a half years, I'm under investigation -- federal investigation before I even ran.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In my opinion, before I came down the escalator, but from the time I came down the escalator, I'd been under investigation. They found nothing. They found nothing. Who else do you think in Washington -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Not -- well, Steve could have withstood it --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. Think of it.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not only withstood it mentally and I think, you know, somebody said -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> But accomplished.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- it actually energized me, yes, because it makes me angry. But think, who else could have withstood that? You take some of these Democrat senators. They couldn't withstand. You know what would happen? Number one, they'd fold up like an umbrella, and number two, they'd be guilty of a lot of stuff.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Will you slap the sanctions back on China, the tariffs if they -- if you sign them -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well [Inaudible]. People don't know.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> -- if you sent the extra tariffs if they don't fulfill what they said they would do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh yes, well, I have the right to do that, but people don't realize I still have the tariffs. 25 percent tariffs on China are $250 billion worth of goods, I still have those. And by the way, remember they used to say we paid for it? No, no. China devalued their currency and they're paying for it. And we have a great relationship with China right now, so I don't want to speak badly of anyone, but they are having the worst year that they've had.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Last year was the worst they had. In 67 -- was 57, now it's 67 years, and they wanted to make a deal and we made a deal, and it's a great deal. Now we have a Phase Two deal, which will start at some point, but Phase One was very important for banking. You know what we did? We opened it up to banking, but for banking, for our farmers, for manufacturers, it's a great -- it's great.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> China, though, is -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have a lot of these deals that I've made. South Korea, Japan. Japan is -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> I've documented all of this.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- [Inaudible]. We have all these deals.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> No one else has touched this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But remember this. They're all kicking in now. We didn't have anything. We had horrible deals or a no deal. The Japan deal we had no deal. We're getting $40 billion. What this is going to do for our economy is going to be amazing, and it's just now -- it just started a month ago. It's just starting kicking in.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> On the human rights issue in China -- and you don't talk a lot about it, but it concerns a lot of our strongest supporters, Evangelical Christians, Catholics, other people who are really concerned about human rights. Got a million people in reeducation camps, internment camps. The Catholics were getting missiles in their pews at Christmas that had tributes to Xi instead of silent night.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Crazy stuff happening. Reagan saw the power of the moral argument for freedom and married it to the economic and military argument for peace through strength. Can you do more on that front without damaging your ability to make future trade agreements more on the human rights -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm riding a fine line because we're making not good trade deals. We're making great trade deals -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> But human rights count.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They do count, and when you say Reagan, look. I was a big fan of Reagan, but he wasn't heavy into it. He wanted to do certain things. He wasn't really heavy into it, but he wasn't also making trade deals. He let Japan come in and take our automobile market. You know, as much as I like Reagan, he was not good on trade.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Well, he didn't trade with the Soviet Union at all. We didn't have a big bunch of students from the Soviet Union coming in the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we should be able to trade with Russia. I think we should be able -- I think getting along -- by the way, getting along with Russia now that the witch-hunt has ended having to do with Russia, now that they've spent $45 million, found nothing, think of this.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Mr. President, when you look at this trajectory of your administration, huge progress on trade, credible progress on dealing with our political foes, ISIS, incredible deregulation, judges. You've done a lot. On the economy today we found out that -- still added 146,000 jobs. Unemployment historically low at 3.5 percent.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> But we do have a little bit of a stall out on wage growth, which you ran on, and we've seen some, 2.9 percent last year, 0.1 percent --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, versus -- I know.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> -- over the last month. But we don't have a tight labor market. If we had a tight labor market we'd be seeing real increases in wages.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> I hear that your team is planning on advocating more foreign workers coming in for some of these high-tech companies. I'm very concerned about that as our body of supporters.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know. I know you're concerned. And so is Mark Levin a little bit.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Yes, we're concerned because Americans --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And so was the great Lou Dobbs -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> You ran on American jobs --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Lou Dobbs is concerned too. But I'll say, Lou, here's the problem. I'm demanding that Japan and all these companies -- countries that have these massive -- we have [Inaudible] nobody's ever seen before. I say you got to open up. I call -- Prime Minister Abe's a friend of mine, I say Shinzo, you got to open up more plants in the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they tell me we want to do it. We want to do it. They start opening. They can't get labor. We need help, otherwise we could just say don't open up any --
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> If they couldn't get labor, wages would be going up. Wages aren't going up.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Wages are going up.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> Not in the high-tech industry. We're seeing a plateauing of wages --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We wanted 3 percent and it went up 2.9 percent. In the last two years, wages have gone up more than they have in 25 years.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> But for Google, why reward Google? Google's working against you in your campaign. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, I don't want to reward Google. I'm not -- I'm not a fan --
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Those guys -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm not --
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> All they want is low-skilled workers instead of well-paid workers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Laura, I'm not a fan of Google. But I'm a fan of great companies, OK?
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> You didn't run on bringing more foreign workers into the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Not foreign workers. We have to allow smart people to stay in our country. You graduate number one in your class at Harvard, you graduate from the Wharton School of Finance --
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Yes, that's a small percentage of what they want.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No it's not. It's a lot.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> But you ran on people training their foreign replacements, that you ran against that. Americans -- it's humiliating for an American worker wo worked for a company for 30 years, now is told, you've got to train your foreign replacement who lives in Korea and they're going to pay him 20 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no, that's different. That -- I would never do that. But we do need workers in our country and I do want an immigration policy -- nobody's been better on immigration than me -- by the way, and we won the funding for the wall. And the wall has been built anyway, because I was taking it out of the military and everything else, and now it's easier.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We need people -- I got Foxconn to go into Wisconsin. They have to get people, they spent a fortune. They built the most incredible plant I've ever seen. In Wisconsin, Foxconn --
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> But why shouldn't we have American graduates of colleges and universities taking those jobs?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We do. No, we do. We do, but we don't have enough of them. We're not -- we don't have enough of them and we have to be competitive with the rest of the world too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The companies want to hire these people and they can't --
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> They want to hire people they can hire for the cheapest amount because that's what they want.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not talking about cheap. I'm talking about brainpower. They want to hire smart people and those people are thrown out of the country. We can't do that.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> No, no, you ran on American first. Anyway -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, this is America first.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> All right, yes --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me -- I just have to finish this. If we tell smart people to get the hell out, that's not America first.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> That's not what we're saying. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's a bad thing.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> There's a never-ending appetite on the part of corporate America to bring in as much cheap labor as possible to drive down wages. That's just going to happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Laura, I have so many companies coming into this country. You're not going to have to worry about it. It's always going to be a shortage. If somebody's smart sitting in this position -- we have so --
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- many companies coming in from Japan. Japan is doing many car companies, China now is going to start building a lot of things -- you know, they haven't been doing it too much. We have so many companies wanting to come in and they don't have the labor. But they're coming in. [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Alright --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'll tell you what, we're doing great. Our country is doing great, our economy is doing great.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Mr. President, I know you're close to the Queen and she has a lot of affection for you, you have great visits over there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have a great relationship.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Would you be able to give her any advice for some of the rogue royals? Like, what's happening there, it seems like there's a lot of tumult. And you've been so good at keeping your kids together in a close-knit family.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's bad, I do. I think -- she's a great woman. I sat with her -- I was supposed to be with her 15 minutes, I stayed an hour and a half. By the way, I got killed by the press -- she wanted me to stay. The press said, no, no, he was supposed to leave that was very rude. We had a great time. Then we had dinner, we were honored, our country was honored; I sat with her for a long time, and she was smiling and laughing the whole time.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Protocol is important for her. She -- the tradition of the monarchy and the responsibilities -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we have a very great relationship. I think this was a blindside -- she was blindsided by this whole situation and I think it's too bad. But you know, she's been the queen, has to be an all-time record, from the time she was like 25 a d now she's 94. She's never made a mistake, if you look. I mean, she's had like a flawless time.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> I think Harry should go back, come back and take a look --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think -- I think -- you know, I don't want to get into the whole thing, but I find it -- I just have such respect for the queen, I don't think this should be happening to her.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> IOC announced today -- and this is our final question, Mr. President -- just announced that no politics at the upcoming Olympics -- new policy -- by any of the athletes. Would you like to see that extended to the United States, where politics stay out of sports? I know you're going to the big LSU-Clemson game on --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I am, and I was responsible for getting the Olympics. The Olympics is coming to Los Angeles, and I was called by the mayor, and he said, could you do us a favor, when I was president-elect, and he said, could you do this? And I worked very hard, and we got the Olympics and we have the World Cup coming into the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I don't know, I guess you can say that no politics, but people are going to talk politics. I think politics -- I do believe I've made politics somewhat more exciting. The New York Times would be dead right now, it would be filled --
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> What are they going to do without you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Washington Post would be out of business. I hate to say it but cable television would be -- it's obsolete. Cable would be out of business, so we'll go another, hopefully, five years and we'll keep everybody happy.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Thank you so much that was fantastic.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Welcome back. We are coming to you live this morning from the border of El Paso, Texas and Juarez, Mexico. Joining us right now on the telephone is the President of the United States, President Donald Trump joining me right now. And Mr. President, thank you so much for calling in this morning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well thank you, Maria.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Well, we're on the border here and while we were standing here, Mr. President, we saw at least three groups -- different groups that crossed the border illegally and were apprehended, why are these numbers soaring so much today?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well people are pouring up because our economy is so good. I mean, unfortunately, it's the only bad part about what we're doing because everybody wants a piece of it and they're willing to come up and take the risk and this tremendous danger and our laws are so bad, the combination of having a great economy and having the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the world by far, and we have catch and release and we have chain migration and a visa lottery.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have things nobody in their right mind would have. We're trying to get rid of them, the Democrats won't do it. We need some Democrat votes. We're unanimous with the Republicans but we need some Democrat votes and they go out of their way to allow these people to come in. And when you get cute, when you get tough, when you do all of these things that we have to do, they end up arresting border patrol people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a disgrace to our country what's going on. The worst immigration laws ever. Incompetent. They're there for a long time. When -- when they used to separate children, which was done during the Obama administration, with Bush, with us, with everybody, far fewer people would come and we've been on a humane basis, was pretty bad.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We -- we go out and we stop the separation. The problem is you have 10 times more people coming up with their families. It's like Disneyland now. You know, before you'd get separated so people would say let's not go up. Now you don't get separated and, you know, while that sounds nice and all, what happens is you have -- literally you have 10 times more families coming up because they're not going to be separated from their children, so it turned out to be a --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> That's right, yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- just incentive that is obviously a disaster. It's a disaster. You have --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> And -- and -- and --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- people coming up with many children and --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> -- we've seen it firsthand.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- now we know -- we know where everybody is and we're moving people out so fast. The problem is we have to register them, we have to bring them to court. Another country just says sorry, you can't come into our country and they walk them out. In our country you have to bring them to court, you have to have Perry Mason involved, I mean, you know, it's all legal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have lawyers standing at the border, our people, lawyers, wise guys standing at the border, signing people up. Every time they catch a cold they try and blame Border Patrol. It's a disgrace what's going on and it -- it could be solved in -- in 15 minutes if the Democrats would give us the votes, it would be over.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Yes. Well --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're building a lot of wall. We're going to have 400 miles of wall up by the end of next year. So the wall is going to be -- it's going to be great.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's going to be the top of the line, too. I got it done. The top of the line. [Break in Interview for Commercial]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What we need is new laws that don't allow this so when somebody comes in we say sorry, you got to go out. We don't need a court system, we have a court system that is -- has 900,000 cases behind it. In other words, they have a court which needs to hear 900,000 cases, how ridiculous is this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This has been building up from years, from many years. And it's just -- it's just a system that Congress can fix, Maria, and they don't get off their ass. And it's the Democrats that could solve it so quickly because we're going to have all the infrastructure soon, I'll have the wall up, I mean by the end of the next year most of the wall is going to be up. Where you are where the wall ends, that's part of the wall that we're building, in other words where the wall ends that's the weak spot, it's like water.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They come through the weak spots.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> That's exactly right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But a lot of those are being taken care of.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> So Senator Lindsey Graham --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They'll all be taken care of fairly quickly, I mean despite the fact that it's like pulling teeth dealing with the Democrats, I have to go different routes to get money. It's lucky I'm good at doing that as being a developer, I used to build buildings, good times, bad times, you build buildings. And getting money in bad times, well this is -- this is great times, but getting money for a wall -- they give me money for anything I want but as long as it has the word wall they don't want to do it. But I have the money, I'm building the wall.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Yes, exactly, exactly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And frankly if they would change the laws it would be a whole different scene down there it could happen so quickly.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> So realistically, Mr. President, when would you expect that because Senator Lindsey Graham came on this show two weeks ago and said look, I'm going to come back from recess, I'm going to put together a package, I'm going to work with the President to change these loopholes and change the immigration laws.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Do you see that happening in 2019?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, Lindsey's been great, we have a package of things that we're asking for and we're actually going for a much bigger package than -- rather than those little things which are not little at all in terms of their importance, but we're making a plan where we really talk about immigration laws on a much larger scale.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we also have a plan for people coming in, because you know, we have so many companies coming into the United States because of my plan and because of our tax cuts and the tax plan, it's called really tax cut and jobs plan, we have so many companies -- you know it better than anybody, you cover it better than anybody, you saw the numbers yesterday, 3.2 percent GDP.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nobody believed it, even you were surprised I'm so disappointed in you, you were surprised, you just don't know me well enough yet I guess. But one of those -- but we have such great numbers and we have companies pouring in. The problem is we need workers and we're doing a plan based on merit where people come in, Maria, based on merit so they can help us. They have skills, they have talent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have people coming in under these crazy laws that -- I mean under these crazy laws that -- I mean if they -- if they need welfare or if they need hand outs in the next 50 years, they -- they're almost incentivized. Those are the people that we're supposed to be taking and we take as few as possible of them, I'll tell you.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Well that's exactly right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But the way the laws are, it's brutal. And they start arresting border patrol people and these incredible people that are doing such a good job, if they want to do anything and if they want to be a little bit cute. It is really a disaster. Whoever approved this stuff...
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> I...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...Had no common sense or they hated our country, one or the other.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Well, let me tell you -- Mr. President, I know you have to run. But, you know, all of the 2020 contenders who want to run against you in 2020, you haven't heard a peep out of them about this. Beto O'Rourke is actually from El Paso. I don't know what he's done about this problem. And then, of course, you've got Bernie and now you've got Joe Biden.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> They're not characterizing this as a crisis, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So Beto O'Rourke wants to take down the wall, so that means he's finished, I mean he was finished two weeks ago when he started saying certain very stupid things. Beto O'Rourke has been exposed. I think Biden has been exposed, I don't know what the hell happened to Biden, I never saw that before. I've -- I don't know, it just doesn't look like the same Biden.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said is that really Joe Biden? He doesn't look the same to me. I've known him for a long time, I've seen him for a long time. I said what happened to him? So he's -- he's been exposed because he's very weak. He doesn't want to talk about this. No but they don't want to talk about this, I don't -- I don't get what their plan is. Do they want to let people in that shouldn't be here, because we have people that are trying to get in that shouldn't be here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Think of the word apprehend, the border security is apprehending 100,000 people a month, do you know how many people that is? It's incredible the job they do. The problem is with these laws, we should be able to take him right out. We can't. We have to bring them into a court, whoever heard of that?
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> I know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're the only country in the world that I know of that has a courts system and it's a -- it's a mobile court system, I mean it is on the border and with all of these cases, 900,000 cases, you need to do 900,000 -- you'd need 100,000 lawyers. I mean it's the craziest thing you've ever seen.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Yeah.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Mr. President, thanks for doing this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> The reaction to your press conference in Washington was swift and intense. Former CIA Director John Brennan described it as "treasonous" and a potentially impeachable offense. Why the push toward conflict with Russia in Washington on both sides?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think Brennan is a very bad guy. And if you look at it, a lot of things happened under his watch. I think he is a very bad person.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I also think that when you watch Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, when you watch all of the things that happened, and Comey, take a look at that, and McCabe who has got some pretty big problems, I assume, you look at the deception, the lies, what's gone on in the last fairly long period of time - before I won.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, long before I won. During the campaign. I guess probably during the Republican - when I was fighting against 17 other Republicans. So, this has been going on for a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But these are people that, in my opinion, are truly - they're bad people. And they are being exposed for what they are and it's a shame that it has to happen, but it's really hurt our country.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> Their view is that the United States is forever in conflict with Russia which is our chief global adversary. And anyone who doesn't believe that is betraying the United States, without taking up whether that's true or not. Why do you think there is this bipartisan consensus on that in Washington?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's sort of incredible because if you look at World War I and World War II, that was Germany. And in World War II, Russia lost 50 million people and helped us win the war.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was saying to myself the other day, I said Russia really helped us. I'm not pro-Russia, pro-anybody. I just want to have this country be safe. I don't want nuclear weapons, even people thinking about it. Russia and the United States control 90 percent of the nuclear weapons in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And getting along with Russia - and not only for that reason - that's a good thing.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> Are they our chief adversary, would you say?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they are a strong military, but their economy is much smaller, as you know, than China. I don't want to even use the word adversary. We can all work together. We can do great. Everybody can do well and we can live in peace.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think it's very, very important. And I've watched your show a lot and I see how you're talking about really the magnificent size of China, you look at the size of what they've done in a fairly short period of time, that's because of a lot of bad leadership on behalf of the United States. We allowed that to happen. We allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right now, as you see and you probably have noticed that things are happening. We have to bring it more into line. We have to level the playing field between the United States and China.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we've increased our net worth. We've increased our worth by more than $7 trillion since the election. And we're about twice the size of China, our economy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But China still is a massive economy. They have the second biggest by far.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> So, NATO. NATO was created chiefly to prevent the Russians from invading Western Europe. I think you don't believe Western Europe is at risk of being invaded by Russia right now.
<Tucker Carlson> <Neutral> So, what is the purpose of NATO right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that was the purpose.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it's OK. It's fine, but they have to pay. And they weren't paying. And other presidents went and they'd make a speech and then they'd leave and nothing would happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the fact that they didn't pay is not a new fact. This is something that people have known for a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Other countries were delinquent. In the real estate business, we use the word delinquent. They didn't pay. They didn't pay for past.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I went there three or four days ago and I said, folks, you've got to pay because we're not going to pay it from 70 to 90 - and I think 90 is really the right - depending on the way you define it, 90 percent - we're not going to pay 90 percent of the costs to defend Europe.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And on top of that, the European Union kills us on trade. We lost $151 billion last year on trade. They don't take our product. They don't take our farmers, beautiful goods. They don't take our cars. And if they do, the rate of tax is many times what we would charge them. We only charge them 2.5 percent. Their tariff is very substantially higher.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, in the case of China, we charge 2.5 percent when they send a car. And when we send a car into China, they charge us 25 percent. How is that fair trade?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People say, we don't want tariffs, but how is that fair when one country gets 25 percent and another country gets 2.5 percent? And by the way, the one getting 25 doesn't even want the cars. They want them to build those factories - they want those factories built in China. They want those factories built in Europe.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, now, we're doing things that have never been done before in this country and you see what's going on. It's been very pleasant to watch.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> So, membership in NATO obligates the members to defend any other member that's attacked. So, let's say, Montenegro, which joined last year, is attacked. Why should my son go to Montenegro to defend it from attack? Why is that -
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I understand what you're saying. I've asked the same question. Montenegro is a tiny country with very strong people.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Yes. I'm not against Montenegro. Or Albania.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, they're very strong people. They're very aggressive people. They may get aggressive. And, congratulations, you are in World War III.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, I understand that. But that's the way it was set up. Don't forget, I just got here a little more than a year-and-a-half ago.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I took over the conversation three or four days ago and I said, you have to pay. You have to pay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the secretary general said that, because of President Trump, last year, we had an additional $44 billion raised for NATO. And this year, it's going to be much more than that. And the countries all agreed. It was very unfair. They weren't paying.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, not only are we paying for most of it, but they weren't even paying and we're protecting them. Add that to your little equation on Montenegro.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> As you traveled around Europe and looked at Europe over the years, can you think of a place that has been improved by mass immigration or movements of large numbers of refugees?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not one.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> Not one?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, in fact, one of my big things - and some people were insulted - I think a year ago, they would have been totally insulted. Now, maybe there could have been a couple out of all of those countries.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said the immigration policies in Europe are a disaster, you're destroying Europe, you're destroying the culture of Europe, the crime is up in those areas and you better do something. I tell them that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, it's not me, it's not anything, you just look at the numbers and the numbers speak. But the culture is changing rapidly and the crime rate is changing more than rapidly. You better do something. I told them that.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> What are the lessons for us, watching that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we have to be very strong on the border. Now, we're much stronger than we ever were on the border and our numbers are much lower, but still we're getting the wall. We're putting in about $5 billion. We've already started the wall, 1.6 billion. Started in San Diego, California. It's almost completed in that area.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the way, the people are really asking for it. It's interesting. They probably go down as we don't want the wall, but when it came to their backyard, they wanted that wall and they wanted it up fast.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we've started the wall. We are going to continue with the wall. It's so necessary. But we have to have strong immigration policies. Our laws are so bad, Tucker, somebody comes in and they step in our land and now we end up with a court case that takes seven years, but the people never show up to court.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's so bad and we have to do something about it. Like, if they come into our land, we have to say, I'm sorry, you have to leave. Not I'm sorry, please come to court; we're going to put you in court, you'll come back in three years for your trial and then they never show up. That's what's happening now. It's crazy.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> Why do you think so many political and cultural leaders in the United States disagree with you and are making the case that borders are themselves immoral?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's incredible. I mean, the Democrats are for open borders, which means crime. It's not a question of, like, what do you think it means. Open borders means crime.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you look at - MS-13 is pouring in and we stop them better than anybody else could. But when they get through - and then we send ICE because ICE is tougher than they are. And now I understand there's a big move to try and get rid of ICE.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But MS-13, these are tough, vicious people. They don't like guns. They like using knives better because it's more painful. These are vicious people. And you know the story. You cover it plenty.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And ICE goes in and they get them out. They get them out. They put them in jail or they throw them out of the country and they don't even think about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And now, there's a movement to get rid of ICE because ICE is tough. If you don't have tough people doing that job, you're going to have crime like you've never seen it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, it is incredible. The Democrats want open borders which is basically saying we want open borders, we want crime.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> Why do you think they want that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Maybe it's a political philosophy that they grew up with. Maybe they learned it at school. Maybe they are fools. I don't know.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Now the second half of our interview from Helsinki with the president. He had a lot to say about the Mueller indictments. A very interesting exchange on Angela Merkel, whether she or Vladimir Putin is a better leader for their people and more. Here it is.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> You spoke with the Russian president about the hacking of the DNC servers. Those indictments were announced just a couple of days before you left on your European swing. What do you think of the timing of those indictments?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't think of the timing as much as I think of other timing. Barack Obama was president - I wasn't president when this happened. Barack Obama was the president of the United States when all of this - this was when I was getting elected.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So, I was being elected. And, I guess, I assume this stuff all took place in that area or before. And he was president. And they informed him of it and he did nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then, after I won - see, he thought Hillary was going to win. After I won, he said this is a big deal. Well, it wasn't a big deal as long as she won.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, it's a disgrace. And, frankly, it's a disgrace what's happening to our country.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> Would it be possible for you to direct the Department of Justice, FBI to take possession of the server and have - assuming no government investigators looked at it, which seems to be the case right now, and get to the bottom of it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, as I've told you, and the answer is, absolutely, it is possible. And maybe, at some point, it will be done. But I've wanted to stay out. My Department of Justice is the one branch, the one group that I'm very little involved in. Same with the FBI.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Am I disappointed that they're not looking at all of the crooked things taking place on the other side, like the Pakistani man who left with these three servers, knew everything about Schultz? Knew everything. Debbie Wasserman Schultz. And I think he had three servers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I believe they even had them and they don't want to use him. For the DNC, where the server was never taken by the FBI, they went in there and Podesta or somebody threw them out of the office. They said get out of here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And yet, they go after other people like there's no tomorrow. And you understand that. I spoke to you about it before. As they said, you are winning, don't get involved because I don't want to have people accuse me of anything. So, I've stayed very much uninvolved.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But am I allowed to be involved? Totally. Will I be involved? We'll have to see as it goes along. I mean, right now, people are finding out a lot of things that they never thought.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And in all fairness to the IG report, it was an unbelievable report except at the end where they sort of tried to be politically correct. But when you talk about bias, there has never been biased like that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Strzok, on the other hand, that was totally bias. But that report was a good report except for the basic conclusion. Which wasn't even bad.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Having met with, talked to, watched carefully Angela Merkel in Germany, Vladimir Putin in Russia, who do you think, from the perspective of their countries, does a better job representing the interest again of their countries?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, Angela was a superstar until she allowed millions of people to come into Germany. That really hurt her badly as you know. She was unbeatable in any election. She allowed millions of people to come in.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And when they came into Germany, they passed everywhere else and they went to lots of other countries, although Hungry would not take any in. But what happened is it was a great migration.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, obviously, it's hurt Angela very much. I don't want to say who is better, who is not better, but I will say this. She's been very badly hurt by immigration. Very, very badly.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> So, China is a very rich country, as you often say. How many refugees and immigrants does China allow?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd say probably none.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> Why is that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'd say how about asking me about Japan, how about asking me about South Korea, how about asking me about a lot of other countries that are very successful?
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> Is there pressure on those countries to allow millions of refugees and immigrants to come in?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't even think that people making the decision would want to waste the phone call. There's no chance. Check out Japan. Ask them. How many have you taken in the last one year? You can count them on your fingers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's different.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> But wait. If the key to success as a country is immigration, how can those countries be successful?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not even talking about key to success. And it depends on what immigration, what's going on. But you're asking me about China and I added Japan, I added South Korea, I could add other countries also. It is virtually impossible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll tell you what Mexico has very strong immigration laws. If Mexico wanted, they could stop this huge flow of people coming up from different parts of South America, including Mexico, and pouring into our border.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Our laws are so bad. We have the worst laws anywhere in the world. We have the worst immigration laws in the world. We don't have any law. We have an opposite to law.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then, on top of it, you have the right to separate children, OK. So, everything is bad, but you have the right to separate children.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's really disgraceful that the Democrats aren't doing something about it because we need their votes, as you know. So, I hope we're going to get enough Republicans that we don't need them come November.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the Democrats, we need their votes. We have, as you know, 51. And even the 51 is not really there for obvious reasons in the Senate. And in the House, it's fairly close. We need Democrat votes in order to get it done.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they really just want to resist. Their whole thing is resist, right? That's their big theme. Resist. What do you get from resistance? But it's resist and obstruct. That's what they are all about. It's the only thing they're good about.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are not good politicians. They have got horrible policy, but they are very good at sticking together and resisting and obstructing. But that's hurting our country. But we'll get the immigration laws changed.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> President of the United States, thank you for the conversation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
