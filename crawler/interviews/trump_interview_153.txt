<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> So I have this note on the call screener computer: "On the hotline..." We don't have a hotline. "On the hotline, you're receiving a phone call in recognition of your anniversary broadcast. You'll want to take this immediately." Okay. So we're going to the phones and we have a special guest. Who is it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, Rush, I just wanted to congratulate you on 30 years. [Laughter] This is your favorite president, and I think you are fantastic. [Laughter] I heard about it, and today's the big day, 30 years. I wanted to call personally and congratulate you.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> I am floored. I... [Laughs] I thought there was nothing anybody could do to surprise me today. I've been preparing for anything. Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're a very special man, Rush, and you have people that love you. I'm one of them. But you're a very, very special guy. What you do for this country, people have no idea how important your voice is. So I just wanted to personally make this one and I said, "I'll even dial the number myself if I have to."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I just want to congratulate you. Thirty years in that tough business is incredible -- and you're stronger now than ever before.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Well, I -- I thank you so much. It's such a thrill to hear from you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's a thrill to be on.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> I told you, any time you want to appear here, you are more than welcome. I don't want to hound you by asking you because everybody's doing that, trying to get you. But, man, this is great. I'm so flattered. While I have you, can I say something back at you here?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, go ahead, Rush. Go ahead.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> Are you aware...? I have to think you are when you go to your rallies.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> Are you aware of what you mean to everybody who voted for you and I think a bunch of who didn't who want to the next time around? People have invested their hopes and their futures in this country being made great again and saved in you. Are you...? When you're alone -- which you may not ever be. But when you're alone in the White House, do you think about that? Do you ponder what you've come to mean to people?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I love these people. And, you know, you probably saw last night I was in Florida and we had 9,000 seats in the auditorium.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Oh, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That was packed, and we had thousands outside and in these rooms all over the place. I guess they had at least 15,000, 18,000 people that couldn't get in last night -- which I hate. So we're actually starting to put up big screens. I must tell you, it's such an honor to me to see this. This love!
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know if you were able to see it last night, any of them. I mean, there's such tremendous love. I'm going to Ohio on Saturday, and tomorrow I'm going to Pennsylvania, and it's the same thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's like the enthusiasm -- and part of it is that they've really been mistreated for so many years by the politicians. The country's been mistreated. The trade deals were so bad. The taxes were so high. The tax cuts are so good; they've been so appreciated by so many people. The cut in regulations maybe is just as important as the tax cuts because businesses are hiring like they haven't, like they've never hired before.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, you know, we have a more interesting stat: We have more people working in the United States today than at any time in our history. And it's been so many different things are happening. So there's a tremendous amount of love in the room, and I am aware of it; there's no question about it.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> Mr. President, it was just a little over year and a half ago where your predecessor said that what is happening now couldn't happen again, that those days were gone, that those jobs that were lost were not coming back. And he would tell audiences this. And look at what you've done with the entirety -- seemingly the entirety -- of Washington's political class opposed to you.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> In a year and a half, you have reversed the direction the country was going. We have 4.1% economic growth. When you promised that, they accused you of misleading people because it couldn't happen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's right, Rush. You have a lot of bad people in Washington. You knew that a long time ago. Frankly, before I knew it. I had no idea how evil some of them are, but you have a lot of great people too. And outside of Washington you have the greatest people in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you're right. You know, I've been saying 4%, but it should be much higher than that. You know, if you do good trade deals -- which I will. You see what's going on with China. You look at what's going on.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will tell you, NAFTA? They want to make a deal very badly. And, you know, we're putting 'em back in shape. They're horrible deals, the worst deals ever made by any country. You do that; you start lifting your GDP numbers way up also. Nobody ever ever talks about that. We're doing 4.1% with bad trade deals. We have horrible trade deals.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And our farmers, we're gonna open up markets for them. You know, but they're great patriots. They're... I watch them all the time where they're saying, "We trust our president."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, you know, they may take a short-term hit. But you look at farm and farming, it's been going down for 15 years. Soybeans, five years before the election, was cut in half! The price was cut in half. I wasn't there. So it's going to... A lot of things are happening that are very exciting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, you know, you look at the job numbers. You look at African-American, best ever. Hispanic, Asian, women, best ever! And it's been a lot of fun for me, but I see the happiness and the faces.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Like last night in Florida with that, you know, really massive crowd, you see the happiness and the love -- and nobody left. It's like you. Nobody turns off your show. It's like you can't. Nobody leaves. You know, I'll speak for an hour and 10 minutes, hour and 20 minutes. There wasn't a person that left that room.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was just... It was an absolute love fest, and it's going on all over the country, and a lot of it's the same message. Most of it, I think -- probably all of it -- is the same message that you give out so well every day, better than anybody.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Well, but your key... You know, I do understand it. I understand the bond that those people attending your rallies have with you and you with them. I've seen it. I know why it exists. And you are consistent.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Things you said during the campaign are things you still say today. You haven't given anybody reason to doubt you. You haven't betrayed anybody or made them think that you're going to. An example: Here you are suggesting that you'd be willing to maybe -- you'd talk about -- shutting down the government if that's what it took to get this wall built.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> Now the traditional Republican says, "Oh, no! No! Don't say that!" There you are saying, "Oh, yeah. I'll be glad to do it if that's what it takes."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I actually think it would be positive.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> People don't understand your voters rally to you for that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We had Obamacare repealed and replaced, and a man -- I won't mention his name. But a man at 2 o'clock in the morning went thumbs down, and he campaigned for years on repeal and replace. We had the chance. Nobody even spoke to him about it, because it was something that was unthinkable what he did, and because of that... But still, I have just about ended Obamacare. We have great health care. We have a lot of great things happening right now. New programs are coming out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We got rid of the individual mandate. But that was very disappointing to me that night -- and he did it because of me, probably. But that was very disappointing. That was a horrible thing he did to our country. And, frankly, it cost $1 trillion because we would have saved $1 trillion, on top of which we would have had good health care.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we're doing it a different way. We have to go a different route. But he cost us a trillion dollars. And the other thing is the wall. We've started it. It's like pulling teeth, though, getting these guys to get it done is. You have no idea how tough I've been. I say, "Hey, if you have a shutdown, you have a shutdown."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, the shutdown could also take place after the election. I happen to think it's a great political thing, because people want border security. It's not just the wall, Rush, as you know. It's border security. It's getting rid of catch-and-release, where you catch somebody, he can be a criminal of the highest order, and you have to release him! You catch him, you take his name, and you release him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then you have the visa lottery. It's a lottery system where you pick people out of a lottery. Well, the countries aren't giving us their best people. They're giving us people that they don't want. So we're taking people out of a lottery that the country doesn't want. We're getting some beauties. And then you have, you know, so many other things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to change the laws. We have the worst laws! How about chain migration? One person comes in and you end up with 32 people. The person that ran down 18 people on the West Side Highway, he's allowed to have -- and I think eight died. He has 22 members of his family in the United States because of chain migration.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we have to change this stuff, Rush. And we'll get it done, but we have to change it, Rush. If we don't change it, it will just go down, down, down. And it will get done. One way or the other, it's getting done. But I'd be willing to do it. And you could do it before the election or after the election.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Well, speaking of before, as a campaign issue, I saw a couple consultants say... I don't need to mention their names. They're Washington, D.C., professionals.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> They said that you need to drop this immigration stuff, Mr. President. You're cruising for defeat if you base the midterms on this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know. I've heard that. [Laughs]
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> You need to pivot back onto the economy, start telling people what a great economy we have, 'cause that's the only way the Republicans can have a chance of holding the House in the midterms. What do you think about that advice?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've heard them. Probably different people than you, but I've heard a lot of people saying, "Oh, don't do it before the election, we'll upset the applecart," and because we are doing so well economically we should do well -- and, you know, the polls are okay. It's very interesting. My polls are great, but the question is, "Is it transferable?"
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, it certainly was in Florida because you saw Ron DeSantis, who's gotten a tremendous -- you know, many, many, many points. The governor of Georgia where he was down by five and he won by 40 after I endorsed him. (chuckling) That was pretty good. That was almost like your endorsement. But, you know, we've had tremendous -- [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you take a look at Congressman Donovan from Staten Island where he was down by 10 and he wins by 24. So we've had a lot of impact. And that's why I'm going around. But I have to say that I have heard this theory. I happen to think it's a good thing politically. I'm not doing it for politics. I'm doing it because it's the right thing to do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I'm not looking at politics. But I happen to think that border security would be a good thing before the election, but there are many people within our party that are good people that are like you that agree with you on everything you say. But they'd rather do it after.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They don't agree on doing it before, and I accept their opinion, but I happen to think it would be a good thing to do before. I actually think we'd get more and there'd be more pressure on the other side, because we're doing it because the Democrats are not giving us the votes.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> I think immigration is the largest reason you got elected, your consistency on that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well...
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> I mean, it reverberates all across the country. There are people that the media, the inside-the-Beltway denizens are never gonna understand about this issue that you do. You've just articulated it, and you have articulated the thinking of what I think is a vast majority of people in this country. It'd be silly for you to abandon this issue now, going into the midterms.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, if you do it before, there's a lot more pressure to get a great solution. But it's riskier. If you do it afterwards, there's less pressure; there's less risk. I'm just not sure you'd make as good a deal. I will say a lot of people -- good people -- you know, would ask me in the nicest of ways, "Could we do it after the election?" So --
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> I'll bet. (Laughs)
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, and they've been good to me. I've had a lot of good support within the Republican Party, and you saw the poll numbers in the Republican Party. They like me so I have to keep them a little bit happy. But whether it's before or after? But I actually think it's a great campaign issue. I think it would be great before.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I don't want to disappoint a lot of very good people that are working with me -- and, Rush, I have to tell you, I've got some really good support within the Republican Party, too.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Well, you do, and you have your staff. Are you basically...? Are you still following your gut, your instinct, or are you relying more and more on the circle of advisers you trust?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think it's largely instinct. I have some great people. I really do. You know, you heard me tell the story last night maybe where, you know, I've been in Washington 17 times. In my whole life, I never stayed here. Now, all of a sudden, I'm riding down Pennsylvania Avenue and I'm president. So I don't know a lot of people. Now I think I know everybody in Washington. I never stayed a night in Washington, I don't believe. And, you know, I've probably been here 17, 18 times.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm from New York. But very rarely. And, all of a sudden, I'm president. And like Mike Pompeo. What a change that was. Mike is doing an incredible job. What a terrific guy -- and I know you like him and he likes you. But we have some great people, and I've made some changes. But we're really close to getting a fantastic -- really just a fantastic group of people. We have some really great ones, and I think that's reflective on the success that we're having as an administration.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Well, I thank you again for calling me today. This is the pinnacle, the greatest thing that could happen today. The last thing I expected was to hear from anybody 'cause I've given orders not to do anything unusual, and here you are. You've made the day for me. I can't thank you enough, and God bless you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you. You know, people don't realize what a great achievement 30 years is in that cutthroat business that you happen to be in. You know, you might not find that 'cause you're so good at what you do. But that is a cutthroat business, and for you to do this for 30 years is truly an amazing accomplishment, and there's no voice like it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Even your friend Hannity agrees with that. Donald Trump
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> No way!
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He calls you "the dean."
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> No way. He was a guest host. He guest hosted for me when we first started. Absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, he's great. He's a tremendous fan of yours. They all are. Everybody is. So I just want to congratulate you. Thirty years of... Just do it for another 30 years. After that, you can take it easy, okay?
<Rush Limbaugh> <Neutral> I will do that. Just that. I will stay around as long as you do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. You have a deal.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Thank you, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And thank you very much, Rush. So important what you do. Thank you.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Thank you, sir, again, very much.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Take care of yourself. Good-bye.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> President Trump. We went a little long there, but that's okay.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right, we're in beautiful Fayetteville, North Carolina, a special edition of "Hannity" with a lot of our friends! [Cheering]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Thank you for being here. [Cheering]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> We have for the full hour the leader on the GOP presidential nomination side. Let's give a warm North Carolina, Fayetteville, welcome, Mr. Donald Trump! [Applause, Cheering]
<Audience> <Positive> Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! [Applause, Cheering]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Grab a seat. Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is a big deal.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> It's a big deal. Mr. Trump, I want you to know we here on FOX, unlike a lot of the rest of the media -- I noticed that when you have big crowds -- we've had to turn away thousands -- we show the full crowd, so I know that you've talked about that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. It's always nice to show the crowd. We have a great crowd. This is beautiful. [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know, Sean, right outside, like about a mile down the road, we have another crowd right after this.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Of 12,000 people.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, 12,000, 13,000, 14,000 people. Who's going there? Is anybody going? [Applause, Cheering] [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Thanks for being -- all right, you are maybe one week away. If you were to win Florida and Ohio, and polls show that -- the RealClearPolitics average is about -- you're plus-18 in Florida.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> There's a FOX poll that came out today that showed you more than double Marco Rubio, at 43 percent to his 20 percent. [Applause, Cheering]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> If you win Florida and Ohio, you are well on your way to the nomination to be the Republican nominee for president. How would that make you feel? [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It would make me feel great because we're going to beat Hillary... [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... and we're going to make America great again. [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It would make me feel great.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes. You know, I want to -- I know that you've talk a lot -- and I've had an opportunity, and I'm thankful for the opportunity -- I've interviewed you and all the candidates throughout this process, and I watch the criticism. I watch the debates.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> These debates have been getting pretty fierce, right? And I want to give you an opportunity, if this does happen to you, what -- how do you fix our broken economy? I just told this crowd we have 95 million Americans out of the labor force, 50 million in poverty, 46 million on food stamps. You know, all these young people, we have stolen from all our young children. We've doubled the debt. This president will accumulate more debt than every other president before him combined. Walk us through the details. How do you fix it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. So what's happened to the country is trade deals done by incompetent people. We have incompetent people. [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We've made terrible trade deals. What we've done even worse than trade in the pure sense is our companies are leaving because we almost encourage companies to get out of the country because we have no policies. We don't know what we're doing. Other countries devalue their currencies, and they make it impossible for companies to stay. You see Carrier leaving, they announced last week, 1,400 people. Ford is moving massive operations into Mexico. Nabisco is leaving Chicago. It's not going to happen with me, Sean. That's not going to happen with me. and you go... [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You go -- and I know North Carolina very well, by the way, because I have property in North Carolina, you know, in Charlotte.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Is there any state you don't have property in?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not too many. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But actually, I have a -- on Lake Norman -- does anybody know Lake Norman? [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's an incredible property, trump National, and it's like an incredible property and with great people and great members, and everybody's happy, the most beautiful homes you've ever seen. And this is a great part of the world, but they also -- they lose industry. They're losing tremendous industry.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we're losing industry all over the country. And they're moving. They're moving to other places. A lot of them are moving to Mexico. Don't underestimate -- it's like the new China on a smaller level, but like the new China. So we will bring our jobs back, Sean. We're going to bring our jobs -- as sure as you're sitting there, we are going to bring out jobs back into this country for the first time! [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we're going to stop -- we're going to stop being the country that's just pushed around, you know? Recently, you saw Vicente Fox. He was the former... [Booing]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> He was on my T.V. show. He and I had a big fight.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh. OK, well, I...
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You missed that edition.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he said, We will not pay for the wall, and he used the word, right? He used the "F" word. And I said, Can you imagine if I used that word? With him, it wasn't even like a scandal, I thought he'd be in the front page of the papers. He said, We will not build that you-know-what wall.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I said Whoa, whoa. That's terrible. But actually, what he ultimately said, he said, We're not going to finance it. We're not going to pay for it. And I said to myself, wow, we've made -- you know, he would never say -- they would never agree to it. Now they're saying they're not going to pay for it. They will pay for the wall. We're going to build the wall. We're going to pay for the wall. We're going to stop businesses from leaving our country, and we are -- they are being... [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they are being drained out of our country, our jobs, our money, our base, and our factories. We are -- we're going to stop this.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You don't expect he's going to write a check, but what you're saying is that they will have to make concessions.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there's many different ways.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> So in other words, you don't expect Mexico to say...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> ... Yes, Mr. Trump, here's a check for $10 billion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because politically, it's not feasible. It wouldn't look good.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> So you think the deals that you make will more than compensate for the wall.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, even if we tax them. We may tax them, OK? It doesn't make any difference. Look, we lose a tremendous amount of money. We have a trade deficit with Mexico, $58 billion a year. People don't know that. The wall's going to cost $10 billion dollars, OK? That's a Trump wall, beautiful wall. It'll be done properly. [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It'll be way up there, Sean. You'll be very proud of it. And it'll look good, too, as good as a wall can look. And it's going to have a door in it, you know, a big, big -- a really beautiful door. You know what that means, right? People are going to come in...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Legally.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... but they're going to come in legally. They're going to come to our country. [Applause, Cheering]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You know I've been to the border 10 times, and -- I should tell these -- I went out with border patrol -- hi. I've been out on border patrol agents on horseback, all-terrain vehicle. I've been there with them when gang members were arrested. I've seen drug warehouses. I saw a tunnel in a San Diego office building dug from Mexico up through that office building. And we know the statistics. Here's the questions. I want to get back to the economy. Government spending is out of control.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> True.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> How do you -- how do we stop the growth of government?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I've been watching him for so many years, and you can learn from this guy and you can learn from the guests. You know, sometimes, you get criticized. Oh, he gets his information from television. Well, the people that write the greatest of all papers are always on television, also.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Good point.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I do watch this one right here, and he had a thing called... [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We can learn. We can learn from our Sean. He's got a thing called the penny plan. It's a very simple plan, right?
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Want me to tell it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Go ahead.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> [Inaudible] one cent out of every dollar every year for six years, you balance the budget. No more increases built into government spending. They've got to live within their means. [Applause, Cheering]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> It's amazing. [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Except the military.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You would not cut the military -- you would increase spending on the military.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would. I would increase on the military, but I'd take more than a penny out of certain [Inaudible] ... [Applause, Cheering]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> What do we do -- every time you look at the equation -- all right, you got discretionary spending, and then we have Social Security and Medicare, the third rail.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Would you consider raising the retirement age? Would you consider maybe getting rid of cost of living benefits...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> ... COLAs?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... going to leave it the way it is. And I'll tell you what.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to make our country so rich, it's going to be so good. We're going to make it good again. We're going to make it vibrant again.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We had no growth in the last two quarters, essentially no growth. It's unheard of. If China gets down to 7 percent, just like they're going to have a national catastrophe. We have nothing. We have nothing left. We've been stripped. If we get our growth up to 4 percent or 5 percent, and I think that's absolutely doable, we can pay for everything. We can have plenty of money left over for infrastructure. You know, the infrastructure of our country -- and it's also great jobs, but the roads, the airports, the hospitals, the tunnels, the bridges...
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You don't think we'll have to cut entitlements?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to cut entitlements, no. I don't want to...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> All right, so let me then...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to cut entitlements.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I want to... [Applause, Cheering]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> There's two issues that you have discussed with me in detail, and I want -- maybe if you can explain to this audience. The money the corporations have overseas...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> ... trillions of dollars...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Corporate inversion.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> ... and you talk about -- corporate inversions, repatriating the money...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> ... and energy independence and the number of jobs that will be created doing that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Exactly. Well, look, we spend a tremendous amount of money on energy in the sense that we're protecting all of these people that don't like us too much, folks.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'll give you an example. Saudi Arabia -- no problems with Saudi Arabia. They were -- before the prices went down, they were making a year ago -- they were making a billion dollars a day, a billion a day, money that -- like nobody's ever seen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We protect them for peanuts, for practically nothing, and we've spent a tremendous amount of money. South Korea -- when you want a television set, we go to South -- LG, Samsung, they're all made in South Korea. It's a monster in terms of economic -- that goes with air-conditioning, it goes with so many different things, even ships coming out of South Korea.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at China. You look at so many different -- you know that we actually have a -- it's not a lot anymore, but we actually subsidize China. We give them subsidies for certain things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You've seen that, too. It's sort of a little bit of a scandal. It's not a huge amount of money, but it's still money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're subsidizing things in China. But Japan -- we protect Japan. Now, Japan's interesting because we protect them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If we're attacked, they don't have to do anything. If somebody attacks Japan, we end up in World War Three. We have to go and fight for Japan, but they don't have to fight for us. I mean, this is the way it is. Germany -- we take care of Germany. We protect Germany. Now, the money we spend on our military is massive, and everyone says we spend 10 times more money than everybody else. But we're spending it protecting other nations. And many of those nations are very rich. They've got to pay up. We want their help. They've got to pay up, OK? They got to pay up. [Applause, Cheering]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Let me ask this... [Applause, Cheering]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I think -- I don't think there's a person in this crowd that isn't worried about their health care.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> We have "Obama care."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You said... [Booing]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I think we came to the right town.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The health care savings accounts is something that -- I know you like it, but yes, we could have "Romney care," right? [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> See how that's worked out in Massachusetts, right? That's been a beauty. Look, we -- we have -- you know, you have concepts. You have different concepts of health care.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But one thing, we don't have any competition. There's no competition. We're going to let there be tremendous competition. And the health care savings accounts -- I'll tell you something, so inexpensive for the people, so inexpensive for the country. You know, "Obama care" is going to destroy -- you talk about budgets. In '17 -- here's the good news -- it explodes, unless the Republicans give him more money. You know, they gave him more money in this last budget to keep it going. It's going to implode. It's going to -- it's...
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> How was -- you mentioned last...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I'm going to be president when it implodes. I'm going to get the blame when "Obama care" implodes. [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not good.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> But you'll replace it with health savings accounts...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> ... with competition and portability.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You can take it job to job.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You can take it from place to place.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And I could buy -- if I wanted to buy health insurance here in North Carolina, even though I'm stuck in New York, where I pay an unreal rate of taxes, I'd be able to do that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You can do that. And you can move around. And it's sort of like ownership.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's almost like ownership. And it also gets people to negotiate with their people. Like, you see a doctor, you can negotiate with him because you don't want to use too much of your money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, it's really an asset. Right now, we have plans that are so out of control. And "Obama care" is out of control. The cost of "Obama care" by 2017 will be astronomical. You know when you see -- to the country, it will be astronomical. And by the way, the premiums are going up 25, 35, 45 percent. People -- is that correct? Right? [Applause]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And more.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. And more.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And more.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People are absolutely getting killed. So it won't exist in 2017. It'll explode. It'll blow up.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You know, young people have been -- the way this is designed, it's like a Ponzi scheme, "Obama care," where young and healthy people pay for the sick, the elderly and the disabled. Young -- most young people, all they really need is a catastrophic plan, high deductible. If God forbid they had an accident, God forbid they got cancer, then they would be given the help that they need, and they can incentivize a checkup a year. That's a lot cheaper than...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the problem is...
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> ... if you stub your toe.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The thing with "Obama care" is the young people aren't joining. And the people that they really want to pay for other people that do have difficulty -- I mean, you know, preexisting and difficulties -- those people aren't joining. The people with difficulties are all joining. And it's just not working.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It never was going to work. It never had a chance to work.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Stay right with us. We have Mr. Donald Trump for the entire hour. We're in beautiful Fayetteville, North Carolina. [Applause, Cheering]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Hannity on the Road continues straight ahead. [Applause] [Commercial Break] [Applause, Cheering]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> And welcome back to beautiful Fayetteville, North Carolina, "Hannity on the Road," as we continue for the entire hour with 2016 Republican front-runner Donald Trump. All right, Mr. Trump, let me talk a little politics process with you. You saw this meeting that took place in Sea Island, Georgia. Mitch McConnell was there, a lot of rich millionaires and billionaires. [Booing]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You heard the speech of Governor Romney. There seems to be a concerted effort to prevent you from getting the 1,237 delegates because they want a brokered convention. They want a contested convention. John Kasich said, Well, that would even be exciting, and he acknowledged to me that would be the only path he would have to the nomination.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's the only way he can get it. And he's got a lot of problems, I think, in Ohio. Look...
<Unidentified Female> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, I think. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, it's very sad. I heard 59 planes flew in from all over the world. These are people that are taking advantage of our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> These are people that I know many of them. I can even look at their plane and say who owns this one, who owns that one. I know them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they're all flying in because, you know, they don't want to have strong borders. They want stuff flowing across the borders. They don't want to have taxation when countries treat us unfairly because they benefit from that. And we have to. Otherwise, we're going to continue to lose our businesses. I mean, you have China sending things into this country, no tax, no nothing. If you want to do business in China, it's almost impossible. And if you get your product there, you're going to pay a tremendous tax. But so -- you know what? I want -- I want beautiful, free borders. I want everything to be nice, but it doesn't work.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> But this is a concerted -- this is a concerted effort to prevent you from getting the nomination, and it appears, based on the names of the people there, that they're willing to spend millions and millions and tens of millions of dollars to stop you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, they've already spent it. I mean, we had -- we had a great night last night. [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love you. It's a great group. Look, we -- didn't we have a great night last night? Was that... [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What happened last night with all the victories, I mean, that was a tremendous -- even my -- even some of these pundits who are the absolute worst, least talented -- I won't talk about them on your show...
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... because they happen to be on FOX, many of them.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Oh.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I will say, they... [Laughter]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Pound the host, all right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They even said...
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- that was a...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That was a phenomenal evening for Trump. And you know, the victories -- and not only the victories, the victories, the margins of -- they were landslides. They were all landslides. So here's what... [Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Here's what -- here's what's happening. The biggest story in politics today is the fact that during the Republican primaries, so many people -- millions and millions of additional people are showing up to vote. It is a phenomenon. It's been on the cover of Time magazine numerous times. I've been on the cover of Time magazine, like, four times in a short period of time, can you believe it? [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've been on, I think -- I think two times in my lifetime, and I've been on four times. This is -- politics is really a lot of fun. But the fact is, we -- we have -- altogether, we have a movement going on. And it's a movement of competence and common sense...
<Unidentified Male> <Positive> You're a great [Inaudible] , Donald Trump!
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And -- thank you. It's a movement -- it's a movement of competence and common sense and low taxes and...
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Last...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- and so many other things...
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Last time...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... and by the way, and borders, and borders... [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And...
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Last night, you said something...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they would be so foolish, Sean, to give it away.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I agree with you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Millions of people, they would be so foolish to throw that away.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> When you see the numbers and the percentages, this percentage increase on the Republican side, clearly, the energy is there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> On the Democratic side, it is depressed. It's down 35...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Thirty-five percent down.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> ... 40 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> So last night, you talked about reconciliation. You talked about unity. You talked about bringing the party together, electing Republican senators and congressmen, and even conversations with Paul Ryan. Bring us in that conversation. How are -- how are these people...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right...
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> -- that are right there now responding to you behind the scenes?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, some have called me, and some it's very personal and very quiet and confidential. And I've been called by the biggest people in the world of politics. I've been called by certain establishment people that you wouldn't even believe.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was called by Paul Ryan, who was very, very nice. He couldn't be -- I like Paul Ryan. I've all -- always liked. I like maybe a little bit stronger border than he would like, and that's OK and we can get that done. But he called and he was -- he was very, very -- it was very, very good that he did.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You said something else last night...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And others -- and by the way, and others.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Some have questioned -- you've been -- look, you're a tough businessman, a fighter. Some of the debates we were discussing with the crowd before have gotten very intense and -- and some said, Well, Donald Trump -- this is what Mitt Romney was saying -- doesn't have the temperament to be president. You said last night, I can be as presidential as anybody. Talk... [Applause, Cheering]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Talk about the temperament that you think a president needs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, it -- it's actually quite a complicated subject. I had 17 -- there were 17 people that started, all capable people, you know, senators and -- and governors. I mean, we're not talking about babies. And they got there by -- by guile and intelligence. So I started off with 17. Everybody that's attacked me is gone. Do you ever notice that? Wouldn't that be nice for our country? Everybody... [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we're now down to four. But you know, when I'm doing that, I can't be so nice. When I'm being attacked viciously -- I mean, Jeb was very vicious.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They were all very vicious. And they're all gone. And they're gone, like, where their poll numbers were 11 and then they attacked me and they go zero and they say bye-bye.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And these are not people that like me. And these are among the people that are, you know, ganging up to try and do something. Look, I -- I feel -- number one, I know this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I could be the most presidential person other than -- I always joke and say other than Abe Lincoln. He was pretty good. He was a serious president, right? He had the serious president look. But I was a great student. I went to the best schools, all that stuff. I mean, I have what it takes. But you have to -- when somebody's attacking you personally and attacking you viciously, I guess they say you should -- some people say, Just stand up and let them say whatever they want. You're presidential. It doesn't work that way. I would be run out of town... [Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... if I did that -- it doesn't work that way.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, Sean...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> No, I'm listening.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> At the right time -- at the right time, I will be so presidential that you'll call me and you'll say, Donald, you have to stop that. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But -- but you know what? It -- it is true, and I think you understand, when they attack me, I have to attack back. I'm a counter-puncher. When they attack me, if I don't attack back -- you know, the press could say, Oh, he should act more presidential. And then like a couple of days ago, I gave a speech, they said, That was so presidential. I can be presidential. But when you're being attacked and when you attack back, they say it's not presidential.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> But I see after -- after you've had victories and you hold these press conferences...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> ... that's more the person -- I've known you for 15-plus years or 16 years. That's the person that I've always known. Now, it's going to be a little different scenario. I know the Democratic playbook. Assuming it's Hillary -- and I know how you feel about that. [Booing]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Assuming -- assuming it's Hillary, they're going to say Republicans are racist, sexist, homophobic. They want to poison the air, water, kill children, throw granny over the cliff -- oh, and they hate America. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it's what they did with Romney, and especially [Inaudible] ...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> That's what they do all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... especially with Paul on entitlements. Remember the famous wheelchair over the cliff and all.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But look, I was hit only once by Hillary, and that was four weeks ago. And we haven't heard from her since. And I... [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And -- and I will tell you -- and I will tell you, I was not given proper credit because she went down during that period of time, and they gave the credit. When Bernie Sanders all of a sudden started doing, well, they gave all the credit -- I did a big favor to him. But she said something about me, and I said something very strong about her and Bill. It was just to counter. I haven't even started on her yet. And let me just tell you this... [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The one person she does not want to run against is me, that I can tell you. You know, I watched... [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I watch -- I watch on your show, Ted Cruz, and I watch these people, and they say Oh, well -- number one, I'm beating her beautifully in polls. In fact, one came out today where I'm beating her very nicely in polls. But I haven't even started on her yet.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> So you're saying this is a preview of coming attractions.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, I'm just saying we're going to win. I'm just saying we're going to win.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the other guys aren't going to win. One thing I do that nobody else can do, I'm going to bring places like Michigan into play. Nobody else is going to win. Ted Cruz and -- and Rubio -- I think Rubio is out of it now. But Ted Cruz -- Ted Cruz is not going to win Michigan. Ted Cruz is never going to win Michigan. [Applause, Cheering]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> We've got to take a break. We're in beautiful Fayetteville, North Carolina. It's "Hannity on the Road." We'll continue with the GOP presidential front-runner, Donald Trump. "Hannity on the Road" continues. [Applause, Cheering] [Commercial Break]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> And welcome back to beautiful Fayetteville. We're in North Carolina. We're on the road with "Hannity," and the GOP presidential ont-runner of the moment, Donald Trump, is with us. [Applause, Cheering]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I want to give you an opportunity -- you're in the -- or you're on the debate stage, and you're always in the middle. I guess that's good because that means leading in the polls.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Every -- every single debate.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, so far.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to keep it that way folks, OK?
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> All right, but... [Cheering]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> ... the biggest criticism -- and when I read social media about you, is some people that are on the conservative side, they listen to Ted Cruz's attacks, they listen to Rubio's attacks, the other opponents, and they say Donald Trump's not going to be a conservative because he was not a conservative in New York. Tell us where you are conservative in your mind, what kind of conservative you are, how do you define conservatism?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So let me start off by saying it's true, years ago and -- and 100 percent, I was a businessman. One of the magazines said Donald Trump is a world class businessman. I had to get along with everybody.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'd get along with everybody. I didn't know I'd be running for office someday. In fact, I was told if you're very successful, you basically can't run for office. And I understand that because you go under a microscope. But I took -- I was friendly with everybody. I helped everybody. I contributed to everybody. And to be honest with you, when I needed somebody or I had to make a phone call, everybody took my call. I got along. That's very good. That's not a bad thing, that's a good thing. [Applause]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I think people understand that. [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And that includes Hillary. It included everybody. If I needed a secretary of state, they were there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, that's what we're supposed to do. When I saw the country going so bad, when I saw the Iran deal being made and I said, don't make that deal, I see so many things going wrong, I see these horrible trade deals, I said, Let's do this. I'm going to go -- I'm going to run, and let's see how it works out. I -- I decided to run. And from literally June 16th, I've been number one. And as you say, it's center stage.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, what happens is this. I'm a conservative person. I'm very conservative in many respects, but I'm a conservative person, but I like to say a common sense conservative because I'm conservative on independence in energy. I'm very, very, very conservative on the border and on all of that. I'm extremely conservative on the military. We're going to rebuild our military. It's going to... [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- than ever before. I'm very, very conservative on our vets. Our veterans are treated horribly and we're going to take care of our veterans. [Applause]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> we're going to treat -- we're going to take care of our veterans. Our veterans are treated -- honestly, our veterans are treated, in many cases, worse than illegal immigrants who come across and -- and have a lot of -- pose a lot of problems. I'm very, very conservative when it comes to education. We're getting rid of Common Core. We're going to have local education. [Applause]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We've already discussed repealing and replacing ObamaCare. It's going to happen.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You'd put education back to the states completely?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, 100 percent.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> All the money would go to the states?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let's put it back to the states. Yes, because it's better, absolutely. [Applause]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, Sean, it's interesting, we are in the top 30. We're number 30 in the world, the United States. Number 30 in the world on education, right? We're last, number 30 in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have Sweden and Norway and Denmark and China number one and, you know, one through four. But we're number 30, and yet we're number one per pupil in terms of money spent. So we spend more per pupil. And number two doesn't because they're so much less expensive. So we spend the most by far, and we're at the worst part of the list. It's not going to happen anymore, Sean. We're going to bring it back to the local. I've seen it. I've seen where the parents are involved. The parents love their kids. [Applause]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've seen it. The local education is the way to go.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Is there anything that you think you're liberal on?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not liberal. I mean, but I am common sense. Look, here's the one thing that the conservatives can get me -- free trade.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm a free trader, just so you understand. But free trade has to go along with the word smart trade. I don't want to be a free trader, you know, it's free on our side, but on their side, they're killing us, OK? Like China.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I have great relationships with China. And I made a lot of money in China. I've made a fortune in China dealing with China. And I don't blame China. I blame our leaders. I wish our leaders were doing -- they -- they currency manipulate greater than anybody in the history of the world.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> So then here's my question. So every time your opponents are attacking you, are they attacking your old positions and not --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They like to attack the old positions and they also say I'm not a free trader. Let me tell you --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> So this is my --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love free trade --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> -- here's my other question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Trump, we don't have the capability. Our leaders aren't smart enough to deal with the other leaders. These guys in China, in Mexico, in Japan, these are total killers. These are smart, smart people. They stay awake at night thinking about what to do, whereas Obama is out playing golf, OK?
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You've also said -- [Applause]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You've also said -- you've -- you've explained from the first day -- debate on how you became pro-life. You're very pro-Second Amendment. I know your son Don is a big hunter and --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Totally.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And you carry a gun in New York?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I do. And I'm a member of the NRA. [Applause]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So my -- and my -- and my sons are members of the NRA.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> If all of -- do you pledge -- I guess for those people that write me on Twitter and Facebook and say Hannity, you're too nice to Mr. Trump and you don't challenge him on his conservatism, are -- is it your promise and pledge that everything you just listed, energy independence, cutting the budget, the penny plan, the military, the borders -- hang on. If everything you're saying, is that a promise and a pledge? This is you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's a pledge. You know why it's a pledge?
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I wouldn't do that if I thought --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Who wouldn't pledge that stuff? I mean it's like basic common sense. [Applause]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I remember when Jeb -- and Jeb Bush is a nice guy, but I know Jeb would stand up and say he is not a conservative. He would look in the -- he is not a conservative. And he'd look in the camera. And people would say, so what. I mean, do you want to have -- and he'd say it, to a large extent, because of free trade. I am totally for free trade, but it's got to be a double -- it's got to be a double --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You think that's the main thing that --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, no --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Let me ask you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- it's draining --
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> One other issue comes up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sean, it's draining our country. It's draining our country.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I agree with you. I'm not disagreeing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know what? If we had smart leaders -- the problem with free trade is you need smart leaders on your side, too. And we don't have those people. But Carl Icahn, the smartest people in the world are in our country, business leaders. I have them lined up. I have Carl Icahn.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You have --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have Steve Wynn is so incredible. He's a smart guy.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Steve?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know Steve.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Phil Ruffin, Andy Beal, one of the greatest bankers in the world. These are super brilliant guys, make so much money when the market goes bad. He always gets it right when it goes good, he gets it right. I have the smartest people in the world. They're ready to come and help. We use political hacks to negotiate our deals and we lose all the time.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Can I interpret from that statement that you would -- [Applause]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> -- that you would take in a lot of people from outside government? For example, you started with 17 people. Some of these governors, by the way, did have very solid records in their states.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, sure.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Because I think they've governed more conservatively. I think Republicans feel betrayed by Washington Republicans because they haven't stood up to Obama. They would not use the power of the purse. [Applause]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> They made promises they can't keep. Would you -- would you hire -- the people, in your mind, that you would want to surround yourself with --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Here's where you're wrong on -- I've never said he was wrong on anything.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Oh, boy, here we go.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But let me just tell you where you're wrong.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Now I feel like Chris Christie. Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Even the people on the stage, like -- like Ted Cruz. You know I mean, I will tell you, they are controlled by the donors. They are controlled by the special interests.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> I don't disagree with you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They are controlled --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> About --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are controlled by lobbyists, totally controlled by lobbyists.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I can tell you this --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> But if you're president --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- and I'm self-funding. I'm putting up my own money.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> But if you're president, wouldn't - [Applause]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> -- the people you hire listen to you? [Applause]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But they --
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, but, Sean, these guys are all controlled by the special interests, 100 percent. I mean look, I was there. I was a member of the establishment nine months ago, right? I was -- who was better at it than me? I was great at it. But I also saw it was wrong. And politicians will do what's right for the people that gave them the money, not what's right for the country.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Let me -- a quick follow-up, and we don't have a lot of time in this segment. [Applause]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And I want to ask this. Are you really committed to -- to creating a political earthquake -- that's the best term I can come up with -- a revolution -- a revolution in DC where you are going to break down the core of corruption that exists in that city? Do you think you can do that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, well -- [Applause]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I have 30 seconds.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right. Let me tell you, Sean, I don't think we need an earthquake. We need -- we need intelligence, we need energy, we don't have energy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We need certain things. We don't need the word "revolution." It's not going to be a revolution. We are going to make our country so great and so smart and so strong and we don't need the -- I mean the words, the words you used are beautiful words, but honestly, we're going to do it with less than that. We are going to do everything that you said, but it's not the word "revolution."
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> OK. I thought I turned my phone off. [Laughter]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right, we've got to take a break. We're in Fayetteville, North Carolina. We continue for the hour with Donald Trump. [Applause]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Thanks for being with us, HANNITY ON THE ROAD. [Commercial Break]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> And welcome to beautiful Fayetteville, North Carolina. It's HANNITY ON THE ROAD. We're glad you're with us for the full hour with Donald Trump. [Applause]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You know, so I got here today. I came in to the airport. And I ran into a friend of mine that's a mutual friend of Colonel Oliver North. Really great guy, and an American hero, and a great American, yes, sir. [Applause]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> And his former bodyguard, hi, how are you? Good to see you. He had a guy with him, and I want to bring him up. His name is Corporal Tony Porta. He's the head of Vets for Trump. I want him to tell you his story. [Applause]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Why don't you take my seat? Go ahead. I'll go stand off to the side. You sit down. So --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So nice. [Applause]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You told -- he's the head of Vets for Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great guy.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> How many tours of dirty did you serve?
<Tony Porta> <Neutral> One, sir.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> OK, and you have now been six years in recovery from a horrible IED explosion that killed two of you friends?
<Tony Porta> <Neutral> Yes, sir.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And you told me, and again this just happened today at the airport, you told me a horrible story about how the Veterans Administration is treating you. You're with Vets for Trump. And I thought you could tell him your story and hopefully get the story you want to hear and fixing the V.A. which has just been morally corrupt.
<Tony Porta> <Positive> Yes, sir. Congratulations.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Tony Porta> <Positive> Congratulations on last night. You did awesome.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That was good. He's been my friend. He's been my friend. Thank you, Tony. Thank you.
<Tony Porta> <Positive> My name is Corporal Tony Porta. I'm a U.S. marine. [Applause]
<Tony Porta> <Negative> I joined the Marine Corps 2005 because I wanted to do my part. I wanted to serve to protect my new country. So I deployed to Iraq in 2007. And May 5th, 2007, I lost two of my best friends. And I suffered these injuries. I really don't mind about my injuries. I'm really, really hurt by about my two friends. But I'm here for a reason. I'm here to fight. I'm here to help my fellow veterans. I'm here for them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Tony Porta> <Negative> So, I was really struggling. I was in San Antonio for six years, over 100 surgeries just to -- just to be this way.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK.
<Tony Porta> <Negative> So after that, I retired. I went back home. Home wasn't home anymore. So I moved to West Virginia. I moved to West Virginia in -- I went to many V.A.'s. A couple of V.A.'s were awful. Awful. I was there. I was waiting for appointments for several weeks. And now I'm going to smaller V.A. It's really good. I like it. It has a lot of problems. But I'm here for the other veterans. I'm here for them because I cannot -- [Applause]
<Tony Porta> <Positive> thank you. I cannot see my fellow veterans killing themselves for lack of help.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's terrible.
<Tony Porta> <Negative> I can't do that.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Let me -- only because of the constraints of time. I know you want to ask him. The vets have been treated horribly.
<Tony Porta> <Positive> That's true.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And you're sticking up for the vets and helping those with PTSD and those that have been suffering and those that have been mistreated like you have.
<Tony Porta> <Neutral> Yes, sir.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And your question is, what is the president going to do to fix this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. You know, Tony, it's been one of my big things. I've seen you around and I've been your friend to a sense and we're going to be better friends. But we have to help the bets. And you know it's always been a been big part, a staple in the speeches. I always mention the vets, and I don't mention the military without talking about the vets. The Veterans Administration is corrupt. It's a corrupt deal. [Applause]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I say this, and I say it very strongly. We're going to take care of the vets. And when they have to wait for two weeks and a week --
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Some died waiting.
<Tony Porta> <Negative> They die waiting. And we're going to make it so if they have waiting, we're going to move them out and get them to doctors in the area. It's going to cost less money, and we're going to take care of them immediately.
<Tony Porta> <Positive> Hospitals that are not even doing well in the area that can take them immediately. And we'll pay those bills, and I'll tell you what, Sean. It's going to cost a lot less money and we're going to save tremendous numbers of lives and have great medical care. But that's the beginning. We're going to take care of the vets. [Applause]
<Tony Porta> <Positive> One more thing, sir. I'm here representing vets for Trump. When you become president, I don't want you to work for those guys who are giving tons of money to a lot of people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Tony Porta> <Negative> I want you to work for us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right.
<Tony Porta> <Positive> For us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. [Applause]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You take care of yourself, OK? [Applause]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> We're going to take a break from Fayetteville, North Carolina, HANNITY on the road. More with Donald Trump when we continue. [Commercial Break]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Welcome back to Fayetteville. We're in North Carolina, HANNITY on the road with GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. [Applause]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I know I've asked you about this before. And we only have two minutes in this segment. It's a short segment, but ISIS, homeland security, I'm sure everybody worries about the next 9/11, God forbid, ever happens to this country. How do we defeat them? and do you think we need boots on the ground?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to knock them out. I was not, and I said it loudly, I am the most militaristic person in this room, other than maybe Tony. Tony might be bigger. [Applause]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I will tell you, I believe so strongly. But we have to know what to do, when to do it. We should not have been in Iraq.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We destabilized the Middle East. Now, then we got out wrong. Obama got us out so badly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When he announced a date and he announced we're going to move, I mean, who ever heard of a thing like this? So we got out very badly. We should have left people behind. We should have had a lot of other things. But we're going to knock out ISIS so fast. And we have to be a little bit unpredictable. Sean is saying, and I do, I have a specific thing, but we have to be a little bit unpredictable, Sean. I'm so tired of saying, well, we're going to attack from here and we're going to attack from --
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You don't want to telegraph it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to talk about it. I want to just do it. [Applause]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> We'll take a break, final moments as we continue from Fayetteville, North Carolina, HANNITY on the road with 2016 Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, stay with us. [Applause] [Commercial Break]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> And welcome back to HANNITY. We're in Fayetteville, North Carolina. [Applause]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right, last question, you said it to me once. If you are elected president and Loretta Lynch covers, if there is a criminal referral by the FBI and they cover for Hillary and they don't indictment her, you will pursue it? But we've got about 20 seconds.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The answer is you have to. [Applause]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Did you all have a good time tonight? [Applause]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Thank you all for being with us. Mr. Trump, thank you, we appreciate it. Good to see you. Thank you. That's all the time we have left. We're in Fayetteville, North Carolina. We'll be back here tomorrow night. As always, thank you for being with us.
