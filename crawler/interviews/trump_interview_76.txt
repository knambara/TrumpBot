<Question> <Negative> On David Bossie, I know that the campaign put out this statement on him and him using his group to sort of promote himself and using your image. Have you talked to him at all about that? We've heard that you've been frustrated.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have not. I have not. I would be disappointed in David if he did that. I guess historically people involved in campaigns go around. I mean, you know, if you look at anybody, anybody running for president. If they win, you always -- you start off with many people running and then you have a group of people that become known.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And David was one of the people. David -- you know, many people helped us. Many, many people, you know, helped me to win. And I've studied history, and I see a lot of people do very well after wins. But, I don't know. I just -- You folks did a story on this story, others did a story. I would be disappointed if everything wasn't on the up and up.
<Question> <Positive> Mr. President, you said on Twitter earlier today that you're confident Biden's going to beat Bernie and that he'll become the nominee. What makes you think that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just think so. Maybe I look at it like my race. If you remember, from the day I came down the escalator until the end of the primaries, I was in the number one position. I was center stage every debate. And you know, nobody came close. And I had -- I mean, I had a big lead pretty much from the beginning, and it got bigger, you know, as it went along, and as people started dropping out.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I look at it as analogous because we had 17 plus one. So we had 18, actually. You know we had Gilmore, if you remember.
<Question> <Positive> Oh, I remember.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Which a lot of people forget. But anyway, so we actually had 18 people. But they have – what do they have, 21, 22 people now, right? Something like that?
<Question> <Positive> That's right.
<Question> <Neutral> Why do you think –
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it seems that -- it seems that many of them aren't registering, as happened with '16. It seems as if many of aren't registering with the public. And Biden – for whatever reason, I don't get that -- but he seems to be – you know, have some kind of a register. Whether it's name or what.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he seems to be doing well. And Bernie seems to be going in the wrong direction. But everyone else is going -- I mean almost everybody else seems to be not doing very well. And so I would certainly say -- I make it analogous to my race in the sense that, you know, I rode it out. You know, they call it in sports: "good frontrunner." I don't know if Biden's a good frontrunner.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I heard him talking about he spoke to Margaret Thatcher yesterday. I mean, what he said is he spoke to Margaret Thatcher. I assume he meant Theresa May. So, I don't know, is that a good front runner? I don't know. That was a beauty.
<Question> <Negative> What do you think about Pete Buttigieg? I know you mentioned him once in your rally, but do you think he's a threat in any way?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Alfred E. Neuman cannot become president of the United States.
<Question> <Negative> And are you -- do you think, with Democrats talking about impeachment, do you think a failed impeachment effort by Democrats would benefit you politically? Because that's what kind of what happened with Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Is that what you –
<Question> <Positive> Do you want them to try to impeach you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, you know, it's all based on high crimes and misdemeanors. And if you look at the Mueller report, there was no collusion. There was no conspiracy. And there was no obstruction. He said that in the first half of the sentence, and then said he couldn't prove it. But there was no obstruction. And then the attorney general, based on the facts, and the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, they ruled there was no obstruction.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So you have no crime. And impeachment's based on crime. And, specifically it's based on high crimes and misdemeanors. Not "plus" or whatever -- it's "and" misdemeanors. Not separately, but together. So you need both. And, you know, look, I know it would be a very, very impossible thing. Plus, you know if you haven't had -- in fact, the crimes were actually committed, but they were committed by the Democrats.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They were committed by the DNC, the Clinton campaign, Hillary Clinton. Those were the crimes. They weren't committed by us. So I must say, you know you mentioned the word, I haven't heard that word in a while. Because since the report came out, it said no collusion, no obstruction, no conspiracy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that was the end. I haven't heard the word mentioned, really -- essentially -- since the Mueller report came out. And it's not like it's not like they were friends of mine.
<Question> <Negative> Are you also concerned about Sen. Richard Burr and that subpoena of Don Jr.? And have you talked to him or Leader McConnell about that in terms of --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I haven't spoken to him. And I'm very surprised by it because he went out about four weeks ago and said there is no collusion. So that's maybe a little bit different, you know, than what you're talking about. But I know that my son did testify. I know that Mueller went over his testimony -- and very, very strongly went over his testimony -- and found that he did absolutely nothing wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That was an oppo research meeting. And I would say that everybody in Washington has had those meetings. You know, your opponent -- "hey, we have information on your opponent. Would you like to hear?" I mean, you tell me how many politicians would turn that meeting down. And then it turned out she did that -- it turned out you didn't have any information.
<Question> <Negative> But are you frustrated that Republicans are subpoenaing your son? I mean, these are Republicans that are doing this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, not Republicans. It's a Republican.
<Question> <Positive> A Republican.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. And I won the state of North Carolina and frankly had another Republican won it, they would not have won the state. I have a great relationship to that state. So I was very surprised. He came in, ran along with me. I didn't know him well, but he ran along with me. So yeah, I was very surprised to see that.
<Question> <Negative> And you saw the Times report that Rudy Giuliani is going to Ukraine to urge them to pursue some investigations? I mean, have you talked to him about that? Does he have your blessing to do that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know much about it yet. Just very briefly, he had mentioned -- and he's involved with a number of people that are looking into the whole thing because a lot of very bad, a lot of very bad things took place prior to the election. A lot of very, very bad things took place. You know, they talk about "investigate the investigators." And when you look at what's happened with Strzok and Page and McCabe and Comey and all of the terrible things that took place, I think, you know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I have not -- I have not spoken to him at any great length, but I will. When is he leaving? I don't even know. When is he leaving?
<Question> <Negative> He's leaving soon. I think in the next couple days.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I see. Well, I will speak to him about it before he leaves. I'm just curious about that.
<Question> <Positive> But you're supportive of his effort?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That could be something also very separate. I will -- I'll speak to him before he leaves.
<Question> <Positive> And one more. Have you asked Bill Barr, or would you ask Bill Barr, to investigate Biden about his son's -- Biden's son's work in Ukraine? That's become a big issue.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I haven't spoken to him about it. But certainly it is a very big issue and we'll see what happens. I have not spoken to him about it. Would I speak to him about it? I haven't thought of that. I mean, you're asking me a question I just haven't thought of. Certainly, it would be an appropriate thing to speak about.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I have not done that as of yet. It could be a very big -- it could be a very big situation. Of course, because he's because he's a Democrat, it's about one 1/100 the size of the fact that if he were Republican, it would be a lot bigger. But anyway, go ahead.
<Question> <Negative> Thank you, Mr. President. The Pentagon said yesterday that North Korea has been firing short-range missiles. They confirm that's what they were yesterday. Do you consider this a breach of trust between you and Kim Jong Un? Are you angry or frustrated by by this? And how do you think we should be responding to that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No. I'm not at all. They're short-range. They're short-range and I don't consider that a breach of trust at all. And you know, at some point I may. But at this at this point, no. These were short-range missiles and very standard stuff. Very standard.
<Question> <Negative> You'd previously previously talked about how proud you were that North Korea had stopped firing these missiles, so you don't consider this a setback?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, this is -- actually, some of them weren't even missiles. Some of the things that they fired, they weren't even missiles. But this is short-range, and I don't consider it a breach of trust. I'll let you know when I do. I mean, it's possible that at some point I will. But right now, not at all.
<Question> <Negative> Are you considering a pardon of Paul Manafort or Roger Stone given that this Russian collusion thing is over, in your mind?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the Russian collusion thing has turned out to be a total hoax, and now people are saying it. But I have not given any consideration to any of that at this moment.
<Question> <Negative> And just one more. Have you talked to Steve Bannon at all, and would you ever consider sort of fixing your relationship with him? Or you just have no interest in working with him again?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I always liked Steve and I mean the last seven months or eight months, I mean, you can't have nicer statements stated about yourself than the things he's been saying about me, as you know.
<Question> <Neutral> Of course.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The greatest of all time," you know, etc., etc. But I haven't. You've seen what he's said on the various shows and you've seen what he's written. And that's very nice, and I appreciate it. But I haven't spoken to Steve in a while. Haven't spoken to Steve in a while.
<Don Imus> <Negative> It's a nine minutes half the hour. Here at Imus, in the morning program. Please, welcome in the program the next president of the United States, Donald Trump.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Good morning, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> How are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm good. I've been good.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> We're totally in the tank for you. Now, we decided.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know, I've been hearing, that's what the rumor is. It's a good rumor.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Let me ask you a couple of questions.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay.
<Don Imus> <Positive> The way Washington works I think... by the way you can get a congressman or senator to vote for something, but for some lobbyist to give a money. How do you change that culture?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> To vote for Trump, because it's going to be a much, much different deal. I'm self-funding my campaign, Don, I'm the only one, and you know on both sides I'm the only one self-funding my campaign. And the lobbyists are... they have a heavy big stake in this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They have a very, very big stake. They are supporting some of the candidates out right, and special interests, same thing. And you have tremendous amounts of money being poured down the drain in terms of the country. And that's the way it is, it's going to be very interesting to see what happens, but a lot of people like the fact that I'm self-funding and I'm not taking anybody's money.
<Don Imus> <Negative> I understand that, but my question... you know, actually it doesn't make any difference because party in Iowa and others have decided that we don't care how you answer the question, that doesn't make any difference. We want you to be elected that's... it's irrelevant, even in people I was talking about this was when I actually mean is, why I wouldn't say about they mean.
<Don Imus> <Negative> I think people who actually don't support you may not like you are going to be disappointed, if you don't get elected because nobody likes Hillary Clinton. I mean nobody likes her.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not too many, no, not too many. You think she'll make it, right? You think she's going to be able to get through. She's got some problems right now.
<Don Imus> <Negative> Well, I heard my friend Meghan Kelly last night saying that the FBI now has a 150 people on this case. Now, with all the terrorism in the world and other things that the FBI has to do. They're not going to devote a 150 agents to something... well, there's no substance to it.
<Don Imus> <Negative> So she may be in trouble.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She could be in big trouble. I mean you know the theory was that she's got to be protected by the Democrats, but she could very well be in big trouble, Don, we'll see. We going to know soon enough.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> How are you doing in Iowa?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think really well. A poll came out yesterday, I'm in number one place. The Quinnipiac poll, I'm in number one place again and it's a close contest Iowa. But I think we're going to do very well there and New Hampshire is fantastic.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, it's a very big lead, and South Carolina very big lead. And we're really... I think we're doing very well, overall doing very... I think we're going to do well in Iowa.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> You know what RFD is?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> RFD.
<Don Imus> <Positive> That's a television. It's the World Television Network. There are about 50 million homes and everybody on in Texas... everybody all in rural America.
<Don Imus> <Negative> That's all they want, not all they watch. But they get a lot of their information from our tape from us, at 3:45 on DirecTV. It's a great network particularly for reaching people in Iowa, so I have Manola guy who runs it. And he said could you get Trump to be on.
<Don Imus> <Negative> I said, I'll asked him. I sent some information over to your office, not getting a response. But they do know... that's not what they do.
<Don Imus> <Negative> They're going to ask a bunch of idiotic questions and nobody wants to answer. But they do... they had some of the candidates on and they do a thing out of Des Moines. And all these people who live and vote in Iowa watched them, and it would do a lot of good to go on.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> I think...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll go on. If you give me the info, I'll go on. I mean, it's fine. I would like that.
<Don Imus> <Positive> I'll send it to...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Rona.
<Don Imus> <Negative> I said I'll do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. I'll take care of it.
<Don Imus> <Negative> So when the Chinese market goes to hell, down 7$ the other morning in 29 minutes they shut it down. And idiots like me to think, oh good, I'm glad they're having problems. But really, and since I come to my senses I realize that then causes problems for us and for our market. So as president what would you do.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Is there anything you can do about that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's an overheated market. It's a market that's probably a bubble. We don't know that yet. It's looking like a bubble.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They shut it down. You know as soon as it's ready to explode they shut it down, Don. They do it a little bit differently than us. If it goes down a little bit too much, boom, they close it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They say everybody go home, no more trading. But it really is a bubble, it's a bubble waiting to you know bad things can happen and we're going to be taken down with it because we're so tied into China. They manipulate their currency to a... they have it down to a science.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're trying to do it more. They want to lower their currency further, so they can take more of jobs and more of our money. But we'll see what happens. I mean they are in trouble.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, they're overdoing it and they have a bubble and the bubble is at least starting to pop.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Well, my question is what could you do about it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you have to write it. I mean you have to really write it and you have to get less reliant on the Chinese market. Our country is so reliant on that boost of heroin that it is not good for our country. I've been talking about this for years, Don.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've been talking about it for you, with you for years. And the problem is their manipulation of currency is so massive and it's been so long that they've been doing this that they really... they put the United States in a very bad position in terms of competition, in terms of competing. And we have a trade deficit with China that's so massive now, it's over $500 billion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if you think about it, we have a deficit of over $500 billion a year with China. You know, it's wonderful to trade with people, but that's a lot of money for the sake of trading, so it's not good for us. It has not been good for us.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Talking with Donald Trump here in the Imus, in the morning program. So they captured El Chapo?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Somebody asked him about Trump and has said Mi Amigo, it means my friend.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. What do you mean by that exactly?
<Don Imus> <Negative> I don't know. What do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. Maybe he was being sarcastic. He could have been sarcastic because I was saying certain things he could have been all right... I don't know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean you know whatever, he is certainly an interesting character. In a world of boring people, Don, he's interesting.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> I know, hundred million dollar question here there for a while.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think so. I think so.
<Don Imus> <Negative> Maybe he has been sarcastic.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Maybe he was, who knows, but it was amazing when you see a tunnel go right up the shower and he leaves and I don't find him and he almost made it this time too. He had another tunnel. He's pretty good with tunnels. But he also...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> he came very close to making it this time.
<Don Imus> <Negative> Back to this Quinnipiac poll this morning showing you're ahead in Iowa. And we get John [Inaudible] I'm convinced... I'm actually being says... I don't mean how many dog in this obviously.
<Don Imus> <Positive> But because puts you over the top in Iowa because you win Iowa, and New Hampshire going to South Carolina, and your viewed, do you have to win all those?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think you have to. I think if I won Iowa, I think it's a big win for me because you know I'm very close right now. I mean it's between myself and Ted Cruz who is tied with sort of tied more or less. But if I won Iowa and I think a lot of people you know that theory has a lot of people are going to come out to vote for me, but it's not polled.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, I don't know, that's right, a lot of very smart people are saying that because I have the biggest scoops, if the people that come and see me speak go out and vote. Everybody says Trump will win. But the question is whether or not they'll go out and vote. Now, they stand on line for five hours.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So you say why wouldn't they go in for 15 minutes and vote, but we're going to find out, we're going to find out very soon.
<Don Imus> <Positive> We put out an Instagram ad showing photographs of the Clintons with Bill Cosby and Anthony Weiner, what's a message there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think the message was that she's not quite as pure as you would like to pretend. And she's got to be careful with what she says. You know, she said some things that were incorrect, and she has to be a little bit careful. She is not having a great campaign.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She is not having fun. You know, it's supposed to have fun in a campaign. I don't think Hillary is having fun.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Better great debate turn [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they say it would be great. And you know, they say that if we run we'll have the highest voter turnout in history, and I think that's right. Just look at the debates. I mean you know, from the ratings world, you're in it better than anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're doing really well by the way which is good. Makes me happy because we've been together a long time you and I, right? In a long time. I don't want to even say how long, but it's been a long time. You've been a great guy and I hear you're doing well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know, they say it's going to be the highest voter turnout in history in the history of the country. I think that's true. It will be great. And a lot of those people coming in will come for me because they're tired of the system.
<Don Imus> <Negative> Well, I started to notice, I think [Inaudible], notice the difference that all these rodeos and taxes, all anybody... I mean, you know there's something going on here. So does the people side him and say, would you... what do you think of Trump.
<Don Imus> <Negative> I mean... so start to spread across the country. So now Bernard and I, we might well be paid employees here because we're really in the tank for. We don't want to think, we just [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I want you to be totally in the tank. I mean... Bernard is been doing a good job, Don. But I expect you both to be totally in the tank.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Thank you very much. Donald Trump here in the Imus, in the morning program.
