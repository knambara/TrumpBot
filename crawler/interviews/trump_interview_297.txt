<Tom Brokaw> <Positive> Trying to scrape up a down payment for a little fixer-upper in your neighborhood? Take a look at my next guest. There is a report around Wall Street that this is what he has in mind. This is Donald Trump, 33 years old, and some people think that he wants to buy the World Trade Center -- the hundred and ten story Manhattan skyscraper that anyone can pick up if they've got the coins.
<Tom Brokaw> <Negative> Donald Trump, as I say, is just 33 years old. He took his father's rather modest -- by current standards -- real estate empire in Brooklyn, and expanded considerably. He now has an apartment for sale in a new Trump building called the Trump Tower, going up on Fifth Avenue. There it is. You can buy this apartment one floor of it -- one whole floor of that building that is -- $11 million all together. You... you bought some prize properties at the bottom of the New York market in the nineteen seventies -- inner cities have been pure gold since that time. Why? Because replacement cost of just gone up so much?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well no not really. I had a great faith in New York, primarily our purchases have been in New York, and at the... about five years ago in New York was not considered very hot and cities in general weren't considered too hot. And we purchased the old Commodore Hotel and we have reconverted that now into about a $110 million Grand Hyatt Hotel which is opening up next week in New York City, and we've made some other purchases that have been fine.
<Tom Brokaw> <Neutral> Is that your general advice to people who are interested in real estate investment though? Look to the inner cities, look to old buildings and doing something with that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I like the inner cities. I see the inner cities as being sort of a wave of the future now. I think with the... with the problems of fuel and the gasoline shortages and everything else and the transportation -- especially in the major cities such as New York and Los Angeles and Chicago. I see the inner cities as being probably, in terms of a real estate, or in a real estate sense, probably the most viable investments.
<Tom Brokaw> <Negative> But it's going to be expensive, apartments in New York City alone, one bedroom, not very large at all, $650 a month. That's tough of the working class, isn't it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that's actually now a very low price. In fact if you have any of them available i'd like to, maybe...
<Tom Brokaw> <Negative> I know where I can sell a thousand of them at that price. Actually, that is a low price.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's right. That's really a very low price. Now there... I know of a couple of buildings... For instance an Olympic tower which is on fifty first Street and first avenue, apartments are are being rented by the condominium owners for five and six thousand dollars a month. And they are one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments. So it's... when you say six hundred dollars even, in other section,s it's almost becoming a low price.
<Tom Brokaw> <Negative> What happens to some of the old buildings in the inner cities that are works of art? You were recently the object of a lot of controversy because you order destroyed some sculptures on the building that you bought that the Metropolitan art museum wanted. Why did you have those destroyed, first of all, and what happens to the look of the city?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, what we had is we... we purchased a site with an old department store on it, the old Bonwit Teller store on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, next to Tiffany, and we had to really take the building down, and there were many people that didn't want us to take it down. They wanted to try and preserve the building. But the building really was not worth, as an art building or an art deco building, it really was not worth very much. And we did take it down, and there was somewhat of an outcry. But I think that's generally subsided now, and I think people like what we're doing and like the building that we're putting in its place.
<Tom Brokaw> <Negative> But could you save just those sculptures that you had brought down?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it would have been very, very dangerous to have saved them. They were... they weighed two tons, they were 15 feet high, they were about two and a half feet thick. And if they would have fallen, and they could fallen the opposite way, if they fall into the building you don't worry. If they fall out towards Fifth Avenue, people could have been very badly hurt and killed and it just to me it was not worth it. And they've really proven not to be very valuable art structures right now. And we've had appraisals done. In fact even after the fact, we had appraisals done and they've turned out not to be very valuable.
<Tom Brokaw> <Positive> Mr. Trump what's left in your life? You're 33 years old you're worth all this money. You say you didn't say that you want to be worth a billion dollars.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I really not. I just want to keep busy and keep active and be interested in what I do. And that's all there is to life as far as I'm concerned. I really... I'm not looking to make tremendous amounts of money. I'm looking to enjoy my life, and if that happens to go with it that's fabulous.
<Tom Brokaw> <Neutral> Give me one final bottom line: in five years the price of a hotel room in New York City will go for...?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It could be a thousand dollars a night...
<Tom Brokaw> <Positive> Whew. Start saving your money folks. Just one night. A thousand dollars.
<Larry King> <Negative> Tonight, he's back -- Donald Trump. His new book tells you how to Think Big and Kick Ass. But wait until you hear what he says about Angelina Jolie.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Begin Clip] I'm not saying she's not an attractive woman, but she's not a great beauty by any stretch of the imagination.
<Larry King> <Negative> [End Clip] And George Clooney.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Begin Clip] One of the perceptions I had of George Clooney was he was this big, strong guy. And he was very little when I met him.
<Larry King> <Negative> [End Clip] Plus, his take on Rosie's controversial new book. And he'll weigh in on Britney Spears, too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Begin Clip] I've never seen an image change so much for the bad.
<Larry King> <Negative> [End Clip] And on prenups.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Begin Clip] If you're going to be successful or if you are successful, you have to have a prenup.
<Larry King> <Positive> [End Clip] And how to get rich like him -- and more. The Donald for the hour is next on Larry King Live. It's a great pleasure to welcome a return visit of many return visits with Donald Trump. The New York real estate billionaire, star of TV's The Apprentice I mean you think about all these things and you view on them in the book -- but real estate, television, writing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm having a lot of fun, Larry. It's been a long time since I've been with you, by the way.
<Larry King> <Neutral> In person.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Like a year.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Yes. Does it get better?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Better than what's happening now?
<Larry King> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, maybe for some people. But for me, this is sort of -- I've had a good time. I'm having a good time. Hopefully, I'll always have a good time. But we've -- we've really -- we've done well and I'm very happy about it.
<Larry King> <Neutral> What prompted the book?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The group came to me at The Learning Annex, which is a great institution. They asked me to do a book -- a book on toughness, on making money, on sort of creating a happy life, in a certain sense, through money and through other things. And we came up with the title, which I think is pretty descriptive, although some people thought it was a little bit tough, adding the words kick ass. But it is a little bit about kicking ass because
<Larry King> <Negative> Already? It's not out yet.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, well, it's not out yet and it's already gone to number one on the charts. And 675,000 books have already been ordered. So it's been an amazing thing.
<Larry King> <Positive> Is this your method or what you're saying should be everybody's method?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it doesn't necessarily work for everybody. And I'm not sure that everybody should be doing this. But for me, it works.
<Larry King> <Negative> Now, let's take a chapter in the book called, Revenge. You recommend it. A lot of people say revenge or like carrying a grudge
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's very therapeutic, Larry. You're a revenge person. I know you very well. You're a revenge person. It's a very therapeutic way of taking care of your own head.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Have you always been that way?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I think so.
<Larry King> <Neutral> You were that way in school as a kid?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think so.
<Larry King> <Neutral> You got even.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think get even. I think get even. Don't you?
<Larry King> <Negative> Yes, you like it. But I don't like to carry it, though. If it carries too much it's...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You like to carry it.
<Larry King> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know you -- hey, Larry, I've know you for a long time and you carry it, all right?
<Larry King> <Neutral> Let's talk about...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People don't know that about you, but I do.
<Larry King> <Negative> Let's talk what one revenge aspect you talk about in the book, your feud with Rosie O'Donnell. Who started that, by the way?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She did.
<Larry King> <Neutral> No question?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. She got on a show and she started saying, you know, she started a rant...
<Larry King> <Neutral> On The View?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> On The View. And she started ranting and raving about me. And it was like...
<Larry King> <Neutral> Oh, when you forgave that winner of the contest, yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right. Because I gave somebody a second chance -- a drug addict, an alcoholic, you know, Miss. USA -- who, Tara. Tara Connor. A wonderful girl. I gave her a second chance and Rosie went nuts. And they came to me and I, you know, I hit her back, including on your show.
<Larry King> <Negative> Oh, did you. All right, but she started it, in your mind?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She started it. Most people start it with me. If they start it, I try and finish it.
<Larry King> <Negative> Here's how you recount one incident in the saga of Rosie versus Donald, an example of how the media blew it even bigger than it was. You write, in part, in the book: One morning I went on The Today Show to talk about The Apprentice. Instead Then she asked, 'Is it true that you said she was crude?' I said, 'No, I never said that. It's not strong enough. I said she's a total degenerate.'
<Larry King> <Negative> Then she called is it -- then she asked, 'Is it true that you called her a fat pig?' And I said, 'No, I just called her a pig.'
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think that's probably pretty accurate. And She's a terrific person, but I thought she had a bad day.
<Larry King> <Positive> Meredith did?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Well, she started off asking me about Rosie. I was there to talk about the success of The Apprentice. The Apprentice became this really successful show. And I was going on The Today Show to talk about the success of The Apprentice. And Meredith started off with a question about Rosie. And then a second question about Rosie. And then she said, How come you won't talk about Rosie? But I will say, it's not Meredith only. I was at a big opening of a building I'm doing in Toronto, a very, very big, successful job. The first question is about Rosie. They don't care about the building. They care about, you know, my [Inaudible]...
<Larry King> <Neutral> Well, why do you think that happened?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because people love to see feuds. They love to see fighting and they love to see celebrities fight. But Rosie said things which were mean, vicious. And, you know, she's a vicious person.
<Larry King> <Neutral> How about...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I know Rosie very well. She came to my wedding. So did you, by the way.
<Larry King> <Neutral> How about -- I did.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She came to my wedding...
<Larry King> <Neutral> But how is so -- what if someone gave you the advice, forget about it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can't.
<Larry King> <Negative> You're bigger than that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I can't, because, you know, when people say things that are incorrect or untrue, you always want to dispute it. I do. I do. But, actually, in a very perverse way, the fight with Rosie turned out to be a good thing. And most people think I kicked her ass, as per the title of the book. And you know what? She's just a bad person. I know her very well and she's just a bad person. And somebody has to hit bad people back.
<Larry King> <Negative> In her new book, she devotes a whole chapter, about 13 pages, to the verbal smackdown she -- the two of you had. In a chapter she titled Trumped
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I wonder what she did with it.
<Larry King> <Neutral> I kept Trump products in my office because they reminded me that my attacker was not a human being, but a wind up toy with Tourette Syndrome -- a man who had allows himself to get pulled so deeply into capitalism that he turned his entire being into a product with a price tag on it. He was gift-wrapped and stuffed with Styrofoam.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do you think she wrote that? I have a feeling she didn't write that. I don't think she writes that well. Her book is not doing very well, by the way.
<Larry King> <Negative> It's not?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No. It's in the middle of the top 100 books. That's not exactly great.
<Larry King> <Negative> What about, though...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But who wants to read...
<Larry King> <Neutral> What about calling you...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Who wants to read...
<Larry King> <Neutral> ...a product?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I get -- maybe I am a product to a certain extent. But who wants to read a book where her biggest, most revealing thing was she broke her hand with baseball bats? Somehow, that's not great. Now, my book, it's like a book on success, a book on how to become successful, how to lead a good life, how to have a good life. But, you know, this other -- the thing I disliked about Rosie's book, in all fairness, is what she said about Barbara Walters. Barbara Walt is a terrific woman.
<Larry King> <Negative> But you were tough on her, too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was tough on her because she told a little lie. And in the end, Rosie actually admits that what Barbara said was -- my -- my version was correct. And she says that virtually in the book. But Barbara didn't want to say what happened during our phone conversation. And, ultimately, Rosie found out what happened during our phone conversation and she really attacked Barbara viciously that day on The View. Then what happened?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She wrote the book and she attacks Barbara for essentially being old. Not good. Thank God that never happens with you, Larry.
<Larry King> <Neutral> We have an e-mail question from Doug in McDonough, Georgia, who writes: What was your relationship like between you and Rosie prior to the feud?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was OK. I was never a friend. She came to my wedding. She ate like a pig. And -- I mean, seriously, the wedding cake was -- was -- it was like missing in action. I couldn't stand there. I didn't like it, but a particular woman wanted her at the wedding -- Marla. I think they were friendly or something. And so I said what's Rosie O'Donnell doing here? She was at my wedding. Can you believe it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I'm not -- look, I know her well. She's not a very bright person. And I just felt that it was time to hit back. You know, she hit Danny DeVito. She hit Kelly Ripa. Terrific people. I mean Tom Selleck was one of the all time classics. This guy sits down to talk about a movie and she -- all of a sudden he's in a fight on gun control and he didn't know what happened. You have to hit back. They don't hit back. They didn't hit back. You have to hit back. I just believe that in life, Larry.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Whoopi Goldberg was on our show very recently and we had a chance to ask for her opinion on this feud. She was the consummate diplomat. Take a look at the what she said. [Begin Clip] What do you make of this whole question, this whole -- the whole Rosie thing?
<Larry King> <Positive> She's got a book coming out, Celebrity Detox. Very critical of Barbara Walters. Excerpts have been released. What do you make of this whole Rosie O'Donnell story?
<Whoopi Goldberg> <Neutral> You know what?
<Whoopi Goldberg> <Negative> I don't really make much of it at all. You know, I wasn't part of it. And I hate to say it, but I came to it all quite late.
<Whoopi Goldberg> <Positive> I like Rosie. Rosie's been a friend of mine for a long time. And I thought she did a great job on The View and for The View and The View for Rosie
<Whoopi Goldberg> <Negative> So, you know, I wasn't -- because I wasn't there, you know, I'm always nervous about talking about stuff, because it's all hearsay to me.
<Larry King> <Negative> [End Clip] What do you make of how -- how is Whoopi doing, do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think Whoopi's fine. I like Whoopi. And Whoopi -- actually, I was in one of her movies -- maybe two of her movies, as -- playing myself.
<Larry King> <Negative> No kidding?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was an easy role. But Whoopi's terrific. You know, Rosie's ratings were not good until she started the fight with me. And then her ratings went well. So at some point, I should send her a bill, like, you know, 20 percent or something. But her ratings went up after her fight. She was going along fine, but they were about the same as they were. And then when we had the fight, her ratings went through the roof. I think Whoopi is going to do absolutely nicely.
<Larry King> <Negative> Donald Trump's book is Think Big and Kick Ass. Can you kick ass in business and still get kicked off a job? More with Donald when Larry King Live returns.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Begin Clip] Rosie inherently is a loser.
<Rosie O'Donnell> <Negative> [Begin Clip]
<Unidentified Female> <Neutral> Yes.
<Rosie O'Donnell> <Positive> Holy moley!
<Rosie O'Donnell> <Negative> [Applause] It was like Mount Vesuvius, you know, erupting.
<Rosie O'Donnell> <Negative> [Crosstalk] He's like the Eveready comb-over bunny.
<Rosie O'Donnell> <Negative> OK [End Clip]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Begin Clip] And, ultimately, ABC got tired of it, and they said, Rosie
<Larry King> <Negative> [End Clip] We're back with Donald Trump. The book Think Big and Kick Ass By the way, let's -- one more thing on Rosie. Your co-host -- The View...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> See, people just can't get away from this one.
<Larry King> <Negative> No, no, no. I'm not going to -- The View co-host...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's like a case of the plague [Inaudible].
<Larry King> <Negative> The View co-host... [Laughter] The View co-host Joy -- I'm sick of it, too.
<Larry King> <Negative> The View co-host, Joy Behar, took a couple of hits from you during the big feud. She was a guest last month. Let's look at what she had to say and then we're off it. [Begin Clip] Were you bugged that he took a shot at you?
<Joy Behar> <Negative> Oh, he says I have no talent.
<Larry King> <Positive> Yes. Well, now, how would you react to something like that?
<Joy Behar> <Positive> Well, see, here again, I've had like 20 years of psychotherapy. So when someone says something that's not true, I just dismiss it. And I -- I am a Libra.
<Larry King> <Negative> You're able to -- yes, that's right. Libra is [Inaudible].
<Joy Behar> <Negative> Yes. But I mean it's like I know I have talent. I've been working on a show for 10 years. My focus groups are good. I've been making a living. I sell out theaters all over the country.
<Joy Behar> <Negative> How come -- well, I'm not going to say that I am no talent.
<Larry King> <Neutral> That is back -- part...
<Joy Behar> <Neutral> And what -- by the way, what talent, exactly -- but I don't want to start with him, you see?
<Joy Behar> <Neutral> What talent does he have, exactly?
<Larry King> <Negative> [End Clip] The last word is yours.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I have a lot of talent. I mean I have a talent at the obvious. But she is somebody with no talent. I understand it. I watched...
<Larry King> <Neutral> In your opinion?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Actually, I watched -- no, not in my opinion. I think in a lot of people's opinion. As an example, I watched the show for about four minutes. I love you. I love your show. I watch a lot of your shows. I couldn't watch it. She's unwatchable. I mean the woman has no talent whatsoever. I guess she got friendly with Barbara Walters. That was her primarily talent.
<Larry King> <Negative> You [Inaudible] pretty good, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well...
<Larry King> <Negative> [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm a very honest guy. Sometimes I'm too honest. But I'm a very honest guy.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Your book is brutal, though. In giving a point about perception...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You said brutal?
<Larry King> <Positive> Yes, brutal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think it's brutal.
<Larry King> <Negative> You say George Clooney is little and much shorter in person. You describe Angelina Jolie as not good looking in any way, not a beauty. All right, first, George Clooney is someone...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, George -- I don't know George Clooney. But I met him once.
<Larry King> <Neutral> He's 5'10.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Is he?
<Larry King> <Positive> I think so, yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think you're taller than he is. But it doesn't matter.
<Larry King> <Negative> I'm 5'10.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I did a chapter on perception. The perception of George Clooney is he's a big, strong handsome guy. He's a handsome guy. He's a nice guy. I mean I really don't know him. I met him once. A nice guy.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Married.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I'm just saying anything bad about him. I'm just saying this was a chapter on perception in business and life and different things. One of the perceptions I had of George Clooney was he was this big, strong guy. And he was very little when I met him. It's OK. Nothing wrong with it. He's doing just fine. Angelina Jolie...
<Larry King> <Negative> So you're writing about perception, not against him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm -- oh, no, no. Nothing to do with George Clooney. I mean, I thought he was very nice, but I only met him for a short period of time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But the perception is this, you know, different kind of a guy. And when I met him, I was very surprised. Angelina Jolie is sort of amazing because everyone thinks she's like this great beauty.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm not saying she's an unattractive woman, but she's not beauty, by any stretch of the imagination. And now she's like a representative of the United Nations and world peace on hunger and all of this crap. And I remember at the Academy Awards a few years ago she was Frenching her brother. She was giving her brother lip kisses like I never saw before in my life. And she had just said she made love to Billy Bob Thornton in the back of the limousine on the way over. And I wouldn't want to shake her hand, by the way. You know, you get back into the -- I wouldn't want to have shaken her hand. But she's being interviewed and she's all over the guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> About three weeks later, he got caught cheating with about 15 different girls and she was gone. But she had just made love with him coming over to the Academy Awards. And now she's like this great beauty who is representing world peace and the United Nations. It's called give me a break. But she's not -- in terms of beauty, she's not a great beauty. She's a nice looking woman. She's OK. But she's not a great beauty.
<Larry King> <Neutral> And it's your opinion.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's my opinion.
<Larry King> <Negative> [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I really understand beauty. And I will tell you, she's not -- I do own Miss. Universe.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do own Miss. USA. I mean I own a lot of different things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do understand beauty, and she's not. But what I really don't like is if you look at her -- and I watched. I was watching television four years ago. And I see her brother and I see her. And then I see them lip locked. I don't mean like, you know, giving your brother a kiss. And I said that's really gross. And then I see what she said about, you know, Billy Bob Thornton and what they were doing on the way to Academy Awards. And now she's representing the United Nations and world peace. I don't get it. Oh, by the way, she's done an amazing transformation. I give her credit.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Give her that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Amazing. If you would have had the things and done the things that she did, and to be this representative of women and the world, is incredible. So I give her great credit. She's done one of the great transformations I've ever seen.
<Larry King> <Neutral> What started the feud with Mark Cuban?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, The Apprentice became the number one show in television. I don't start feuds. People start them with me Mark Cuban lives in one of my buildings. He lives in a building that I built and...
<Larry King> <Negative> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...and control and run and [Inaudible]. He lives in the building. But The Apprentice became the number one show on television. It became the most successful business show ever in the history of television. And And Mark Cuban always said nice things about me. And then all of a sudden he was doing a show called The Benefactor. And probably some P.R. person told him
<Donald Trump> <Negative> His show drew flies. It drew nobody. Nobody watched.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was a total failure. It got thrown off the air. And he said bad things about me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Trump doesn't want to shake hands. Who does Trump thing he is, bah, bah, bah. You know, all of a sudden, I was like this bad guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He lives in my building. And I hit him back. I called him, you know, a -- not a very attractive guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said -- I wrote him a letter. I said, Mark, I wish you would have told me before your show because you have absolutely no television persona. Now, I'll tell you this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will say it, because I give credit, again, honesty. He's doing better. I mean he could never make it with his own show. He truly does not have persona. But he's a better dancer than I thought, so he's going on somebody else's successful show, because the only way he's going to be successful is to go onto somebody else's successful show. And he is a better dancer than I would have thought.
<Larry King> <Neutral> The book is...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it took courage for him to do that.
<Larry King> <Positive> And it took courage for you to praise him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's right. [Inaudible].
<Larry King> <Positive> The book is Think Big and Kick Ass. The guest is Donald Trump. Coming up, some interesting, if not harsh words, for President Bush, next.
<Unidentified Male> <Positive> [Begin Clip] Donald likes that impact. This is the first time I've ever heard Donald say anything complimentary about The View.
<Unidentified Male> <Neutral> Do you like The View?
<Unidentified Male> <Negative> [End Clip]
<Unidentified Male> <Neutral> [Begin Clip] Donald Trump.
<Unidentified Male> <Negative> There you are, Donald.
<Unidentified Male> <Positive> Beautiful. [Applause]
<Larry King> <Negative> [End Clip] We're back with Donald Trump. His book is Think Big and Kick Ass. You got a star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I was there...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true, you were. I appreciate that.
<Larry King> <Positive> That day when you got it. It was interesting to watch you get it. What made you go from billionaire successful businessman to bona fide star Hollywood?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's sort of interesting. In a way, you and other people -- for some reason when I go onto television shows, the shows have gotten -- including you, you told me you get your highest ratings when I'm your guest.
<Larry King> <Negative> Uh-huh.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I guess tonight you're going to get good ratings. But, you know, network executives are -- it's not a complicated business. It's about ratings. If you come up with a cure for cancer and if it doesn't get ratings, they won't broadcast it, OK? It's very simple. And for some reason, it seems that over the years I'll go on a show and I'll get very high ratings. I saw it just the other day on Fox. I went on Fox and somebody calls, they said the ratings spiked up. They went through the roof.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And what happened? Roger Ailes, who's one of the greats, he said that. He said the ratings went through the roof. What happened?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And they checked. And it was Trump who was on. So somebody saw this and Mark Burnett saw it, I guess. And they went to NBC and we put on The Apprentice. And The Apprentice became the number one show in television. I mean and to this day
<Larry King> <Neutral> Now, what's it called?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But it's all about -- it's just called The Apprentice
<Larry King> <Negative> That's what caused this bump [Inaudible]...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, actually, Ben Silverman said that the first call as the new head of NBC was to Donald Trump to get him to do it, because I didn't want to do it anymore.
<Larry King> <Negative> [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I'm busy. It's hard to do, you know, spend that much time doing anything, even doing the show. I mean it's hard. So he called me and he said to the New York Times -- it was the first call he made was to Donald Trump -- and to get him to do another two seasons of The Apprentice. And we came up with a concept for celebrity apprentice. And I think it's going to be amazing.
<Larry King> <Negative> But this is what keeps you or what spiked you into show business?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, people ask me. I mean they've always asked me to do it. I mean I've been asked by every single network to do reality shows over the years. But it was only when Mark Burnett, who is a terrific person...
<Larry King> <Positive> A great guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...came up with the concept of The Apprentice that I liked it
<Larry King> <Positive> Do you have to love what you do, other than just love making money?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have to love what you do. I tell people that are in a good business but they don't love it, to go into a worse business if you love it. Because you'll never, ever be successful if you don't love it. And I devote a lot of time on that subject in the book. I really spend a lot of time talking about that in the book. You have to love what you do. If you don't love it, it's never going to be good. You're never going to be successful. You need knowledge, and the only way you can get knowledge is to love something. If you don't love it, you're just not going to work hard enough to get the knowledge.
<Larry King> <Negative> When I first met you and when we had earlier political talks, you were a, I would call a liberal Republican, a social Republican, a conservative Republican fiscally, but certainly a Republican. Why this hatred for George Bush?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I just hate what's happened to this country. We've gone to a country that's no longer respected. We're in a war that we should have never -- and by the way, I'm worse than any hawk there is in terms of military and in terms of defending ourselves. But Saddam Hussein didn't knock down World Trade Center. He had nothing to do with it. And there were no weapons of mass destruction. There was nothing. Saddam Hussein, you know what he did with the terrorists? He killed them. He would kill terrorists. And now Iraq is a breeding ground. That's where all the terrorists are going. They're going to Iraq because that's the safest place for them to be.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we're in this country and we should have never been there. And if you look -- I have many friends all over the world. If you look at what's happened with this country in terms of the prestige and all of the other great things that we -- we're losing it rapidly. Now, they're talking about China. They're talking about Russia. They're talking about India. Look at Putin -- what he's doing with Russia -- I mean, you know, what's going on over there. I mean this guy has done -- whether you like him or don't like him -- he's doing a great job.
<Larry King> <Neutral> What...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ...in rebuilding the image of Russia and also rebuilding Russia period. Forget about image.
<Larry King> <Negative> You talk about perception. You write about it. But while he is an unpopular president, isn't this a flourishing economy?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, if you look over the last little while, it's not so flourishing. The tying that he has done that's good is -- are the tax incentives, because I call them incentives. I don't call them breaks. People are incentivized. But you also look at certain things like subprime and very -- I'm not blaming him for subprime. I'm blaming him for a war. I'm blaming him for the prestige of the country. I'm blaming him that when somebody like me goes to London or goes to Paris or goes throughout the world where I go, we're no longer respected like we were. That's what I'm blaming him for.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Who are you supporting?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think Hillary is terrific and I think Rudy is terrific. And I'll have to make a choice, assuming they both win. But she's been a friend of mine and he's been a friend of mine. And they're both terrific. I think they're both going to win. I think Rudy has a little bit of a fight with Romney, who is a terrific guy, also. I know him a little bit, not nearly as well. But I think Rudy is going to end up emerging. I think she's going to emerge. And you have two very, very smart people who are going to be running for president.
<Larry King> <Negative> Is the religion rap on Romney a bad one?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think it's a bad one. I think that it's -- look, he's -- he's a great person. And you have...
<Larry King> <Negative> You don't think it's a bad rap or you do think it's a bad rap?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, don't think it's a -- I don't think it's a bad rap. I don't think it's going to have that much of an impact, ultimately.
<Larry King> <Negative> You don't?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think so. No. I don't think so.
<Larry King> <Negative> So you're going to have a quandary if it's Rudy versus Hillary?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm going to have a quandary. Look, it would be wonderful if it is. They're both terrific people -- very different people, very, very different -- like day and night. But they're both terrific people and I know them both well.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Who would you pick to win? Forget who you would support.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think it's very hard for anybody that's even slightly in favor of this war that we should not be in. I mean I looked at a picture -- you talk about Bush. He's got a lovely daughter.
<Larry King> <Positive> Well, she was on this show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know. I watched. And I think she's beautiful and lovely. And her husband, soon to be, is a wonderful guy. And I looked at a picture of them in one of the big newspapers, and they're standing there happy as could be. And on the next page was a soldier from Iraq whose face got blown off. And he's standing with his future wife, who is in shock. They probably agreed to get married, you know, before he left.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And she's standing there and it's like a picture of shock on her face. And I'm looking at that couple -- a beautiful couple. And I'm looking at the poor soldier that came back from Iraq. And I'm saying to myself, Bush did this. There was no reason for this. Bush did this. And it's horrible. What he has done is horrible.
<Larry King> <Negative> Coming up, any chance Donald might make a run for any big office? Next.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Begin Clip] So I am going to form a presidential exploratory committee. I might as well announce it on your show. I will announce, I will be forming that, effective, I believe tomorrow. And we will see. I'm going to take a very good, strong look at it.
<Larry King> <Negative> [End Clip] We're coming up with Donald Trump, more with Donald Trump as he authors Think BIG and Kiss Ass in Business and Life. It's now available everywhere. And we begin this segment with an e-mail from Cindy in Johnson City I remember when you once did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I didn't really consider, there was...
<Larry King> <Positive> You sat here on this set and were considering.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> An independent party -- the Independent Party wanted me to run for president and I ultimately decided I like what I'm doing. But there's no reason for that now. You really have some very good candidates. And particularly I say because I know them, Rudy and Hillary. I think you really have some good candidates. I think you have two people, and, again, very different people. But I think they both would do a good job.
<Larry King> <Neutral> In fact, Phyllis in Wagner, Kentucky, had an e-mail saying: If you are considering voting for Hillary
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I could absolutely handle it. Look, it's time. It's time. It is going to be tough for a Republican, and in all fairness to Rudy, for a Republican after Bush, because I think a lot of people are looking at Bush as being such a total disaster that anybody who is a Republican is going to have a lot of baggage to carry. It's not their baggage, but they are going to have to carry the baggage. I think it is going to be tough for the Republicans to win because of Bush.
<Larry King> <Positive> All right. You would not want him campaigning for you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think he's the kiss of death.
<Larry King> <Negative> Back to the book. Is it your belief that anybody can, as you say, kick ass in business?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, not at all.
<Larry King> <Negative> You can't train that, can you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, The Learning Annex is a great institution. And I make speeches for them on occasion when I can. And I love doing it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I speak in front 40,000 and 50,000 people. It's crazy. The groups, it's like -- you never saw anything like it in stadiums.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They rent out stadiums. And I speak in front of 40,000 to 50,000 people on average. I mean, it's an amazing event.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they do a great job. But one of the things I tell them -- Mr. Zanker, terrific guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He has done an amazing job with it. I say, look, Bill, I have got to tell it like it is. I can't say that all of these people are going to make a lot of money because I don't want people leaving their jobs and they are not equipped to be an entrepreneur.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are not equipped to make money. Because most of the people in the room are not equipped to make money. And I'm going to tell them that. And if you don't want that, then you don't have to pay me a fortune to make speeches. And he said, you have got to say what you have got to say. Now that's not good for somebody like The Learning Annex, for an institution like The Learning -- that's telling, you know, here's how to make money. But the fact is, if you don't have the ability to hit a golf ball, if you don't have the ability to hit a baseball or a soccer ball or anything, you just don't, well, business is no different than that. Tiger Woods was born with a great ability.
<Larry King> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Other people were born -- well, it's no different in business. If you don't have that ability, you can be helped, you can learn, you can do better, but you're never going to hit the home runs.
<Larry King> <Neutral> But you can be taught things?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You can absolutely be taught things. Absolutely. You can get a lot better. But there is something. You know, the racehorse theory, there is something to the genes. And I mean, when I say something, I mean a lot.
<Larry King> <Negative> Let's get a King Cam question now. One -- the first one is from someone who is asking about the downside of your kick ass approach to business. Let's watch. King Cam number one.
<Unidentified Female> <Negative> [Begin Clip] Hey, Donald. Is it true that you're such a bully nobody will negotiate with you in person?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [End Clip] No, it's not. The one thing about the words kick ass is that And it really doesn't have to do exactly with -- everyone is different. Every deal is different.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Every person is different. You deal with some people in a very nice way and other people, they take advantage of you and you have to be a little bit tougher. And we discuss that at great length in the book.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But life is not just about kicking ass, and the book is not about that either. It's to a certain extent and there are money sections where, yes, we explain that. You know, one of the things that happened to me recently is that a very great athlete came to me, whose name I won't say. But it seems that a lot of money is missing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I said, let's go check it out. I send in forensic accountants, and I found out where it is. And the people that took his money probably was the manager, probably was somebody, who knows? This is an age-old story.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It always happens, they are young and all of a sudden they are making a fortune and they get ripped off. I said, we're going to go after that guy. We're going to get that guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I respect some of these guys. They are good. And they love Trump, for whatever reason, the athletes love Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I said, we're going to kick -- we're going to go and we're going to get this guy. No, I don't want to do that. I said, why don't you want to do it? Here's a guy that's so good at sports and such a killer at sports and yet he doesn't want to do one of the things that is going to insult -- he stole money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I said, do me a favor, don't ever call me again. But you have to have a certain attitude. You can't let people take advantage of you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Not only for that person but other people are watching. And if I ever said who this person is, the whole world would be after him because we all dream about people like this. So as competitive as he is on the sports field, he's just the opposite in life.
<Larry King> <Positive> When we come back, Donald Trump, the parent of five, seemingly well-behaved children. How would he deal with a child like Britney Spears? We will also ask about premarital or nuptial agreements. Don't go away. We're back with Donald Trump. The book is think Think BIG and Kiss Ass. Before we ask about the pre-nup
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Don't forget Lindsay.
<Larry King> <Negative> How would you have raised her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I knew Britney five years ago when she was hot as a pistol. Of course, I guess you can say she's hot now. Everyone is talking about her. But she performed for me numerous times at different venues that I own. And she was the cleanest, nicest, most -- I will never forget, she went on the stage in Atlantic City, and she was with like a prayer group. And everybody got together. They had a Bible in the middle, they put their hands on the Bible. I'm saying, what happened to this person? And the 15-year-old and 17-year-old young girls, she was like their idol. I have never seen an image change so much for the bad side.
<Larry King> <Negative> Do you blame the parents?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think the mother is distraught. I think the mother did a great job until something happened. You know, it's interesting, Kevin Federline, I was never a big fan of his, and then I heard his all-time hero is Donald Trump. In fact, they sent... [Laughter] It's true.
<Larry King> <Neutral> That changed immediately your opinion.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no. Immediately, I think he's fantastic. [Laughter] It is unbelievable. He came in with a suit -- this is like two years ago. He came in all dressed up with a suit and tie. He said, my all-time hero is Donald Trump. I think he's fantastic. He has done a great job with Britney. But the fact is, from the day he met her, it's not exactly like she turned out so good.
<Larry King> <Positive> A chapter in book is titled I Love You
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That was a great interview.
<Larry King> <Positive> ... he would not have a pre-nup because he loved her too much and it would affect the love. And you said?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I was watching, and I said schmuck. I was watching. He is so in love. He was star struck. I don't get it. I don't see what he saw And he was so -- it was like, I said, who is the star? Is she the star or is he the star? And they talked about pre-nups. And he said, I wouldn't have one. And I couldn't believe it. I said, the poor guy. Now, I had no idea it was going to turn out so badly. I hear she's turning down hundreds of millions of dollars. She wants more. She wants the right to write about his life.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What she did was very bad, though, because she -- or at least this is what the papers say she did, she started -- you know, one of the beautiful things was Paul and Linda. It looked like a really great romance. And in my eye she sort of destroyed that romance by saying terrible things about that relationship. And I loved it. You know, I think Paul is terrific. And I loved what that relationship stood for, because, you know, in our world, there are not too many of them, right? All of a sudden I'm hearing this relationship was a disaster from her. It wasn't nice.
<Larry King> <Negative> So you're saying you have to have a pre-nup in every relationship?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think you have no choice. Now if you're going to be poor, you don't have to have a pre-nup. I wouldn't bother.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you want to be poor, if you don't think you will ever make money, then don't even bother. It's not worth the effort. But if you're going to be successful, and the people I speak in front of and the people that read my book are usually people that want to be successful or are successful.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you you're going to be successful or if you are successful, you have to have a pre-nup. It's an ugly instrument. It's a terrible instrument. I will give you an example. I say to Melania, you're beautiful, I love you, you're the greatest, ever, unbelievable, I can't live without you, by the way, sign the pre-nup. OK. It's not exactly the most romantic thing in the world.
<Larry King> <Neutral> What does she say?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She was very nice. She loves me. She's a great woman.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I have to have it. And you know what, you have banks, you have institutions, you have partners, you need that. In business -- and we talk about pre-nups a lot, in business you need a thing called certainty.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If something happens to a relationship, you need the certainty, like, as an example, Heather with Paul. She's going after everything. I mean, she never -- I didn't see her singing on the Ed Sullivan Show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will give you an example, Michael Strahan, who is a great guy, he had a pre-nup. That was the worst pre-nup I ever saw. She got 65 percent of everything.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't see her tackling any of these 300- pound people. But so you can have a bad pre-nup, too. I want to know who is Michael Strahan's lawyer? That was the worst pre-nup.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said, boy, did he get killed in court. And the judge was almost apologetic, saying, I can't believe this. But I think Michael Strahan had one of the worst lawyers ever. But you need certainty. You need a pre-nup. KING.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Real estate market, what's going on?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's an amazing situation. There are tremendous opportunities. You know what's interesting, I was begging people not to buy real estate two years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And everybody was interested in buying. And now they are less interested, and this is the time they should be going out -- not buying, negotiating to buy. This is the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, I'm sort of a tale of two cities, because Manhattan is through the roof. I sold an apartment last week for $38 million. I'm selling apartments now, I have never sold apartments like this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Manhattan is like in a different world from everything else. Outside of Manhattan, you look at other parts of the country, it's terrible. It's absolutely terrible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But this is the time. You were talking about books. This is the time that people should be going out and making unbelievable deals on real estate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And one other thing, Larry, you read all the about subprime and all about the people. I don't understand where these people come from. The bank sends them a letter, and they leave. They send them a letter, you have to be out. They leave. Why don't they call up the bank and negotiate?
<Larry King> <Neutral> Yes, everything is negotiable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The bank doesn't want to take over their house. I mean, the bank, whether they are nice or not. What are they going to do, put security people in there? I mean, the bank, you can sit down. You can make a better deal than you would have made five years ago with the bank. Cut the price, make it interest, make it long-term. The bank needs these people. But what happens is the bank sends them a notice, the people leave. I don't get it.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Tell me about Trump the Magazine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Trump the Magazine was started with Jerry Powers of Ocean Drive. And it is doing phenomenally.
<Larry King> <Neutral> When does it come out -- is it out?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, it's out. And it's going to be out quarterly and then ultimately monthly.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Is it like a thick -- slick...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, I really wanted it for my people, my hotels, my condos, my country clubs, Mar-A-Lagos of the world, et cetera. I did not care about it as a magazine. They put it on the newsstand, the thing sold so fast, it sold like hot cakes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the newsstand said, one of the best magazines we have had in a long time for selling. So Jerry Powers came to me, said, you know, could we make this thing like where you actually sell? Because I really wanted it for my people that buy apartments from me, that -- you know, my real estate deals. And just as something to hand him, here, congratulations, you paid $20 million for an apartment, have a magazine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You've got to give them something, right, for their money. And what happened is, when they put it at the newsstands, it sold like crazy. So Jerry wants to make a big deal out of it. We will see how that works out. I think it will probably work out well.
<Larry King> <Negative> Do you ever bomb at anything?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You bomb. But you don't like look at it as a bomb. You like to look at it as a learning experience. Never let a bomb be so big that it takes you down. That's the key, because you know, if you have one deal, but don't let it be bigger than everything. Because I have had friends where they bet the entire ranch. There's a man in New York right now, he bet the entire ranch on something. Rich guy. He bet the entire ranch. I'm telling you, he's in such trouble, it's like unbelievable. You can never get the bet be so big that it takes you down.
<Larry King> <Positive> We will be back with our remaining moments with the incredible Donald Trump. Even his severest critic would have to use that adjective. Don't go away. We are back with our remaining moments with Donald Trump. Congratulations, you're a new grandfather.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Tough word.
<Larry King> <Neutral> What you have got?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Beautiful, beautiful, baby girl from Donald and Vanessa. And -- but the word grandfather is a tough word.
<Larry King> <Neutral> OK. But it's still -- it's there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's there. That's what it is.
<Larry King> <Positive> Grandfathers have it easy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's OK.
<Larry King> <Positive> You know why grandfathers and grandchildren get along so well?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why?
<Larry King> <Negative> They have a common enemy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Laughter] That sometimes works out, doesn't it?
<Larry King> <Positive> All right. Tell me about Pageant Place.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I was backstage at the -- I own the Miss Universe Pageant, I own the Miss USA Pageant. And over the last few years, you know how you go backstage, because I have an obligation to go backstage and see all of these beautiful women. There's nothing like it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> NBC just renewed the Miss Universe, Miss USA for another three years. It does terrifically. And you know, you look at that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's some tribute to me, because Miss America is thrown off the air like dogs and this thing just continues to do really well, Miss Universe and Miss USA. And I'm backstage. And I see these girls backstage before the -- and they are fighting like cats and dogs. They are going at it. And they are beautiful. And I said, wouldn't this make a great television show? And we went out to a couple of different people, through Andy Litinsky, who is really terrific. We went out to a couple of people. And everybody loved it. Then we just bid it out and MTV absolutely adores it and it's on MTV and...
<Larry King> <Neutral> On now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. They just went out the other night. It did very nice ratings, really good ratings. And I'm very happy about it.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Are you on the show?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A little bit. Very modestly. I don't have time to -- I would love to be on. I could be on every week if I just had the time. But the show -- but I was on the show, and I will be on it intermittently. But it went out, it did really terrifically. And the MTV people are fantastic. They really know their stuff.
<Larry King> <Positive> All right. And what's the story of you and a quarry worker in Scotland?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I own close to 2,000 acres in Scotland, in Aberdeen, which is an amazing place. And I'm going to build a development close to $2 billion of hotels and houses and thousands of -- just incredible. And it's four miles on the ocean, beautiful, the waves crashing in. There's no sight like it. And I'm going to build a golf course, which I believe -- the great dunes of Scotland, largest dunes of the world, I'm going to build a golf course that will be the greatest golf course anywhere in the world. And I own great golf courses. I own one in Los Angeles. I own great golf courses.
<Larry King> <Neutral> So what's the story?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But this land -- and I have a couple of people -- not only one but I have a couple of people. They are not anything to do with the golf course and they are really not in our way, but I would like him to clean up his house because it's a pigsty. And I say, get your house cleaned. And all of a sudden I made an international hero out of the guy. But actually I think most people get it.
<Larry King> <Negative> You don't want to buy it. You want him to clean it up?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would buy it if he would like to sell it, but it's absolutely not necessary to buy it.
<Larry King> <Positive> He's not blocking your golf course.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Absolutely, nowhere near it.
<Larry King> <Negative> Why won't he clean it up?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Maybe he thinks I'll pay him more money if he doesn't. I knew guys in New York, they always had a dirty, filthy store. They were very rich guys. They always took over a store, I would say, why don't you make that that store nice? He said, you know, Donald, if we make Tiffany out of here, guess what, you won't pay the same kind of money.
<Larry King> <Neutral> So you think he will clean it up?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I think nothing changes.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Think he will clean it up?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think he will probably not want to clean it up. His property is more valuable if it's not cleaned up.
<Larry King> <Negative> As always, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, very much.
<Larry King> <Positive> Thank you, man. Donald Trump, the book, Thing BIG and Kick Ass in Business and Life. Check out our Web site Tomorrow night, the super megastar preacher Joel Osteen and his wife Victoria. Anderson Cooper 360 starts right now.
