<Brian Maste> <Negative> OK, let's talk about the big announcement tonight. I know a little bit about it, ethanol --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Right.
<Brian Maste> <Positive> -- kind of boosting that for Nebraska and Iowa farmers. That's a great deal. I know the oil industry isn't thrilled about it. How do you balance those two interests?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, the ethanol people have been so great to me, and I've studied it so long, and it's really -- it's very important for our country. It's very important for our farmers. I promised it when I was in both the Nebraska and Iowa and frankly, other places, and we're taking care of our farmers, especially with that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But if you look at what we've done with the USMCA which is basically the redone NAFTA, but I refuse to use the word NAFTA because it's so bad -- it was so bad for our country. But the USMC, which is Canada-Mexico, has been incredibly well-received by the farmers -- and everybody else -- but by the farmers, and we were happy about that.
<Brian Maste> <Positive> The job growth you talked about with that trade agreements --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Brian Maste> <Neutral> How do see it particularly impacting those of us in Council Bluffs and Omaha?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's so great. I mean people, are coming in. People want jobs, you need jobs. We're letting people come in on a merit basis to help the farmers. We have to do that. We're using the merit system as opposed to anybody can come into our country. We're very strong on the borders. But the farmers need help, and they have to be able to get help.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we're having the merit system and it's really working out great.
<Brian Maste> <Positive> So the last couple of months of a pretty contentious confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh. How do you to mend those fences? Do you see that as your role as a healer?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he's going to be a great justice of the Supreme Court. Brilliant man. First in his class at Yale, first in his class at Yale Law School. No matter where he wa,s he was, you know, a top intellect, top student. And he's somebody that everybody respect. You know 10 years ago, Brian,  I was asked by a couple of people like, who do I think, and I said I don't know, who do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they were always talking about now Justice Kavanaugh, right? Brett Kavanaugh. They'd say he's incredible. That was ten years ago. So, the Democrats were vicious, what they were saying. I've never seen anything like it. I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like it. But he won, he got confirmed, and he's now sitting on the United States Supreme Court, where he should be. And I think basically he will just go down as one of our great justices.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And what will happen is, people are already, I think, used to it. It's going to happen very quickly, and our country's coming together, because we really have -- you look at our economy, it's is the best it's ever been, from the standpoint of the deals we made with Canada and Mexico and South Korea. We don't even talk about that, but we also had a great deal for farmers, for everybody, with South Korea.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We terminated the other one, made this deal, which is far better. We're opening up these countries that were never opened before. And we're working on China. The farmers have been incredible on China, because they said, let him do it. Can't do it too quickly, but I will tell you China wants to make a deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we'll see. I told them they're not ready yet, they're not ready yet. They've been taking tremendous -- tens of billions of dollars out of our country on a yearly basis. Last year $375 billion. And we just can't have that. So that's going to work out great for the farmers, and everybody else also.
<Brian Maste> <Positive> So two years ago, you won on the backs of rural voters. What -- how do you sum up the appeal of President Trump to rural voters?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think what -- and it's a very interesting thing. I think -- what happened is they they heard what I said about trade, maybe more than anything else. Look, the farmers for 15 years, it's been trending down, down, down. You take a look at soybeans, if you go back five years from when I won from the election.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They cut in half. They were literally cut it in half, meaning they went down in half. Now, what's happening is they're starting to go up, and we're getting tariffs. Now eventually, the tariffs can come off and your prices are going to be way up. I mean, the prices for soy, the prices for all of it will be way up. And I think the farmers saw that, they have confidence in me. If you look back just two weeks ago, everybody said, oh, he'll never be able to make a deal with Canada.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We made a great deal with Canada, made a great deal with Mexico, and a lot of people were saying, you know, that was almost going to be impossible to do, because our deal was terrible. The deal we had previous was terrible. So the farmers saw it. I love the farmers. They're just such special people. They are -- they really have gone through a lot, and we're opening up markets for them, and will open up, ultimately, China will be opened up to them too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's your biggest of all. But right now, it's a closed shop. It's essentially a closed market, and it's unfair. The way they treat the United States farmers. But the way they treat our country, it was unfair and it's all being worked out today.
<Brian Maste> <Neutral> Today, the big news of the day, Nikki Haley --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Brian Maste> <Positive> Moving on. Were you surprised [Crosstalk]?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no.  I knew this -- we knew this for about six months. We had a little news conference, Nikki and I today. She's going to work on the 2020 campaign. She's been governor for six years of South Carolina. She's been doing this for almost two years at the United Nations, and we made a little compact that after the big United Nations meeting last week, that Nikki -- she wanted to step down at the end of the year, and she was terrific.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She did a really terrific job. And we're going to be picking -- I'm going to use Nikki also to help me with it -- but I have great people that want to go in. We have a great Cabinet. We have a great group of people, a great staff, great trade negotiators. But we'll be making that decision, I would say over the next two or three weeks.
<Brian Maste> <Negative> Gotta be jazzed about the midterms, aren't you now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh yeah we are. The numbers are, I think, to a certain extent, because of Judge Kavanaugh. I think really, to a to extent, because of that, because people really like him. They saw how unfair the Democrats were. They were brutal. I mean they were -- it was terrible, what they did, if you, you know, you watch that process.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that's an extent. And I think the fact that I've been going around, we're having these tremendous rallies. You look outside, there's thousands of people outside trying to get in. And this is a big arena I don't know how many seats at all. But it's packed. But they're all packed, and I think it probably helps also.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But when they see the -- what happened and what's happening with the Supreme Court. They want to have great, conservative, strong justices of the United States Supreme Court. The court is very important to the voters, and I think they see that. And as you know, almost in every instance, the polls have gone way up over the last few weeks for Republicans.
<Brian Maste> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you very much. I appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you for your time. Thank you Brian.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Positive> Mr. Trump, thanks for the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> I want to start with your mother, Mary Trump, who we hear very little about; but, you said she had a flair for the dramatic. What do you see in yourself that you saw in her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Maybe that... she was a... she was a terrific woman -- beautiful woman. She was born in Scotland, came here at 19 years of age; met my father; they got married.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They were married for 63 years or something, and they had a great marriage. It was very beautiful, but she was a very, very smart woman. And she was a very religious woman, actually.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> Tell me -- we're talking about women. There's been a lot of confusion, controversy out on the trail. When I travel the country, people say, "I'd like to vote for Donald Trump
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that never happened -- those were artificial. They were made up, just like at the rallies, where they made up, you know, they brought the protesters in. They paid them. They were thugs, and they, you know, they paid them, I guess, $1,500 or something and an iPhone.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was artificial, and, actually, criminal, what they did. And nobody understood it at the time, and it was put in there by the Clinton campaign. This stuff was all made up. And so, I protested it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, actually, witnesses have come forward, and much of it's already been debunked, but it was all made up.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> What do you say to those who still have lingering concerns? Have you changed since those comments were made... a decade ago?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it was locker-room talk; it was locker-room talk. The microphones, I mean, to be honest, should, you know, should never have been on, but that was locker-room talk. And it's just one of those things. I have it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've said it. I've made my apologies, but again, just one of those things.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> I want to read something Newt Gingrich recently said about you. He said, "He is a transformational figure
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, I started with 17 people, and it was a very, very nasty primary, and they were nasty to me. You know, people think I was nasty, but they were nasty to me, and I ended up winning, you know; one in 17 -- and it was actually 18, if you want to be exact. And then, I have the final now with Hillary Clinton, and I hear we're doing very well in the polls, and we're doing very well in Florida, which is up now. The reaction has been amazing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we'll have to see what happens. But, no, look -- you can't go back. You have to look forward. This was a nasty campaign, and, you know, people don't mention, but they were nasty to me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think, in many cases, they were nastier to me than I was to them.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> And, as a president, you wouldn't react that way?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think so. It depends; you react a different way for different people. These were 17 people coming at me from every angle, and, you know, I hit them hard. Most of them are now endorsing me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Some of them dishonored the pledge: They signed a pledge, and they dishonored the pledge, and they'll have to live with that. But most of them have endorsed me.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> I want to get into some issues.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> You weren't always pro-life, but you now are determinedly and decidedly pro-life.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, I am pro-life.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> You said you are going to appoint judges who are pro-life.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> You're very concerned about the late-term abortions. What was the moment that changed your thinking, your heart, on this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there are a number of moments, but one was a couple that I know very, very well -- and you had a strong pro-life [person] and you had a strong pro-choice [person], and they argued over [the pregnancy].... The mother was pregnant. They argued over the child.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> One, I won't get into specifics.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Positive> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But one wanted to abort. And the other said, "We can't do that. We're not going to do that."" Anyway
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the baby is such a magnificent person, who I know, a magnificent person. And the person that was actually pro-choice is now pro-life because of it, and it had a big effect on me. But I've seen other examples similar to that; but I've seen other examples, so...
<Raymond Arroyo> <Neutral> So, it was a personal change for you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It is a personal change. And, you know, Ronald Reagan made that personal change, too. Many people have made the personal change. I mean, some make the personal change the other way, also.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Positive> Right; right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I made the personal change, and I'm very happy with it.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> Tell me about religious liberty. I know this is becoming a growing concern for you, particularly for so many faith-based voters and people who are in nonprofits...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Neutral> Religious-service people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> Whether it's the Little Sisters of the Poor or, you know, these private businesses who are religiously motivated, they feel this Obamacare mandate, which demands contraceptive and abortifacient services, as part of insurance...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ...is intrusive.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Neutral> What would you do as president?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, let me tell you: Religious Liberty itself, taken in the biggest picture, is in tremendous trouble. Okay? I mean, religious liberty in this country is in tremendous trouble.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> You mean expression of religion?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm talking expression, and I'm talking anything else you want to talk about. People that are faith-based are not having, you know, they're just not having, they're not being accepted. It's almost like they're not being accepted in our country anymore. Obama has been a disaster, in terms of religious liberty.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, one of the things I'm very proud of: I was with pastors, ministers, priests, rabbis, on numerous occasions, large numbers; and at the first meeting, I could see I had tremendous support like, beyond.... And I said, "When are you going to endorse me?"" And they said
<Raymond Arroyo> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I said, "Why is that?"" And they told me about the Johnson Amendment
<Raymond Arroyo> <Positive> Pulled out from under them, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we're getting rid... and I think it's one of the most important things that I'll be doing for the evangelicals and for religion. So, I think it's very, very important. So, we're going to get rid of the Johnson Amendment.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> And what about Obamacare? The administration admitted these premiums are going to go up 25% on average, could be 50% in some markets.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Right.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> Given that and this religious objection to the Obamacare mandate, what are you going to do as president?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Obamacare is killing our country. It's killing our jobs. It's a disaster. I've been saying it for a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've been talking about it for a long time, before it was even approved.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Neutral> What do you replace it with?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Whether it's health care savings accounts -- by the way, there are many things, but health care savings accounts are phenomenal. You have to break up the lines between the states so that we have competition. Once you create competition, those numbers will go so low, but you have to repeal and replace Obamacare. It's a disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the number of 25%: Washington came out?
<Raymond Arroyo> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Say, I'm sorry to say your numbers [have] gone up 25%. It's wrong. It's going up 50%, 60%, 70%, and next year it's going to go up again. It's going to get worse.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Hillary Clinton wants to keep Obamacare going. And people are going to be paying hundreds; I mean, when you really look at it, they'll be paying 150%. It doesn't work. It's no good on its face.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It doesn't work. Never would have worked, should have never been approved. It was approved by a lie. I mean, let's face it.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> You mentioned Hillary Clinton. She is saying [about] your unwillingness to accept the election results, which happened at the last debate -- she says, "This poses a direct threat to our democracy."" Does it?"
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, who had said the same thing, and I won the last debate; according to everybody, I won it easily. But, you know, who really said it pretty well was Obama: When he was running in his first election, they asked him the same question. And he talked about rigged elections and rigged everything else. Our system is rigged.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Neutral> What do you mean when you say that, specifically?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Whether it's through the media...
<Raymond Arroyo> <Neutral> Not the electoral process?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, Obama said it was. I mean, he said the electoral process is rigged. I mean, all you have to do is go back and look what he ran, when he first ran.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> But are you worried about the counting of votes?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, if you look at research, certainly there's some of that going on. We can be babies and say it doesn't happen; but certainly, if you look at Philadelphia, if you look at Chicago, if you look at St. Louis, if you look at Obama's statements from eight years ago: Take a look at his statements, what he said about it. I saw it last night.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was, like, incredible; he was far more outgoing, as far as that's concerned, than I am; but, overall, what I'm really concerned about is the system is rigged -- whether it's the media rigging the system, there are so many things wrong. Look: Hillary Clinton shouldn't be allowed to run. She lied. What she did with her emails, where she deleted 33,000 emails, she shouldn't even be allowed to run for the presidency.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She gets a subpoena from the United States Congress, and she deletes her emails. Now, James Cartwright, Gen. James Cartwright, may go to jail for five years because he lied to the FBI. She lied to the FBI probably hundreds of times, and she's allowed to do it, but a four-star general is going to go to jail? She shouldn't even be allowed to run for the office of president.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> You mentioned emails. These WikiLeak revelations have offended a lot of evangelicals and Catholics.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Positive> Now, these were members of Hillary Clinton's staff, John Podesta, her communications director, and they said things like this. They suggested that they needed to plant seeds of rebellion in the Catholic Church to somehow change the teaching to accommodate their political agenda.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Terrible. Sure.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> They said it was a backward, Middle Aged dictatorship. Now, that's her staff.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's her.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> Is she guilty of that? Should she apologize?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's her. It's her. She should apologize. I think she has to do more than apologize.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, that's her thinking. That's her staff. Frankly, if any Catholic votes for Hillary Clinton, you know, I would say, if I were a Catholic, I wouldn't be talking to them anymore. She's been terrible in what she said and her thoughts towards Catholics and to evangelicals.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She was mocking evangelicals, also. So, you'd say, why would an evangelical or a Catholic -- and almost, you could say, anybody of faith, but in particular, because they were mentioned, evangelicals and Catholics -- why would they vote for Hillary Clinton? And how could they vote for Hillary Clinton? But that's her speaking, believe me.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Positive> Well, if it's her staff. Do you think it reveals a mindset in the administration?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's her staff, but I think it's her.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Neutral> Is that what you're suggesting... or in her campaign, rather?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, sure; I mean, this is the top person in her campaign. I think it reveals her, yes.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> I want to talk personally about you. When you pray, what do you pray for?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I, I don't want to talk to you about that. I mean, I pray. It's very personal to me. I'm a person of belief, but I certainly, you know, I pray for my family.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I pray for our country, but I don't want to talk to you about that. I think that's very personal.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Positive> Okay, between you and God.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It is between me and God, yes.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> You are Presbyterian, so I don't want to drag you into other realms. Do you have a favorite saint?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that if you look, Mother Teresa, who's probably our newest, is great, and John Paul... Pope John Paul, I thought, was terrific.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because he had something special. He had a special something. There was a warmth. There was a toughness, but there was a warmth that was incredible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I certainly think, Pope John Paul.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> No candidate since the advent of polling has come back this late in a race from a five-point national deficit. How do you turn it around in these last days?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, No. 1, I don't believe there's a five-point deficit.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Neutral> You don't?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was done by CNN. And it was, you know, heavily skewed toward Democrats. I don't believe there's a five-point deficit; and if you look at the polling booths in Florida right now, if you look at where they're voting, the voting booths, I think you're going to see record crowds. That's what you're seeing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's only two days, but that's what you're seeing. And, I think, we're going to do really well.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> Hmm. You have said this is a movement. You're the leader of a movement, whether you win or lose. What are the issues that this party, the GOP, will have to contend with as part of that movement?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There are many issues. The biggest issue right now is the judges, Supreme Court judges, but Obamacare is a massive issue. The Republicans have to get rid of it. They've been unsuccessful in doing it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will get rid of it. And I'll replace it with something much better and much less expensive for the people. Jobs have to stop leaving our country. Our military has to be rebuilt, and we need, you know, it's been very depleted.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The military has to be rebuilt. We have to take care of our vets. We have to protect our Second Amendment, which is under siege. And we have to have strong borders.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right now, people are pouring into our country. Drugs are pouring into our country. We have to stop the people and the drugs.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> Now, Hillary Clinton says we need [to let] more of these Syrian refugees in: "These people are suffering abroad. They need to come home. And we have... we need..."
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> they need to come here. And we as a country should be open to them." You would say what?"
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say: She's crazy. I would say that it's one of the dumbest things I've ever heard. We have no idea. We're not vetting them properly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have no idea -- are they ISIS? Are they not ISIS? Where are they coming from? Who they are? We're taking them in by the tens of thousands right now, and Hillary Clinton wants to upgrade that by 550%. I would say to you it's crazy to be doing this, and I will stop it immediately. We will not have radical Islamic terrorists coming into our country, and some of them will be radical Islamic terrorists.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Negative> Okay, my final question: It is perhaps the most portentous. We've been seeing on social media, we've been seeing it in The New York Times
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well...
<Raymond Arroyo> <Neutral> Bigly or "big league?"""
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now, let me ask you: Are you talking about for me?
<Raymond Arroyo> <Neutral> When you're speaking on the podium, and you say, "This is... ?"""
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I, I use, "big league."""
<Raymond Arroyo> <Positive> I was right!
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good. Okay, good.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Neutral> Big league, you've settled it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. Thank you.
<Raymond Arroyo> <Positive> Thank you.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Doesn't travel alone these days. He has brought a lot of support with him. We welcome his wife, Melania, along with his adult children, Donald Jr., Ivanka, Eric, and Tiffany. All of you, welcome. Good to have all of you here on the plaza.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> Good morning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning, thank you.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Let me -- yes, you can clap. [Applause] Let me all start by asking you all for one word. Not you, but the rest of you. Give me one word to describe this campaign.
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> Leadership.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Incredible.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> Inspiring.
<Eric Trump> <Positive> Certainly entertaining.
<Tiffany Trump> <Negative> Motivational.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Positive> When you think about what's happened so far, is there a favorite moment, best moment that comes to mind? Ivanka?
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> I think for me, seeing the actual rallies and seeing him interact with people all over this country has been the most amazing thing. Because obviously, we see it now materializing in terms of the actual votes, but seeing him inspiring so many people, seeing his message resonate so strongly, seeing the passion, and the love and the enthusiasm, and many of the adjectives that were used just a couple of minutes ago is pretty remarkable.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> So, I've watched him inspire thousands of executives over the years as the leader of a large company, but now to see him do it on a much larger stage and in a much larger capacity is remarkable.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> I think, by the way, some of the other family members might say 3.5 weeks ago when you had a baby would be one of the best moments on the campaign.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's where I was going, Matt. That's where I was going. [Crosstalk]
<Ivanka Trump> <Negative> I don't really consider that a campaign moment.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> That's OK, it happened during the campaign.
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> It's more a family moment, so.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Have there been moments -- this family has grown up in a very high-profile way. You're used to the spotlight. But this is different. I mean, the crowds, the secret service. Have there been moments, guys, when you wish you could put the genie back in the bottle?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Honestly, I think no, in the sense that it's time.  I mean, when you look at this country and you look at the things that have happened, I think it's time to get someone who is not just the typical politician, not someone that's beholdened to special interests just doing the same old thing.  They tell you whatever you want to hear and then they go do whatever the people that are writing their checks want them to do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Applause] And I think it's time.  As you can see by the reaction, I've had people come up to me all over the country that we've been traveling, and -- I mean, some of them in tears, just Thank you for letting your father do this. " Yeah But thank you for letting him do this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know, it means so much to us. It really is time. I think people believe that.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Negative> Melania, you've told a story before about when he talked about running, you said Well Do you think as far as he's gotten has surprised even Donald about -- that it's really gotten this close where he's about to clinch the Republican nomination potentially?
<Melania Trump> <Positive> Yes. It's unbelievable what is going on. And for so long, he's number one for now ten months. And I never thought about it. I know his energy. I know how people love him, how they connect to him. He's telling the truth. And I said, If you will run
<Savannah Guthrie> <Neutral> Did he believe that then?
<Melania Trump> <Negative> I don't know. You need to ask him that.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Neutral> Did you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm not so sure. She believed it. I'm not so sure. But it -- yeah, I had confidence. I know the people of the country and they want to see things happen. And, honestly, they want to see things happen quickly.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Let me ask you all this question personally, not politically. You've been through a wild ride over this last year. You've watched the ups and downs of this campaign, the great moments, the difficult moments. You're now getting to a point where it looks like he's going to get the most votes of any candidate on the Republican side. You're going to go to Cleveland. How is it going to feel personally if the rest of the Republican Party does whatever they can to prevent him from getting the nomination? Personally.
<Eric Trump> <Positive> Well, Matt, I think it's happened for a long time. But listen, we're proud of him. We could not be more proud of him. We've worked next to our father every single day, you know, for the last ten years and we're having so much fun with it. But we're proud of him. I mean, the man has done something that no one has ever done before. And they've tried to hold him back the entire time. I mean, they have really tried to hold him back, but...
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> But when you get to Cleveland, what's it going to feel like in your gut to watch what happens there?
<Eric Trump> <Positive> Well, we're going to win in Cleveland. I mean, we're really going to win in Cleveland. There's just no question about it. [Applause]
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Tiffany, how about you?
<Tiffany Trump> <Positive> I think that really we need to look at what an amazing thing he has done for all of us. He was doing this for, you know, our family, for the country. He really believes in making America great again, and you know, let's hope that what happens in Cleveland is positive and you know, luckily he's continuing to excel. So, we're just very proud.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Positive> Well, we know that Mr. Trump values his children -- not just his children, but his advisers, particularly you, Ivanka. People say you're one of his top advisers. What's the piece of advice you've given him about running a general election against Hillary Clinton?
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> Well, I think he values our advice all equally, but I tend not to provide my advice on topics political like that.  I think his instincts are incredible.  I think he will do incredibly well, as he has done incredibly well to date.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> And really, my role as his daughter is to support him.  I'm obviously his advocate.  I've seen what he has done, both as a parent, on a personal level, and as a leader who has grown an enormous business and succeeded in many businesses, building many businesses and studying the vision for them.
<Ivanka Trump> <Negative> So, I have no doubt he can apply that to this country and fix the many problems we have. I am his daughter and supporter. So, that's the extent of it.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> So, this one, you've mentioned him as a parent and on a personal note. So, Melania and kids, jump in on these. These are kind of rapid fire. This is, you know, the potpourri section of the interview. We watch him on the campaign trail. He's extremely intense. What makes him emotional? When the last time you saw him cry?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know that we've seen him cry all that often, Matt. But you know what, it's great. You know, now that he's a grandfather as well, and I have five kids. Ivanka has three kids. You know, watching him play with them, you see another side of Donald Trump. I mean, there is the image. There's the business guy, but when you see him around a family table and the sense of humor, the love. You know, playing golf with my 20-month-old, teaching her how to swing a golf club, it's a special moment. It's really incredible to watch. And it's a totally different side that no one really gets to see.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Anybody else? Ivanka, go ahead.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> I agree with that.  He's amazing with my children as well.  And I actually see Trumpisms picked up by each of them by spending time with him, especially during the summers.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> So he's remarkable in that capacity.  I think, though, he has tremendous empathy as well.  And I think that's the side people don't really see.
<Ivanka Trump> <Negative> My whole life, I've watched as he has ripped stories out of newspapers that he has read about something that's happened to somebody or adversity that somebody is being faced with. Often put in a situation where they don't have the power to affect change and they were unfairly put there. And he will actually, proactively reach out to that person, bring them into the office and help them. And that's not reported. That's not seen. But, I've witnessed it my whole life. So, he is incredibly empathetic in that regard to what's happening to other people. [Applause]
<Savannah Guthrie> <Positive> And Mrs. Trump, we'll give you a fun one for the end. Every wife wants to answer this question. What's the one habit you wish he would give up?
<Melania Trump> <Positive> Let's see. The tweeting. [Laughter]
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> All right. Let's end it there. That is the quietest Donald Trump has ever been for seven minutes in his life.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can verify that, Matt. I can verify that.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> All right. The Trump family, thank you very much. Still ahead, Mr. Trump answers your questions in our exclusive town hall, right on the plaza. We're back after this. [Applause] Welcome back to our exclusive town hall meeting with Donald Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner. Mr. Trump. Good morning again. Good to have you here.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Positive> Good morning.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Congratulations on a huge win in New York this week. [Applause]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I feel very good.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Normally, with that win, in this stage of the race, you would basically have the nomination in your hands. This is a different kind of year, though. But let's say you do have the nomination. Let's say you're going to be the guy in the general election. You look at some of the polling right now. You have an enormous negative number, 68 percent of people say they can't support you. Would you admit you have a lot of work to do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think it's going to go very quickly, frankly.  I've been hit by 55,000 ads.  I saw it on your show, 55,000 negative ads, and nobody else has.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, you look at a guy like Kasich.  He has never been hit by an ad because nobody cares, frankly.  [Laughter] [Booing] No, it's true.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's so true. And Cruz isn't hit with negative ads. But, you know, they went after me, both sides: my side, the other side and my side. And despite that, I won Florida with almost 21 points, you know, in a landslide. I've won mostly landslides. I've won 22 or 24 states and nobody else is even close. And you know, the main thing, millions and millions of votes more than anybody else has. And like, you know...
<Savannah Guthrie> <Neutral> But that's the Republican primary. 30 million people vote in the Republican primary, 130 million vote in the general election.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Negative> If you look at these polls and you look at the specifics and the swing voters who decide elections in this country, in poll after poll, 69 percent of women disapprove, 67 percent of independents. Young people, 70 percent unfavorable. That's not just one poll. It's several. So, what work do you have to do? How are you going to convince them that you are their candidate?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When people see that I'm going to bring jobs back to this country, when they see that I'm going to strengthen up the military. ..  [Applause] ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> when they see that I'm going to have strong borders like nobody else can have and we will build a wall.  And Mexico will pay for the wall, by the way.  But when they see that we're getting rid of Obamacare, which is a total disaster and we're going to be replacing it with something good.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Applause] When they see we're going to get rid of Common Core, which is also, likewise, a total catastrophe, and we're bringing education locally, so it can be run by local communities and the parents of the children.  And it's going to be wonderful and beautiful and much better.  When they see what we're going to do -- and maybe above all, when they see -- we are going to make some of the great trade deals -- every deal we have is a total disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Our country is losing a fortune. Now, women -- if you saw my big win in New York, -- it was a landslide, like unprecedented -- women were one of the highest demographics. [Applause]
<Savannah Guthrie> <Negative> But that's not...
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Yes and to Savannah's point, it's a valid one, though. It's different in a Republican primary than in a general election.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I agree with that, you know, but I think it'll come along.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> And some of the things you've said -- and I'm not going to go into all the words. I don't think we have to, and some of the insults of -- about women, Mexicans and Muslims. You can't unsay those things. So how do you convince them -- cause by the way, they've been listening to all the things you just said about jobs and the wall.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think it's about -- look.  I did some things and I've said some things in fun.  I've said it as an entertainer, doing the Apprentice.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know how successful -- I just saw Steve Burkett said they wanted to renew me for two years.  And I didn't do it because of this.  But a lot of that was entertainment.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Applause] There's nobody that respects women more than I do. There's nobody that will take care of women's health issues better than I will. Hillary cannot do it. Believe me. She doesn't have the strength, the energy. She will not be able to do it. And I think that women will be big fans. Look, they want to see security for our country. And I rate number one in every poll in security. With the military. The military is endorsing me. I just gotten endorsed by the border patrol, 16,000 agents. They've never done that before.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Negative> Let's get to some of our town hall questioners.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Positive> Cause I think Willie has got one right here.
<Question> <Positive> Mr. Trump, good morning. Good to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning.
<Question> <Neutral> We've got a lot questions, so let's get started with Andrew Sullivan, Brooklyn New York, registered Republican and a supporter of yours.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Hi.
<Question> <Positive> Hello, Mr. Trump. Full disclosure, I did work for you. And I appreciate the ten years of good union construction work you provided for me and my family. God bless you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good. Good. Thank you. Thank you.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> What's your question, sir?
<Question> <Positive> The question is this. In regards to ISIS, I sincerely appreciate the aggressive stance you want to take with them. And my question, how do we avoid the pitfalls of the past, in part, by getting involved yet again in this perpetual state of war with no end in sight?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it's such an important question.  You know, I was against the war in Iraq.  I said you don't go in.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're going to destabilize the Middle East.  I was so strong against Iraq.  We went in.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We made a terrible mistake in going in.  Then we got out the wrong way.  ISIS, as a matter of fact, was created because of the way we got out and because of the bad moves we made even while we were there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we now have to do something.  We have to knock the hell out of them.  We're going to get them out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to help.  We're going to get the countries in that region to put up their manpower or they've got big problems.  And a lot of that is going to be leadership.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we do have to get rid of ISIS We are going to make it impossible for ISIS to survive.  They're cutting off heads.  They're drowning people in steel cages.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's like medieval times. I've never seen anything like it. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. So, we are going to get rid of ISIS. By the way, speaking of that, our military has been decimated with cuts and everything else. We're going to rebuild our military. It's going to be bigger, better, stronger than ever before. [Applause] Hopefully, we don't have to use it. But the one place we will be using it is to get rid of ISIS. Great question. Thank you.
<Question> <Positive> Thank you sir.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Thank you Jim. Just so -- just to make sure I'm clear here, you're going to bomb the you know what out of ISIS. But you have a comprehensive plan?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> For what to do in that region afterwards?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, one of the things that -- running for office is interesting.  Because they'll ask you questions like that.  And I did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said bomb the you know what - I've been saying that from the beginning.  They never did it.  Then they started it on a very limited basis.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right now, Libya, as you know, has fantastic oil, some of the finest oil in the world. Who has the oil? ISIS has the oil. Do we blockade it, do we bomb it, do we do anything? No. ISIS is making a fortune now in Libya. That was a Hillary Clinton deal. She wanted to go in, she wanted to get rid of Gadhafi. For what reason? I mean, look, Gadhafi was a bad guy. Saddam Hussein was a bad guy. They had one thing in common. They killed terrorists, OK? We would have been better off if we never looked at the Middle East for the last 15 years.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Neutral> Let's get to another question.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> OK Mr. Trump, I have Jamie Heckman Yuowa. She's from West Sayville, New York, a registered Republican, married, three kids. Still undecided.
<Question> <Negative> My relative is a natural-born American in the military, deployed in Oman. His father and his stepmother are undocumented citizens here in the -- undocumented people here in the United States for the last 25 years without any way of adjusting their status. If you're president, what will you do for those members that are the fabric of our country that have been here for 25 years undocumented? Won't they be deported I'd like to know ?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When you say natural-born citizens, it's interesting, cause why do you mention that. I assume that you were born here. But why do you mention that? Because you know who always says that? Ted Cruz, because he was born in Canada and lived there for four years. People are trying to figure... [Applause] So he always says, I'm a natural-born citizen when, actually he's not.
<Question> <Negative> I don't -- I'm not for Cruz.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because he was born in Canada. But, you know what? He has no path right now...
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> What's your plan for her relatives?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You -- they've been here how many years?
<Question> <Neutral> I've got 25 years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we're going to do something for people that have been -- look, we're either going to have a country or we're not going to have a country. But many people are very fine people. And I'm sure these are very, very fine people. They're going to go, and we're going to create a path where we can get them into this country legally, OK? But it has to be done legally.
<Question> <Negative> So you will deport them first, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Otherwise, we don't have a country. They're going to be. And they're going to come back and they're going to come back legally. We have some wonderful people. It's too tough to say you'll never come back again. They're coming back, but they're coming back into our country legally. So important. Now that might not be the perfect answer for you. But am I going to get your vote?
<Question> <Positive> By the way, they are from Ecuador and I'm organizing the relief effort for Ecuador and I need transportation for volunteers and supplies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. Very good.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> All right, all right. Willie, do you have a Twitter question?
<Willie Geist> <Positive> Yes, we're getting thousands of questions on Twitter, Mr. Trump. I picked one here. This is from Jessica Hershey, Toms River, New Jersey. I'll just read it as a quote on a hot button issue here. Mr. Trump, please be specific. Tell us your views on LGBT. How you plan to be inclusive as president. Speak about North Carolina bathroom law, in particular.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I had a feeling that question was going to come up, I will tell you.  Well if North Carolina did something.  It was very strong.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they're paying a big price.  And there's a lot of problems.  And I heard -- one of the best answers I heard was from a commentator yesterday saying, leave it the way it is, right now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There have been not -- very few problems. Leave it the way it is. North Carolina, what they're going through with all the business that's leaving and all of the strife -- and that's on both sides. You leave it the way it is. There have been very few complaints the way it is. People go. They use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate. There has been so little trouble. And the problem with what happened in North Carolina is the strife and the economic -- I mean, the economic punishment that they're taking. So I would say that's probably the...
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Do you have any transgender people working in your organization?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> No? DONALD
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I really don't know. I probably do. I really don't know.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> All right. So if Caitlyn Jenner were to walk into Trump tower and wanted to use the bathroom, you would be fine with her using any bathroom she chooses?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That is correct.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> OK.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Neutral> Different issue, also a social issue...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, there's a big move to create new bathrooms. Problem with that is for transgender. That would be -- first of all, I think that would be discriminatory in a certain way. It would be unbelievably expensive for businesses and for the country. Leave it the way it is.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Negative> Let's talk about abortion, another potent issue. The Republican platform, every four years, has a provision that states that the right of the unborn child shall not be infringed. And it makes no exceptions for rape, for incest, for the life of the mother. Would you want to change the Republican platform to include the exceptions that you have?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I would. Yes, I would. Absolutely. For the three exceptions. I would.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Neutral> Would you have an exception for the health of the mother?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would leave it to the life of the mother, but I would absolutely have the three exceptions.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Willie?
<Willie Geist> <Positive> All right. Let's go back to the crowd here Mr. Trump. Dr. Priscilla Peramas Warren of Scarsdale, New York. She's married with one son, registered Republican and a supporter of yours.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Question> <Neutral> Mr. Trump, your wife, Melania, suggested that you be presidential. Can you tell us some of the things that you have done to be more presidential?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm sure Melania would like me to not hit as hard sometimes.  And yet, you know, when I started, we had 17 people and I was being hit from every angle by governors and senators and really smart and wonderful people who endorsed me, Ben Carson and others, Chris Christie, another one.  And you know, you're being hit pretty hard.DONALD I felt that I had to hit back very hard.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I think if I didn't, if I acted very presidential, I wouldn't be sitting up here today.  Somebody else might be.  It wouldn't be me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I will tell you, it's easier for me to be presidential than for me to be doing what I've been doing for the last, really, nine months. But at the right time, I will be so presidential, you will be so bored. You will say, can't he have a little bit more energy? But I know when to be presidential. We have two more left. They are really -- they have absolutely no path to victory. In fact, it was announced this morning, they have no path to victory. And we have a very easy path to victory. I think they'll be gone very soon.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> On the Democratic side...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Two good people, but I think they'll be gone very soon.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> On the Democratic side of things, huge issue is Wall Street banks. I mean, they're firing at each other on that subject. You're a guy who said you know the Wall Street bankers better than anyone.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Better than anyone.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> All right. After the 2008 financial meltdown, do you think any of the guys you know better than anyone should have been in jail?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it's a question I've heard so often.  I've been asked so often.  And the answer is, if they did something purposely, purposely, illegal, the answer is absolutely yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, with all of that being said, I don't believe anybody has really been indicted and gone to jail, which is pretty amazing.  Because I'm sure there was some pretty bad moves made.  I will say this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A lot of mistakes were made. You can't put a businessman in jail because he made a bad business decision. You know, they want to do well. For the most part, Wall Street bankers want to do well. I know so many of them. You know so many of them. They want to do well. They're good people like everybody else. They've got a lot of money. I think they're paid too much money but what are you going to do? I mean, you know, it's one of those things. Did they make a business mistake? You can't put people in jail. If they did something that they know is illegal and wrong, you have to put them in jail.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Does it ever surprise you that so many of your supporters are so angry at those banks because they feel the decks are stacked against them? And yet you're the guy they're supporting and you're a guy who has been given every single advantage those banks can give to the wealthiest Americans.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have taken advantage of the banks probably more than any human being on earth.  I love banks.  Right? I love banks.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I love fighting with banks if I have to.  I mean, you know, it depends on what happens, the economy goes up, it goes down.  But I've found bankers to be very good people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've found them to be very honorable people. Generally speaking, they want to do what's right for the country. But again, you know, I've known some bad dudes. You've known some bad dudes, Matt. I mean, I've been at parties. I've seen you and I've seen these people in the same room as us. You know, there are some people out there that are not good people. For the most part, I have to say, though, Wall Street people, they're aggressive. They're tough. They're smart. And they bring a lot of money and a lot of jobs into this country.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Negative> Do you believe in raising taxes on the wealthy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. I do. Including myself. I do. [Applause]
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Willie?
<Willie Geist> <Neutral> I'm with Ella Walders. She's is right here in New York City, registered Republican, undecided, but leaning your way.
<Question> <Positive> Good morning, Mr. Trump and congratulations on your big win in New York.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Question> <Positive> My question to you is, can you please share with us a single most important lesson that you've learned growing up? And who do you consider a mentor now, and why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's a great question.  And I'm not asked it very often.  I will tell you a real lesson.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My father was a builder in Brooklyn and Queens.  He had built housing.  And he loved to work.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he didn't say, you have to work and you have to do this.  But I would learn sitting at his knee, playing with blocks.  And it would be a Sunday or Saturday night or any time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was always working.  And he was a happy man.  And I learned that work is a great thing that -- you know, I looked at my father.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He had a wonderful wife.  They had a fantastic marriage.  It was 63 years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was an incredible relationship.  But my father was a very happy person.  And all he did is work.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He couldn't take a -- I don't think he has ever taken a vacation. One time he told me he took a vacation and he came back early. He was happy. He was content. He had a great family. He had a great wife. And what I learned is that when you work, and if you enjoy what you're doing -- if you really love what you're doing, it's a great thing and you'll be happy. I know so many of the people -- many of them who were at the big celebration the other night. They're all friends of mine, they're big business people. Now, I'm not going to specify which, but some of these people unbelievably wealthy, but unbelievably unhappy.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Let me ask you about something in the news this morning, as you've seen. Harriet Tubman will replace Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill. You have so often, during this campaign, railed against political correctness. Do you see this as a move that is all about political correctness or is this a move that's simply way overdue?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Andrew Jackson had a great history. And I think it's very rough when you take somebody off the bill. Andrew Jackson had a history of tremendous success for the country. As you know, they we're going to do the $10 bill and then all of a sudden the Broadway play, Hamilton -- or the Broadway play, sort of saved that one. And I read it just this morning. It was going to be Hamilton.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Are you in favor of Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think Harriet Tubman is fantastic. I would love to -- I would love to leave Andrew Jackson and see if we can maybe come up with another denomination. Maybe we do the $2 bill or we do another bill. I don't like seeing it. Yes, I think it's pure political correctness. Been on the bill for many, many years and, you know, really represented somebody that really was very important to this country. I would love to see another denomination, and that could take place. I think it would be more appropriate.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Positive> Mr. Trump, thank you so much for your time this morning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Positive> We thank everybody here for their questions. [Applause]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What do I know? I see Donald Trump is on the phone. He's, of course, probably promoting "The Apprentice" that is.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes, it should be rolling out its new season tonight.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did Martha Stewart had her debut last night?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Last night, I haven't seen it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. I heard they're not getting along but I don't think Donald Trump would ever admit that.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No, he's going to take the high road. Don't you think?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What's that noise?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> That was my copy. I'm sorry. It's gone now.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh. Mr. Trump? Oops, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning to you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Look at you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How are you?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How are you, my friend?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm doing good, Howard. I'm doing good. You're doing good. You're waiting for the big day, huh?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, man. I can't wait.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, it's that time.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It's going to be big.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, that's what they're all saying in the world of showbiz, right? You know, I'm in that world a little bit and they're all saying, it's going to be big, so like.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> For me, --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have no doubt.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> For me, it's the future of broadcasting. I mean, I got to get out of here. I've -- I've had it. I mean between the FCC, the religious right, taking away my radio stations, I can't function like this anymore. And quite frankly, I like the whole thing. I think it's a very worthwhile product.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You always want to say to Donald "What happened to the world that we have to leave broadcasting?"
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, that's right. That's right. Things have gotten out of hand. I -- listen. Never mind me. Let's talk about you. Your appearance on the Emmys. A-plus.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, thank you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That was good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That was good.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Seeing you in a pair of overalls was startling to me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, they asked me to sing and I said "You have to be kidding."" About a month ago
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It occurs --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said "Okay. Look
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I didn't even know what overalls were, so what the hell is that?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And they gave me a pair of things that they went up and bought at some [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you mean, you don't know went overalls were?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I never wore them. I never wore them with the suspenders over the top.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you ever -- do you know, it occurs to me, every time I've seen you in my entire life, you're always in a suit. Do you ever lay back and --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Do you ever wear a pair of jeans?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I wear jeans seldom, really seldom. You know, I'm a very formal type person.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I wear -- Obviously I play golf and I play tennis and I play stuff like that but generally I like, you know formality. And what happened here is, you know, they first they brought out these. I think they call them overalls and coveralls and they brought these things out. And I said "You have to be kidding"" and then they brought out a pitchfork and a hat. And I
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, it just was odd to see you in a pair of overalls.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I mean, he, he likes formality. I'm telling you, the guy is always in a suit and I, and I, I mean, did you ever do you ever put on a pair of shorts ever?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll do it on occasion.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> When he plays tennis, I'm sure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But not very much. Yeah, like if I play tennis,
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> There's a whole closet filled with suits?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's mostly filled with suits and they're usually the same color.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I mean, it's --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like, I like dark suits. I just like it. You know, I grew up that way. I just grew up as formal. I like formal.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You dressed even as -- [?]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, during the dotcom, during the dotcom thing a number of years ago, guys would come up to my office. They'd be wearing shirts, shorts, and undershirts, right?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah. Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, this is like, a cool thing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then, when that went crashing, they gave up that look. You know, when everyone lost all their money, they gave up that look.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> The whole dotcom look?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The whole dotcom look that was made up of really bad jeans and an undershirt.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Even Bill Gates had to give up that look
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, that was a bad luck. That was a serious -- in the new little bit of the dotcom, this is just peanut. Com. I call it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> In other words, if you're going to invest money in something, you better come into your office with a goddamn suit on and let's look like we know what we're doing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, at least like sort of semi-presentable so when they gave me this, I said, you know, then, I put it on and found it didn't want that I said "I hope I don't look fat."" So I put it on and I looked okay. And I went out and the audience went nuts and
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I woke up. The first people I see are that desperate housewives. And then, you look at those first 15 rows and you know, they, you, you, you know, everybody indirectly you know from watching television or movies, everybody in their seats, everybody. And I'm saying" I can't believe I'm doing this"". As I'm walking out
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Wait a second.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- won what they called the Emmy Idol, you know
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We want to get your friend, William Shatner.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> William Shatner was a competitor.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we went against him and some other people that were terrific actually --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You brought up the name "The Desperate Housewives"". I don't know about you. I don't watch that show."
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I'm, I'm sick to my stomach to see these women over and over again. Talk about a case of overexposure.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> When you look at them, they seem desperate, don't they?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I really like, you know, I think --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who do you like?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll tell you what, I like as a person Teri Hatcher. She's so nice to me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean every time I see her, she's just --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I like her.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Like so nice. I think she's really a nice person but you know, I don't really get it and --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Are they really good looking? They're not good looking.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Eva, Eva is really nice.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Eva is not that good looking.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> On your scale. On your scale. You have a very high scale, okay?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And on your scale, you know, you wouldn't watch the show, okay?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, I'm not going to watch it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You wouldn't watch it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Because I'm a man.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know who's really changed?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Nicolette.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Nicolette Sheridan.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now, she's --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She used to be this skinny, really skinny.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hot. [?]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And now, she, all of a sudden, did a total body transformation. I wonder how.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yeah, let me ask you something. On a scale of one to 10, go for the desperate housewives, Nicolette Sheridan is a two, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I'd say I would say she's in the 4 or 5 category
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right, if you were single demand, you know, back in the day. I'm talking about the way she looks now, you would not do her, would you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Then, I think, you know.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You would not do her.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like the way she used to look. I don't like the way she looks today.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> She's gone from a 10 to a four?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think she is. I think she's a solid four.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh, my goodness!
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay. Now, she was a 10.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> What a drop.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She wasn't a 10.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She was an ei -- she was a nine.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, she went from being very flat chested. I feel like a person who;s flat chested is very hard to be a 10.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh, okay.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, there has to be extraordinary. You have to have the face of Vivien Leigh to be a 10.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Exactly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you're flat chested. Okay? But she went from an eight to a solid four.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now, why, why do they carry on about the redhead on there, Marcia Cross? She's a what? A three?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, yeah. I hate to say it because I met all these people.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they were so nice.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But they --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They would go "I love your show. We love your show. We watch The Apprentice all the time."" And then I'm going to call her a three?"
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is she a three?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Damn, listen.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I call that -- you know what I'm going to do?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Call it like you see it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hey, Howard. I'm going to do this.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're all 10. They're magnificent beauties.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Oh, stop it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, no, no. That's not your style.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because I don't want to --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You've been to Hollywood.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to have an article. Every time I do your show, I get in trouble --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Just tell me [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- with all the headlines that I said something.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're a connoisseur of female pulchritude. You know whether or not a woman is good looking. You, you run the Miss USA and all that.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And the Universe.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And all those. By the way, those are 10s.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay, so Marcia Cross, is she a three? Is she worse looking than Nicollette Sheridan or better looking?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I, I'm going to get in trouble because I know these I know they know me well.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Forget the show business thing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Inaudible] did not.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, you'd better looking.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] if your beautiful girl decided to leave you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She said "Howard
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right. Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You lose about 40 pounds.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay. Now, you're starting to get out of depression about two months when you know you've eventually have to come out
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Either do that or do -- you just kill yourself.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I would, I would jump right back into the swimming pool.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> All right. Would you go out, as your first date, Marcia Cross?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Come on. Just a start out.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Would you go out with Marcia Cross or would you turn gay, Howard?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I would go out with Marcia Cross.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> She's not bad.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> She's got a good body [Inaudible] bag on her ass.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, you know.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So, so tell me, is she really a four? Is she a four? Is she a four? Give her a number, please.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I, I, I -- Well she's in that, she's in the category. You know, solid four to five.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay. What about Terri? What is she now? Be honest.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well Terry you know
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why is she [Inaudible]?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I only know Terri now.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Terri is very thin.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Too thin.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's extremely thin. She's really nice and you know, they're very good actresses.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is she a six?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, she is a six.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay. And, and, and Eva --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Let me track this. Sharon, a four. Cross, a four to a five and Terri's a six.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And, and, and the other one, the final one, Eva Longoria.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Eva Longoria.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she's really cute I have to tell you she's really [Inaudible], really cute.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's about five foot, one.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You like girls that a five foot one, they call and they come up to you nowhere.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I would do her.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You would.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I would do her.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But she's [Inaudible]. She's got beautiful skin.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is she a seven?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, yeah, sure.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh she is?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure, she is.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Definitely seven.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, she --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Evaluate --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have to get started. You have to like short girl. She's very very short. You know, she goes out with a basketball player which is interesting but she's very short.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Tell me about Carmen Electra now. Is she still a 10?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You see, I never thought she was a 10.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In her heyday, I've never thought she was a 10. And I think Carmen is somebody who has unbelievable photogenic abilities. She really looks unbelievable in a picture. And then when you see her first of all she's unbelievably short.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Mm-hmm.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm a little bit surprised. I think that the, the boob job is terrible. You know they look like two light posts coming out of a body.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Give her a number, please.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would say she's an, an eight.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> An eight?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, she's an eight. I'm talking about
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who is a 10? Who is a 10?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If I see a picture of Carmen Electra in the, in the -- you know, in the New York Post, right? She's a 10 all the time.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's great. [?] If I see her in person, she's a solid eight.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who is a 10 of all time?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A 10 of all time?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> A 10 of 10.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I love this guy's [Inaudible]. He knows this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. I truly know.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He thinks about it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know I'd be much more accurate and much more blunt if you and I were having this conversation in the back.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know I was.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible] is that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Or I pick you up because your freaking car is lost, okay?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thank God for [Inaudible].
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Really? He saved you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Then I'd be much more honest here 'cause now, I'm trying to be a politician.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> If he's-
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it's very hard when you, when you're doing the rating system [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He's like my superman he rescued me.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> [Inaudible], swooped in and save you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. But you know what? This is what --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There aren't many, there aren't many 10s. You know, 10 is a rare, rare specimen. You know that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I like.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, you're married to a 10.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll tell you what, I'm married to a woman. This has nothing to do with anything but I'm married to a woman who is truly one of the most beautiful women.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, she is. I've been around her. She's a great one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She is a great beauty, considered to be a great beauty.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There are --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What is a, what is a -- All right, here's a good question. Right now, at this point in history, your ex-wife Ivana, what is she?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Oh, no.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you can judge now.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Judge now.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, if I said that, Howard,
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Come on.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That would be such a disaster. I don't think --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> This is the moment of his [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's been going after me for 20 freaking years.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Then she'll never stop [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's going after me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You've -- I've let you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I do a book, she comes out with a book and it fails.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Let's forget, let's forget that we're on the radio. Let's have those conversations we have when we're alone.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> See, he's told you Ivana's number.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, he's definitely a fan of Ivana.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I don't [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ivana is very beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I don't like her. I don't like her attitude.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what I'll say? I don't like her attitude, to be honest with you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, but Ivana was a very beautiful woman.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Back in the day. Great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's a very beautiful woman.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But today, what is she?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, I don't want --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is she a four?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't do that. You know why? She's the mother of three of my children.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That's right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> If Teri Hatcher is a four, a six as you say, and, and, and, and Nicollette Sheridan is a four --
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> Here's a way to go, Howard
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> Is she higher or lower than Marcia Cross?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Are you asking me that question?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd always say higher because she's the mother of my children.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> Take away the kids.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have to be, I have to. Howard, if I asked you about your ex-wife, you could go five.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She's a 10.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, give me the answer.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> A 10. A 10.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, that's what I say. I say the same. I'm not as brave as you.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, I know. I know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it was -- those are very, very difficult scale questions.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right, now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But there's nothing like the scale.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No, but you're not going to --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> How, how amazing is this?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Who is the 10 of 10?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who is the 10 of 10? Come on.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, wait. I have a friend who -- I know somebody and this guy is a very, very rich guy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And he said "Donald
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If he sees a beautiful girl, he gets lockjaw. He can't talk.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right, go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He destroys people.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who is this guy? What is his name?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he's just -- I better not picked up his name but --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is it [Inaudible]?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But he's just a regular guy but he -- anything, anything he can go out with, he'll go out with. And yet he can't talk. He gets lockjaw. He can't talk with women. He can go to the office. He destroys people. He's [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So what's the point?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There is no point. Let's go.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Oh, there is no point.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What is it with [Inaudible] name?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who's the 10 of 10?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Uhm...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right now, if you could just be free to have sex with anyone you know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know. Okay, I'll tell you and I've always felt this and for some reason, it's always been this one with me. The most beautiful women aren't the famous woman.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay, who's a 10 of 10?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There are very few famous women. For instance, we had a girl named Jennifer who was Miss Universe last year, from Australia.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Forget that. Give me a famous person.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] You remember when you had Miss Universe on from Russia?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, beautiful woman but give me a famous person today that you see that is a 10.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Or at least a 10.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> A 10.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't think of any.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who's a 10 to you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'll tell you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who's a 10 to you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Probably the same as you [?].
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No Charlize Theron. No?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, not, not. By the way, not even close.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You have to understand. I've seen all of them. I'll tell you, you know one of my --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What is Charlize Theron?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would say a solid seven.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> All right. How about --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> This is the guy who gets a lot of good-looking [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no. I own the Miss Universe contest though.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. She's a --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I see, I see, I see [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Halle Berry.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I tell you what. I think she's got from the midsection to the shoulders.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's a 10.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. Right. The face?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The face is a solid eight.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He's right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And the legs are maybe a little bit less than that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He's --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But you know what?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Pam Anderson today.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Wait. Wait. Wait.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Pam Anderson today. Pam Anderson today, not [Inaudible] though.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> She was never a 10 or [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Pam Anderson's a great friend of mine. She is a great person. The Pam Anderson is, is, you know. Come on, give me a break.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What is she? What is she right now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Six.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> A six?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> A six?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I think so.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What about Ashley Judd?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Ashley Judd's beautiful in a soft way.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Who cares about her? Gwen Stefani?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Gwen Stefani, I like. I mean she's got great style.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Give me a number.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> An eight.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> An eight?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Paris Hilton.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> See, I know Paris Hilton off cam. I think Paris is a nine actually. A lot of people disagree. I argue about Paris all the time. I think Paris is beautiful. And then people would tell me she's not beautiful at all.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Jessica Simpson.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Uh, Jessica Simpson's really cute. I think Jessica Simpson is a good eight or nine.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right, that's what I thought too.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Don't you think so?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] Howard. Most beautiful women are not the famous ones.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, we don't know them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that's your problem, not mine.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Will Dakota Fanning grow up hot?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh my gosh.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She will not?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She will always be cute.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But she'll never be hot.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She'll never be hot.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are the Olsen twins hot at all?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Not now.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Not now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And they never were [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And they never were?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> About eight or nine.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And they never were.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And they never will be.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> And you guys were...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know what, Howard? Someday, if you go, as an example to the Miss Universe contest, these were -- and you say it sometimes, you know, when they go on your show and you destroy them. I mean, what you did to that woman from Russia. She never had a fire her. You know what I said? Oksana, you're fired. She never recovered.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You know who's intense?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You're going to laugh me out of the box right now.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That chick we used to be on Star Trek, Jolene Blalock.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's a long time ago though.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No, no, not the original Star Trek.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, I'm talking about the [Inaudible] Star Trek.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, really?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You cheated on her.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know her.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She's hot, man.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know her.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I wonder if you'd agree.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I don't think you'd find it a 10.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, but it's true. You know, you go out like, like, like I go to the awards the other night so I've seen everybody write-up plus, you know. I mean, I was the guy. I was up for the nomination. I had the best seat. I sang. I did it. It's like I'm backstage with all these people. I've seen every one of them.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They were no 10s.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No, not a 10 [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They were no 10s of the famous people.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You went backstage and you said, you said "You know what? I'm satisfied with Melanie because you know what? I don't need any of these broads."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Honestly, Melanie was the most beautiful person in that auditorium, in the shrine auditorium.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You haven't [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The most beau -- in fact,
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You haven't --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Every night, I said that. They said, like, you know, this guy whatever, he said the most beautiful woman but --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Would you ever be with a black woman?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Have I what?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Have you been with a black woman?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Uh
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Go ahead and say 'yes'.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He had to.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You had?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Their name rhymed with Umba?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, no.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you had a famous phone call. Do you remember the phone call you had with AJ?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, and you know, you have, there's a woman named Corey Young who's, who's a black woman, who is a total great person and a beautiful woman --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right. You had her?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And she was AJ's girlfriend.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> For a while.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But she's barely black right? Isn't she mostly white?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, she's black. She [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Have you ever made love to a real --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's like this great person.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Have you ever made love to a full-blown [Inaudible]?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And by the way, car, a car is a 10.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, yeah. A car is beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I always consider myself blacker than her.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You don't even know.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm saying, do -- I'm saying, did you ever make love to a full black woman?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Are you going to watch The Apprentice tonight, Howard?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. Hey, did you hear my -- Yeah, in fact I'll talk to you about [Inaudible]. Did you hear my theory that you were Jewish?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, really? No.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Here's what happened, I was running with two friends of mine.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, that was money.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I was running with Richie Notar from Bobo.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And Patman Nakia.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Patron and was saying, he goes "you know Trump's Jewish?"
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I go "You kidding me?"" He goes ""No
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I grew up in Queens.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I guess, you know any wash from Queens named Trump?, he goes. And secondly what's a trump?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Robin Quivers I think as far as Hills, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Howard Stern Right. He goes You ever heard of -- What is Trump because they made that name up.""""
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> So did his father changed his name? Donald Trump is Jewish like one of the best kept secrets. I go "Are you kidding me?"" And then Richie goes ""You know what? You're right. We're in Forest Hills. Are there any wasps?"" he goes. So I'm sitting here going ""I can't believe because I could always spot a [Inaudible]."" I'm going ""This guy's in Country Club. He's following everybody."""
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He just slipped right under the radar.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And then, we did some research. We found out that you're the furthest thing from a Jew.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, actually, you know, I'm in a very Jewish business, okay?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But Harry Helmsley and Donald Trump were the only two. But When Harry's gone, he met the wonderful Leona, she destroyed them and that was the end of everything.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was a sad -- that was called a sad, sad ending.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Tell me the truth. Don't give me any BS. You and Martha Stewart are having problems?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. We don't have problems at all.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You don't like her anymore?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like her a lot.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] she's a 10. You know, Martha -- first of all, I did her show yesterday and the show aired and my show is tonight and I've had a great relationship with Martha for a long time and I chose her. I mean, I chose it to go on The Apprentice with Mark Burnett.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And you getting piece of the action.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, you know what happened. I mean, we were thinking about Mark Cuban and then he did a show and he bombed and you know, [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Rated
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why are you
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And then we were thinking about Richard Branson --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- and Branson did a show and he drew flies.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He'd get no ratings so they did an automatic Nielsen for us. And we were thinking who would be good with The Apprentice and we chose Martha and her show add [Inaudible] but you didn't see it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I didn't see it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You were too busy watching the airplane landing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. Did you watch that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I didn't see it. I hear it's unbelievable.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, it was petrifying. How'd you like to be in a plane like that. Is that like, just like, the worse?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh my God. I mean --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We were asking, Donald, would you be a crier or a prayer? Which one would you be?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I'd cry and you know he'd cry too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's -- I don't know what I'd be doing. I'll tell you one thing: it wouldn't be pretty
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Martha Stewart, at the end of her show doesn't say "You're fired."" She says ""you don't fit in."" I think ""you don't fit in"" is crueler than I'm
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You don't fit in is, you know, sort of a long expression. You know, it's very to -- tough. Every once in a while, an expression comes out and sometimes, it sounds simple. It's very tough to beat "You're fired""."
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> One of the broads has written in the tabloids -- one of the broads on your new show, the one that premieres tonight on NBC. Listen to this.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> The broad.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, because I read this in the tabloids.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> She's abroad?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> This is Chica there, right? she wants to be in The Apprentice.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And they list her on The Apprentice. Is this embarrassing to the show to bring this up?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No. Not at all.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is this -- a girl in the show who they list as an owner of salons. That's her background.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I've talked about this girl.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And now [Inaudible] --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Her name is Allah.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, and they're saying she's now was a stripper and, and she found some guy who used to pay to take her out to dinner.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Yeah, I told you this whole story. He used to come -- No, he used to get lap dances from her.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> She was a stripper.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> And he loved her so much, he's started robbing and killing people.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He killed three people --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- to pay for his lap dances.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> -- to pay for lap dances from her. She must be super hot huh?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she's hot and she's really smart. She's very, very cunning. Very, very smart. She's an amazing character.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is she a nine?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's a -- very good looking and she's like an amazing character. I will say this though. We have people, this Sentara [?]. I mean, this is just terrible. You know I wasn't happy with Shokri. I wasn't happy with it.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It did very well in the ratings but I didn't like it because I didn't pick the cast and I couldn't pick the cast from building too many -- . I said "I'm not
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I ended up with 18 people and I just didn't agree with the cast. It was -- To me it was terrible. So the show goes on as well. And I couldn't stand it. And same thing with you but to a much lesser extent but one really work with a crazy Omarosa and everything it just rose.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, so it continues to get good ratings. And I say "I don't care. I'm going to go to California this time"" so we had over a million people applied. I go to California that they it down to 2
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] "This woman is so beautiful that she's not credible"". I said ""Do me a favor
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have, on that show, two 10s. Two 10s.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Two 10s.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, two 10s.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And now, listen to this.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're not going to [Inaudible] one.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I have one -- I have one girl in the show. I won't even tell you who 'cause I'll let you figure it out but I have one girl on that show who is one of the most beautiful women I've ever met.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Really? Well, you're smart because that's what you do. Hey, before I let you out of here --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> By the way, he is right that that woman is smart because when the guy went really off the deep end he actually was holding a gun on her at one time and she talked him out of killing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right. She saved her own life.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> That's pretty damn good.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> This guy, this guy did not sound like a very solid citizen.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you, did you, did you bring this up on the show or --
<Eric Lynch> <Positive> No. Well, actually on the show we find out if -- we, we had no idea because she owns spa and everything, you know, but on the show, a lot of things come out at one of the board rooms. It's amazing. It's an amazing board room. So this is the best show we've ever done. Number four is the best we've ever done. It's even better than one.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Hold on one second. Eric, the midget, needs to talk to you. Yes, Eric, the midget? Eric?
<Eric Lynch> <Positive> Yes, sir?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, w-what is it, Eric? This is Eric, the midget.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I want to talk to Mr. Trump because I am interested in getting into the hotel business and I have some ideas.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> I'll allow you three seconds on Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He should be on The Apprentice.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is Eric [Inaudible]?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right. Maybe we should put Eric on the offensive. He'd be perfect.
<Eric Lynch> <Positive> Eric, listen to me. There's no time for nonsense. Give Mr. Trump your two best ideas.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And we are [Inaudible].
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Okay. The top idea I have is it's called a sports hotel and casino in Las Vegas. What this hotel would be able to do since they got built will be to have not only professional sports teams from all the different types of sports.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What about an elf hotel, filled with elves?
<Eric Lynch> <Neutral> Why are the sports teams all coming to Las Vegas to stay in a hotel?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, no. I mean, they'll be able to play their home game there.
<Eric Lynch> <Neutral> What?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What? All right. Listen. Eric, I will forward a letter to Mr. Trump that you write. Maybe you, you can do the pitch that way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Eric Lynch> <Neutral> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Eric, thank you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thank you.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> That is a brilliant idea.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What do you think of that sports hotel?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> For sports teams to play their home games in.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's sort of a complicated idea to figure how many home, how many home games do we need in Las Vegas
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why don't you tell him?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, the sports franchises is trying to stay out of Las Vegas. Not in Las Vegas.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why don't you tell him he's fired?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Eric?
<Eric Lynch> <Neutral> How about --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Are you there, Eric?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> Eric you're fired. Get the hell out of here. I'm only kidding, guys. You're not fired.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right, Eric. Give me a letter and I'll send it out to him [?].
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You need a job to get fired.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Hold on, Eric. Let Eric write that in a letter. All right. Listen, Good luck with the premiere of The Apprentice.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Tonight at 9 o'clock on NBC.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> True.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm sure the show will do well and --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> From watch, you have to tell me. You have to call me when you see the cast. You have to tell me what you think 'cause you're asking me about ratings all day long like rating.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Rating women. I'm talking about.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I will call you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well you have to call me and tell me what you think of the beauty of some of the women.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I will.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well you can't you can't pick [?] all these rated because that would not really be credible. You can't have all 10.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And things will [Inaudible] --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Super geniuses and everything else but you have to tell me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And things, and things with Melania, you're good?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Excellent.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Sex is still good.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The sex is extraordinary.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Three days a week?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Howard, much more than that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, do you only do three days a week?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Sometimes a little more.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Ah?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Sometimes more.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay. No. Much more.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> Really?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible] Mr. Trump at the Emmys the other night. I said "So Mr. Trump
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Nice.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There you go.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All intercourse? Not the other things?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm a very, you know, I'm like the old fashioned way. Pretty straight stuff.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, me too.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I'm not into the whole world of craziness.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> All right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Let me ask one thing though. The thing I don't understand about Donald was his incredible success now. He still does the learning annex.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, I do. You know, the man that runs -- I'll tell you, it's crazy. It is like semi embarrassing but great. You know what happened? He asked me to do the learning annex and I gave a speech about success and my -- you know, like a motivational touch [Inaudible] which I do and I do it and I like doing it. I have fun doing it and everything else. But he asked. We ha -- we did it last year in New York and 25,000 people came. You know, they started also --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it's a successful, it's a successful
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And they ended up going --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- to the convention center in New York. The convention center because that was -- that was the only place that you don't have it. So anyway, he did one in Los Angeles. Now, in all fairness, Robin, they paid me so much money that --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> How much money? How much did they pay you for that?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Over a million dollars for a speech.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're kidding me?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know what, Howard?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You know what? I would do that too.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Howard, listen.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, how long do you have to talk?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, you can be really rich. But when you can't, you know, walk down to Madison Square Garden to make a speech and take up a million dollars.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> There's something wrong with you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, you've got to sort of think in terms of retirement.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because honestly, I did one the other day half a million dollar speech and I had to walk one block to a hotel.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> By yourself? [?]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I say to myself, you know, I wasn't in the mood to make a speech. I'm saying "Why would I turn down half a mil -- ?"" You've got to be really --"
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- Stupid
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Shame on you if you have even 10,000,000 dollars and you won't --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Walk down for a million.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> -- walk down the street for half a million dollars.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You, you got to -- You just got to do it. So I don't care how rich you are, you have to do so.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Explain -- Now, wait a second. Explain --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now [Inaudible] in Los Angeles.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Explain something to me --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> -- because we're running out of time.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It's important to me. When you say having that much sex, Melania, what does Melania do to keep it fresh?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know. It's just --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Just wear outfits?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, if you really like somebody, --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Uh.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- if you really love somebody, it just sort of works.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Does she wear outfits to bed like Special Ops?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, she wears nothing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Nothing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Which is much better.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Nothing? Always nude?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Much better.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know, best estimate, how many years do you have left with Melania? Come on. How many?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, well, it's an infinite number of years.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right. All right. Listen. Everyone, watch Donald Trump on the season premiere of The Apprentice, tonight at 9:00 on NBC. I love when you call in.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Have a good time, Howard.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> All right, take care.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> So long, Robin.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Take it easy.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> Bye bye.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Thank you. I say three. All right, Rob -- Robin. I got to take a br --
