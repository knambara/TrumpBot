<Howard Stern> <Positive> Tell me when Donald Trump's on the phone. I'll do my thing 'til then. I was like, talking to him, I was like giving them brackets. The hot chicks.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> He loves getting into that with you.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Many feuds with a lot of people, so I'm always kind of --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Always.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I'm always kind of curious, who he hates him the most. I got, I got a bracket for Donald Trump about who he hates the most.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> And about beautiful women?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And hot chick. Yeah, I got some of the latest hot chicks on here, and he'll tell me, which ones are the best.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He knows them all.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. I see Donald on a lot of shows now, and you know, they ask him about politics and things, but I like him better, when he's just talking about girls, and people he can't stand. That's -- that's my take with Donald Trump. I love it when he talks.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You don't even get this conversation, about him possibly running for president again.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, because.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Any time at all.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Because he's never going to run for president. If he wanted to be, he would have done it years ago, because it was perfect time years ago. I think, it was more about, you know promotion and selling, and book at that time. And I think, this whole 'Donald Trump for President thing' always is good for publicity. But I don't think, he actually wants to be the president. I think, he's got too great in life. I mean, he's got so much fun in his life. You know, why would you want to be the president? You know what I mean?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Why does he even bring it up?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, because as I say, it's really good for publicity.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Good promotion.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. It's good promotion. People get all charged up, and they go, 'Oh, Donald Trump's gonna run for president.'
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But he never does.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He never does. Not interested. And he is funny. I mean, I've been down to his place, 'Mar-a-Lago'. Like if I owned that place, I would never even leave. Yeah, I think another son, is getting married at live. That's true?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I was invited. Oh, where are you?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Are you going?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah sure. I don't know, if I ever, I don't know. I don't think, I don't think, I am because, I wouldn't have any shoes to go down to that monologue. I think it is very mean.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But you know I live here. I was going to, I was saying, "Hey
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Howard, the country is going to hell. But I will say, you know, Mar-a-Lago was given over to the United States government. It was built by Marjorie Marriott, with a tremendous cost of 30 million dollars, to build in the 1920's.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow. That's, a beautiful place. But, it's a great place.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And these are great places. It's like, being on a movie set. Like, you go to dinner. I took my wife there, spent $30 million, back in that day. That's like $100 million, but I took my wife there for dinner, and it was like wow. You know. And it took my father in law, my mother in law, and we're like looks in there, and it's like, I feel like I'm in a movie or something.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> When I saw them standing there, and I said, "That's all American families"". Yes they are."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Just quietly, takes years to get a better looking group of people.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know, it's funny, because you go there, and every guy. Looks like you know like, like Donald Trump, like you know, they got a suit on, you know and stuff, and everything. But wherever you put me, I look like I'm in the wrong place.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, and I mean, I love it's been so it's it's too big for us, you got 58 bedrooms. It's got a hundred rooms. So I decided to make it a flop, and it was an easy answer.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm very good, by the way, I'm not getting approved. Nothing ever bothers you, like, like you all manner of people say now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah right. You'll just know somehow, it is the right thing to do.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I mean, it's not a house.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I remember my daughter Ivanka. I couldn't find her, when she was in the house. You know, we had to go through all these rooms, try to find a golf ball.,
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> As if you can find one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it's actually a very comfortable place, but it should be a flop, it was given to the United States government. Let me explain something. Richard Nixon was given Southern White House, because you know, it's got the walls outside. 35 feet high of four feet thick and they circle the whole house.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So, you have total privacy on 22 acres. Now, if somebody wants to eat there, they have to be a member of staff. To be a member, you just can't like come in off the public and eat.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You remember. I mean, you have to be a member of my law. To be there, and you see the kind of crowds, we get up mean play successful anyway. So Richard Nixon, had it was his first, when he died, it was wheeled over to the United States government. And Richard Nixon had it, and he loved that he was there one time, but of course, he then got embroiled in Watergate. So he wasn't able to use too much, he had bigger problems. So then Jimmy Carter became president, You know, he used to coming off a plane, because he thought it was inappropriate for a Marine to carry his suit, or for anybody to carry his own clothing. So even though he was President, remember the scenes of him walking out of a plane carrying something, because he wanted to be like a regular guy. This is what the country wanted, he was a president that wanted to carry his luggage off, a 747 by the way.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You have said, that you feel that Obama, doesn't walk off the plane, the proper way like a President should.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He bounces off the plane, he runs down the stairs. I tell you what. You know, Ford fell down the stairs one time, and I remember places it was Austria. You know, they're standing at attention, everyone is perfect.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> This guy falls off the plane, falling off the plane. And there is a Presidential Walk that you would like to see, the President do. To be more regal, am I correct.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think he should be running down the stairs, I mean he's bouncing, and running down the stairs. And I don't think it looks very 'Presidential'. But of course, he knows it's not, you know, but he's not much of a President. Look, he is making the happiest person about President Obama, and his Presidency is Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter is no longer the worst president ever.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You feel Obama has surpassed him, as the worst?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Absolutely, there's not even a question. But I mean, we're a disaster. You look at Russia. You look at this five to one trade, we get with, we get a traitor, and they get five leaders, that are killers.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I mean, then you would not have made that deal, if you were president.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, I don't think you see Trump, making that deals.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think so. What do you do, if you want to leave no prisoner behind?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And I've heard people say that, Donald seems to think that the guy is a traitor.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. You know, he's a low life trader. He walked half a walk of a number of times, but this time they caught him they nabbed him. But if he were a Congressional Medal of Honor winner, you don't make a trip you know make a trip. You cannot negotiate that way you can. And they embolden these people, and you see what's happening here.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You see, what's happening even since then, look what's going on here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We spent two trillion dollars in Iraq, the dumbest war ever caught. The world's dumb war. By the way, I'm no Bush fan. Just so you understand Obama should have gotten it, he got us out.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Bush? Don't you think, Bush is the worst president?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> In fact, he lied about weapons of mass destruction. So here's my argument. He lied to us about weapons of mass destruction, we were told that they had them. If they did not, we go in now, we're in this quagmire. The best friend that we ever had was, Saddam Hussein. He kept that region stable right now.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Saddam Hussein?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He killed terrorists. They were petrified of this goal. They should do that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He had other problems, not even had us convinced, that he had Al-Qaeda in that country.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> But there was no terrorism.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the other thing he did is, he held Iran at bay. Yes that's right, for hundreds of years, they go back and forth, you know one feet way, two feet, the other way, then they get tired. Rand was afraid of Iraq and Saddam Hussein. And by the way, now what happens is, we've decapitated that country. Now, how about this one. Of all the tragedies, talk about the 5:01, this is going to be the best. So now, Obama calls Iran to go in and help us. Now, Iran's going to go in, and help us out. We'll see, if ever they never going to go out, they're going to take over Iraq. For centuries, they've wanted to take over Iraq, and now they're just giving them.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Please go in, and straighten out. So don't wipe out these guys, you know from day one.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> So, Robin made a good point yesterday, and she got me thinking the right way. She says, "Look
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's their battle.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let's get out. Those people have to determine, what kind of lives they want to live. It's none of our business.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you think of that? We should never have been, in there with them, in the first place. So what do we do now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The disaster also. But we should never have been there in the first. What are we doing. Should not be going back.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Is this the day we leave? I don't care, if we're there for 25 years, and we educate them, and we do all the things, that we've been doing. I mean we're building them schools, which are now blown up. By the way, we're building schools. But you can't build a school in Brooklyn, because there's no money in this right. So, we have to stop school in California and Los Angeles. We should rebuild our own country. We should make our country great again. I mean, a little example of you would have seen it, when I took it over. It was like a bomb hit today. Yeah. But in a big way, we really have to rebuild, our own country, you know the Romans skating rink, in Central Park was a disaster right. I remember, when you rebuilt that. And I rebuilt it, with it was nine years under-construction, they spent $24 million It was a total catastrophe, the Koch administration, didn't know what to do. I took it over, I rebuilt it in three months. I mean this part of the rebuilding, was ripping down everything. They had put up, because it was so badly done.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you make a good point. You know, if our country doesn't rebuild our schools, and rebuilding our infrastructure, and our infrastructure, we're doomed.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And if we go over, and start building schools in Iraq, that get blown up, and not you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What's the point? You know, Howard and Robin just get back from the Middle East.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What were you doing there? For whatever reason.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Even knock the hell out of it. Even though, I say, "Oh
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No, I can't stop saying that. I'm not going to stop saying that. Why would you risk your life going in the Middle East? When I say, "You know
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Mr. Trump, you know he's used to landing in La Guardia? Where we have pot holes on the right? Right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> How about the sign that's made out of two by fours. That's 35 years old and warped and rotting. We love New York with little apple. All right cardboard. And it's all rotted and falling down. This is our airport, so I landed at airport in Dubai. It is now the biggest tomb airport to map, what the biggest airport in the world. The runways are like glass, you never saw anything so smooth, so perfect everything's good. You go to China, you've got airport you got bridges, you've got roadways, like you've never seen. We have roadways, you go up these roadways, that we have. I mean you have to drive slowly, because you destroy your car. The country, is falling apart and we're spending trillions of dollars, on these countries that don't care.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, you make a point, when, when China and Dubai have better airports than we do. We're no longer a big power.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I went to Guitar right. And I'm in Qatar, and the head person is showing me the airport, and they have magnificent rooms. You never saw anything, like it's a lobby, that's just that I say "This is the nicest airport
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Let me ask you something. You're a Republican guy, and you certainly want to keep taxes low. I think what you're advocating though is, we raise taxes and build infrastructure? Yes?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, what I'm advocating is, we build up our businesses. And we stop letting China make, when we stop letting other countries take our job. You know, whenever you call me, somebody starts calling, I have so many calls coming out.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That's one thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> True. And you know, what it is too. It's cutting off key words, and it's someone's listening to us and going. I was going to call now, call O' Donnell now.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He's on the phone with us.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, what else? What? I'm a very popular person. It's one of those things. But you know, we have to suffer through it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Let me ask you some brackets here, because this is the most important thing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> All right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I put together people you hate. I want to know, who you hate the most in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> All right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, I don't say, "Hey. All right""."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, wait a second. Ain't you got respect?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Let's do, let's do let's do brackets.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, ready?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> First bracket. Barack Obama versus Jerry Seinfeld. Now, I bring up these are only people, you have feuds with.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> All right.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Barack Obama. We know you're not happy with him. In terms of that President Barack Obama, I think, is a very bad president right. It's nothing personal with you.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I think, he doesn't know, what he's doing. He has no experience. You do need a deal maker of sorts. He has no experience. He's never made a deal, the only deal you ever made was, for his house and that was questionable in Chicago, by the way. You like my Chicago now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, it's unbelievable. What's going on with your life?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You got to sign, your Chicago sign. Sign on the side of him, you didn't hear about that. What is this about?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, for this, I built a great building in Chicago. I have to sign up, and it got a lot of publicity. Last week I'm surprised, that it happened.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But once you sign, I mean, how many projects you got go? What are you worth right now?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I just bought, as an example yesterday. I closed on the great, great resort in Scotland, called Turnberry, 2000 acres on the ocean. Incredible.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> When you say, you 'bought'?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You bought it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I bought it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. That's something, that's been in contention for years right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Turnberry, not. One of the greats ever. Tolbert? No, no, not contention. But I've walked around in Miami, a hundred acres in the middle of my four years ago, and where it's going to be amazing, and these are all big golf resorts.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> These are some golf resorts
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm starting the Old Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue, which is this great post office, that was built in 1880. Incredible. The walls are four foot thick solid granite. That's when the country had money, they used to build.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And like what do you do, when you're looking for a deal?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You look over the situation in these places. What are in the streets? And you say, "Hey
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Stress is a very good word, because you're not afraid to take love.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I love when something's in distress, that means you buy it, for the right price.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I love the word distress. I don't like things, like I turned down a lot of things that you know, that are in distress, because they're not in distress. They don't need it right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Our country is in distress, but you would rather take something, that like once was maybe, a jewel.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I could easily deal with it with competent leadership, but a lot of people don't do it. Because they're afraid, that the thing will not make money, once they pump money into, or they're afraid they don't know what they're doing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So, how do you know when you buy 800 acres in Scotland, that this thing is going to be big?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's phenomenal fable. It's great, it's on the water. Tt's you know, it's a whole thing. It'll be great.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It already is great, but you never say to yourself that's one in all fairness.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> That's one that already is great, but you never say to yourself, "Hey this thing is gee
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So now, it's doing big business. Thick, thick people. Tremendous everyone wants to go to everybody, from Miami is going there. So, a million developers probably, passed on the Dorough.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They know, there was a lot of competition.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I actually bought it in a bidding competition. Getting these things is not easy, because you know people are smart. They're smart people and then they bid and they want it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But how do you identify?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Somebody wrote about me recently, I was sort of he said, "Donald Trump has a knack for getting the best locations
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So, how do you identify these properties? Well, you can't possibly locate them as easy as that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I see them. It could be a site. It could be a building. It could be a building that needs help. It could be, you know a resort, but I see things that you know, I know that when I fix them they'll be great. And it's not great, and I've never had that happen before.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Is it a group of people that you invest with? In other words, do people come to you and say, "Hey
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't have partners. I mean for the most part, I do these things myself. Now I have a lot of cash. I have a lot of cash flow, these projects cash flow is great. And usually I just use my own money. Now think of it, think if I had a partner on my blog, I wouldn't want to partner Marillac. But where if I want to paint the ceiling, and say what's the return on investment for the bank.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No kidding.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Want to be sure? You do this on your own. I do them all by myself. No kidding. We have. We have a great company. I've built a great company.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> So you're saying, if you were the president, you'd just do the same business plan?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Except it would be easier it, would be much easier. We have such potential. The country has such potential. You know, as an example we have in the last five years. We don't have this technology. We have tremendous value under our land under our feet, and that we're not allowed to take it out. We take our coal and they destroy the coal industry in this country, and destroy it. And you could have clean coal. I'm not saying that's as good as natural gas, and other things but you know, we sell our coal to China. China then lets the coal go up, and they use it as an inexpensive form of energy, and they don't worry about pollution. But then they talk about the carbon footprint. You know they talk about carbon footprint. And then they laugh at how stupid the United States, is because their factories are much more efficient than our factories. But we're not allowed to use call. And yet China is buying all of our coal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So if you were the president, you would have clean coal.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> By the way, as one of many, many, many forms of energy. All right. Let's get back to the brackets.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> All right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What do you dislike more? Barack Obama or Jerry Seinfeld? Jerry Seinfeld, you had him booked for a charity event, and you got pissed off, because you didn't show up at it.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I don't dislike either. I don't dislike Obama. We went to that Jerry's. I've never been a fan of his. I don't find it funny, as an awkward guy and you know, a lot of people think awkward people are funny, because they view him as like a lot of other people. I don't get it but they find them awkward. I like this guy Seth Myers, he's an awkward person. You know, like you know, I watch him. I watch him, he's just an awkward. He shouldn't be doing television. He's an awkward person. He's got no, "Hey
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Give me a break. Because he was like, he was a friend of mine. Johnny Carson was right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You see him. Comedians? Have you watched him and you'd say, "I was going to college
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'd watch a guy every night and say, "Now
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You looked awful. I knew him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I didn't look up to him, because I knew him too. You know, he's a friend of mine. You do Johnny Carson, and Johnny had some serious problems.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What was Johnny's problem?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Well, he had a big drinking problem. And when he drank, and when he drank, a little bit too much. He was nasty, and people would come up. "Hi Johnny
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It's like such an incredible restaurant, and I didn't even want to say to Frank, "You know Frank
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But isn't it funny, how he was approached on television? You watch a guy like Seth Meyers. You can't even get the words out of his mouth, is terrible. This has nothing to do with me. I mean, he's, he's not God, did not put him on this planet, to do what he's doing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You understand it. I know what your point of view is, that the comedians today have sort of become the thing, where people are all worried, and a little bit off a little bit shy kind.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They really, I think probably, you know, they're a great comedians. I like comedy. I like comedians. I think it's good. No, I think Jerry Seinfeld is what angered me. About Jerry Seinfeld, as my son Grace tremendous amounts of money for charity. I have a son who's, who's a very good person. Eric Trump right. And he's got a little foundation, the Eric Trump foundation. He really works hard on St. Jude's Children with Cancer, and he lets agencies spends a tremendous amount of money, and he makes money. And I pay him a lot, and he does a great job. He's in charge as an example of Doonbeg, in Ireland, which I bought. And he's in charge of a couple of jobs, that are going up, that I'm doing he's fantastic.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It is nice to see that money for your kids, is doing a great job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But Eric is, you know in charge of Turnberry. It is an example also, and he works hard, and he gives his money to charity love it. So, he spends a lot of time with St. Jude's, and he's having a thing, at one of my golf courses up in Westchester, at this club. It's a tremendous success Trump International Golf Club. It's a beautiful, beautiful clubhouse, beautiful everything. It's all full, and it's a big hit. And Eric, is giving a charity up there. And Jerry Seinfeld agreed to entertain. Which is very nice.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> He's a great friend, yet it changes. And then something happened, where I guess, I made a statement politically maybe about Obama, and Jerry Seinfeld said, "I'm not going now"". Let me tell you
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So I'm putting down Jerry, in the bracketing versus Obama.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I don't dislike either of them.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I was disappointed in Jerry because you were disappointed.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And you had to be more disappointed in Barack Obama, or Jerry signs as the president. This is letting this country go to hell.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> All right. So we're putting up for auction.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know, let's, let's, you know, like, I don't dislike Obama on this. Why I would love to call you and say, and I'm a Republican, I would love to call and say, "Our president is doing a great job
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The country is on the left. The country is not doing well. No one can disagree. And many of our leaders, don't put the country back from a big two. They are all over the world. In Europe, all of the country that we're laughing, they look at me they say, "Donald
<Howard Stern> <Positive> In other words, you're saying also, it's not so great to be wonderful. Sometimes you have to be a real dick, in order to run. Run the world's greatest power, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have to be competent. You have to be competent. You have to be capable. Know what he's saying is, they have a very low opinion of him behind closed doors, and yet they all say in public that he's wondering if you ought to marry him.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> All right. Well, let's get back to the bracket. One second, from the time you were young, you would tell one of the worst things that could ever happen is, when Russia and China if they ever got together. They were never together.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Excuse me. One month ago, they signed this unbelievable act, for we force them together our incompetence and our leadership. And our president force them together. Russia and China are now together. Never happened before.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, now. Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So that's a big one. By the way, you know, watch. That's a real bad thing.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I'm not getting anywhere in my bracket. No, we can't get on my way to second.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want to start right here, because I can. I only know, if one of those two guys, had to marry your daughter, which one would you marry him off to.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I wouldn't be in favor of either. She's really happily married, but you don't want him. So you get to choose a husband for one. It's between the two. No, I wouldn't choose either. I don't want to get a different bag now. Rosie O'Donnell with Seth Meyers. You have a problem with both of them. Rosie I don't think you made a.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let me tell you, a quick sir maybe, we can dispel something, so I'm the leading candidate. Because, I always do the best in the polls. You know, if I say I'm running.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They'd like me, you like, "Hey
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're not looking for likability. They want a guy. I don't want like they want somebody, who's getting tired of people that are nice people that way.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But the fact, and you're not afraid, to go to war with these people on Twitter. It isn't Howard?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I had a great time, but I didn't know exactly how to react. So the president of the United States is up, and he's telling little jokes about town, and I don't know. I was a little bit stern face, a little smile but you know, I had hit my wife on the, on that you know, about this stuff. I hit my wife in the knee, and I said you know this is amazing. The president's only talking about me. So now, the thing is I had a great time unbelievable time, and I went to the press. The press is going crazy, because I'm telling you, if you look at that speech, I remember the speech was about Trump joke. After joke about Trump, they got everybody in the room. Every candidate only wants to talk about Trump.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I leave the room, and the press is saying how I said, "It was great the president
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I don't think, you don't even remember. No.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like to put you know. I have a nice photographic memory, but I like to put things I don't like.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I don't blame you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't blame me, when somebody says something. A little bit that was over the line. And when he said that, I said, "He's off my list""."
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> So, who do you dislike more, Seth Myers or Rosie O'Donnell?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't respect. I don't dislike them. You know, Rosie when I gave the beauty pageant contestant, who was a winner who, who was beautiful. Yes whatever, I do great Derek on her, she had a slight problem, with alcohol drugs men. She got a lot of energy championing right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She's a clean queen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They wanted to fire her, and destroy her life. I mean, she was going to be destroyed, because it never happened before. And they came to my office, and there was a news conference in Trump Tower. And there were hundreds and hundreds of reporters, it became a huge story because of her beauty by the way. Sadly she were beautiful nobody, would have cared.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But she was so beautiful, and you remember the shock, where they kept showing the walking back and forth in that bikini. And you know, that was the only shot that kept joking, or the bikini the night before.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right. So, we go there, and the place is packed with reporters.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They bring her up to my office. She's crying devastated. And I say, "What happened"". And she said
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She's Gretchen and she's good. But we would have destroyed a lot. So Rosie O'Donnell, on The View, I guess started going crazy. What right does he have, to give anyone a second chance? Is he to give her. So I get a call from Entertainment Tonight. Rosie O'Donnell just lit it up with you and said, "Rosie O'Donnell
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Remember when she hit Tom Selleck, when he goes on the show to promote the show. You are friends with Rosie now or now. Not at all, not at all, there's no reason to be. Seth Meyers and Rosie look Rosie's a low life.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Everybody knows. Rosie as well.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I don't know, that she's a bad person. He may be a friend of you. But Rosie is a bad person. I really don't know him, but I just don't think he belongs there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> All right. So let's can we get to that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, we're trying to say. Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The other night, I was on television so hours on Sunday night, beat the Tony Award. It was the number one show on television. The only thing, it is non-sports. You know, I said to Rahm, and I said to. Robin, the reason that show is number one the chicks are very, very hot. I mean, incredible the Miss America, does not have the hot girls like you do.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> No?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the Miss America has girls with talent.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> The one is a concert pianist. You are most likely, not going to look like the girls from Michelle. It's tough. You know, you have these girls and they do have some pretty good talent, but then they get on you say.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, you made a decision that Miss USA, is going to be about beauty pageant.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Beauty pageant?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Miss USA is being held in Miss Universe the most beautiful women in the world that anyone has ever seen.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Is Miss Universe now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When I bought that, 13-14 years ago. It was a sick puppy right. Right. And I said, "Well
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yes, and you destroy the English. One was asking her questions. I mean, maybe you should concentrate more on business.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, because I focus, I focus on business. I have a, I have a nice family. My family's getting old enough, to get into the business, so far they've all been good. They've gone to the Wharton School of Finance etc. Etc., which is the best school.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How many more years does Molony have is your wife?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh unlimited, I think so. I think so. This is it for my right. It has been a very good you know. You know Melanie has been very good and beautiful. She's beautiful. She's silent, she's a good person, good mother art, great mother. She's got a great heart.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And when you're around, these Miss Universe ladies?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's amazing. But I can still appreciate, she get jealous, when you. When you're saying something before Howard, about the actresses and all. So I deal in this crazy level of beauty, that's you know, they like the most beautiful young woman from Venezuela.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's a lot of people right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. This most beautiful woman from Brazil and they they you know they have contests all over Brazil in any way the top one. OK. So I feel for this. Now you take these people and then you get let's say that one of the prettiest actresses or I mean it's not even a contest. OK. Not that that matters because beauty is in everything.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Let me ask you, about beauty for example. Who is more beautiful, Katy Perry or Rihanna?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I would say, Katy Perry. You would, I would say Katy Perry. I, you know, I would say, that if you were asking me, I think a lot of people would disagree with who is more beautiful, Beyonce or Kate Upton. By the way, Rihanna is another one.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You know what I would do. Why do people do that? Why did they agree to do something for charity?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you know, she was singing the next day. And there was no problem with her throat.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So Katy Perry wins that bracket. Beyonce or Kate Upton who is better looking?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I like Jay-Z. So you know, I'm not going, to get into the whole 'Beyonce' thing. Do I think she's beautiful, or not so I don't want to get into that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> All right. I don't want to insult people, and Kate Upton? I really don't know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've seen her once in person, and she didn't have a good night. The night I saw her, I'm sure she's beautiful. She looked rough the night.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She didn't have a good look great that night, but I know she's much more beautiful, because she said she too chubby, to be a supermodel.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think so. No, I don't think so.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> All right. Now who is more beautiful, Scarlett Johansson or Jennifer Lawrence?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, Jennifer Lawrence is the one who recently has been winning a lot of award. Yes, three time Academy Awards. You know, I know Scarlett Johansson. I've been on the Tonight Show with her a couple of times, where, where I'm suggesting that she is yes. You know, I think both fine, and Jennifer has a little skin problem. I would say a little rough with her skin. Do you understand?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I get a little here, and I don't quite get it. You know, a little joke that's all over the question.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Scarlett Johansson is more beautiful. Yeah, I guess I got mine. So don't tell me, between Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Lopez, who is more beautiful?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know Kim Kardashian, to hand it to her, because let's face it. I mean, give me a break. But she was on the Apprentice, she came on the Apprentice, a huge. And she was very nice, and said, "I want to you know
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Donald, Is her ass too big?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, absolutely. Of course, it's record setting, but it's attracted to that gigantic dancing in the old days, that say you got a bad body. Right. Right now Jennifer Lopez says the biggest two people, don't realize as she does, so who is to say, they've both been so nice to me, so I don't want to have sex, if you like one?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't like, you know, being negative to people that are so nice?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I understand that, but so now I love them both. But if you had to have sex, with one of them who do you go with? Yes, but you would never bang, you're the one that's on? That's the headline. Trump says, "He won't have an idea
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So I have, I have squealed, Donald Trump. Everybody tune in at. We'll done. So I have all the millions and millions of people. With Facebook and whatever it's like millions. And every day, I get at least one or two people. Please do Howard Show, you're the best guest ever. And how are you? Well, you are. And now we have Rob, in two of his all time top five. Yes, A. J. Benza. That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have two of his all time top guys, which I guess you play at the end, of every year is something I'm not. So with all of the people, that you've interviewed to have two of your five. That's a great honor.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Let me ask you something?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, why people like, you have and I've gotten many awards, a lot of it let me say something?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> The reason people like you, is you talk like a regular guy. You know, if I ask you who is better looking. You say, Jennifer Lawrence has a bit of a skin problem, I won't go with people like that kind of honesty, even if they don't agree with it. Here's the question, though if you weren't a married man, this is what everyone wants to know, because you have the ability to identify the crown jewels of the world, whether it's real estate or a restaurant.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have that ability, to have that ability. And so that's why you're successful, in my opinion that's the reason I'm six.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So literally, so if you weren't married, you're a single guy right now. You're looking over the landscape? Who is the woman, you'd most want to have as a girlfriend?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, you know honestly. I don't even think about it. I have a great wife now.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I don't even think. I know you because you. You can't help but think you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What you said before, is true. The best and most beautiful women, are not the women of famous. That's right. The women that are famous, are not even close to the best looking women.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I mean, you're talking about, as an example Kim Kardashian. Come on. Give me a break. OK. Let's talk about what you said.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very nice. Were you surprised the guy, a guy is famous, and can have all the women in the world this Kanye West.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Were you surprised, he married her or is going to marry him, or whatever?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, look whatever makes him happy. You know, I don't know you were shocked. And other guys, like a Trump fan he did a song, with my name in it. How about that song done by Mac Miller? Did you ever hear Mac Miller? No?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He's a white rapper. He did a song called, 'Donald Trump' and he's got 93 million hits. Can you believe it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look at that everyone, but Kanye West has always been nice to me. So you know, my attitude is, whatever makes him happy. And you know, the expression, that's why they have menus in restaurants. I mean, I go to a restaurant. I want steak. Somebody else likes peas.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Hey, I meant to ask you, because one of my brackets, we never even got to it. I was going to ask you, who do you hate more, Bill Maher or Jon Stewart, because I know you're a war with those guys too?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Ensuring your crazy show.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> My time is very hard.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I understand that, and appreciate when I go now. I'm going to like a massive meeting, of a lot of people, from all over the country, and you know talk to do a show, because it's hard to find the time. I like to do the shows.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But it's hard to find, Jon Stewart.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I couldn't do a show, because I couldn't do a show. He starts hitting me, and I understand that you know. What if I were a host, and if I called Trump 10 times, to do the show. And he's called me more, than that and I see him, at a restaurant he was perfectly nice, and very nice. He said, "Are you going to do my show?""And I said
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> It's just natural, and so you expect that. But Jon Stewart, you don't like him, because when you were talking about Obama, you know whether or not he was born in this country? Stewart took a shot at you. So you went with him.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He takes shots at me all the time. I don't like that. I mean, you know they part of being in the public eye. My hair, my hair, I don't know what's the big story. It is my hair.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You do understand, and I understand, that it you touch that thing. If you miss your hair?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, no.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They say, "Oh
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, let's. I can't even send people the story. You always have so much to say. I love it, when you're on the show. Well, you know, I love being on the show actually a lot of energy is energy. There really is energy, between you and I.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's what people say. They say, "Please
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And who is going to be, who is going to be the Republican nominee for president? Could it be Chris Christie? I like this guy.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> It's a very, very tough, right now for Chris. He's a friend of mine. It's a very, very tough, he's got to get rid of that problem, it's all hanging everybody.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, he got rid of that, how can he get hurt? It's going to take a long time. Take a long time. But you would.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Would you like to see him? I like him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, look he's a friend of mine. I had dinner with him a week ago, and I saw him two weeks ago. But it's a very, very tough situation. And the other side, and his opponents are using that, to a fare thee well. It's rough. Look. Beating Hillary is not going to be easy. They have to find the perfect candidate, or they're not going to win. I'll tell you, where the Republicans are going to do very well those in November. They're going to crush November. The Republicans are going to take over the Senate, and they're going to get more house because people are fed up with Obama, they hate Obama. They cannot stand the job he's doing, and he's just getting worse and worse.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But he got re-elected? What is going on there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's amazing and honestly, does nothing happen to Mitt Romney? I mean, that was an election that couldn't be lost, and it happened to Romney at the end that was disastrous. What was happening with these two term presidents? We have you know George Bush, was roundly hated in his second term and so was Obama? Well, why don't we have been long, and we don't like them.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> That's a long time. They're under massive pressure. And honestly, they're not very competent, to start off with George Bush, is not a very competent person.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And Obama is not a very competent, you know, a lot of confidence people don't want to go into public service.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People don't want to go. Right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You say, you don't, they don't want to be in the public service, because they get this ship.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, it is true the guy, has a happy marriage. He had one affair, 29 years ago. But he's running a major company setting records, he's the greatest guy. Tough smart but 29 years ago. They say, is it true that during your marriage, you were with so, and so right now the guy's blown out his wife? They don't want to go through.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, no, it's you can fully understand. Absolutely. Very, very tough thing, so we get incompetent people, to leave the guy you're trying to buy the Buffalo Bills.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm going to look at it Howard. I'm going to look at it. I have a lot of friends up in Buffalo, that love to do, and I'll take a look at it. But I also have, to make deals if I don't get something for a fair price. And it could be even higher, than a fair price. But it can't be a crazy price.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So you think this, Donald? Are you friends with Donald Sterling?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know him well.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I thought, you said, you know him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, he's been to my office once or twice. He called you know sort of funny. He would call me, I don't know him, but he called me. I'd love to meet you and he comes to my office, and he was perfectly you start screaming the N-word. He really did. He just come up to the office out of respect, and I talked to him for 20 minutes, and that was probably twice over two billion dollars, he's being offered. And I think he can run it down, turning it down there's a saying that if he were let's say, in the moat to sell, and he said without all this happening, and he said I'm going to sell my team. He would have gotten a hundred million dollars.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, I like to point it out. The controversy or the controversy, has made him at least a billion two.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow. And so when you look at this guy, you should just take the money and run?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's simply, he should. He's been, you know, embarrassed himself. And it's a very tough situation.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> One thing I will say, what is with our country, that now everybody is taping everybody. This guy said something in private. I'm not saying, what he said was right but what he said in private.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Next thing you know, he's being pushed out or the girlfriend calls him. And gets some talking and that guy goes and sells, at the 25000 bucks. You know this guy, he has no friends no phone age. Now, they make these cell phones, where you press a button and you're on tape. Every time it's really a very very serious problem. And you know in our country, we're so politically correct. So the people, that are knocking the hell out of Sterling. And I'm no sterling fan, but you know they act like they've never said anything that, holier than thou or some of the statements.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But what do you say is, that is that you know the NBA owners are hypocrites.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the Buffalo Bills like an undervalued property right now. Like you could take that property, if you could get a hold of it and you could probably really jack up the attendance, and all that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, if I got it, I'd make it successful. I just don't know. You know, there'll be many bidders. What's the right price to happen. I don't know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's value, valued over 800 million dollars, and outbid and I don't need talker's or anything, which is always nice. When you don't have to put together groups of people, because it gets to be you know complicated, and not so nice. But, but so I'll bid, I think I'll bid. But I have no idea, whether or not I'll get it. And it's close. Maybe somebody wants to pay, what I call 'stupid money'. I'm not interested.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So close. So you never get emotional, in other words you don't say. I kind of have a sports team, I got to have a sports team. I don't get that much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I sometimes get a little bit of mush. I really want to Turnberry. I mean, Thurbert to me was very important Scott.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Have you ever made a bad deal lately? Have you ever made a bad business deal, where you said, "I bought something and then two minutes later you go should I pay too much""?"
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd make bad deals, and you learn from them. And then you sort of recoup, and you know I've made some bad deals. I turned into good deals. I've made a few deals, that were bad deals because of the market questioning, and make a deal is fine. And then the market crashes, and now you have to live by your wits see you go back and negotiate with the banks and you negotiate with everybody and you turn it into a good deal. But I've made bad deals that have turned into great deals.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Actually, you might end up betting against Bon Jovi for the bells. I heard he wants a buyout.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He's a nice guy, by the way, and you know that before.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So we'll see what happens.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I mean, who knows. All right, listen, I'll let you go. I know you haven't even heard the bracket. I can get you through the brackets. That's why I wanted to talk a lot, but I'll tell you it happens to me all right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll tell you, when I was over here years ago. He was holding up pictures of supermodels, that I happened to know, how great was she. You remember the good news.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah. Well, you banked a bunch of them.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's when a supermodel, was a supermodel. You don't have that so much today.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who is a supermodel today? You don't have too many of us, you really don't do.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know the old days. You are a supermodel or a sharp face. Not good enough.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> She's the wife of a great friend of mine. Tom Brady, who is a fantastic guy. And she certainly is. But you don't have too much of that today, you know, the old days you have.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I mean, they were they were a lot of you know, you almost completed the hot chick bracket, because you know, when you go down to it. Katy Perry versus Scarlett Johansson, we were almost in the finals on that one. Yeah, well, you know, I love them both by default. Look it's you know, he's a more mature adult, but they're not going to get to that. There was a time when he would just say, 'Fuck them all" and that's it."
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Fortunately, I've become a little bit more political.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You know, I'll tell you one thing, I think you have to do. I think that you are for gay marriage. But I think, if you because you are a Republican, and you toy with the idea of getting the nomination. You can't publicly come out, and say that you're for gay marriage. But I think you are.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I believe that you are.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, we won't get into that very hot subject. But you do know, how I feel? We won't get into that hot subject.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, you really don't care.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Am I right, you don't give up?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You know. Let everybody be in love. Who cares.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I mean, am I right, or am I wrong? People feel very differently about the subject, but we'll talk about that, when you head out on it. Tell me to try to talk about that now. I know what that means, he agrees to talk about it some time when are we going to talk about it. Any time you want.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Listen, Donald Trump. He's you just want a place in Scotland, we could all go to Barry Turnberry. But you know.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How do you, do you any good?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I've actually won many club championships. And your father in law, has to use it as a golfer, as he is my club in Palm Beach and I brought my father to club championships if you can believe that you know how I've been over the years I've been a good golfer and I haven't lost it. It's funny. You know at a certain age you lose it. So far, I haven't lost it. In fact, I think I'm pretty much as good today, as ever was, but when I lose, it it's going to be a very, very sad day.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I'm going to have to play you in golf. You know, I took four hours for four holes. I played the other day, and they said this is the longest anyone has ever been on the course, for four holes and that was a world record. So I'm holding records too.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow. I love it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, when you're in Palm Beach, you play my course. And you love that, you take your father-in-law, you have a good time.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'll walk him around there. Well, thank you so much for calling in.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I love being here. It is a great energy and I love being on the show, and love having your, on this man. Thank you. Bye bye. Here he is. You heard everything.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Any one of these days. Well, I will. Our great Donald Trump. There you guys.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Now, you know. Now, Donald Trump has said it all. Oh my goodness.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Let me see, if I can get there. Wow.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> So he did say, Kim Kardashian's ass, is too big and so jealous. .
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. So it is.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Today, his discussion of Jennifer Lawrence, just to catch up.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Ah, yes. The skin problem is that he doesn't understand, that I don't understand. None of us understand that. I didn't know she had a skin problem. And you haven't looked. No, I mean, I never noticed. I don't know how to get those glasses. I saw her on I think, the Seth Myers show or Jimmy Fallon or Jimmy Kimmel, one of the shows and maybe she had good coverage, that look good to me. I don't know, but she knows this stuff. You can see it. I don't think it's a secret, whether it's a property or a woman or whatever. He sort of looks on the bottom, change when he sees me. I have my head in shame, because he must be looking me over.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Jesus Christ. Thank goodness, you're not a woman. Because, I don't think he noticed.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well, I hated that monologue. I took my in-laws and my wife, and Donald turned his whole TV set to the table. And he turns his chair to look at me see what's doing. I said, "I am probably getting evaluated right now""."
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And it was, you know and in many ways, this time evaluating men, when he looks on what I'm up to.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow, what a, what an explosive interview, I think.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, I think if Donald won't run for president,  I'm going to do it..
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You'd be terrific. You're presidential already. And you know how to walk off a plane. I've seen you.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> There would be no bouncing down.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I would back you. I would back you.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> And no more of this they're wonderful on TV and hating them in person.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right, good for you.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Behind closed doors. More respect and let's rebuild this country.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That's my platform.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You sound like Donald Trump now. Alright, hy don't I take a break, and we'll come back right after these words.
