<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Joining us now is the president of the United States, Donald Trump. Mr. President, congratulations. And on top of that, I think one of the more underreported stories is that we now have a trade deficit that dropped by more than $50 billion.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you very much, Sean. And you're right, that to me is so important. Your phase two of the question, $52 billion drop in trade deficit, that hasn't happened in decades. And it's really something very special, and a lot of that is because of the policies that we're putting in place. And it's going to get better, Sean.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's totally sustainable. I look so forward to next quarter. I look forward to watching what happens over the years. It is something very special that's taking place.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> How is it that trade is so interconnected to all this and a lot of people thought you're going to start a trade war with Europe. Well, that was put to rest pretty much this week. And you said you found a new favorite word, which is reciprocity.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, reciprocal is very important to me because we have countries out there, Sean, and most of your folks know exactly what I'm talking about because they'll watch and they'll see we have countries that charge us a 100% tariff or tax and we charge them nothing for the same product coming into our country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have countries judging us far more than that, close to 300% in certain cases. And yet when I say well we're going to tax them or we're going to be reciprocal and charge them the same 300%, everyone goes crazy and they say, oh, you can't do that, it's not free trade, which is sort of laughable when you think about it. In other words, they can do it but we can't. So those days are over.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think that's had a huge impact even though it's very early. I've only been doing this a little more than a year and a half with some of these, and the policies, really, it takes a while to get them enacted but it's having a tremendous impact. And if we can straighten out trade, which I'll do absolutely and it's already happening, you see what happened with Europe yesterday.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But as we straighten out trade, we can pick up a lot of points on GDP.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> To be clear, though, you don't want a trade war. You want free trade, but you want fair trade?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. I want fair trade. I don't want a trade that people think is fair and free, but we're being charged 50%. As an example, China, and I have great respect for President Xi. I think he's a friend of mine. He may not like me so much anymore, but we'll be friends again. But China charges us 25% when we send a car to China to be sold.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When they send a car to us we charge them essentially nothing. They say 2.5%, but it's not even collected. So they get 25%. We get like nothing, and it doesn't make sense. It's not fair. You can't compete. That's like a baseball game, I give an analogy. That's like you having a big game with a very good team and they score 15 runs in the first inning.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So the score is 15 to nothing. Now you're going into the second inning. It's not looking good. That's what happens when they charge 25% and we're charging 2.5% and not collecting. Essentially that's what's happening and we can
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> One of my criticisms often, a theme on both radio and TV, is the fact that the media is so corrupt and so one-sided and it's like every day they have a breathless thing, negative thing to say about the president. We're 101 days away from the midterm elections. I'm arguing in my view that it's the most important midterms in our life.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> But if we go back to 2016, the Gateway Pundit actually picked up some really interesting headlines that if you were to become president, you would lead the economy off the cliff. I'll read you a few of them. CNN Money said Trump promises 4% growth, economists say no way. The L.A. Times said if Trump thinks he can get more than 3% economic growth, he's dreaming.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> The Wall Street Journal said Trump's 3% growth target looks out of reach. The Hill wrote Trump's growth projections leave economists in disbelief. And you got your Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, Trump's election means we are probably looking at a global recession with no end in sight. And I can keep going.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And Barack Obama, we'll never reach 3% growth in a year and said what magic wand does Trump have to revive the economy? Usually the answer is he doesn't have an answer. I guess their predictions were wrong, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we've had the answers during the debates and I think we were very strong in the debates on what we want to do. And if you look at the predictions, they've all been wrong. I mean, we are far ahead of what anybody thought except me. We can go a lot higher than this. If you look at regulations, nobody talked about regulations.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Had my opponent won, the Democrats, you would have had an economy that instead of being up close to 40% in the stock market, they would have been down 40% or 50% because the regulations were choking this country. And I'm all for regulations for clean air, clean water. We want to have great environmental control, but they had 10 regulations when you could have used one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And as you know, I've been cutting 22 regulations for every new one -- a new regulation that's put in which are very few because we were totally over-regulated. You couldn't do anything. Highways were taking 20 years to get approved. You have a highway, that's really important. It would take from 17 to 20 years to get your approvals.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By that time the highway system is different, then the roads are being built a different way and you couldn't make changes. Now, this is -- we're doing great. We could do a lot better. The fact is that, if I can cut the trade deficit from $817 billion, think of that, we have a trade deficit with other countries that's trading with other countries $817 billion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I cut it in half, right there, we'll pick up three to four points. So you could add that to the four or five and so it would be an eight or a nine. Now I don't want to say that too much and I didn't want to say it too much during the campaign because I would have been criticized. People wouldn't have believed it. But now they're starting to believe.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you're right, you look at a guy like Krugman. He doesn't know a thing. I mean, the predictions were so -- they were so bad. A big factor though, Sean, was regulation. And obviously, a big factor was the taxes. But a lot of this -- really the taxes are going to help in the future. I look so forward to seeing the next quarter because this is so sustainable.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is going to go for a long time.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> We have numbers that are in now and all during the 2016 campaign, I gave statistics out. I did it every day because I wanted people to know what eight years of the Obama economy were. And you know lowest labor participation rate, 13 million more Americans on food stamps, eight million more on poverty. He took on more debt than every other president before him combined.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You now have accumulated your track record. We have nearly four million new jobs in the country. We have the largest labor participation rate in history. We have literally nearly four million new jobs created in manufacturing jobs that people thought weren't going to come back. Well, that's nearly 700,000. Then we've got two or three million fewer people on food stamps, record-low unemployment in 14 states for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, and a 65-year low for women in the workplace.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> That's pretty impressive. And now 4.1% GDP. I think that we can make a comparison that some economic policies work and others do not.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you're really right. And I've heard those statistics from you for even a long time. And now when you look back, it's hard to believe that we've put up with it and much of it was caused by bad trade deals. People don't want to say much if it was caused by regulation and overtax. I mean, you're overtaxed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Think of it in the election coming up in now just a little more than three months. The Democrats want to raise everybody's taxes. They want to give back these massive tax cuts that we got and reforms that are so good for everybody but the tax cuts. So they want to raise people's taxes. They want to open up borders.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They want to get rid of ice. I mean, the things they're doing are so destructive. We won't have a country. So...
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> They want their crumbs back. They want their crumbs back. They want open borders. They want Obamacare. They want to impeach you and they want to stop all investigations into deep corruption.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. No, there's a lot of corruption out there but it happens to be on the other side of the ledger, the Democrats. And if you talk about collusion, the collusion is there. There's no question about it, but it's with the Democrats and Russia because all you have to do is look at what they did and how they participated with Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a disgraceful situation. But for the economy, we can go a lot higher and people don't talk. We have $21 trillion in debt. When this really kicks in, we'll start paying off that debt like it's water. We will start paying that debt down. We're $21 trillion, a number that is unthinkable. But that will go down very quickly because the numbers with growth and the kind of growth that we've produced to 4.1% can actually go higher.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I look forward to seeing next quarter because I think that the 4.1% is just a stepping stone. But will we make good trade deals? Is it going to have a huge impact on GDP growth? And the numbers will be so big that you'll actually start paying down debt in very large chunks. It'll go quickly.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Right. The president has graciously agreed to spend more time with us. We'll take a quick break. We'll come back. We'll continue on this Friday. 800-941-SEAN is our toll-free telephone number if you want to be a part of the program. [Commercial Break]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> As we continue with the president of the United States. I was with you in Singapore. I was also in London and in Helsinki. Now one of the promises that Kim Jong-un made to you, and we still have not had rockets fired over Japan, our hostages were released. We're talking about denuclearization. One of his launch facilities has been dismantled.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> But now the remains of Americans have come home -- are coming home. And we saw that earlier today. But also -- NATO is also paying more money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, a lot of things have changed since I became president. And when I was with President Obama in the Oval Office, which I guess is something that presidents do, they have a meeting and I had a very interesting meeting. But he did say the biggest single problem that our country has is the problem with North Korea and he was very perplexed and I can understand that and it could have led to war.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I did ask, have you spoken to him, and the answer was no. And I said to myself it would be a good thing to speak. We did meet. We had a great meeting, a very, very great meeting. I mean, I think you could have lost 50 million people more. If you think that Seoul is 28 million people, it's right on the border, people say hundreds of thousands.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're talking about 50 million, 60 million, 100 million people could have been wiped out and lost. We had a great meeting, historic. And among other things, where the remains are starting to come back, missiles have been stopped. We don't have rockets and missiles shot over Japan. The hostages, we got them back.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Even before I left, we got them back. Nuclear testing no more, rocket testing no more. So many things have changed. And one thing all of their propaganda material and the propaganda which has been up for years, propaganda, the signs, the music, it's all stopped. It's all been taken down. So many positive things have happened.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we have time we had -- there's no rush. I told my people don't rush and we have sanctions on. We haven't taken any sanctions off. And we hope -- I look forward to the time when we do take the sanctions off because when that happens, a lot of good things will have happened on the other side. But -- so we're very proud of that and are very proud of the fact that with NATO, they were taking in less and less money every year.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But last year, which was my first meeting, they took in $44 billion more because they said you have to pay your bills. We were paying for everybody else. And this year, we raised by at least hundreds of billions of dollars. So we took in $44 billion last year, and all of that goes toward protecting -- most of it toward protecting against Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then they say I'm friendly with Russia. Russia is not happy about what I did with NATO. Russia is not happy about all of this tremendous amount of money that now is flowing into these countries who weren't paying their bills. I mean, they were delinquent in many cases and certainly bringing up the pipeline where Germany is paying as you know, Sean, in Germany, nobody brought this up. Nobody even knew about it. But Germany is paying to Russia billions and billions of dollars for energy coming out of that pipeline.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I said, wait a minute, we're protecting against Russia...
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> It's nuts.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We are paying billions of dollars toward Russia. Nobody brought that up but me and I'm very unhappy about it and I told them that.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I hope we can eventually because we have more energy resources than anybody in the world. Last question, sir, because I know you got to run.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's happening, Sean. That was part of the deal I made with the European Union. They're opening up...
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> That's millions of jobs for Americans in the energy sector. That would be great.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Let me ask the last question because I want to go back to the election in 101 days and I see the agenda just as you described and I've been saying it as well that they want to, a, impeach you. We know they just tell everybody to stop saying it. They want the tax cuts reversed. They want their crumbs back.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> They want to eliminate ice, open borders, keep Obamacare, stop investigations. I don't think... I don't hear anything that is going to help the American people. But in midterm elections, historically, the party in the White House in power usually loses seats.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And I know to prevent that from happening, you kind of have to buck the trend. There's usually about a 15-seat loss. What do you say to people and this audience that maybe, well, you're not on the ballot that support you but don't particularly like their RINO congressman or senator?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, my endorsements seem to have a lot of weight. If you look at Georgia, the governor of Georgia, he was down five to 10 points and he won 70-30. So he won by 40 points. Many others, I mean, you could look at... to your congressman, you can look at all of these different endorsements. And what I told my people just now, I said to General Kelly, I said to a whole group of people, we have to get a group together.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Give me the top 25 congress people that are -- could go either way. And I want to go out and campaign for those people, likewise, with the Senate. Because we're going to fix everything once we have the votes. We really don't have, when they say majority. It's 51-49, but it's not really, because you lose a couple and people are sick, people are ill, people can't come to vote.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So in the Senate, we really don't have a majority at all and it's a very small -- the House, it's a very small majority. So I think we can actually -- because of a couple of things that are happening, very special things are happening for our country. You mentioned North Korea, you mentioned our military is being rebuilt, so many others.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But look at the economy. The economy may be the strongest it's ever been in the history of our country. Now the famous quote, it's the economy, stupid. Well, if it's the economy, then we should do very well. I just don't know any reason why we shouldn't do well. We're doing well with our military, we knocked out ISIS, we've done so well in so many.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And ISIS would have never been knocked out. Now you've got to keep on it. I don't want to be saying we knocked it out. You got to keep on it, but we have decimated ISIS. So many things have taken place, but the economy is the strongest ever and I think that's going to have a very positive impact. And I am going to work very hard.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll go six or seven days a week when we're 60 days out, and I will be campaigning for all of these great people that do have a difficult race. And we think we're going to bring them over the line. So I really believe that because we're doing so well as a country and so well with the economy, I think we're going to be surprising a lot of people.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right. Mr. President, I know you're busy. Thank you for taking the time. Congratulations, 4.1% GDP growth. Thank you, sir, for being with us. And hopefully we'll talk soon. Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Sean. Thank you.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Well, Donald Trump, of course, remains the strong frontrunner up here to win the Republican primary in New Hampshire tomorrow. That is UMass tracking poll. Shows the man leading the field with 34 percent. Look at that, a hefty lead. Everyone else is way back, 21 points behind, all bunched together and fighting with each other. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, John Kasich, Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, all in one circular firing squad.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> That must have been one nice thing at the debate the other night. You walk in, and everybody was fighting with each other and ignoring you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I didn't know what happened exactly. I was just sort of standing there watching everybody go wild. I was very happy about it. That's okay with me.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> What did you make of Marco Rubio doing an imitation from The Blade Runner"? He just started repeating himself
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was standing right next to him. I don't know what it was. But I was standing right there. And he's a nice guy. He's been very nice to me, I must say. But I heard it once. I heard it a second time. I have, like, a good memory. Then I heard it a third time. I said, I think it was the exact same thing. It wasn't even like, I know you've replayed it. And then after the fifth time, I said, I wonder if he's going to do it once more. But it was a little bit...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Hang in there. Let me ask you about - talk to the voter for a minute here. Don't use up too much time. It's snowing up here now. It snows in New Hampshire. People know how to put - get - cars. They got - will put chains on now they don't have good tires. Why should they trudge through the snow for Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, my whole concept and my whole theme, frankly, behind it is make America great again, Chris. We're going to strengthen up our borders. We're not going to let the drugs pour in. New Hampshire has a unbelievable heroin problem and drug problem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to build up our military. Nobody's going to mess with us. We're going to take care of our vets. We're going to get rid of Obamacare like you and I discussed it. I mean, whether you like it or don't like it, it's tremendous what's happening in terms of the increases. Twenty-five, 35, 45 percent increases in Obamacare. It's unheard of.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Let's talk about how you get it done. Now, we know about the wall. We know about your - I think it appeals to a lot of people. But here's what happens. You get inaugurated. You take the oath. You have the ball, the party. That night you come back to the Oval Office. You get a call from the speaker of the House. Say it's Paul Ryan. You know
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm going to get it done, Chris. I'm...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> No, he'll just say to you, I'm not bringing it up.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He may say that, but he may also go along with me a hundred percent. And I think that my history is that I cajole, and I get people to do what they have to do.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> What are your tools?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Washington - me. Washington is in gridlock right now. You understand...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> No, I know all about this. And I know how things don't get done. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's time. And when you see Congress, what is it, I think the last time I saw it, it was about nine percent.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> That's where it belongs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, about nine. No, no, we're going to make things better. We're going to bring it up. We're going to get things done.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> OK, let's talk about your experience. When you put up a building in New York, and there it is, that big building on Fifth Avenue, Trump Tower...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Which they all said you could never get zoning.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Well, I know. Well, here's what - I'm just - I'm not into business. But I've heard about New York. I've got to pay a special percent, maybe five to the bad guys. You've got to deal with council man privilege, where some local councilman will stiff you just so he can get something out of you. Or you've got a labor union that's being very difficult.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> What do you do? How do you scare them into doing what you want them to do? Or pay them off, or what do you do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Where do you hear all these bad things?
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> How do you get it done? How do you get it done?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm the king of zoning.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> But how do you do it? What's your technique? Fear? Bullying?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I deal with people. I hire experts. No. I hire people that are good...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Do you pay these guys?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They're consultants and I...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> No, do you pay the...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't, no, I don't. The problem is if you do -- first of all, it's dishonest and I'm an honest guy. But if you do that, you know what happens? Everybody else comes along, and it never ends. If you don't do it, it's like the old story. You take care of building inspectors, all the building inspectors hear about it, they all come to you. I don't do it.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> What else have wise guys committed say you're not building?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've known tough cookies over the years.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> I mean wise guys.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know what you mean by wise guys. I've known very tough people. I've known people that make the politicians that you and I deal with every day look like little babies. They'd walk across the street out of fear if they ever saw some of these guys. I deal with people that are very tough people, and I get it done. I deal with people that are heads of countries because I'm all over the world. My company is all over the world. I get along great with people.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> So, even guys like Mean Esposito in the old days of King - [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He was great.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> He was great?! [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll tell you something. I knew him very well. Mean Esposito...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> He was the boss of Brooklyn.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Mean Esposito - he was the boss. Mean Esposito, in his own way, was a very, very honest guy. When he gave you his word on something, it was done. I deal with politicians. They give you their word, it's like -- it means nothing. Mean Esposito in a certain way was a very honorable guy.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Let's talk about the race. You're a nationalist. Maybe don't know, but you saying things like either we have a company, country or we don't, I get it. It can be on immigration, jobs going overseas, best jobs to China, worst jobs to [Inaudible]. I get it all. Trade deals you don't like. You don't like the stupid wars we've had to fight.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> So, you're the nationalist. You're up against a socialist. Who wins? Self-describe...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I think I'd beat him easy for one reason. When I start talking about tax rates, I would hit him so hard on taxes. You know, somebody's got to pay for it...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Who would pay for the tuition for everybody? Who would pay - [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're going to pay, I'm going to pay, we'll all pay.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Who's going to pay for Medicare for life?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> 95 percent taxes. That's what's going to pay, Chris. It's impossible. I would love to run against him. The only one I'd rather run against because a Fox poll just came out where I'm beating Hillary by five points. I would love to run against Hillary just because it's - you know, it's more of a name. But there's no way you lose to Bernie. When you start going into the taxes. I'm actually surprised that Hillary isn't playing the tax card. And I'm a little surprised that Hillary continues to run - [Crosstalk]
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> She's not playing any cards. Let me ask you about the old names. Why are the Clintons, both of them, having troubles this time? Bill on the campaign trail. Well, you basically pushed him out with that thing about sexist charges...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have not said a bad thing about me since I said...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> I know. You've pushed him off the trail.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Were you impressed? Were you impressed?
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> I'm impressed with stuff that works in this case.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Anyway, let's go about the - the Clintons and the Bushes are nothing politically, right? They're having such a hard time out on the stump. You don't like Jeb. You've been awfully tough on him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I'll tell you why?
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Why don't you like a nice old guy?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you why. He spent $20 million on ads against me, which he shouldn't have done. He should have focused on people that are ahead of him. But he spent $20 million, they're false ads and he says false things about me. I mean, he says so much. He talks about the Second Amendment. Nobody's stronger than Second Amendment than me. He would make it believe like I'm not. He brings up taxes. I have the biggest tax decrease of anybody else and he makes it sound like I'm going to eat it.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> What about the stadium?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's really - the stadium is another one. Eminent domain, thank you very domain. Eminent domain. He talks about me with eminent domain. It just came out this morning that his father and the group, the Bushes - not him because he's not smart enough to do it, but his group used eminent domain to get the stadium bought - the land around the stadium bought in Texas. So he's very embarrassed by it. Let me tell you. He's not going anywhere. He just announced he spent $120 million on the campaign. He just announced about 20 minutes ago that he's against now against super PACs. Well, he spent most of the money in his super PAC, and now he announces that he is against super PACs. It's really pretty...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Let's talk about something that bugged me. You talked about torture. You didn't use the word; you talked about going further than waterboarding. You're going to be commander in chief if you win. You're responsible to every enlisted person in the Army and the - You're responsible to all those guys. If they get captured, there's always been the concern in our government - and the reason we don't torture prisoners, people in uniform, is because our guys are going to be captured. And we don't want them tortured.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Now aren't you worried, as commander-in-chief, that you will legitimize torture?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Came up in the debate. They asked Ted Cruz about waterboarding. And he was very tentative with that answer. I don't think he had a good night. He was very tentative with that answer. You saw that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Then they looked to me. What do you think? I said, I'm all in favor. And I said the reason I'm in favor -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I prefaced it by saying the reason I'm in favor is because they're chopping off heads. Not since medieval times - you know, you and I used to study...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> By the way, it's not since The French Revolution they did a lot of guillotine...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right, well, I used medieval times.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> They did, they did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But not since I said...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> They've been drawing and quartering in England in the 19th century.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're right, but you know, medieval times made more of an impression, I guess. But I said, not since medieval times have we talked about chopping off heads. I know the parents of James Foley. I see what...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Let's talk about that guy. Because I carry his picture in my wallet. And I think we share that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great guy. Right.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> To me, he was a man of noble courage...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great parents, by the way.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Noble courage right to the end. He saw what was happening to him, he knew he was going to reach his end on this earth.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I agree.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> He stood his ground and never buckled. What a great man.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A hundred percent.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Let me ask you -- suppose you got a call and you're a [Inaudible] office at 3:00 in the morning and someone tells you, they just picked up one of our uniformed guys. They were embedded in an Iraqi unit. They get picked up by damned ISIS. They say they're going to chop his head up - cut his head off in five days? What would you do? Five days max.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, the one thing I won't do because I think this is what you're getting at...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> No, I'm not getting at anything. I don't know the answer.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they're tough answers. They're always tough answers.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Well, what's your answer?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The one thing you can't do is start taking care of people by giving money to get people out. Because once you do that, then everybody in this room is going to be gone. So, you can't do that. I mean, it's horrible to tell parents that. You know, like the parents of James Foley, who I love. I know them and I love them. They're great people.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Good for you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And he was great.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> What would you do? If it was you in fold?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would never negotiate...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> What WOULD you do?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would - what I'd really like to do...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Would you try to stop it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, I would try and stop it.. I would do everything I could to redefine the area...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Would you bomb?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would bomb, I would do whatever I could to stop it. The one thing I would never do is pay ransom. Because once you pay ransom, it's over.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> You've paid tribute - some of the Republican candidates have paid tribute saying that the minute he came in in 1981, they sent the hostages back. What was he threatening with implicitly? There must be something...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He said they will not be there when I'm president.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Well, they also - [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> '-- and he meant it.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> They did that to punish Carter anyway.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Where's this power? How do you use...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he was a little bit scared. I watched that. And Carter was a nice man, but you know, they had no fear of Carter for whatever reason. OK.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> How do you - no, this is very important. I learned when I worked with Tip O'Neill in the old days that the reason that the Russians were impressed with Reagan is he broke the Paco strike. It was a demonstration. [Inaudible] came back and said those guys are - [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That was not an easy strike.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> How do you demonstrate strength so they don't take our hostages? How do you get the message across like Reagan did, don't mess with me? Because strength is a lot about the appearance of strength. How do you create that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think the strike in his case was good. But I think it's almost an heir that some people have, not a lot of people...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Do you have it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't ever want to be saying that I have it. I mean, you obviously think I do because I...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> No, I'm asking. I'm wondering how you can [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I always hate when somebody says, I have this or I have that. I don't talk about myself. People can say whatever they want.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you one thing. If we didn't get our hostages back -- we paid $150 billion for hostages. But if we didn't get them back or the 10 sailors the way they made us look, that was a pretty humbling thing, what they did with the 10 sailors. But if we didn't get our hostages back, they would have had hell to pay if I were president, that I can tell you.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Have you been impressed by any opponent in this campaign? Personally impressed? Wow that guy...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I wouldn't want to tell you yes. Yeah, a couple of them are impressive. Some of them are unimpressive. I mean, I think Jeb Bush to me is very unimpressive. Very unimpressive.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> I noticed. How about Kasich?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, he's got something that's okay. I mean, he's got something. He's done a good job. Now, he got help with fracking, in all fairness. When you frack...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Do you know how many Democrats I bump into that like Kasich?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like him!
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> No, as a candidate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I like him. I like him, too. He was very nice; then he went hostile on me. Kasich went very hostile in the second debate.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> I know, but you're the frontrunner. He's king of the hill. You know how that works. Do you think he would be a good running mate for you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think he would. I'm not thinking running mates now...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Ohio. Ohio.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have very good poll numbers in Ohio.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> You got to win Ohio.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have to win Ohio, you have to be at Florida.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> How do you get Florida?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, right now, I'm at 48 percent in Florida. I'm at 48, Bush is at like 6, and Rubio, I think, is at 11. And I'm at 48. And I'm saying, what do I need anybody for, right?
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> OK, tomorrow night if you win, you're the frontrunner. Are you going to let anybody take it away from you and say, well, he didn't beat the spread. [Crosstalk]
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> The bronze winner - I'm sorry, the silver winner tomorrow will be the real winner.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that happened a little bit in Iowa. I came in second. I was 2,400 votes ahead of the third place. And the third place person, who is Marco, was like a genius king. I never even did it before. This is the first time I ever ran for office.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I came in second -- probably came in first, to be honest with you -- because folks were taken away from Carson that if they weren't taken away, I would have come in first. So, let's say I came in first or second because I don't forget things like that. And all of a sudden the guy that came in third is like a hero, and the guy that came in second - and I kept saying how come he's a hero and...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> OK, got one big problem. Rubio proved the other day he repeats himself.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's not good.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> So he'll repeat himself in this regard. He will say, I won again. They guy's...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How big of an impact does it have long term. Short term it has an impact. Will that affect him long term?
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> OK, let's talk about - I think you and Bernie have two things in common. He's a socialist, self-described - I'm not knocking. That's what he wants to be. And you're a nationalist. I believe that about you. You both have a focus, and you both have joy in your campaign. There's fun when people leave your things. [Crosstalk]
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> You seem to have lost some joy since Iowa.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Lost or gained?
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Lost. You don't seem as happy as you were last week.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Really? I think I'm happier now. With those polls -- you just showed me those polls. That makes me very happy.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Oh, well, that's why I'm here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you, we have another thing in common with Bernie. There's only one difference. I can do something about trade. He knows the United States is getting ripped off by China, by Japan, by Mexico, by everybody. OK? And so do I.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The difference is I'm going to do something about it. We're going to make a fortune. Bernie can't do anything about it. He wouldn't know where to begin.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> How do you make China change its currency policies?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By telling them that if you don't change, you're going to have a hard time trading with us.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> And what do we do about our debt problem with China if we stop trading with them?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We work out a deal with them.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> See, they got - don't they have us by the shorts?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, we have them.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Because they have our paper!
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me. We have them. They need our money to come in. Chris, we have them, and nobody's...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Who's carrying our debt?!
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It doesn't make any difference.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> We're up to $20 trillion, and they're carrying us.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Chris, if we played numbers with them with trade, they would have a depression the likes of which you've never seen before.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have China. We're going to make a great deal with China. Don't forget, I have the biggest bank in the world from China in my building. I sell millions, tens of millions of dollars worth of condos. I own the Bank of America building in San Francisco because of China along with a group.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to tell you something: we have all the cards. And I deal with China, and I love -- I have nothing against China. What I have - no, no, what I'm upset about is that our leaders deal so badly.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> All right, late breaking news, last question. The counter on the former president of Mexico president says he won't pay for the wall. What's it mean to you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. He'll pay. Trust me, he'll pay. We have such a trade imbalance with Mexico, we have such a trade deficit, the wall is peanuts compared to anything else.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Would you get rid of NAFTA?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would get rid of it or amend it greatly. NAFTA has been a disaster, especially for New Hampshire and areas like this.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Donald Trump, thanks for coming over. Coming up [End of Video]
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> He is certainly no fan of President Bush, but Donald Trump is now weighing in on the Bush administration's handling of the economic crisis.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, I mean, these people inherited a mess. And they weren't necessarily to blame for it. And they are trying to fix it. [End Clip]
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> All right, my interview with Donald Trump, that is coming up next. Also, the final debate, as we have been saying, only two hours and, what, 47 minutes away. John McCain may be tempted to lash out at Barack Obama, but would he only hurt himself by going negative? And they are still sitting on the fence, 20 days to go. When will undecided voters finally make up their minds? The best political team on television is standing by. Stay with us. You're in The Situation Room.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> President Bush and his economic team have certainly come in for some heavy criticism for the country's economic crisis. So, how does one of the country's best known businessmen feel about the job that they are actually doing? Today, I had a chance to sit down over at Trump Towers with the real estate mogul Donald Trump . We had this discussion. Let's talk about the economy right now. And I want you to do, in your Donald Trump -style, some quick analysis, but give me some grades for these people, how they have done in dealing with the economic crisis that we are all going through right now. OK, grades. A is the best. F is failing -- President Bush?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I would certainly not give him an F. And I guess you can't give him an A, because, unfortunately, look at the mess we are in. But I think that he has been dealing with the crisis pretty well. And he has some very smart people -- and I am sure Paulson is going to be on your list -- in Paulson and Ben B., as the expression goes. They are pretty smart people. They are very smart people. So, I would give him a B.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Aren't you shocked to hear me say that?
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> Yes. I am pretty surprised. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're talking about dealing with the crisis. You are not talking about getting us into the crisis. You're talking about dealing with the crisis. So, I would give him a B. [Crosstalk]
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> How they have dealt with this financial crisis.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would give him a B.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> All right, Henry Paulson?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would give him an A.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would give him an A. And I know a lot of people are saying, oh, this and that. But the fact is, he came into a mess. He didn't create the mess. And he is helping us get out of the mess.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> So, if Obama were elected, you would advise him to keep Paulson on the job?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I wouldn't necessarily. He has got his own people. And he has got his -- some very, very smart people with him. But I think Paulson, I would give an A, because he really took something very strong. Now, you could say the U.K. came up with the first land, but Paulson is the one that got us there in the first place, in terms of the concept.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, Ben B., as you call him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that he has -- was a little bit late on the draw, but he has come around strongly. And I would give him a B-plus, a good strong B-plus. Look, I mean, these people inherited a mess. And they weren't necessarily to blame for it. And they are trying to fix it. I would say that Ben was a little bit late. And, based on the lateness, but I am not sure there's -- if he was earlier, I am not sure that we would be in any different -- so, I would give him a B-plus.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> John McCain?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, John is one of 100 senators. And you could put Obama in the same category. And they have to vote yea or nay and they sort of voted...
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> Yea.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... the same way.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I would certainly -- I probably wouldn't put them anywhere, because I don't think they had that much influence on what has happened.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> And Barack Obama same?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Same thing. I don't think that Barack Obama or John McCain had that much influence as to what happened with what is going on with the economy.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> Nancy Pelosi, the speaker?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, when she first got in and was named speaker, I met her. And I'm very impressed by her. I think she's a very impressive person. I like her a lot. But I was surprised that she didn't do more in terms of Bush and going after Bush. It was almost -- it just seemed like she was going to really look to impeach Bush and get him out of office, which, personally, I think would have been a wonderful thing.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> Impeaching him?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely, for the war, for the war.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> Because of the conduct of the war.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he lied. He got us into the war with lies. And, I mean, look at the trouble Bill Clinton got into with something that was totally unimportant. And they tried to impeach him, which was nonsense. And, yet, Bush got us into this horrible war with lies, by lying, by saying they had weapons of mass destruction, by saying all sorts of things that turned out not to be true. [Crosstalk]
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> Their argument is, they weren't lying, that that was the intelligence that he was presented, and it was not as if he was just lying about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't believe that.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> You believe that it was a deliberate lie?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't believe it. And I don't think you believe it either, Wolf. You are a very, very intelligent young man. I don't think you believe it either.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> By the way, thank you for calling me a young man.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Young.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> Yes. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Young is more important than intelligent is. The fact is that he lied. And he got us into a war that was a horrendous mistake. And, any way you take it, that war was a mistake.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> So, you think he should have been impeached because of it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, it was not Saddam Hussein that attacked the World Trade Center, OK? In fact, those people, when they sent their families back, most of them went back to Saudi Arabia. It was not Saddam Hussein that took down the World Trade Center. And, in fact, Saddam Hussein killed terrorists.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They had very few terrorists, because he didn't terrorists in Iraq, and he killed terrorists. So, we go and attack Saddam Hussein. Now, Iraq now is the number-one breeding ground for terrorists.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All the terrorists go to Iraq to learn the trade. You know, we all have trades, right? And they go to Iraq. But you didn't have that when Saddam Hussein was running Iraq with an iron fist. Now you do. Now, we took out Saddam Hussein. What have we created? A mess. And the day we leave Iraq, it is going to be -- forget it. [End Clip]
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> All right. We are going to have more of the interview with Donald Trump. He is discussing at length what is going on. Stay with us -- more from Donald Trump , my interview with the billionaire. That's coming up, continuing, right after the break. Also, John McCain's balancing act -- can he be calm and experienced, an angry fighter, and a maverick all at the same time? The best political team on television is standing by to weigh in. We will have a complete debate preview. There, you're looking at live pictures from Hofstra University, Hempstead, New York, out on Long Island. Two hours, 38 minutes from now, the debate, the final debate, of this campaign begins.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> So, how does one of America's most famous businessmen really feel about the government's committing $700 billion to bail out banks and other Wall Street firms? Here is the rest of my interview today with Donald Trump . Let's talk a little bit about the billions that are being pumped into the banks.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, let's talk a little bit about -- one other thing about Iraq. They have hundreds of millions of dollars was just recently found in the banks of New York.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> Eighty-seven billion surplus.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hundreds of billions of dollars.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> You think it is much more than the 87?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think it's much more.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it's building up every day.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> Because of the oil... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Are we not entitled to anything? They have so much money, they don't know what to do with it. Are we entitled to anything?
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> Because the United States is still spending about $10 billion a month in Iraq, and you want the Iraqis to start spending that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The United States has been stupidly managed for the last eight years.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> So, on this issue, you give Bush a...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> On that issue, a F-minus.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> On the issue of the war, an F-minus, and I don't think there is such a thing.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> Let's talk about, quickly, because we are almost out of time, the billions that are being spent to pump up and to reassure investors out there, the credit lines and everything else. Some say this is private nationalization of the banking system. Others go further and say this is socialism in the works. You are a capitalist. How concerned are you about this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it is probably is a little bit of a combination of both, but I think it was necessary. The banks were in a seizure. The banks were unable to move. They were unable to do anything. And at least now they have some liquidity. You save companies like Morgan Stanley. You save some banks, very good companies like Morgan Stanley. [Crosstalk]
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> That's because the Japanese came in, Mitsubishi, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they came in, but they also had some government help. And the Japanese got some government assurances or whatever.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> Can you believe that Lehman Brothers is out of business?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Lehman Brothers missed it by about a week-and-a- half.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Had Lehman Brothers been able to survive another week- and-a-half. But the fact is, you can't lose all of your institutions. And I know it for a fact. I have friends, they have buildings. They have wonderful buildings, fully occupied buildings. They have tiny mortgages. When the mortgages come due, they can't even renew them. It's ridiculous. The banks are essentially out of business. Now, the real question is, is that going to be enough? You don't want to make it anymore, but is it going to be enough? And will you start to see some money flowing? So far, the answer is no. So far, the banks still don't have the money to put out.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> Is it a good idea for these big financial institutions that are being saved in effect by U.S. taxpayers for the restrictions on the CEO compensation to go forward, the golden parachutes and all that kind of stuff, ended because U.S. taxpayers are now directly pumping up these companies?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it is a great idea that that has ended, yes. You can't have the golden parachutes and they're not allowed to have the golden parachutes. So, if you go into that pool, you can't have golden parachutes and some other things. And I think, politically, that is important. And I think it is important anyway. If you have to go into that pool, you don't get those big benefits. And I think that is a good thing.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> Bottom line, are you upbeat in the short term about what is going to happen in the U.S. economy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I'm not. I am upbeat for the long term. We have a great country. It is the greatest country in the world. And I'm very upbeat in the long term, but, short term, probably not.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> Donald Trump , thanks.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. [End Clip]
