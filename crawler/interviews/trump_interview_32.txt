<Alyse Eady> <Positive> A recent national poll just showed that 80 percent of African-American voters said that they would plan to vote for the African-Am -- or, for a candidate for President next year who's a Democrat. So, what would your message be to these voters here in Georgia?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think we've cut into it very, very big, and, as you know, the polls have been very good for us now, and if you look at Black Voices for Trump today, it's an overflow crowd. We have the lowest unemployment for African-Americans in the history of our country. We have the best poverty numbers that we've ever had -- that's poverty in a very positive sense, the best we've ever had, and so many other things, and I think that overall, while we're doing well overall, African-Americans are doing proportionately better, and they've done better than they've ever done, and people are seeing that, and I said that was going to happen, as you know very well, because you've been there -- I said that was going to happen during the campaign, and we've produced.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I think we're gonna have tremendous African-American support.
<Alyse Eady> <Negative> I want to take you back to 2017, President Trump. You tweeted in regard to -- to John Lewis, and you were talking about the 5th Congressional District, which is where we are right now. You mentioned that it was crime infested. Do you still feel the same way?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, if it's crime infested, it is. I mean, if you have crime, you have crime, and we have to get it out, and we've been actually putting a lot of money into this area, because, I mean, Georgia's coming a long way under this administration, and when you have crime, you have crime. There's nothing you can do about it in terms of statistics.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have to just solve the problem, to make the statistics look a lot better. So, we've worked very hard, with your local politicians and local representatives, and we've really made it a much safer place, as you know.
<Alyse Eady> <Positive> So Georgia is a really important state when it comes to the 2020 election, with there being two Senate seats open as -- as well. So -- So what's what's the message for Republicans to -- to maintain control of Georgia?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you have a great gentleman named David Perdue, and he's running, as you know, he's your Senator. He fights so much. He loves this state. He loves your state, and David is running hard, and I don't see how anybody can beat him, frankly. He's been such a great Senator. And then, as you know, Brian Kemp, who's your Governor, is going to be making a choice for Johnny Isaacson, who's been so incredible for so long, for the whole state.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But they'll be making a choice very shortly, and I'm sure he'll pick somebody that's terrific.
<Alyse Eady> <Neutral> For the impeachment inquiry, President Trump, how is this impacting your -- your campaign for re-election?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll tell you. My poll numbers are higher than they've been ever. My -- my -- the fundraising has been through the roof. We have bigger crowds than we've ever had. Our base is more -- as an example, I got a call from the evangelical leaders. They came over. They said there's never been anything like this in terms of the electricity that they have.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> These are the churches and really, leaders of faith. I must say -- look, it's a witch hunt. It's a phony deal, based on one conversation that was a perfect conversation. It's a phony deal by a corrupt politician named Schiff, and Pelosi should go back and clean up her own district in San Francisco, which is going to, I'll say, going to hell, frankly, with the needles and the all of the problems that they have.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's got to go back there and clean it up. But this is really just a phony deal, and what it's done is driven up our numbers like crazy, and you saw the other night, we had a Republican vote, 196, actually, a couple of Democrats joined the Republicans, and it was -- it was zero negative Republican votes, which is pretty amazing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, it's unfair. It's not nice. But it's something that is honestly energized our party a lot.
<Alyse Eady> <Positive> So you're headed back here for LSU -- this direction, at least --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right, that's right.
<Alyse Eady> <Neutral> The LSU-Alabama game. Your choice, your pick, for the win?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I better not do that, but I will tell you that, two fantastic teams. They're both undefeated. They're great teams, and I think you're gonna have an amazing game. Alabama's always tough, and LSU has really become tough. I hear their quarterback is fantastic. So, I'm going to enjoy it. I look -- I, look, two great areas, two areas that like me, so we're going to watch a great game.
<Alyse Eady> <Positive> President Trump, thank you so much for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Great to see you.
<Question> <Negative> I wanted to begin in the news. Iran overnight said it was considering enriching uranium at levels that would violate the 2015 nuclear agreement. You've been very clear that you won't let Iran get a nuclear weapon.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, I think they'd be making a big mistake doing that.
<Question> <Neutral> Are you considering more military action?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wouldn't say that. I can't say that at all. It would be inappropriate. But they would be making a big mistake if they enriched.
<Question> <Neutral> Are they calling your bluff on this or how do you see it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Time will tell. Only time will tell.
<Question> <Negative> I mean in your campaign, you promised to get the U.S. out of unnecessary foreign wars. With your  --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's true. Well I have. We defeated ISIS, the caliphate. We've taken back the caliphate. That doesn't mean one of the crazies doesn't walk into a store all bombed up. But we've taken back 100 percent. I wish I could show you the maps of what it was before and what it was after. Sarah, maybe you could ask somebody to bring me those maps.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The -- ISIS, when I got there, and ISIS when I left. Right now, there is no ISIS. ISIS has -- the entire caliphate is down. Remember when it was 99 percent gone and I started moving people out. They said "He didn't finish the job." Anyway, so  --
<Question> <Negative> With this confrontation with Iran, I mean, are you watching another  --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well -- look -- I also said Iran is not going to have a nuclear weapon, you know, which is very important. As you know in Afghanistan, when I got there, it was 16,000 people. It's now 9,000 people. And some good things are happening there frankly. No, I'd like to get out of the Middle East, we should have never been in the Middle East.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We should have never been there, and I'd like to get out.
<Question> <Negative> It does look as if you're getting drawn in rather than pulled out, especially with regard to the tankers. Are you concerned about Iran's attacks as  --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, one of the things that seems to be rather ridiculous -- also, Shea, do me a favor. Will you get the information I had yesterday -- the people that benefit from the Straits. The companies, countries that benefit from the Straits. Just -- I want to show you something. China gets 60 percent of their oil there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Japan 25 percent of their oil. So many of the other places get such vast amounts of oil there. We get very little. You know, we have made tremendous progress in the last 2-1/2 years in energy, and when the pipelines get built, we're now an exporter of energy. So we're not in the position that we were in, that we used to be in in the Middle East where we needed -- you know we were there -- some people would say we were there for the oil.
<Question> <Negative> So does that mean that strategically you would go to war over nuclear weapons but not over passage through the Strait of Hormuz?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I wouldn't even want to say that, but I would certainly go over nuclear weapons, and I would keep the other a question mark. Shea? Ask them to bring in the documents I saw yesterday.
<Question> <Positive> How much of the challenge --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [To an aide] I'm talking about through the Straits. The oil that comes in by country. I had it yesterday. Who would have it? Maybe Bolton would have it, or somebody Which is a pretty shocking thing. You look at China, it's a big beneficiary -- they don't pay anything. Japan is a big beneficiary, they don't pay anything.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Many other countries, they don't pay anything. Indonesia. Many other countries come, they don't pay anything. And we're there keeping the world as, you know, we're there keeping the oil flowing. Right? And the amazing thing is we're now an exporter, so in theory, we're a beneficiary of oil problems. But I don't view it that way.
<Question> <Negative> Do you believe the evidence the intelligence community is -- says that shows Iran is launching attacks on oil tankers?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't think too many people don't believe it. I think people say they don't believe it because they don't want to get drawn in. But they don't, they don't, uh, they don't believe it.
<Question> <Positive> Is it proving challenging -- it sounds as if from your description of the other countries, as if you're finding it challenging to get other countries to help the U.S. apply pressure
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're just starting that process, but other countries are a bigger beneficiary of that part of the world now than we are. Far bigger.
<Question> <Negative> Do you think there's a credibility problem in trying to get them on board, both because of Iraq intelligence, but also because of your own criticisms of the U.S. intelligence community over the years?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think we have any problems. I have a good group of people now. I have people that I want. And we have some terrific people, and no, that's not a problem. But what is a problem is that the United States takes care of the world, and the world doesn't take care of the world. The world doesn't want to take care of itself.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There are some countries, as an example that benefit greatly, and they're rich countries. These are very rich countries in some cases, and they don't make contributions, and they haven't for many, many years. And at some point -- you know, look, I've done a lot about that. If you look at NATO, if you call up Secretary General Stoltenberg, you'll see that, he said over $100 billion has been contributed over the last very short period of time by other countries who were not living up to their 2 percent commitment and the 2 percent should be more than 2 percent, by the way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And over $100 billion has been paid, and if you look at a chart of NATO, it's gone, go back 15 years, it's gone literally, the contribution, down here, and then it went up like this when I became -- And I told them, I said, 'Look, the United States cannot continue to be—' I mean, they're not paying. They're literally not paying.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're protecting nations, and they're not paying, and it was very unfair. But Secretary General Stoltenberg was terrific. He tells it like it is. Big difference.
<Question> <Negative> A criticism on the other side of that is that -- to use the word your critics use -- the "confrontational" approach to Europe is now costing you in the attempt to put pressure on Iran because they're less willing to believe you and feel less aligned.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. Europe looks at me as a double -- I guess first of all, my relationships with Europe are very good. You saw that with my recent trip to -- number of trips, frankly -- but my recent trip with France, where Normandy was a tremendous and beautiful thing to behold. It really was incredible. But I have very good relationships in Europe.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The Prime Minister of U.K., the Queen of England -- we had a great time. We had a great time. We have very good relationships in Europe. I would say our relationships are far better now than under the Obama Administration, but they respect us more because they got away with things that were very unfair. Like as an example, Europe, the European nations, if you look at what's happening on trade.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> O.K., it was really unfair what's been happening on trade. They, we lost, over the years, on average, $150 billion a year on trade with the European -- as a group -- the European nations. It's very unfair. Then on top of it, we protect them, from NATO, in the form of NATO. And NATO, if you take a look at it, NATO probably, a lot of people would dispute this number, but we were paying 70 to 80 percent of NATO.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's unfair.
<Question> <Neutral> So just continuing on this idea of America's role on the world stage, what is your message to the demonstrators in Hong Kong right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, my message is that they're obviously having a big impact, because it's been pulled back and it will be pulled back further. And I think that they've been very effective in their dealings with China. By the way, I have a very good relationship with China, just that they've treated us unfairly with respect to trade for many years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Since the WTO, we've been treated unfairly. We've helped create China. I give them a lot of credit, but we've helped create China. You look at what's happened over the last period of time, and China wants to make a deal. They actually had a deal with us. We were very close to having a deal, and then they pulled back on three major points that were just unacceptable to me. So I'm very happy now collecting 25 percent on $250 billion, which is what we're doing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But China wants to make a deal, and I don't blame them, because companies are leaving China by the hundreds because they don't want to pay the tariffs. So China's going to want to make a deal.
<Question> <Positive> Do you support the demands of the protesters against the extradition bill?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll tell you what, I'm going to let the protesters speak for themselves. I have our own argument with China, and I think it's going to work out successfully, but I'm going to let China and the protesters work out their own problem. It looks like it's going to be worked out.
<Question> <Negative> A lot of Republicans were critical of President Obama when he wasn't, by their account, sufficiently supportive of protesters in Iran after the election in 2010. Are you taking a similarly Realpolitik view?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I would view it differently. I would view the Iran situation differently. I think that things could have happened, that Iran would have been a much different country today. When I took over Iran -- when I took over as President, when I became President and then took over Jan. 20, Iran was a much different country 2-1/2 years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They were unbelievably hostile. They were truly a nation of terror. They were all over the place. We had 14 points of confliction, and they were behind every single one of them. Now it's a different country. They have tremendous problems, problems that nobody would have ever thought they had. And that was not a time to make the deal, the deal that President Obama made.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was a horrible deal. So I terminated that deal, did other things including sanctions, and Iran wants to make a deal also. I will tell you right now. They don't talk it, although sometimes they do. But Iran wants to make a deal, and it's the smartest thing they could do, is to make a deal.
<Question> <Neutral> Have you gotten any messages from Iran?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Interview Goes Off-the-Record] Look -- when I first -- One of the first meetings I had was with the Pentagon, and we were talking about the Middle East, which I was always against going in. You know people always like to say, "Oh, maybe he was too --" I wasn't. I was always, I was against going into Iraq.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was a terrible… going into the Middle East was a terrible decision. We're into the Middle East for $7 trillion. Many lives, and if you look at both sides, you know, unbelievable numbers of lives -- because I look at both sides, I don't just look at the one side. I look at both sides. It was a terrible decision to go in. It's quicksand.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Always has been, always will be. And we're doing just fine. We did ISIS. We're doing fine in terms of Afghanistan. We're down to half -- we'll soon be down to about 8,000 soldiers.
<Question> <Neutral> Are you going into direct talks with Iran and what would you ask for? What do you want?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, I'm open whenever they're ready. Let's see, we have a long way to go before we get there, but I'm open when they're ready. But if you remember, sometimes it's hard to place yourself back in time, but if you go back 2-1/2 years, we had an absolute disaster going on. It was -- Iran was causing problems like nobody's  --
<Question> <Negative> But how do you explain the current attacks against shipping, and as Pompeo laid out, allegedly  --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, so far, it's been very minor. And so far, if you look at the rhetoric now compared to the days when they were signing that agreement, where it was always, "Death to America, death to America, we will destroy America, we will kill America." I'm not hearing that too much any more, and I don't expect to, by the way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't expect to. A lot difference. Rhetorically you understand.
<Question> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look at when they were signing the agreement, they were all screaming death to America as they're signing the agreement? What's that all about? They picked up the seven sailors, and the only reason the sailors -- the 10 sailors -- the only reason the sailors were let go is that we started making massive payments to them the following day.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Otherwise the sailors would still be there under President Obama.
<Question> <Positive> I want to talk about some of the big themes of your campaign. I've been to a lot of your rallies, here are signs that say "Promises Made, Promises Kept." At the current rate, it's very unlikely that your wall will be built by the time Election Day comes around.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, we'll have -- we'll have, over 400, We're building the wall right now. People don't understand. We are building the wall right now. It is under major construction.
<Question> <Neutral> There's 654 miles, you have 61 miles --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there's 550 miles. 550 is max.
<Question> <Neutral> —of fencing and barriers --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we will have over 450 miles built by the end of next year. We're also renovating tremendous amounts of wall. We're renovating and fixing. We're putting -- areas that didn't have wall, we're putting temporary walls in. We're doing a great job, and the job we did with Mexico, nobody could even believe.
<Question> <Negative> Why are the numbers of people coming across now at a 13-year high then?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because they're trying to come in because the economy is so good. We have 3.5 percent unemployment. The economy is -- you could make the case it's never been stronger than it is now, and the people are trying to come up for the economy. They're not coming up for asylum. They're coming up for money.
<Question> <Negative> Either way, I mean you can't expect us -- as a policy matter to make our economy bad to stop them from coming.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, I'm not going to make it bad. I'm just saying it wasn't good. The economy wasn't very good, and it was weak under President Obama. Now it's the strongest economy we've probably ever had.
<Question> <Neutral> So how do you deliver on the promise?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Even look at the First Quarter, we're at 3.2 percent. Nobody expected that. They thought it would be one -- you know, the First Quarter is always very low. We're at 3.2 percent. The economy is so strong that people are coming up. Now what I did with Mexico is, Mexico -- I don't know if you've seen, but the numbers are way down since they started last week, and they haven't even -- they're putting their -- they're starting to move the 6,000 soldiers in tomorrow.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I think they're working very hard. [Interview Goes Off-the-Record]
<Question> <Neutral> Would you consider reinstating the family separation policy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So let me tell you about that. It's very interesting. President Obama had separation. I'm the one that brought it together. I was the one, and what that did is it made more people come up because I didn't like separation any more than you did. But if you look at those cells, where they were showing all these cells, they looked like jail cells or cyclone fence -- but they look like jail cells.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They were built in 2014 by Obama. I think you people had one of those pictures actually. You said look at these cells. It turned out they were built by Obama. They were built by people that I know very well. People that want to come into the Administration. But if you look at the separation policy, I had that policy, and then I'm the one that put the families back together.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When you put the families back together, you have more families come up. It's a very simple …
<Question> <Neutral> On your watch, sir  --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but you understand what I'm saying.
<Question> <Positive> Yeah, there were  --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I inherited separation.
<Question> <Negative> On your watch, there were families whose parents were separated from the children. They were deported. The children were left behind. And the agencies  --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they had that under Obama's watch, too.
<Question> <Negative> And the agencies didn't keep good records, and have had a hard time reuniting  --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Many of those records were Obama records, and they had separation and they had the exact same thing during the Obama years. The difference is because our economy is so strong, more people came up. Plus, they learned how weak our laws are. Now the laws, hopefully, are going to be changed. But they learned how weak the laws are.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know, if Mexico does the job, they have very strong policy; they have very strong immigration policy. If Mexico does the job, there should be very few people coming up through Mexico. And Mexico can do the job. And I believe they will do the job, but if they don't do the job, we're going to put tariffs on, and they understand that, and the tariffs are very significant.
<Question> <Neutral> What other measures are you considering if the numbers continue to grow?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think they will continue to grow. I think they're starting to go down now.
<Question> <Neutral> Do you know how many kids were separated from their parents under your -- Administration. Do you have a number?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they have lists. They have very accurate lists actually. But you have to understand, they were separated with President Obama. They were separated with President Bush. I didn't change the policy, and the policy had been changed, it was -- I'm the one that ended separation. Just so we understand. And when we ended separation, and I was not surprised to see this, more families came up because now they're not going to be separated.
<Question> <Neutral> So would you consider reinstating it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know, I don't like it, I don't like the concept of separation. I'd rather keep them from coming up, it would be a lot easier because I don't like it. But I'm -- it's crazy. I got such a bad rap on that. I inherited separation.
<Question> <Neutral> But it was the enforcement  --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You do know this, right Sarah?
<Sarah Huckabee-Sanders> <Positive> Yes, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These were the laws, President Bush had them, President Obama had them. I had them. And when I had them, everybody went wild about separation, nobody talked about separation before. But Obama, President Obama is the one that built the jail cells, as they called them, and they said "Look at these cells, isn't this terrible?" I said, wait a minute -- and we didn't know that, and then they stepped forward -- those pictures were perhaps in your magazine in 2014. That was long before I became President.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All of those cells were built in 2014, and before. And they made it sound like I did it. Look, just so we understand, separation has been there for a long time. When I got there, I ended separation. I knew what would happen. More people would come up, but I didn't like the concept of separation. It was bad.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now what we're doing, if this works with Mexico, there will be a trem—. Look, they're putting 6,000 soldiers on their southern border. That's a game-changer. We are now bringing people back into Mexico. [Interview Goes Off-the-Record]
<Question> <Negative> It does feel to me a little bit, Mr. President, as if you feel you're vulnerable on immigration in 2020?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I don't. I think I'm good. I think they're vulnerable. No, I think the Democrats are totally vulnerable. I think we're doing a great job on immigration.
<Question> <Negative> Do you sense that your supporters who voted for you and heard about how you're going to crack down on immigration and reduce illegal flows are disappointed?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, I'm building a wall despite the fact that the Democrats don't want a wall built. They have fought every -- we just won a lawsuit on the wall. I don't know if you saw that, a big one, a very important one, against Nancy Pelosi in the House. They sued us, and we won a lawsuit last week, a very big one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're building a wall, the wall is going up as we speak. We've already renovated vast amounts of wall, taking inferior product and making it very good, very strong. We had walls, we built walls in San Diego.
<Question> <Neutral> Painting and barbed wire on many sections, sir, but  --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, we fixed walls, and in some cases, we have added massive amounts of barbed wire because the walls were not effective the way they were. And we used the walls as a structure for the barbed wire, and now that the barbed wire is up, nobody is coming across. They can't come across. The walls have become very effective, and they were very ineffective before.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You could climb them, you can't climb them now. But we're also building large numbers of new wall. If you want, I can get the Army Corps of Engineers to tell you exactly what we're building, but we're building -- we will have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year.
<Question> <Negative> The money isn't coming from Congress  --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that's despite the -- no, that's right. That's despite. We're taking some from the military. We're taking some from the drug enforcement. We're taking -- we have different pockets where we're taking it.
<Question> <Neutral> On North Korea, sir, the remains  --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> North Korea?
<Question> <Negative> On North Korea, the remains have stopped coming back. The Pentagon is no longer in discussions with the North Koreans about the remains.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they will be. Look, we've gotten remains back. That will start up again. We have gotten our prisoners back. We had four prisoners, got them back. [Interview Goes Off-the-Record]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We got our prisoners back. We don't have nuclear testing. We don't have any testing, we don't have -- other than short-range missiles, which they did a couple of like every other countries test short-term, these were standard short-term missiles -- there are no ballistic missiles being tested. There's no nuclear tests, and we have a very good relationship.
<Question> <Neutral> Are you in talks  --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Uh, yeah. Will you show me that letter, the birthday letter, do you have it? Get it for me. I'll show it to you.
<Question> <Positive> I want to jump, one question back to  --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, please.
<Question> <Positive> -- one question back to the border, and then we can go back to North Korea, or other topics. Just to point blank ask you, because May was the highest number of immigrants coming across the border illegally in 13 years  --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In 13 years  --
<Question> <Positive> So we're trying to reconcile the promise of, versus the reality  --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> O.K., here -- I ended separation -- which Obama had, which Bush, which everybody had. I ended separation. One thing. But the biggest thing is the economy is so strong, and the Democrats -- the only reason we have this is because the Democrats won't fix the loopholes. The loopholes are terrible, and they won't fix asylum.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We could have them fixed in 15 minutes, but they refused to fix it. The only reason we have a problem at the border -- and with that problem comes the fact that people learned about their legal rights on the border -- the Democrats could fix the asylum problem and the loophole problem in 15 minutes. If they did that, everything would immediately stop.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The border would be 100 percent secure. Now, when you add Mexico to it, and then you fix -- then you really have a great secure situation. But I think Mexico will solve most of the problem by itself. But the Democrats have to fix these asylum problems. I mean we have asylum -- we have an asylum situation that is so ridiculous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're the only country in the world with the things that we have to do, and the Democrats could easily fix it, but they want open borders -- which means crimes, it means drugs.
<Question> <Negative> The promise was that Mexico was going to pay for the wall. [Interview Goes Off-the-Record]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This isn't over. This is a negotiation. Don't underestimate the fact, and the other thing is in the trade deal, which assuming it gets approved, Mexico's paying hundreds of billions of dollars over a period of time more than they were paying previously. I mean can that count for a wall that's a fraction of the numbers you're talking about?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, in the U.S.M.C.A. That deal is .. .in other words, that deal is much more lucrative for the United States than NAFTA. Here's the ISIS maps. You probably have to look at them together. So, here, I'll show you. That's where I took over. That was halfway through. And this is like now, or something, yep.
<Question> <Neutral> Try to go in order here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That would be pretty impressive. I assume you want them; I assume you're going to put that in your front page. So this is ISIS  --
<Question> <Neutral> We've run this graphic -- we've run it practically every week, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Have you seen this? No, seriously.
<Question> <Positive> I have seen it, yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But here you have nothing. The caliphate is gone. This doesn't mean you don't have crazy people around that, you know? And bombs -- I'm not saying any fighting is finished because with these people, you never know. They're totally -- they're stone-cold crazy. But there's ISIS. There it is a year later. And there it is now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Not bad. Not bad. Not bad  --
<Question> <Neutral> Jumping back to the campaign  --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hope you're going to write it. Do you want to keep them? Can we give them?
<Sarah Huckabee-Sanders> <Positive> Yeah, they can keep them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Do you want something to drink, folks?
<Question> <Positive> Sure. Thank you, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK.
<Sarah Huckabee-Sanders> <Neutral> We've got a few more minutes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's all right, let them have it. If we do, maybe I'll get my first good cover of Time since I got elected. The first story was great. The first story, when I won the election, that was written by a gentleman with like a French name.
<Question> <Neutral> Michael Scherer?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who?
<Question> <Neutral> David Von Drehle?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. French. Is there like a French name?
<Question> <Negative> Do you bet? I have forgotten whether you bet or not?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do I bet?
<Question> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My whole life is a bet.
<Question> <Neutral> Do you have a bet for who will be the Democratic candidate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't have a bet. I think that Biden is not the same Biden. Something's going on there. O.K.? I would say that probably a progressive wins. Look, when a progressive gets out, another progressive is going to take 100 percent of the vote, so it's  --
<Question> <Neutral> Meaning, if, Bernie drops, Warren picks it up?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, yeah, I think they pick up close to 100 percent. I think they pick up much of that vote. I think that Harris has not surged, as they say. I think that Bernie is going in the wrong direction. I think Biden is going in the wrong direction. He's dropped a lot. He's come down a lot. If you look at our friend Pocahontas, she is doing pretty well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's doing pretty well. They forgot that she's a fraud. She's doing … you know she's the one that's doing, it seems, the best in terms of that. I don't believe Mayor Pete has a chance, I never did. I don't see it.
<Question> <Negative> Why is that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Here's a letter, O.K., now I'm going to show you this letter. So this was written by Kim Jong-un. It was delivered to me yesterday. By hand. [Interview Goes Off-the-Record]
<Question> <Negative> And why don't you think Mayor Pete has a chance, while we look  --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just don't feel it.
<Question> <Neutral> Is there a candidate -- ?
<Question> <Neutral> It's all instinct when you get into politics -- politics is all instinct. Right?
<Question> <Negative> Who do you think your toughest opponent would be?
<Sarah Huckabee-Sanders> <Negative> You can't take a picture of that, sorry.
<Question> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What was that?!
<Question> <Negative> So, who do you think your toughest opponent would be in the general?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Uh -- I don't know. Look, I think I've done so much. Could you bring the list of things, please, give me four of them. I've done more in 2-1/2 years than any President in the history of this country. And when you look at the things … I'm going to give you a list. Nobody's approved what we've approved; nobody's gotten through.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Whether it's the Vets and Choice, and accountability. Both two things you could never get approved. They could never get them approved. You look at the tax cuts, you look at ANWR. You look at the individual mandate. I've had a lot to do with healthcare. You look at right-to-try. Add right-to-try with the individual mandate.
<Question> <Neutral> What is the individual mandate?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The individual mandate of Obamacare. We ended it. That's where you had to pay for  --
<Question> <Positive> Yeah, right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You had to pay not to pay for insurance -- to pay a fortune for the privilege of not paying. One of the most unpopular part. We'll get great healthcare after -- if we win back the House. And keep the Senate. Keep the presidency.
<Question> <Positive> Here's a list. We just made a -- this is relatively new, right?
<Unidentified Aide> <Neutral> It's for today.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's pretty new. Here's a list of the things, each spot, each line is another thing. Nobody has done this. These are all between bills and things. I'd like you to keep it. Take a look.
<Question> <Negative> Your own campaign polling is showing a disconnect; people who are feeling the benefits of the economy but not giving you credit. Is there a way you…
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I agree with that. I don't think -- I think I'm getting credit, but I'm not getting the full credit. If the Democrats had won the 2016 race, instead of being up 3.1 percent, I think it would be down 5 percent. I think we would actually be down because what -- what I -- I had the largest cut in regulations in the history of the country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In two years, I cut more regulations than any other President, no matter how long their term was. That was a big factor in terms of what's happened with the country, with the thing. With the whole -- with the whole success that we've had. If the Democrats got in, they wouldn't have done that and they would have put more regulation on, and you would have been in -- you would have seen a real mess.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Here's that. Do you see what I'm saying with that letter? It's pretty good, right? I mean this is pretty good.
<Question> <Neutral> At the same time that he's launching short-range missiles  --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Short-range, extremely short-range. And no different than anyone else tests and launches, et cetera. Can I have that letter back you have?
<Question> <Neutral> We have the bullet points.
<Question> <Negative> Going back to kind of a health care question. Do you support the Alabama abortion law that was recently passed?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I -- I'm -- I have the exceptions, and I've always been for the exceptions, and I think that's very important.
<Question> <Positive> What about fetal heartbeat bills, like in Georgia, which do have those exceptions?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're studying it all. I mean, it's a very evolving topic, but I am for exceptions.
<Question> <Negative> -- Even when it bans -- at six weeks  --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- It has to be that way -- I have been very strong on that.
<Sarah Huckabee-Sanders> <Positive> Guys, we have time for maybe one or two more questions.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Question> <Negative> I have some Mueller questions. Sir, your former Chief of Staff, White House Counsel, Deputy Campaign Chairman, Deputy National Security Advisor, Staff Secretary, Communications Director, among others -- all testified under oath, at risk of prison time, that in the words of the Mueller Report, you tried to "influence" and "control" the Mueller investigation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think they did that  --
<Question> <Neutral> They did. I can give you the citations, sir, I have them right here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think they -- I don't think they did that. And frankly, I could have ended that -- Mueller -- immediately under Article II, if I wanted to. Article II, we don't even talk about Article II because there's no reason to talk about it. But I could have ended Mueller immediately. I could have done that, I decided not to do that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I had the power to do it if I wanted to do it. So there has never been a President that's been as transparent as I've been. 1.5 million pages of documents. I gave… 300 or 500 people, testified. I allowed many people, including White House counsel, to testify. Hundreds of subpoenas, in fact, I think thousands of subpoenas I said -- I didn't exert presidential prerogative.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't use presidential prerogative in any way, shape or form.
<Question> <Negative> You did try to limit Mueller's Russia probe to only future election meddling. Why did you do that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me tell you this. I could have ended the whole thing very quickly. Very easily. I said let it play out, and the bottom line was no collusion, and subject to a review of the documents, no obstruction by the Attorney General. After he reviewed the documents, he found no obstruction. That result has driven the Democrats crazy, crazy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These people have gone absolutely insane.
<Question> <Negative> For the record, sir, the report does say this report "does not exonerate" you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> On obstruction. You mean on a no-crime. You mean there was no crime. So there was no crime taken and  --
<Question> <Positive> Everybody knows that you can obstruct justice without there being an underlying crime  --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, here's what I don't -- I'll go a step further. It was a crime committed by the other side. Not only was there no crime on my side, and he found no collusion and he found no conspiracy, right, do you agree with that? No conspiracy, no collusion, no nothing?
<Question> <Neutral> But he found multiple examples of members of your staff interacting with the Russians  --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, and he also … excuse me … what did he say? He said, in fact, there was pushback. He said they pushed back. Our staff pushed back.
<Question> <Negative> Some people did, some people didn't. But the point is, Mr. President  --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no -- he said there was pushback.
<Question> <Negative> -- the American people had a right to know what Russia was trying to do to the core exercise of their democracy, and that's what the Russia probe was about. You attempted to influence and control it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> President Obama in September was told by the FBI about Russia. He did nothing. Hillary Clinton went out and paid a man who went to Russia and used Russians and paid Russians. They did nothing. A lot of the bloggers that you read about, O.K.? You read about these bloggers. They were on Hillary's side and Trump's side.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The so-called -- was it 24 numerous -- And you're talking about -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising and Facebook and everything else.
<Question> <Negative> But didn't the American people  --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They spent a tiny amount of money -- just so you understand, and as the report makes very clear, there was no collusion, there was no conspiracy  --
<Question> <Negative> But why would you try to limit the investigation only  --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't limit the investigation.
<Question> <Neutral> You dictated a letter  --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me  --
<Question> <Negative> -- to Corey Lewandowski telling him to tell Sessions to limit the investigation  --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I could have told Sessions myself if I wanted to. Under Section II  --
<Question> <Neutral> He testified under oath  --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me  --
<Question> <Negative> -- under threat of prison time, that that was the case Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me -- Under Section II -- Well, you can go to prison instead, because, if you use, if you use the photograph you took of the letter that I gave you  --
<Question> <Neutral> Do you believe that people should be  --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> confidentially, I didn't give it to you to take photographs of it -- So don't play that game with me. Let me just tell you something. You take a look  --
<Question> <Negative> I'm sorry, Mr. President. Were you threatening me with prison time?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I told you the following. I told you you can look at this off-the-record. That doesn't mean you take out your camera and start taking pictures of it. O.K.? So I hope you don't have a picture of it. I know you were very quick to pull it out -- even you were surprised to see that. You can't do that stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So go have fun with your story. Because I'm sure it will be the 28th horrible story I have in Time Magazine because I never -- I mean -- ha. It's incredible. With all I've done and the success I've had, the way that Time Magazine writes is absolutely incredible. Tell them five seconds.
<Unidentified Aide> <Neutral> O.K.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> With all I've done, with the tremendous success I've had, that Time Magazine writes about me the way they write is a disgrace, O.K.? Let's face it, it's a disgrace. And some day within the next 20 years, maybe you'll pick me as Man of the Year. O.K., big deal. But with all that we've said, now -- go back to the Mueller Report.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have 18 people who hated Donald Trump, who were angry Democrats, many of whom supported the Democratic Party financially. Right? You have Bob Mueller who was conflicted, totally conflicted. You know my feeling on that. Comey was his friend. I had a nasty business dispute with him when he was in private life.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A very nasty business dispute. Right? You know about that, right?
<Question> <Positive> If you want to provide us details  --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't want to provide you details, there's no reason to. What difference, you won't write it the way it's proper anyway. But I had a nasty business dispute with Comey. And you know the other disputes, also we had. And he sat, see that chair you're in? He was right in that chair, wanting the job to be the FBI Director, and I said no. O.K.? That's a conflict of interest.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Despite that, he said no collusion. First chapter. No collusion. No conspiracy. Push back. Push back. So now they have a phony crime and they say I tried to obstruct a phony crime. But you see, but I didn't. I didn't. And more importantly, under Article II, I could have done whatever I wanted. I could have fired Mueller if I wanted, but I didn't, because if anybody checked out Richard Nixon, that didn't work out so well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Alright? But I could have -- I could have fired -- I had the right under Article II to fire Robert, but I didn't. And I didn't want to. I figured, let him finish his report. Let's see. The report came out, no collusion. Collusion being the biggest thing, meaning conspiracy. Or whatever they want to call it. And the report was very clear on that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And remember, take a look -- there was actually in fact push back, do you agree with that, Sarah? They actually had push back from our people. Not only didn't they accept, but there was push back. And then Phase two, they set up a crime. What about Hillary Clinton's 33,000 emails? What about the fact that she paid Christopher Steele for a fake phony dossier -- tremendous amounts of money -- her and the DNC.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you guys wrote the real story, you'd end up doing very well. You'd end up with Pulitzer Prizes. I'll tell you there are people that should get Pulitzer Prizes, but they aren't the ones that got 'em. The ones that got 'em should hand 'em back because they called this thing very wrong.
<Sarah Huckabee-Sanders> <Neutral> Maybe one last question, and we'll wrap here.
<Question> <Neutral> A campaign-related one.
<Question> <Positive> What are the new goals you want to take up in your second term?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we're rebuilding the military, which is creating jobs. We're doing some really good things in health care. We're doing some tremendous things in health care. You see what's happening with some of the policies that we're coming out with. We got rid of, as I said, we got rid of the individual mandate, which was by far the most popular thing in Obamacare.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're managing Obamacare much better. But Obamacare is a very -- it's very bad. And if we win, I will do healthcare. If we get the House. If we get back the House -- you can't do it without the House. If we get the House, we get the Senate, we get the presidency, we will have a great health care plan, we will have tremendous healthcare.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we're doing a good job on that anyway. Doing a very good job. Our military is strong. We are withdrawing -- if you look from the Middle East end, we may have a problem with Iran. That could happen. A thing like that could happen, absolutely. But it could also be that things work out. If Iran does the right thing, it would be a very good thing for Iran, but I don't know that they'll do the right thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a feeling they probably will.
<Question> <Negative> Your ability to be in the middle of the news is seen as a big asset for the campaign. They are running Facebook ads; whenever you have a big news cycle they will generate…
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right, right  --
<Question> <Positive> Like when you said you were going to close the deal with Mexico -- Are you able to coordinate, have you been talking with the campaign about what issues resonate  --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure. I am. We all have our meetings. But I generally do my own thing. Like for instance, they had the Stephanopoulos interview, and I said, you know, let me watch this, and then it said both things -- did you see that? Where I said, yeah, I'd do both. I said, where's the dispute here? Where's the dispute?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was made up by the fake news media. I said I'll do both. Then I also said I would report them. I'm not talking about the Fox & Friends a day later. I'm talking about just if you go by that interview. But for the most part they didn't put the "I'll do -- I'd do both." I said, yeah, I'd do both. Nobody wanted to hear that.
<Question> <Negative> What would you do if a foreign power launched a propaganda effort to halt a Democratic opponent?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've said, you know what? I've answered it so many different ways -- I answered it in Stephanopoulos, I answered the same question on Fox. But number one, I don't think they'd do it with me because they know I love the country  --
<Question> <Negative> -- asking about, if there were an effort to help an opponent, the Democrat.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You mean if they helped the opponent?
<Question> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, if this was reversed, where the Republicans did this to a Democrat, every one of them would be in jail for years already. O.K.? If they did -- if this was reversed, where I did to them what they did to me, the repercussions would be enormous. The press is protecting the DNC, the Democrats, crooked Hillary.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're totally protected by the press. They're partners, let's face it. They're partners. Look at Time Magazine. I read a couple of stories in Time Magazine that were so bad, it was unbelievable. It was unbelievable. [Interview Goes Off-the-Record] Bad coverage, though. I should get good coverage. I built one of the strongest economies, I built probably the strongest economy, certainly one of them, but the strongest.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean you could go by many -- go by unemployment. African Americans, Asians, Hispanics, the strongest they've ever had. More people working today, almost 160 million. By far more than we've ever had working. You know, you could make the case, this is the greatest economy we've ever had. I built that. If Hillary would have gotten in, it would have been decimated.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Instead of being at 3.2, we'd be at minus-5 or minus-6. It was going bad. If you look at the numbers from the end of the Obama, it was crashing. It was crashing. And here's the good news. We have tremendous potential. Maybe it depends to a certain extent on what happens with some trade deals, but we've already done the deal with North Korea.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's totally done, it's really good. I took a bad deal, I terminated it, and I made it a good deal. Got the 25 percent on trucks, on small trucks, et cetera, et cetera, which was terminated. Which is frankly very interesting. You ought to look at this sometime. The Chicken Tax. It's the most successful vehicle built in the automobile industry in America today.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was able to do it. But we did the deal -- KORUS —you know, the deal with North Korea -- the deal with South Korea. We did pretty much everything I've set out to do is either done or on its way to being done. Now, when you look at that list, and you go point by point by point by point, you say does this gentleman ever take it easy?
<Question> <Positive> There are some political analysts looking at the 2020 election who say your strategy of focusing on base issues makes sense given your politics. There are others who say broadening it to try and reach some of the voters who you didn't get last time and some who you need to try and keep from last time is important.
<Question> <Positive> Do you have a strategy to reach out beyond your base?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd love to broaden it. I think I have one of the greatest -- you know there are those who say I have the greatest base in the history of American politics because it always stays at 45, 46, 47. I mean it's been -- today it's at 51. Wasn't Rasmussen 51? 51. And I'll tell you, you know, Rasmussen -- you know -- it's respected -- they got the election the best.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's why I say Rasmussen because they got the election the most right. Los Angeles Times, Rasmussen, and I think it was Business Insider, believe it or not, three polls got it very good. But Rasmussen was good. That's at 51 percent. But I have a base of 45, 46 percent that is a phenomenal base.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Directed at an aide] I've got it. Thanks. I got it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a base that's a phenomenal -- it's just a phenomenal base. It's a very loyal base and I'm loyal to them also. With that being said, the thing that I have that's different, because based on the economy, I should be up 15 or 20 points higher. It should be, just based on the economy. You know it's the economy, stupid, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Based on the economy, I should be at much higher numbers than I am. And the thing that I have that nobody's ever had before, from the day I came down the escalator, I have had a phony witch hunt against me. And not long after that day, you understand, from the day and you look at the insurance policy by crooked FBI agents, where they talked about the insurance policy just in case Hillary Clinton should lose.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The insurance policy. We lived the insurance policy, if that's what it was.   This was spying on a campaign. This was -- what happened to me as President should never happen to another President again. And I'm honored to have gone through it. There are those that say that very few people that they know could have taken it. I spoke with Lindsey Graham.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He said, "You know what? There's not a person I know in the world that could have taken what you've taken. And you've come out stronger for it." But I really believe that there are very few people could have taken it. From Day One, it's been a phony witch hunt with a phony dossier with phony FISA court -- the whole thing was a phony deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was a fraud. It was a woman that deleted 33,000 emails after getting a subpoena from Congress, and she had no problem doing it. If I ever deleted one email, if I did one email and deleted it, I'd have nothing but serious, serious problems. It is a partnership between the media and the Democratic Party.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it's a shame. It's really a shame. Nobody's gone through and nobody has been treated as unfairly as Donald Trump. And almost everybody admits that.
<Question> <Neutral> In your estimation, that's costing you 15 points?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's cost me -- yeah, and it's phony, and I think that will turn around because it's been proven to be phony. The whole thing. Impeachment. Impeachment for what? Nothing was done wrong. Impeachment for what?! There was no collusion, nothing was done wrong. You know there are those that say -- Alan Dershowitz wrote a piece the other day that it's illegal to impeach him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's nothing done wrong, you can't impeach
<Question> <Negative> Do you think impeachment would actually help you, as Pelosi clearly worries?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It might. I mean a lot of people say it would. Most people say it would. I don't know, I really don't know. But I think it's inappropriate, when somebody wins -- The only thing I did wrong was winning an election. By winning an election, I made them so angry. I'll tell you what, winning an election and building a great economy -- and by the way, doing all those things on the pages that I gave you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean it's just -- it's so many different things and nobody ever thought -- even ANWR. So ANWR is among the biggest oil finds in the world, in Alaska. Ronald Reagan tried to get it approved, everybody tried to get it approved. Nobody got it approved. I got it approved. They are starting ANWR shortly. I got ANWR approved.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's as big as Saudi Arabia they say, in Alaska. I got it approved. Nobody else got it approved. Ronald Reagan tried, couldn't do it. Bush tried. Everybody. Presidents, even Democratic presidents tried. They couldn't get it approved. I got it approved. So the only thing I'm guilty of is that I happened to win an election that some people thought I shouldn't have won.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, we're going -- I don't know if anybody's going tomorrow, but I'm going to an event tomorrow where we have 116,000 people?
<Sarah Huckabee-Sanders> <Neutral> I think it's closer to 120 now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> 120,000 people have requested tickets. We have the big Orlando Basketball Arena, with the floor, it holds 25,000 people. It sold out in the first day. It sold out in the first hour. And we have 120,000 people. I went to Texas to help Ted Cruz. We had 106,000 people. We had to take ads asking people not to come.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Tomorrow, what we did is we put big screens up, television screens because the arena is so -- these are big arenas. This is the size of Madison Square Garden. I think it's slightly larger. It's where the Orlando Magic plays. It is packed. We'll have thousands and thousands of people outside. O.K., that's one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now Joe Biden, Sleepy Joe, he goes to a high school gymnasium that holds 300 people. And they can't get 88 people. Or he has 88 people show up. I don't get it. Where's the magic? Where's the magic? So we're going to have 25,000 people tomorrow, we're going to have 120,000 requests for seats. Many of those people, you'll probably have 20, 30,000 people outside the arena.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And Biden goes, he can't fill up 100 seats! So I think we're going to do very well.
<Question> <Negative> Where will you spend most of your time campaigning in the next few months. What states?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, it starts as of tomorrow. But for the first eight or nine months, it'll be very, much more limited. Probably one rally every two, three weeks. And then it will get tighter. And then, you know I did six or seven a day toward the end of the campaign. That was one thing I never -- I went to Michigan, we had 32,000 people that final night, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hillary was there the day of, the day I was there. I actually bled into the Election Day. I started speaking at 1 o'clock in the morning. We had 32,000 people. She got there four hours earlier, which is primetime, she had 500 people show up. And then I said why am I going to lose Michigan? And I didn't. You know?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I didn't. So we have a lot of things going, and I'll tell you one interesting thing you may focus on. The witch hunt has made our base stronger. It's made our people more resilient. And the witch hunt has done a lot of things. It's told -- it's told the story of the dishonesty and a lot of the problems, you know, the swamp.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All of the things that we've talked about. But I think we have more energy than the Democrats do by far. You don't hear that as much. I have never seen energy like I see right now.
<Question> <Positive> Well, traditionally, you have no opponent. The Democrats each have 22. You could reach out some, beyond the base, and maybe get more credit for that economy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That might happen. No. It might happen. But I think my base is so strong, I'm not sure that I have to do that. But I'd like to do it, just as President, I'd like to do it. Not for political reasons. I'd like to do it as President. The Russian hoax that they've put us through has hurt our country, and it's made our country much more divided than it should have been.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I didn't have that situation happen, which is totally -- and by the way, now we've been exonerated by the Mueller Report. Again, these are people that hated Donald Trump. How do you pick all people who are opposed to me? And I still got a great report. Had we not had that, the country would have been much more united than it is. That was a very bad thing for the country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What they did with the phony witch hunt was a very bad thing, and it's bad now, what they're doing. You know, when they try to keep -- They want a do-over. The Mueller Report was a disaster for the Democrats. They want a do-over.
<Question> <Positive> It does sound as if you're wrestling still with it. That it's very much something that you feel is a political liability or that is something that it's  --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I think it's turned out to be an asset because it's really energized our base, like I've never seen before.
<Question> <Positive> We learned a lot of detail about how Russia is trying to make contacts with your campaign --
<Sarah Huckabee-Sanders> <Negative> We're going to have to interrupt here.
<Question> <Positive> We learned a lot of detail about how Russia was trying to make contact with people around you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, but they do with every -- maybe they do. And by the way, I would be surprised if it was only Russia  --
<Question> <Positive> Going forward are you ready to do things to prevent that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know. But I would be surprised if it's not China, and if it's not other countries. I think it's much more  --
<Question> <Negative> So how do we protect against that if we don't learn the lessons of the past?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, we do -- well, we've done things that Obama didn't do. When the FBI went to Obama in September, and they told him about this, he did nothing because he thought Hillary Clinton was going to win, and he didn't want to rock the boat.
<Question> <Neutral> Famously, Dianne Feinstein brought a stack of Time Magazines with Putin on the cover and dropped them on McDonough's desk in October 2016 to say that something was happening and more needed to be done. So you won't  --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Question> <Negative> -- so you won't find disagreement with that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. Good. Thank you. But the truth is, Obama, whatever was going on, Obama knew about it long before I ever heard about it. And he didn't do anything about it. And then his statement to the President of Russia about, "Hey, I'll see Vladimir after the election is over." Look, folks, it's been a very unfair period of time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we've gone through it. And we'll do very well. I think we're going to do very well in the election. I think we're going to have a big success. And if I win it again, I might even make the Time Magazine cover again. Maybe. I doubt it. But maybe. You know.
<Question> <Positive> So you have a good shot this Thursday, for a start.
<Question> <Neutral> We come out on Thursday.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, do you come out on Thursday?
<Question> <Positive> Yeah. [Interview Goes Off-the-Record]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Anyway, thank you all very much.
<Question> <Positive> Thank you.
<Question> <Positive> Thank you, Mr. President.
<Question> <Positive> Thank you very much. Question
<Trish Regan> <Positive> President Trump feeling pretty confident that Republicans will come up big in the midterms. Here's my exclusive interview with the president of the United States. Here we are. That's about three weeks. Actually, three weeks exactly today from midterms.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right.
<Trish Regan> <Neutral> What's your prediction?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well first of all, it's very exciting. Second of all, I think we're going to do really well and I -- I -- look, I want to make predictions. I know that my poll numbers are terrific although if you watch certain cable stations they try and make them look less than they are. But we have great poll numbers we have tremendous turnout at these rallies.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thousands and thousands of people, more than we can hold. In every case. I mean, there's no case where that doesn't happen. There's enthusiasm like we had at the last election 2016, which was quite a spectacular day and evening. I think we have a lot of enthusiasm. You know I keep hearing about the enthusiasm, the blue wave.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think we have tremendous enthusiasm. I think Justice Kavanaugh -- the way he was treated -- He's an outstanding human being, an outstanding man of great accomplishment and the way those Democrat senators treated him was horrible, was horrified by any standard --
<Trish Regan> <Negative> Were you shocked that...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- the leaking, the lying the disgusting things they were saying to them. The -- the false accusations that were made. The third one, this lightweight Avenatti bringing up a person using gangbangs and everything else mean this stuff that was said, and this man didn't even know what they were talking about.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was a disgrace to our country. And I'll tell you what, since that we've been energized anyway, but we're more energized since Justice Kavanaugh, and now he is Justice Kavanaugh, and we're proud of it. He's going to be a great one. And I really think that had an impact. But even before that we had tremendous energy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I think we're going to do well. Now who knows? I mean,
<Trish Regan> <Positive> But a lot of that energy is for you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> History says the opposite.
<Trish Regan> <Positive> Right. Yeah. But a lot of that energy is for you. So when you go and there's tens of thousands of people showing up in one of the stadiums they come to see you. How do you translate that into excitement for the candidates?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I've had people come up to me and say, "Sir, I will never vote in the midterms because you don't like Congress." Actually, I like the Republicans in Congress. They have worked hard. We don't really have a majority. If you look, I mean, we have a majority by a vote. I always joke, if somebody had a cold we no longer have -- they have a cold we don't have a majority anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So. I say, "Go out and vote. We need more Republicans and we will win everything." We're getting the wall. We've already started building it. We're getting everything. But we're lit -- we're no winning on so many different fronts. But we do need more Republicans. So history says, and this is why you asked the question, that whoever is president always seems to lose the midterm but nobody had an economy like we have we have the greatest, nobody reports better than you on that.
<Trish Regan> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have a greatest economy that we've ever had. And numbers just came out today about job openings and everything else. I mean, it's incredible record numbers. So, there's never been a president with this...
<Trish Regan> <Neutral> Now, can I ask you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Trish Regan> <Negative> Because your critics on the left would say, "No, that's just a result of President Obama's policies finally taking a fact." What do you say to that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Years later. If the opposition got into office instead of me they're going to put more rules and regulations in there were going to do things with taxes that would have been a disaster. Raise taxes. They were all going to raise taxes. They we're going to do many other things. So we had 4.2 last month, last quarter.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And everybody said that's impossible because the most you can go is 2 and you know very slowly but it would never be up to that number, we had 4.2. Had the opposition gotten in, you would be at minus 4.2. You would be so low. You would have job numbers that would be so bad, you would have companies leaving this country, which -- they were flowing out of the country and now they're flowing into the country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They we're all wanting to be back in the United States in America. And whenever I hear that I say, "Isn't that sad that they can get away with it." You know, it's the opposition, and they say, "Well, he helped." He didn't even helped. We had the slowest recovery in history, or I guess since the depression, since the Great Depression, and we were heading down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Take a look at the early numbers like the early numbers or the late numbers for him, we were heading down 1% GDP. We were going down and we were going down fast. So when I hear that -- and when professionals hear that they left, even professionals from the other side.
<Trish Regan> <Positive> True.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We opened it up and it's great.
<Trish Regan> <Positive> Well, that's a -- look, the economic accomplishments are significant.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Trish Regan> <Positive> And that a lot to be proud of and I think people are feeling better about things. That said, there's a lot of division right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Trish Regan> <Negative> And you now have people on the left. Almost calling for more of it. I mean, Hillary Clinton saying that that, "We can't be civil." The left cannot be civil right now until we take back effectively the government. Now, fairly or unfairly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Trish Regan> <Positive> You as the president of the United States have a lot of responsibility in terms of trying to restore that civility.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true. That's true.
<Trish Regan> <Neutral> How do you do it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, it's got a big setback with Justice Kavanaugh. No. 1 at Yale, No. 1 at Yale Law School. You know, just like this person. And when you heard the horrible things said you had to become somewhat aggressive, let's say. But Hillary is a very dishonest person. If you look at the things she says, I mean, they're so dishonest.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And she was dishonest during the entire campaign, whether it was 33,000 emails that were deleted, that so far nothing has happened with, which is very disappointing from the standpoint of this Justice Department. Very, very disappointing, I will tell you. But you look at all of the tremendous dishonesty that it's got to be cleared up. We're going to get along.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think the economy is going to clear a lot of things up when people are really getting the jobs they want. But we have a tremendous powerful base, the Republican Party. And they have to know that going out for the midterms is very important. It's almost like going out for the 2020 election that's coming up in the not too distant future.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Isn't that incredible that we're already talking about that?
<Trish Regan> <Negative> And I want to get to that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But this tremendous enthusiasm for that, tremendous. And I really think, again, this tremendous enthusiasm for the midterms. We'll see, we'll see. If the enthusiasm is there, which it should be. It really should be because they'll take away your tax cuts, they'll put rules, regulations, you'll start losing jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're going to --You would -- This would be a terrible thing for the country if that happened. But we'll see what happens. I think we're going to do very well.
<Trish Regan> <Positive> And the economy could restore civility.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I really think the economy is going to bring people together because people are doing better now. African-American unemployment, the best ever. Asian-American. Hispanic- American. Women. Everything. Every category. I mean, whether you look at median income, whether you look at employment or unemployment, no matter what chart you're looking at. It's either ever or 50 or 60 years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The best. The best numbers. It's probably the best economy we've ever had.
<Trish Regan> <Positive> So you mentioned women. Let me asked about that. Because women -- you know, a lot of women are effectively the CFOs, right, of their family. They're paying the bills --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<Trish Regan> <Positive> -- and they're keeping the trains running on time with the family and they want financial prosperity, they want security.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Trish Regan> <Neutral> Things that you're offering.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's what I'm about.
<Trish Regan> <Negative> If you look at the poll numbers they're not. They're not liking you. So how do you overcome them right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well number one, I had worst poll numbers when I went into the last election and you saw how well I did with women. I mean, if you looked at my poll numbers going into 2016 you would have said there is not a woman in the country that's going to vote for me. And I did phenomenal with women. I did, in fact, that was one of the reasons probably the reason I won in a true sense.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now I also did better with Hispanics than they predicted. I did better with African-Americans than they predicted. I guess they did better with the men stay with me. I don't know why. But with the women -- with the women, they want security and they want financial security too. Look at 401(k)s. So let's say we have a really bad time in three weeks from now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Your 401(k) is going to go down tremendously. People are going to lose wealth. If they don't go out and vote then they have themselves to blame because they'll lose wealth tremendous amount. I've built up $11.7 trillion dollars in wealth. You report on it. And if you look at China by the way they're down about $25 trillion dollars in the last five, six months since I started going into what I have to do, which is straightening out the unfair balances.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That is very unfair.
<Trish Regan> <Neutral> What thing came there with China?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> To make a deal. [Inaudible]
<Trish Regan> <Positive> What would that deal be? I mean, would it look like we won?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right now I've put tariffs on $250 billion worth of products, right. Nobody's feeling that. There's no inflation or anything in this country. Everyone would say, "Oh, there's [Inaudible]. But there's no -- I mean, the inflation's very low.
<Trish Regan> <Negative> Jerome Powell might think a little [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no. My biggest threat is the Fed because the Fed is raising rates too fast and it's independent so I don't speak to them but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going to fast because you looked at the last inflation numbers are very low
<Trish Regan> <Neutral> But you put them there. I mean, you think about Janet Yellen and she was so dovish.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I did. I'm not -- you know what, can I be honest? Can I be honest?
<Trish Regan> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm not blaming anybody. I put them there and maybe it's right, maybe it's wrong but I think --
<Trish Regan> <Negative> What if he gets it wrong?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I put -- so a couple of other people there that I'm not so happy with too.
<Trish Regan> <Negative> If he gets it wrong?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But for the most part I'm very happy with people. Excuse me?
<Trish Regan> <Negative> Well, if he gets it wrong and he misses meetings
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, he's being extremely conservative, let me use a nice term. He's being extremely conservative. The problem is I want -- we are just having record numbers. You know, when they try and compare what I'm doing with Obama. Obama was working on zero interest rates. I'm working off real interest rates, almost normalized interest rates, that's a big difference and my numbers are much better.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you take a look, you can't compare zero. Give me zero interest rates right now and you take a look at our numbers would be the greatest economy in the history of the world. Nobody would be able to compete with it. We're paying a lot of interest and I think we're paying too much, to be honest with you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But still it was so strong. And he's doing it because the economy is so good because the economy is so strong. So we'll see how that all works out. I'm not happy but...
<Trish Regan> <Negative> But if he gets it wrong would he be out of a job. I mean, if he starts hiking rates at the time we don't really have inflation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, No. 1, I don't want for another four years, five years, so look, I am not happy with what he's doing, I will tell you that because inflation -- and I fully get the whole thing, the Federal Reserve I get it, as well as any president who's ever been here. I get it really well but right now that inflation's not here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If we start to see it then you start to go and you do what he's doing. But in the meantime, I'd like to pay off debt. I'd like to do other things --
<Trish Regan> <Neutral> We've got a lot of it. We've got a lot of it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> and pay interest. We do and we're going to start reducing costs now that we took care of our military. We had to take care of our military. But we're going to start you'll see that very soon. We're going to start reducing cost. We have such fat in the government but I wanted to take care of our military.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have to understand that Democrats have programs that are a total waste of money. But in order to get the military $700 billion and $716 billion, I had to do it because President Obama starved the military. He didn't give them raises, he didn't give them anything. I gave them a 10% pay increase, they haven't had it in a decade.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We gave them an increase. That's a big thing. I had to do it. Not that anybody's wanting to although I did because I loved the military. Law enforcement, the military, I gave them a raise. But I'm also building brand new planes all made in America. I'm building brand new ships. We're building missiles and rockets and we're fixing our nuclear and we're going to be in tip-top shape in order to get $700 billion and $716 billion, two years, I had to give the Democrats some stuff that I would never give to anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So they've been -- they're very negative on the military and they're very negative on law enforcement and the border. And I don't see how they win elections that way.
<Trish Regan> <Negative> Breaking tonight: President Trump speaking with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, who denies all knowledge of how or why Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi was killed. This phone call happening after my sit down with the president. Now earlier today I had asked the president what he plans to do about this atrocity.
<Trish Regan> <Positive> So now, part two of my exclusive sit down with the president of the United States. Watch.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Turkey and Saudi Arabia are looking very strongly. And it depends whether or not the king or the crown prince knew about it, in my opinion. No. 1, what happened but whether or not they knew about it. If they knew about it that would be bad. If they didn't know about it things -- bad things can happen. You look at what they're doing in Iran.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don't forget, Saudi Arabia is our partner, they're our ally against Iran and against missiles and against what they are doing trying to take over the Middle East. And by the way, since I'm here, not succeeding. They're heading down the tubes, if you look at what's going on. So Saudi Arabia and they have -- I can only say, I've been here for almost two years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They've been a great ally to me, to me. They're investing tremendous amounts of money, they're fighting terror. Now, with all of that being said you can't do what we've been reading about but we're going to learn -- we're going to learn a lot about it. Now, one thing I have to say because you could visit so well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They made the largest order in the history of a country for outside -- outside of our country for -- for weapons for any kinds of military weapons missile systems, ships, they're buying.
<Trish Regan> <Neutral> From us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> From us. $110 billion dollars in purchasing. It's 500,000 jobs, American jobs. Everything's made here. Okay. So now people say, "Well, we want to have you and that order." Well, aren't we just hurting our own country. Because here's what's going to happen, they're going to say, "Hey, America won't sell us the missiles we'll buy them from China or buy it from Russia." Ours are better.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Much better. They'll say, "America won't sell us the ships. America won't sell us the arms that we need." What we'll do is we'll buy them from Russia, China and some others, France, you know, there's some others.
<Trish Regan> <Positive> And so they benefit financially and they might then have a more strategic relationship too with these countries.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have senators and congressmen say, "Oh, if they did that we should punish them by not selling them equipment." Well, if we don't sell the equipment they'll buy a lesser quality equipment because we make such -- it's so much better than anybody else but they'll buy it from Russia to buy it from China. So we're not really hurting them, we're hurting ourselves.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we want to be smart. I don't want to give up a $110 billion order or whatever it is. It's the largest order ever given by an outside country. Okay. And I don't want to give that up. You're talking about jobs. What I'm doing -- we've created an incredible economy. I want Boeing and I want Lockheed and I want Raytheon to take those orders and to hire lots of people to make that incredible equipment.
<Trish Regan> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do you understand? It's a dilemma.
<Trish Regan> <Negative> Yeah. No. I get it but it's complicated stuff. And you know, you're looking at jobs here at home and a lot of money for American companies versus what certainly seems as pretty atrocious. Now we don't know everything but these are -- these are the decisions that you face says president.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let's hope -- let's hope we hear the proper answers.
<Trish Regan> <Neutral> You mentioned Jeff Sessions earlier.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Trish Regan> <Negative> We haven't heard a tremendous amount about the Mueller investigation recently. I imagine we're going to hear more after midterms.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, let me just say, first of all there was no collusion, there was no Russia. Do you think I'd call Russia, I need help in Idaho, I need help in Iowa. Oh, let's call Russia it's a it's a con job. Just like some of the other con jobs that you've been saying, it's a total con job. It's a disgrace that they were allowed to do it. This was the Democrats losing the Electoral College, which they should have won easily.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't run the whole east coast. They lost and they come up with this excuse, "We lost because of -- let's see, Russia, yeah, Russia." I didn't make one call to -- the whole thing is so disgraceful. So it continues, it's a witch hunt. It's nothing more than a witch hunt. And most people get it including Democrats.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They wink at me they look at me they wink at me. The Democrats get it too. But we'll see what happens. If this continues onward and Jeff Sessions should have never let it happen. He should have never recused himself. I mean, he's a man recused himself. Why wouldn't he said I'm going to recuse myself, I wouldn't put him in that position.
<Trish Regan> <Neutral> But he's in a position now, is he going to stay in the position?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not going to tell you that. We'll see what happens. But I think it was a disgrace. And by the way, my enemies people that are on the other side say for him to have taken the job and for him to immediately have recused himself is a disgrace. They say, "Trump is right about that."
<Trish Regan> <Negative> Yeah. Do you think that in some ways Vladimir Putin is kind of getting what he may have wanted? And I say this because it almost didn't matter to the Russians who won but it certainly mattered in that they wanted to create this -- this division because it's harder as a country, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The answer is yes because our Justice Department and FBI played right into the hands with this stupid investigation or whatever you call it. People said I'm not under investigation. You know I'm not a target of this investigation, which nobody ever likes to say but put it -- it played right into their hands because if they want to sow -- they use the words sow chaos, sow chaos, they've got it for nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They didn't do anything, they got it for nothing. We did it to ourselves, the chaos. The stupid cast. Now, it hasn't been talked about for a long time because people don't believe it. Who's going to believe that I called Russia to give me help and everyone does say, Richard Burr, the other day, they asked him, he's the head of the Senate Intelligence.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they asked him, "Did you see collusion?" "No. I see no collusion." He just said that, you know, he -- he haven't -- they haven't issued their final report but he said there was no collusion. The -- as you know the House, Devin Nunes, they came out with the ruling. There was no collusion but Richard Burr, they asked him the other day during actually the floods in North Carolina, South Carolina they said, "What about this committee?" He said, "We have found no collusion." You know why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because there is no collusion.
<Trish Regan> <Negative> So collusion aside, I mean, the concern is that Putin and his folks over there and Russia and maybe the Chinese are trying to do the same thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think they're laughing at us.
<Trish Regan> <Negative> Are trying to tweak us, right? And they -- they kind of like this division but --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because these people, not me, these people are played right into the hands. Assuming, you know, I keep hearing they like to sow chaos so a word from Old English. They sow chaos.
<Trish Regan> <Positive> Now we got something of that right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now we put it. I mean, it's ridiculous. I believe that they laugh at it. Yeah, we played right into their hands.
<Trish Regan> <Neutral> Let me ask.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> With that being said, nobody has been tougher on Russia. No president. At least, certainly, in the sem-modern era has been tougher than I am. I gave weapons to Ukraine, Obama gave them pillows, he gave them those, that's what he actually gave them, pillows, he wouldn't give them any weapons. And the one that brought up the scam of the pipeline, where Germany is paying them billions and billions of dollars for natural gas.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have -- nobody even knew about it. I mean, they knew about it but nobody talked about. I made it a big issue.
<Trish Regan> <Negative> So your policies been tough. But...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look at my policies on energy.
<Trish Regan> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She wanted to put windmills all over the place, which don't work. I'm opening up our country to natural gas and oil and to the kind of things [Inaudible] --
<Trish Regan> <Neutral> So I got to ask you. I got to ask you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> and that's competition for Russia.
<Trish Regan> <Negative> Helsinki. You know, you've got a lot of criticisms --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was a great meeting.
<Trish Regan> <Positive> -- including from me. Full disclosure, you know what, I wondered why you weren't tougher on Putin but you've said you had a great meeting you met with him one on one. What happened there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Trish, if I was tough, it's easy for me. It's easier for me to tough. We had a great meeting with him before that, we had a two-hour meeting and then we had another meeting, I guess, with a lot of people and they were great meetings. That was very tough but they were great meetings.
<Trish Regan> <Neutral> But why were they great?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let me explain. Then we had a press conference. So when I was very tough with North Korea, with Kim Jong-un, everyone's saying, "Oh, he's going to cause nuclear war." Well, we're doing great with North Korea. Okay. As you understand we're doing great. No missiles fired, we got back our hostages, everything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Everything. We're doing great. Everybody's saying, "He's too tough on North Korea. He's too tough he's going to cause nuclear warfare." Okay. Look. Look what it turned out. With Putin, they want me to go up and have a boxing match with them onstage. I was nice to him. I was nice to him. But what happened is when I walked off the stage everyone said, "Oh, that was great." We're on the plane all of a sudden the fake news start saying, "Oh, Trump was tough enough." And let me tell you, if I was too tough, let's say Trump was too tough.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I could have a very good relationship with Russia having a good relationship with Russia would be a good thing not a bad thing.
<Trish Regan> <Neutral> Did you tell him in that meeting?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This stupid investigation hurts us from having a good relationship. Don't forget, we're a great nuclear power but so are they. And having a good relationship is not a bad thing.
<Trish Regan> <Negative> Did the tell him in the meaning he's got to knock it off?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I told him. Let me just tell you what I told. We talked about Israel. We talked about meddling, I said no more meddling, if you did meddle. I said no more meddling. To which he says," I didn't meddle, I didn't meddle." I said no more meddling. You know, Obama said knock it off and yet Obama is talking to his second in charge and he's saying, "Tell Vladimir I'll talk to him after the election." I mean, look, in terms of meddling, Obama was told in September, just prior to the election, that Russia was trying to meddle in the election.
<Trish Regan> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He didn't do anything about it he didn't even say anything about it. He only brings it up after the election. That should be your investigation. Why didn't he do something about it. Here's the good news it didn't affect one vote but Obama was to -- and everybody agrees to that, but Obama was told before the election in September by the FBI about Russia and possible Russian meddling.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what he did? Nothing. You know why? Because he thought Hillary Clinton was going to win and he didn't want to do anything to upset that. And just to finish. The last thing that Putin wants now, I can tell you, is Trump. He'd much rather have Clinton, although I hope...
<Trish Regan> <Positive> China doesn't want you either, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me?
<Trish Regan> <Positive> China doesn't want you either?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I don't think that China is too happy with me because we are winning with China for the first time. A man named Pillsbury, an expert.
<Trish Regan> <Negative> I know, Michael Pillsbury.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I saw him, I think, on your show actually. He said that China for the first time he's never seen anything like it, were doing so well. And he said much more than that but I'd say it you'll say I'm bragging, I don't want to do that. But we're doing great against China. We're doing great against Russia.
<Trish Regan> <Negative> We're going to make certain that none of them interfere, right? That they're not interfering in midterms, they are not interfering in 2020.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Of course. I've done more -- excuse me, I've done more having to do with the new election -- the election coming up than Obama ever did on 2016, ever.
<Trish Regan> <Positive> That's good.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't really keep anything but ask Obama why didn't he do something when the FBI told him about it because he thought Hillary Clinton was going to win.
<Trish Regan> <Positive> Okay. Quick question. 2020.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Trish Regan> <Neutral> You're running?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. 100%.
<Trish Regan> <Negative> Michael Bloomberg might be running.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's good.
<Trish Regan> <Neutral> Yeah?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Sure. I think it'd be easy. I think it'd be so easy --
<Trish Regan> <Neutral> How do you think you do...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- I don't think he'll get -- Well, I don't think he'll get through the Democrats.
<Trish Regan> <Negative> I know he wouldn't be able to do anything in the primaries because of where the party's going?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think -- I think the Democrats will eat him up. You know, you have a lot of people running you have been hearing names that are shockingly bad but they're nasty.
<Trish Regan> <Neutral> Avenatti?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that -- Oh, I don't think he's a serious person. He's not I don't think Avenatti, the lawyer? I don't think he's -- I just beat him in a big case. I just --
<Trish Regan> <Negative> By the way, you're going to have her pay the legal fees?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In fact, he has to pay me legal fees.
<Trish Regan> <Neutral> She does? She does?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think he has any money. But he and she have to pay me a lot of legal fees --
<Trish Regan> <Negative> Are you going to hold them accountable for that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- and it's based on Texas, based on Texas, you know, I love Texas, based on Texas law where the legal fees are nice and plentiful.
<Trish Regan> <Negative> And you'll hold them to that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Are you are you serious? Of course.
<Trish Regan> <Positive> I'm just asking. Will you be disappointed if I say they'll pay a lot. But no he's not a serious person. The -- Mike Bloomberg is -- but I don't think he'll do well. He may -- he may do it or he may not. But I don't think he'll do well. I think that I would know who -- I have a pretty good idea who it is. I'm not going to tell you but I have a pretty good idea who I think will emerge as a group.
<Trish Regan> <Negative> Well that's a tease.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. A little bit.
<Trish Regan> <Neutral> Come on. Give me a hint
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We'll have other conversations.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Let's talk to Donald Trump about all this. He is on the phone with us now. Mr. Trump, good morning to you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> I want to talk about foreign policy in a second, but let start with pure politics. Ted Cruz says Carly Fiorina is his running mate if he gets the nomination. It gets headlines. Also might get him some support with women voters. You, on the other hand, seem to continue to say things that alienate women voters. On Tuesday night, you said Hillary Clinton is still playing the women card, or the woman card, and that if she were a man, she would only have five percent of the vote. Seventy percent of women in this country say they have a negative view of you. Do you even care?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Of course I care. Nobody respects women more than I do. And I wasn't playing the woman's card. It's true. I mean, she is playing the woman's card. She said -- everything she says is about the woman's card. And frankly, all I'm doing is bringing out the obvious. And without the woman's card Hillary wouldn't even be a viable person to even run for a city council position.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> But are you saying that women in this country vote based simply on gender?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't think they vote on gender, no.  I think they vote for security, I think they vote for jobs.  And that's why I'm doing so well, that's why I'm leading the Republicans by a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And that's why, in all of the elections that I won on Tuesday night, which is five states.  And then, I won, of course, New York the week before.  And you know, I'm winning them one after another now, and building up tremendous numbers and tremendous numbers of delegates, and millions and millions of voters.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In all of those exit polls, I led with women and I led with women by tremendous margins over all other candidates.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Negative> But Mr. Trump, I mean, for you to say that if she were not a woman, she would be getting 5 percent suggests the only thing she has going for her is that she was a woman, not that she was a former senator, a former secretary of state and lawyer. Do you understand why some people find that to be kind of a demeaning comment?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I find it to be a true comment. I think the only thing she has got going is the fact that she's a woman. She has done a terrible job in so many different ways. You look at Libya. You look at some of the things that she has done that are just absolutely disastrous. No, I would say the primary thing that she has going is that she's a woman. And she's playing that card like I've not seen anybody play it before.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Let me ask you about your foreign policy speech yesterday, Mr. Trump. I think what was very interesting was what was not in the speech. You didn't talk about the wall with Mexico. You didn't talk about deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants. You didn't talk about restoring torture. You didn't talk about possibly allowing Japan, or South Korea or Saudi Arabia to have nuclear weapons. Are you backing off some of the key tenets of your campaign during the primary season?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, not at all.  And I put the wall, and I've put all of that in a little bit of a different -- when I'm talking about immigration, I'll be doing a big speech on immigration very shortly, but I'm talking about that and more in the form of immigration, the wall, undocumented immigrants being -- having to be brought out of the country.  And we will do that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It has never been a worse situation than we have right now.  You look at the crime.  You look at the tremendous impact they have on our country economically.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at what's poring across the border. But I consider that really immigration as opposed to foreign policy. So...
<Savannah Guthrie> <Neutral> But...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I'm going to be doing -- I'm going to be doing a -- a policy speech on immigration fairly soon.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Negative> Let's talk about ISIS. You said in your speech yesterday that they will be gone very quickly in a Trump administration. So, can you be more specific? Are you envisioning a massive ground troop presence in Syria and Iraq to get rid of ISIS? It seems that would be necessary if you want to get rid of them quickly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, one of the tenets of my speech yesterday -- and it has gotten great reviews, as you know, from many, many people, one of the tenets was unpredictability. We want to be unpredictable.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Neutral> Yeah, but people are casting votes. And so, they should know whether or not a vote for you means a massive military presence in the Middle East.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But Savannah, if I get elected president, I don't want ISIS to know what I'm going to be doing. I don't like the idea.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Neutral> What about the American voters?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know what? Psychologically, we need to -- and as a country, we need to -- when President Obama announced we're sending 250 soldiers, when he announced previous to that, we're sending 50 soldiers, and then he announces it to the world, they have a target on their back.  He shouldn't be announcing that.  He shouldn't be talking about what he's doing militarily.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The enemy is watching every move we say, everything we do militarily, we announce what we're doing and they prepare for it.  And I don't want that.  And one of the big tenets of my speech yesterday was the fact that I said -- and very, very strongly, is we need unpredictability.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to be somewhat unpredictable. We're so totally predictable, Matt.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Yeah, but Mr. Trump, just -- some American voters -- some American voters might be a little bit nervous that this call for unpredictability is actually a way of masking an understanding of the issues or a grasp of the details.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I will give you -- I have a total grasp of the details, far greater than just about anybody else. That, I can tell you. When I said take the oil, and I've been saying it for a long time -- I didn't want to tell that. But yourselves and everybody else was saying, Tell us what it is. Tell us what it is. And after three months, I said, Take the oil." Now Now, they have fortified oil reserves and they've prepared. And we'll still take the oil, and we should be taking the oil and we're not.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Positive> But real -- real quickly, Mr. Trump, would you rule out the use of nuclear weapons in the fight against ISIS?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to rule out anything. I will be the last to use nuclear weapons. It's a horror to use nuclear weapons. The power of weaponry today is the single greatest problem that our world has. And it's not global warming, like our president said. It's the power of weapons, in particular nuclear. I will be the last to use it. I will not be a happy trigger, like some people might be. I will be the last. But I will never, ever rule it out.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Positive> All right.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Donald Trump.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Positive> Thank you very much. Got to leave it there. Appreciate it.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Thanks for joining us this morning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Posing as John Miller] How are you?
<Sue Carswell> <Positive> Good.  How are you?  What's your name again?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> John Miller. [This is Donald Trump]
<Sue Carswell> <Negative> And you work with [indiscernible]?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, that's correct.
<Sue Carswell> <Neutral> John Miller.  Can you sort of -- I guess we're going to try and put a story together and we have a deadline of today because our magazine closed, well, basically yesterday but we'll probably get something together Ð you know, it's been on the cover both here and the Post.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, I saw that.
<Sue Carswell> <Positive> What kind of comment is coming from, you know, your agency or from Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it just that he really decided that he wasn't, you know, he didn't want to make any commitment.  He didn't want to make a commitment.  He really thought it was too soon.  He's coming out of a marriage, and he's starting to do tremendously well financially.  As you saw, he got his licenses five to nothing the other day and totally unanimous.  And he's really been working hard and doing well.  And probably, as you know, there's a real estate depression in the United States and he's probably doing as well as anybody there is.  And frankly, he wants to keep it that way.  And he just thought it was too soon to make any commitment to anybody.
<Sue Carswell> <Negative> So what is going to happen when -- is she being asked to leave or is she going to be allowed to stay?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he treats everybody well.  You know, you don't know him, but he's a --
<Sue Carswell> <Negative> No, I have met him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Have you met him?  He's a good guy and he's not going to hurt anybody.  The one article said he was going to throw her out of the apartment is total nonsense.  He is going to always treat her well as he treated his wife well.  I mean, he paid his wife a great deal of money.  He did it in a very bad period of time and, ultimately, that was settled.  There were those that say that that was even put that way.  I don't know if you heard that but that Trump became poor until he got his divorce.  And then all of a sudden, he's been doing very well and I guess you probably heard that, too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But he treated his wife well and he treated -- and he will treat Marla well.  He's somebody that has a lot of options, and, frankly, he gets called by everybody. He gets called by everybody in the book, in terms of women.
<Sue Carswell> <Neutral> Like who?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he gets called by a lot of people.
<Sue Carswell> <Positive> Yeah.  Well, what about --  this Carla Bruni, I mean, how important is she right now?  Is she [cross-talking]?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's somebody that -- you know, she's beautiful.  I saw her once quickly and she's beautiful and all, but I think that he's got a whole open field really.  A lot of the people that you write about, and you people do a great job, by the way, but a lot of the people that you write about really are -- I mean, they call.  They just call.  Actresses, people that you write about just call to see if they can go out with him and things.
<Sue Carswell> <Negative> You can't say, like, did Madonna ever really call?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was so set up with that.  You know, Madonna called and what happened -- I mean, I don't know if you want to listen to this.
<Sue Carswell> <Negative> No, I do.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do you?  Do you have a second?
<Sue Carswell> <Neutral> Yeah, obviously.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What happened is it was a benefit at the Plaza Hotel which he owned for Vreeland, Diana Vrelland, or no, for Martha Graham.  It was a ball benefit for Martha actually just before she passed away.  And Madonna was there and she came in a beautiful evening gown and combat boots.  She was wearing combat boots, and Trump was asked to go over to meet her.  And he was there just for a little while to say hello and to make a speech and make like an introductory speech.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Madonna was in the room, and so somebody from Madonna's entourage, because she comes in with an entourage of dancers and everything else, and somebody from Madonna's entourage came over and said, "Would you go over and say hello to Madonna?" And so he went over and said hello to Madonna and he gave his autograph to the dancers.  She said, "These are fans" and all this.  "Will you give them the autograph?"  So he said, "Best wishes" or something.  And then all of a sudden -- and that was the end.  And then he said goodbye to her and that was literally the end.  He's got zero interest in Madonna.  It was literally the end.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the next day in the newspapers, they had a story that he wanted to go out with her and everything else.  Besides that, that she was sitting there with her boyfriend.  I think his name was Ward or something --
<Sue Carswell> <Neutral> Yeah, Tony Ward.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- and she was sitting there right with her boyfriend.  So, I mean, it wouldn't be appropriate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Then the next day, there was a story that Trump went to [inaudible] and Madonna was supposedly at [inaudible], and that was another total nonsense.  So, somehow, there was a thing.  And then she called recently about this fight and wanted to go out.  You know, she's got this PR machine that I guess you people play to very well but it really was nonsense.  So, anyway.
<Sue Carswell> <Negative> I don't think we ever reported that about Madonna and Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she called and wanted to go out with him, that I can tell you.  And one of the other people that you're writing about -- by the way, I'm sort of new here.
<Sue Carswell> <Neutral> What is your position there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm sort of handling PR because he gets so much of it.  And frankly, I mean, I could tell you off the record.  Until I get to know you, off the record, I can tell you that he didn't care if he got bad PR until he got his divorce finished.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So when he got a lot of bad financial stuff, he liked it because, you know, it was good because he could get a divorce finished.  And once his divorce is finished, if you noticed since then he's doing well financially and he's doing well in every other way.  The licensing was five to nothing.  And people are saying how come all of a sudden he's doing so well?  And then I guess Newsday about two weeks ago did a story on that.  So I've sort of been put in here to handle because I've never seen anybody get so many calls from the press.
<Sue Carswell> <Negative> Where did you come from?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I basically worked for different firms.  I worked for a couple of different firms, and I'm somebody that he knows and I think somebody that he trusts and likes.  So I'm going to do this a little part time, and then, yeah, go on with my life, too.
<Sue Carswell> <Negative> Is he trying to -- I mean, is Marla trying to reconcile all this or is this --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Marla wants to be back with him and he wants to be with her, but he just, he just feels it's too soon.
<Sue Carswell> <Negative> What about the ring?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it was never an engagement ring, because that was my first question.  It was never an engagement ring.  It was a ring -- I mean, he wouldn't buy the engagement ring.  Actually, he bought the ring at the Taj Mahal at Tiffany's.  The only place that Tiffany's has that, you know, in a hotel is because of his relationship with Tiffany being the neighbor next door to Trump Tower and Tiffany decided to open up a store at the Taj Mahal.  And this was a way of giving Tiffany some business in addition to getting Ivan -- geting Marla something that would be nice.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So he did that, and as I told him and other people told him, when you want to buy a present, don't make it a ring the next time.  It was a little confusing.
<Sue Carswell> <Neutral> Make it a chain.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Make it anything.  Anything but a ring, I guess.
<Sue Carswell> <Negative> Do you think there's any fear that Marla will spill everything at all or -- ?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It doesn't matter to him.  He truly doesn't care.  I've never seen somebody that's so immune, that he gets immune to, you know, some people would say you got bad press three or four months ago.  Now, he's starting to get good press where I don't know what you call this but this is a big press.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I've never seen somebody so immune to -- he actually thrived on the bad press initially.  And once the divorce was over, he said, "We have to change this" and it's very interesting.  Frankly, if he got good press during the divorce, he'd be in court right now because she settled because she thought that she better believe the press and she settled.  And now, he's doing great and now she would like not to settle.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Ivana, when she didn't settle, she made a huge mistake and she's now had a huge fight with her lawyer, Michael Kennedy, over why they made the settlement. And it's over.  He sort of laughs at everything.
<Sue Carswell> <Negative> How does Donald feel about Ivana's [indiscernible] with Barbara Walters?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it was a total violation of -- I mean, I could tell you --
<Sue Carswell> <Neutral> Yeah.  But then, that was -- I mean, did the judge, Phyllis What's-Her-Name?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Gangel-Jacob, yeah, but that's going to be -- the judge felt that when Donald got Ivana to sign that agreement, that Donald got Ivana to void her rights and that the judge was wrong because there's so much case law on that.  And what happened is the judge said -- by the way, she can take that clause out.  She just said she's not going to hold Ivana in contempt.  In other words, if somebody -- if she violates and she's not going to put Ivana in jail for violating.  Okay?  So she didn't void that clause.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, Donald's got a decision as to whether or not he wants to pay her any more money because by violating that clause, he in theory doesn't have to pay her any money.
<Sue Carswell> <Neutral> Being the good guy that he's trying to be -- I mean --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not sure what he's going to do.  Again, you could say that she shouldn't have done that either.  I mean, you sign an agreement, you go through months and months, and she can't say she didn't know this one.  And what he did was smart because he got not only Ivana to sign the agreement, but he got Ivana's lawyers to sign the agreement that she'd do it, that she speaks English perfectly, that everything in the agreement is known and studied and everything else.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, in theory, I think he could probably -- you know, I think that could have cost her many millions of dollars.  I don't know that he's going to enforce it or not.
<Sue Carswell> <Negative> What about that whole thing that was brought up in the news whether Marla wouldn't sign any sort of prenuptial?  Did that have anything to do with the ending of the relationship?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no.
<Sue Carswell> <Negative> Was that true?  I mean, was he trying to get her to sign anything?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I can tell you this.  Just off the record, there's no way he gets married without a prenuptial agreement.  You understand that.  It was painful but worked in the Ivana case because, you know, while it was challenged, it still ended up being upheld and worked.  And frankly, she got not exactly one penny, she didn't get one penny more than what the agreement called for.  So that's that.  And she spent a lot of money on lawyers and a lot of money on everything and that was the year of the circus, but they do stand up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can tell you there was never any talk of marriage from Donald's point of view.  I can also say that Marla would've liked to get married, obviously, but it was just something he didn't want to do.  It's just too soon.  And, you know, hopefully, he'll maintain a good relationship with Marla.  [Indiscernible] but it's just too soon.
<Sue Carswell> <Neutral> What about this Ivana thing?  It says in the Newsday Trump also told friends that when he and Ivana met last week, she indicated that she would be interested in reconciliation?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Ivana wants to get back with Donald, but she --
<Sue Carswell> <Negative> Really? After saying on Barbara Walters that she never would?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What is she going to say?  What is she going to say?  She's going to say when he's with somebody else and had other people lined up, is she going to say, "Yes, I want to get back.  I want to get back."  You know, she's a pretty savvy woman and she's not going to say -- I mean, he's living with Marla and he's got three other girlfriends, and then, and she's not going to say, I really want to get back, you know?  She wants to get back, she's told it to a lot of her friends and she's told it to him, but it's so highly unlikely.  That's off the record.  He left.  I mean, it was his choice to leave and he left.
<Sue Carswell> <Neutral> He left for Marla.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, he didn't leave, no.  See, that's the biggest misconception of this whole thing.  The second question I asked about after the ring was the biggest misconception is he left.  He didn't leave for Marla.  He really left for himself.  He didn't leave for Marla.  He never left for Marla.  He was going to leave anyway.  Marla was there, but he was going to leave anyway.  Whether there was a Marla or not he was going to leave anyway.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So now he has somebody else named Carla who is beautiful and I guess you have something on her.  I don't know if you do or not.
<Sue Carswell> <Negative> No, they won't talk about her.  He didn't say anything about her.  I mean, she's a daughter of who --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, she's a very successful model, etc., etc.  But again, he didn't leave Marla for her.  He just wants [indiscernible], he does things for himself. He leaves for himself, he does things for himself.  He, when he makes the decision, that will be a very lucky woman.  But he's not going to do that until he makes the decision.  You know, when he makes the decision, he's very capable of a total commitment when he makes the decision.  But he felt it's too soon.  Off the record, he probably felt Marla wasn't the right one, or whatever, but he just felt it was too soon.
<Sue Carswell> <Neutral> How did he meet Carla?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> At the Plaza Hotel, she was doing a Carolina Herrera fashion show.
<Sue Carswell> <Neutral> Was Ivana there, do you think? Does she go to fashion shows?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well she goes to them, but less so since, you know, since --
<Sue Carswell> <Negative> When did he meet Carla there?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Probably a few months ago.
<Sue Carswell> <Negative> Uh-huh.  Have they been able to see each other?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, not really.  And again, I heard with Carla -- I mean, I'll give you -- this is getting to be -- this is a little different from what I normally discuss.  This is I think an interesting point.  Carla is a very beautiful girl from Italy whose father is one of the wealthiest men in Europe.
<Sue Carswell> <Neutral> Who is he? What's the name of her father?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Her father's name is -- her name is Carla Bruni Tedeschi.
<Sue Carswell> <Neutral> How do you spell that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know.  She doesn't use the last name because it's too complicated, you know [indiscernible].  But anyway, but her father is one of the wealthiest men in Europe.  Carla is extraordinarily beautiful and didn't want to be a model except that every time she'd go to a show, [indiscernible] to look, Ralph Lauren and various people would say, Carla, you have to be on the show, etc., etc.  So she does all of the top shows and she's always very busy and very successful, etc., etc.  She was having a big thing with Mick Jagger.  Did you hear about this?
<Sue Carswell> <Positive> Well, I've just been reading about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What happened is she was going with Eric Clapton.
<Sue Carswell> <Neutral> Mick Jagger, who was married at that point?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Mick Jagger, as of three months ago she was having a big thing.  [indiscernible] What she - Just doesn't want to be in the limelight. What she was having a very big thing with Mick Jagger.  And then what happened, she was going with Eric Clapton, and Eric Clapton introduced her to Mick Jagger, and then Mick Jagger started calling her, and she ended up going with Mick Jagger.  And then she dropped Mick Jagger for Donald, and that's where it is right now.  And again, he's not making any commitments to Carla either just so you understand.
<Sue Carswell> <Negative> What kinds of things have they done?  I mean, do they go out? [Indiscernible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they just get along very good and she's very pretty and all of that stuff.  But, you know, he doesn't have any idea who she is, right?  When he meets the right woman, it's going to be a great relationship and it's going to be a very, you know, because he believes strongly in the marriage concept.  In all fairness, he was married for 12 years and he was happily married for 12, you know, for many of those years, I guess, and he believes in it, especially in this society today, I can tell you.  But he believes in it.
<Sue Carswell> <Negative> Where is he living now?  I mean is he --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He lives in Trump Tower.  He has the apartment at the top of Trump Tower.
<Sue Carswell> <Positive> Okay.  And Ivana also has an apartment at Trump Tower?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She has an apartment at Trump Tower, but the court order is that she has to leave within a period of less than a year.
