<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> When you become president will you make the Pledge of Allegiance, will you reinstate it, the words "one nation under God" so everyone says the Pledge the way we used to when we were in school?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I hadn't heard that question before, but the answer is yes. I would do that. I think it's terrible, what's happening. You can't use the word Christmas anymore. You say "Merry Christmas" and it's not politically correct -- and believe me, I say it anyway. But if you go to stores, you don't see 'happy Christmas", "Merry Christmas" -- you see "Happy Holidays". You're lucky you even see that! It's just gotten crazy.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> So you would bring back "Merry Christmas"? You would bring back the celebration of Christmas.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would tell the stores to use it. I don't even think they have a legal prohibition. They put their own prohibition on it. But you put down 'Merry Christmas'. Absolutely. I mean, you go out to Macy's and any of these stores and you don't see "Merry Christmas" the way you used to see it all the time. It's terrible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And a lot of stores aren't able to do that anymore.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> So you have the Pledge of Allegiance "one nation under God" coming back. You have Christmas coming back. What about English? Would you make it the official language?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'd certainly encourage it because I think it's hard for somebody, and I'm not talking Hispanic, I'm talking anybody. It's hard for somebody to make it in this country if they don't speak English. And I think it should be. And I think it used to be mandatory, it was almost mandatory, now it's not. And some people were talking, we go second language.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that would be a big mistake. It's really, really hard to make it in this country if you don't speak English.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> I agree. But would you make it the official language?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would have to give it serious thought, but I would certainly encourage it very strongly.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> What do you think about Dr. Ben Carson's resilience? In the national Fox News poll, he's right behind you, 24% to 23%. In the key states, South Carolina, Nevada and others, you lead him double-digits, but what do you make of the fact that he's still in it? And if he's not nipping at your heels, he's still in the rearview mirror?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, he is. And you know he's been very nice to me. And I've had a good relationship with him. I really can't figure out anything. I see some of these people, Carly's gone way down since she did well in the debate and since then she's gone very far down. Others have gone very far down. Don't forget when he and I go so far up someone else is going down... and one of the things I don't understand is that when some of them have zeros like Pataki has zero why is he hanging around?
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Why is he hanging around? You think its ego?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't understand it. They make fools out of themselves. You wonder why do they hang around, Lindsay Graham; you know a number of them. I think it's very bad for their brand; it's very bad for them. But they must know something I don't know, I mean they go on the debate stage, they're introduced as having zero, they're on the other set, the undercard, they call it the 'Children's Set', I refuse to call it that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you wonder why they are doing this, I mean it's not like oh they're going to have some kind of a surge. It's not going to happen.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> You have Hillary Clinton. What do you think of going up against the First Lady? At that debate she was pretty calm, competent, and more attractive than she's been for months. Do you fear Clinton opponent, do you relish it? What's your position?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, there's nothing to fear. I mean look she's done a very poor job as Secretary of State, she's had nothing but problems, she's still got to deal with the emails despite what Bernie said, which I think was a great sound bite but a mistake.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> 'Nobody cares about your damn emails!'
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what though, that was his only chance and he gave it up. But she is under investigation by the FBI so I don't know, we'll see what happens but I think she's totally protected by the Democrats so I don't think anything's going to happen, not because she's not guilty because she probably is guilty.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Guilty of what, what is she guilty of? What's the crime?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You'll have to ask General Petraeus cause he got suspended sentence of 2 years in prison and other people got suspended sentence and they went to jail for the same thing. But actually for much less. So it's not a question of what I think, it's a question of what's been happening over many years, the people who do this stuff go to jail, I mean General Petraeus his life was destroyed for doing really much less than what Hillary did.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> IT's not for me to talk about the crime. It's for the FBI. That being said however, I think she's totally protected by the Democrats and I don't think the Democrats will do anything to her.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> So the US Attorney in DC will not do anything, that's a Democrat, you won't see any real action because the democrats will protect her even to that extent?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think so yes, and it's a double standard and very unfair to the people who have been convicted of major crimes.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> You know you had yesterday a second Republican Congressman Richard Hanna of NY said "sometimes the biggest sin you can commit in DC is to tell the truth. This might not be politically correct but I think there was a big part of this investigation that was designed to go after people and an individual Hillary Clinton.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> What do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I think that was a big step for him to come out and certainly it's not a... for the Committee.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> It's a second Republican.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's a Republican and I saw that last night and that certainly is not going to make Trey and the group very happy but we're going to have to see what happens, it's really up to them. I know nothing about the evidence. They might have the case, but we're going to have to see. But I think she's just got a bad record of being Secretary of State.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> That's true.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The world imploded around her. Everything that you're reading about now took place, it just, Libya, just look at everything, the world has gone to hell. The world has become a battlefield. It all took place during her term and a little bit after her term.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> That's my position! Run against her record, not this phony stuff. Is it possible that this Benghazi investigation is a partisan witch hunt?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right, I know, I don't know. I really don't know. I wouldn't want to say one way or the other. I doubt it. But again, I don't want to get into that because I don't know. But what I do know is that her record is terrible. And I think her record is really the thing I could tell you, that if I'm the nominee, I'm going after her record, I'm not going after anything else.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm going after her record, because her record speaks for itself.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> And I think that's fair game.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Finally, I get to immigration, those protesters, as few as they were, they do represent a lot of Latinos. The surveys I've seen, still the majority of Latinos are very unfavorable toward your candidacy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No...  look at the Nevada poll. 38%, I lead with the Latinos, as you would say, or with the Hispanics, as I would say. I lead with the Hispanics with 38%. I have a substantial lead.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> But why not moderate it? Since you have a lead -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The Hispanics that are here legally love Trump because I'm going to produce jobs. You know how many Hispanics I employ.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> But why not soften some of this rhetoric? Soften some of it. I mean, you're not going to go door to door. The Donald Trump I know is not going to go door to door and say, 'Let me see your papers'.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Geraldo, I'm just saying, I'm leading with Hispanics and -- [Crosstalk]
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> But what about what I just said?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A radio host who competes with you on the air, and he's Hispanic and he was on one of the shows the other day. And he said, it's amazing, every one of my listeners that calls in, they love Trump. And it's a Hispanic radio show in New York! And they understand. I love the Hispanics! You know that!
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> You love me! [Laughs]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love you! I know you're only half Hispanic but I love you anyway!
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> You only love that half? Not my Jewish half?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love both halves!
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Okay great. So, let me take you to a Spanish restaurant. Let's do this. Melania, Erica, we'll have some fun.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I wouldn't mind doing that. I wouldn't mind that at all! I'd love it. Geraldo just so you understand, I have thousands of Hispanics that work for me right now. Over the years, I've hired tens of thousands.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> But you're scaring people with the rhetoric though.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They are phenomenal people.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> But why not ease off on the rhetoric?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think I have eased off. I don't think my rhetoric's tough. If you look in the 1950s, take a look at when Dwight Eisenhower was President and what he did. I mean, it was much tougher. And what he did was incredible. He moved millions and millions of people out. And he did it, and nobody complained.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was a different time, but nobody complained.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Alright, we'll debate that further. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> One of the things we have to do is we have to be here -- you know, we want to have people come in legally.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Are you ready to be President?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am ready. I am ready. I just want to make our country great again. That's what I want to do. I want to make our country great again. And we can do it, Geraldo.
<Erin Burnett> <Positive> All right, well Matthew, thanks very much. We appreciate it. Live from Perugia, Italy. Well earlier today I was speaking to Donald Trump about actually an entirely different matter, but he brought up Amanda Knox because he's been a supporter of hers for several years, very publicly. So he joins us on the phone and we really appreciate your taking the time. Donald, I know that you said you're a big supporter of Amanda Knox. I know you've spoken publicly about that over the past few years. You mentioned to me that you spoke with her father this afternoon. What did he say?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Via Telephone] Well, he couldn't have been happier. It's about time that this happened. I mean, it's ridiculous. She was never guilty. All the evidence proves that. If you look at this prosecutor, he has his own issues. He's got a terrible reputation and a terrible past. And he had just a thing. It was just -- he had this thing about her, somehow, and probably has it about other people, too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it was time. And hopefully she's now going to recapture her life, and do a good job in doing it. And maybe, frankly, become a big star, and somehow she can get some dividends out of this nightmare for herself.
<Erin Burnett> <Positive> Well, you've been very outspoken on her defense before, Donald. I'm curious. You talk about her becoming a big star. How do you plan on supporting her from here?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I've been supporting the family. I've been helping the family and I'll continue to help the family. They went through a lot. I just felt badly. The first day I saw this, I said that doesn't sound right. And then we looked at the evidence, and the evidence just wasn't there. And, you know, at least the appeals court had the courage to say, the evidence was not there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it was never there. For her to have spent four years in a terrible jail is just outrageous.
<Erin Burnett> <Neutral> And did Kurt Knox give you any sense of when they plan to return to the U.S. or what their plans are when they're here?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, he's going to Seattle is what he told me. And I don't think they can leave quick enough. She went to Italy to learn the language. Well, she learned the language. That's one thing she got out of it.
<Erin Burnett> <Positive> I guess that's true. Well, thanks so much, Donald. We appreciate it. Maybe we'll see her on one of your shows.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you'll see her someplace. But she's got -- she's a great person and what happened to her was absolutely outrageous, Erin, and good luck with your show, it's going to be great.
<Erin Burnett> <Positive> Thank you so much, Donald. We'll be talking to Donald again, soon. Thanks again.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> By the way, President Donald Trump is on the phone. My theory is that Donald is really not running for president.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You think he's just promoting a book.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, he doesn't need the aggravation. Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I am having a good time.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Laughter] How you doing?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Good. How you doing?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Am I allowed to date your wife? I mean am I allowed to call her and take her out to dinner and wine her and dine her?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You're not talking about romantically. You're just trying to help her get over...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh yeah, right...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I was more surprised than Howard by this one, I have to tell you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, well you can goof on me because  I goofed on your marriage.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You did, you did. Howard, Howard... Hey Robin, Howard gave me a very hard time because he came to my wedding, and there were like, literally Howard, as much paparazzi as you've ever seen, would you say?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, that is true.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And Howard stood in on the stairs of the Plaza Hotel, they said Howard what do you think? First, said started there wasn't a wet eye in the house.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You made that statement, which was an all-time classic.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then he said, I give the marriage three months at best.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Three?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And it did last six.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So when I got back to the room, I put it on and this is what my wife had heard. This was the first words from television, with Howard on television.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I got to tell you something, you -- you are so smart. I've been looking at pictures of your last wife, Marla Maples.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She fell apart. You got rid of her just at the right time.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Just in time.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You got out just in time, my friend.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let's say I'm very happy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Exactly.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You know Donald's been known to be having the greatest timing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. Listen, I have -- The timing is right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're timing when nothing, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I certainly have no right as to whether or not you can date my wife, but if you date Alison and I'm going to date Ivanka.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now that sounds -- That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, in that case, you have to tell Alison I won't be calling home.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What are you saying?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What are you saying, Donald? I'm not good enough?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I don't think -- You're just what I'm looking for in a son in law. You'll be the perfect son in law.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, I'm really great. Oh, boy. Yeah, I'm a real treat. Now, but listen you -- you have some beautiful girlfriend now, holy mackerel, I mean, and then I was reading about her. I can't believe he stopped, you know, he was drawn to a little terror down there for a while He has some stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know after the show is over you should call me because you and I will travel around during the late hours of the night.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What presidential candidates aren't supposed to be doing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But especially with someone like me.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> But he always used to invite you to Mar-a-Lago for that weekend he has down there, and you'd never go.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I know I've got no invites.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, no, no. You're always invited.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And really, you know it's sort of interesting, it's a very funny thing, a very, very rich friend of mine, this is not the case with you, he's not able to get women.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And for some reason they always call me because they want to travel with me, and he's a guy --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why is it everyone assumed that I can get women.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think you probably can easily, you can. But I have so many friends when they call me they want to hang out because they think -- and at a thought of an amazing phenomena how they eat people for lunch and they are the toughest, meanest, most miserable, most brilliant people. But if they meet a woman at 7:30 in the evening, they freeze, they got locked jaw.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right, they can't forget how to put that deal together.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That deal they can't do.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It is amazing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have no idea how often, but it happens all the time.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So -- so listen, let me talk to you about this president thing for a second. Now this has gained some steam and the fact of the matter is this third party, this Ross Perot party, is really considering you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they really liked me, but they liked me for one reason because the polls do very well. I do very well on the polls to summaries.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Now I -- I -- Between you and me, I know that you have a book coming up pretty soon, right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Correct.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. I believe that this is advance publicity for the book.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's true but I really am considering this. But it would be very, very important to have your endorsement.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What is the exploratory committee? Cause everybody puts one of those together.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Robin, before I tell you about exploratory committee, you know, in my last book I gave a lot of television lot of this, lot of that, and when I had a book signing in -- on 5th Avenue, pick book signing, thousands of people -- a lot of people showed up. Most of the people that showed up weren't from the very famous television shows that we all know and love. They were all from Howard's show.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They all set their hair, because they heard me on Howard. And I was really amazed of that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He's not running, now you know that, Robin.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Because first of all that would destroy -- You don't -- It's fun to get the publicity in the hype.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Donald doesn't do things by committee. He can't work with congress.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right. He wouldn't do that. And the fact of the matter is, he's having a too good a life, I mean, to even consider that horrible job. It really is a horrible job, unless he' got nothing -- Unless you're a loser.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, do you think Clinton's a happy man, Howard?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I think for Clinton, this is something that --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> This is the best thing that could've happened.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> This was his career.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What's gonna happen to Clinton when he retires as a young man of 53 or 54?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He's gonna run a company or something.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, but you think he'll stay married?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, I don't think he's -- I think he will because --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Cause she let's him do whatever he wants.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He's got the perfect marriage.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He does what he damn well pleases.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think she might even encourage her.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. I don't think she really wants him on top, a very -- that's the way it goes. It's unbelievable. Hey, you know, let me get a glimpse of your life.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> When I read about the supermodel you're dating, who is a knockout.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Melania Knauss from Austria.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Very sweet too.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How do you know she's sweet?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I've met her.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Who cares if she's sweet.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But she is.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Robin did meet her, that's absolutely right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Are you serious about Oprah's your running mate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In terms of getting votes, I think that Oprah would be great. I mean, you know, Oprah's -- I'm very friendly with Oprah, and I think she's great.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yeah, but I've heard a lot of white guys say that they're very nervous if you run with Oprah because then they will kill you, so Oprah can become president.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You think black people will kill Donald.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I don't think that. This is what these horrible racist is thinking. Can you imagine?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I guess there's some racism out there, on occasion you do see racism.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's horrible to think that that that someone would kill you to get Oprah as president. But, I don't think she could run, she can hardly walk, well I don't know. So, you're telling me. That your life now, you are you are in a monogamous relationship.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You're not cheating on your girlfriend.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That is correct.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She is so satisfying to you right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's very satisfying.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you living with her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Because she implies that what the relationship is, she's very busy during the day, you're very busy obviously.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And then at night you two link up.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true. Which is the ultimate time to link up.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Did she leave after you have sex with her, or did she sleep over?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, generally she'll stay over.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Oh, too bad. Wel you don't have the perfect relationship. So, you're there with her now.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She is -- You know, in fact she is listening right now to the radio.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I thought I could do this, maybe I'd do it a little bit earlier, in fact I was thinking about calling a bit earlier, but, you know, I just had a hard time doing that for another reason. But I tell you, I really didn't want her to listen, because you know when I did his television show, Robin, your television show,
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And you started whipping out all the purses of Linda Evangelista and this one, and that one
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right, right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know it's very embarrassing if you're going with somebody in particular, it's very embarrassing, so I didn't want her to listen but she just listen.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But that's why she digs you, cause you can get tricks like that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well maybe. Who knows, you never know.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Do you have to talk to her a lot, or is she pretty much keep quiet.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's quiet, beautiful, very nice, and very smart.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Boy, I couldn't think of anymore perfect. The only thing I could think she could do is turn into a pizza after you have sex with her. That would be as perfect as it gets.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That is about good as it gets.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, my God.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> He's not at work right now, because the last time I saw him he says. yes we just got back from Monte Carlo, you know, he's smelling the roses.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I'm having a lot of fun, Howard. I'm having a lot of fun in business, my business have been great.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The city is booming as you know, and Rudy has done very good job.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He has been great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People love him, my town love him. Rudy has been a great man.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes he has.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It is absolutely booming, and you know I'm the biggest developer in New York now, by far. and I'm having a lot of fun.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I tell you you're smelling more than roses, my friend. You are absolutely genius.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know in the early 90s [Inaudible] developer, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who are you gonna vote for? Are you gonna vote for Rudy or Hillary?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I'm a Rudy man.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. Me too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, Howard he's done such a good job, how can you not let him go on to the next stage. I frankly wish he would be Mayor for another [Inaudible.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You have to reward a guy who's done a good job.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Absolutely, that's awesome.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think he's very nice.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Me too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've seen a number of times, he's really nice.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But what has she done for us?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She hasn't done anything she hasn't proven herself.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Rudy has been a great mayor, you got to let him got to stage two.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's right I agree. All right. So your point is you're banging this supermodel, and when you get tired of her you will have another supermodel. But it seems to me you're really digging this one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she's very exceptional. Very very beautiful.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But you're not going to get married again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's really beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You would never marry her, you would never marry her.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, I have to tell you this, Howard. This is a terrible thing, and this is going to really disturb you, but, you know, marriage is a great institution. Now, there's some of us just haven't gotten it right. But you've gotten it right. I mean, look you have a great relationship with Alison
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes my wife and I --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you could never say that marriage is not great. She's -- and I know Alison, and she's a tremendous woman. And you know, it's gonna be -- it's gonna be tough for you to top that. And you're always gonna feel guilty as hell, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And every time you meet some beauty, you're going to say. oh my god I'm like guilty. But then you're gonna have some fun, and you'll get over with.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's how you get through the day.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The guilt last for about 4-5 minutes and then your up.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So, you are having a good time, and then the fact of the matter is, the fact of the matter is that your life now is pretty much perfect. And you would never get married again. And I think this woman thinks you're going to marry her. Is that true?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know, this has been a good year.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Has she brought up marriage? She brought up marriage? No, she hasn't. She knows better, because that would scare you right away.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it would frighten me. But I do like the concept of marriage. I'm a great believer in marriage if you -- if you have the right woman.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, let me introduce you to the supermodel is a stunning woman. I know people who have actually seen her in person and they told me it's unbelievable. So, what is the greatest role to take her, let's say, to take her to Monte Carlo which is not like being alone with her and banging her, or is it better to like just put her in a bikini and put her out on a beach somewhere and sit next to her.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Like her dress is a Barbie doll.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Excuse me, this is guy talk, Robin. Which is better?

<Howard Stern> <Positive> And she'll put on like a thong and a little top spot.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Very small thong.

<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd like to name him out, but you know, I don't want to give him the credit, and he hates my guts, and we walked in.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is it Al Gosling?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He turned around and the chair trips over and he went over on his ass. But I liked it, I thought it was so great
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You liked that. So, when you sit does she dress up real hot like she miniskirts or something?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Well she's a pretty conservative person. But she will wear pretty well clothing.

<Howard Stern> <Positive> And she says like, how do these girls get cellulites?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's got an accent right? A little bit of an accent.

<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I didn't notice her towering over him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Robin, I should take Howard one night to New York.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'll go with you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's hard to get him to stay up.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I got to stay awake.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I feel very disloyal by saying this to Alison, I feel very disloyal in a way, because, you know.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Don't worry, nothing will happen to me. You don't have to worry about me.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But, Howard, you should come out with me sometime.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You're inviting me?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> For a presidential candidate I tell you this, for presidential candidate I have the best time. One thing --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Where would we go?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't want to tell you the name of the places, because I don't want to make up them any harder than they are. But I think you would have an unbelievable time. You know, we're talking about presidential candidate, Gore has spent. $22 million
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So far.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've spent exactly $22 million less than that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. So you're really on the roll.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm doing it on the cheap.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But when I decide to do it, I'll spend a lot ot money.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Let me tell you, take me out with you, I'll back you all the way, buddy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Howard, you should come out with us, I'm serious. You will see things that you have never seen before.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I feel very disloyal by telling you this. This is terrible.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You don't have to feel disloyal.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> See, they could get back together if you don't get into it. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Robin, the problem if he comes out with me they'll never get back together.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That's what I'm saying. You got to stay away.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Howard, don't call me. I guarantee, 11:00, the first call I get's gonna be from Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Why don't we double date the Siegfried and Roy 3D movie . [Inaudible] Well, I'm gonna take you up on that because I need to see what you're up to.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Would you -- anytime I would love to go. You know, we would just have a great time.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really. I need this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm serious, you would see things.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'll bring the Viagra.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't think you'll need it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I don't need that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You won't need it, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Really. Where the hell is he going? I got to find out.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He's everywhere.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, but you think I fit in with those --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know what, if you're with a proper woman, you don't need viagra.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But do you think I would fit in in your blue blood friends.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think you would fit in beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He don't have blue blood he knows everybody.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what, I actually don't. The people that -- Actually, you know, even to these polls, the people that dislike me the most by far are the rich people.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What are we going to do if I go? Would I wear a suit?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You don't have to wear anything.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, go naked.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I like the naked, because that would make even more of an impact. You get more chicks. So, all right, okay, I hear what you're saying. I don't -- I should --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But you should do this, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm going to do it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, Robin I have no doubt that very soon. Like I say there's every once in a while I say to a friend of mine like a really rich friend of mine who out with me, you want to come out with me and I say it lightly, and you think the guy won't even bother -- like 12 minutes later there's a phone call.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Take it day.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I actually feel very funny about it. You know, I feel like I'm imposing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well you better start off at the staff house.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know, but I don't know if he's asking me because I'm on the air.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no. You will have a great time.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I got to tell you, Donald. You would've because when people hang out with me they're obnoxious. I'm horrible hanging out with.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Donald won't even think you're there, he's busy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Robin's right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yeah, that's right. Here's what kills my marriage. We would go out, and my wife would go -- I want to just go home.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Donald won't know when you leave.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's not gonna go home so fast.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donald I'm going to take you up on it because my audience needs to see me go out and go out with you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And you can report back to your audience, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Do I need to wear a cock piece?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You can wear anything you want.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Because It will make my crutch look bigger. Listen, Donald. Seriously, good luck with the presidential run I'll be following that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have to endorse me, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, sure. I'll endorse you. What else do I have to do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, I made billion of dollars. I watch Push the other day on television. And I'm not sure if that's what you want.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I'm not sure that's what I want either. I don't know anything about him. All I know is he knows less than I do about world politics.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. And you watch the debate with Bradley and Gore. and I don't think that's the one you want either. You take a good strong look at it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah that sounds good.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Tell you what, this country won't be ripped off again, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I know, you'll get a good deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We'll get good deals.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You guy's a great businessman.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Lots of good deal an lots of lower taxes, but I'll make a decision over the next couple of months. But it's interesting it's fun for me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Let me talk to broad in your bed.

<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What is she doing, what is she wearing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know. Maybe I should get her, do you want me to get her?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, let me talk to her for a second, let me talk to her. What's her name again? Melanie?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It begins with an M. I never can get it quite right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Have you ever seen that chick?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I've seen her, up close look.

<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, Jesus Christ.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's got an accent.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, you know what it is, the accent's cute now, but you better not get married. Because you know what happened, Ivana's accent was cute for a long time --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, it was amazing. It was so cute, and then one day I woke up that it was terrible I couldn't stand it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, that chick's something.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, she's very smart. Maybe too smart.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You marry her, you don't want to gag her. I don't want to get that accent.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm a little too concerned Howard, that she may be too smart. I have to be careful.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I told her I have a big bratwurst, but I don't think she believed me. All right, listen Donald. I don't want to keep -- I know you have a busy day of sex ahead of you. You have no sex today have you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I refuse to come.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, man, She's naked there, isn't she?

<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What a life you have there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don't feel bad, Robin.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> This is a candidate, we're sorry.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Hey Donald, can you have sex with her while we are on hold? Please.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Wouldn't that be nice?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You should have sex with her. Don't hang up, just leave the phone.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right on the floor, and I'll listen-in.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And watch your ratings go even higher.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Can you imagine my ratings? I will owe you big time. Speaking of the poll -- It's so big, you're hurting me. Please Donald, don't put it there. Oh, my goodness. Donald, I mean, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Is this your average interview, Robin, for presidential candidate?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Not for a politician.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That is why you're a great candidate, because you're refreshingly honest. Clinton, is doing the same stuff, he's just not talking about it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The level of quality is not even there either.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I'm telling you, I was watching and interview with Donald, and very seriously Donald says, listen, I don't think America was shocked by the Monica Lewinsky thing, they were shocked that he was not supermodel. That he's with some big fat chick. And even Donald could not believe it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I did make a statement that, there are those that say, that president Clinton was caught with a supermodel. He would have been everyone's hero. I would never say a thing like that. But there are those who say that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I believe you might have said it. Hey, Donald listen, we're going to follow your candidacy, and please come in and see us soon.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Any time you want Howard, I'll see you soon. And if you want, seriously, I'm serious about that. And Robin keep up the good work.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And you have an open invitation on this show, you know that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know that and I appreciate it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Donald Trump is a great friend of the show and President Trump will be a reality. Thank you. Take care of yourself. Thank you Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So long, Robin.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Mr. President go back to that girl.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I will.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> There's Mr. President, Donald Trump. Holy cow. Well, one thing that has happened here is that President Clinton prove he you can be into women and still run the country. Hey, I'd rather just see a guy who's honest having sex and admitting it. I don't need a guy to be married to some hausfrau to be president. We used to think that a guy who's dissing women would be too busy. But the president has already proven and that does not -- I like how Donald Trump is campaigning from his bedroom, I love that. Yeah, he calls here, he's done. Very efficient. [Inaudible] They didn't have to go to the hamper, they are all listening in to this. Wow. Well, there it is, an exclusive interview with possibly the next president of the United States.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> And the first lady.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> First of many ladies.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. Wow. All Right. We're gonna take a break. We'll be back after these words. [Break]
<Announcer> <Positive> And now, Howard Stern and Wally George engages in one playful [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You are such a pitiful moron. Hey let me tell you something, dope. You are my dog and this is what I'm gonna do to you. If I ever hear you mention my name negatively again. I only wanna hear praise. I'm your master, and I only wanna hear, you listen carefully to me. You can't threaten me. You are arguing with the best now, you are not arguing with those idiots on your show. Now listen to me carefully, dog boy. I am telling you right now, that you are morally bankrupt. Personally, I don't care about you professionally because you're nothing to me. You're a pimple in my ass, you're a flee in showbusiness. Let me tell you something, my friend, and listen to me carefully. If I hear you mention me negatively again, what is gonna happen, I'm gonna get hold of your first and your second wife.
