<Jamie Little> <Positive> Thank you Chris. Well, Mr. President, of all the events that you can attend, why did you decide to come here today to the great American race?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It really is the great American race, and I look at this as almost a patriotism kind of thing. It's incredible. The people are incredible. We love the area. We love the state, and it's a very exciting. You know, I've been here four times before, as a civilian, and now I'm in a different capacity. We love NASCAR and we love the people of NASCAR.
<Jamie Little> <Positive> And you mentioned you have been here before, the last time though back in 2001. So what is it about NASCAR that you enjoy personally?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's really the bravery of these people. I mean, these are very -- you know -- they do all the safety things, and everything, but it's -- it takes great courage. It's the speed. It's really the technology. You look at what's happened just over the last 10 years with the cars. I love to see it. I love to watch it.
<Jamie Little> <Positive> Okay. So, inquiring minds want to know: as the President, are you allowed to drive your own car?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, I'm not. But I think I've gonna reall -- right now. If I can, I'm going to hop into one of these cars and I'm going to get into this race if possible.
<Jamie Little> <Positive> All right. You're here -- heard it here for you. I love the idea. Thank you for being here enjoy your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love the idea. Yeah, I love the idea.
<Jamie Little> <Positive> Thank you for being here. Enjoy your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Great honor.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Mr President, how are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm good thank you, Piers.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> It's been a while!
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It has, since you became my Champion on the Apprentice.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Well that was 10 years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Can you believe it? It's a long time but I appreciate all the nice things you've said, and every once in a while a hit, but that's OK.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> I always say that you don't mind criticism if it's not hysterical.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> You don't mind listening to criticism, do you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's true. No I don't, if it's real. If it's fake, I don't like it. I mean when they give you false stories, and there's so much of it in the media, but you've always been very fair.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you really are a talented guy. Look, you were on the Apprentice, and I wouldn't say you were the most popular person in the sense of the other people liking you, but you were the smartest person and that had something to do with your victory.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> I actually found the quote that you said to me. This is exactly at the moment you made me your Apprentice.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> I don't know if you can remember what you said, but you said this. You said 'Piers, you're a vicious guy. I've seen it. You can try and dispute it.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> You're tough, you're smart, you're probably brilliant... You're certainly not diplomatic, but you did an amazing job, and you beat the hell out of everybody, and you won by far more than anybody'.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Watching your campaign, it looked like you'd stolen my playbook Mr President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's been an interesting campaign, and you know, often times they say that Hillary was a terrible candidate. They never said I was a great candidate, but we won. It was a convincing win. It was an electoral college -- I guess it was like 223 to 306.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You remember that it could never be 270. I'd love to do popular vote, it would be such a thing. I would love to do a popular vote, but it's a much different kind of a contest.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it would be actually an easier way of doing it, but the electoral college is nice because it gets you into so many different states that you wouldn't see otherwise. But we had a great campaign and we won, and the country is doing fantastically well.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Some people think you didn't actually want to win.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that's such a false story. That's fake news, that was in that fake book. But that is such a false story. I mean first of all, you know me, and I actually though I was going to win because I'd go to stadiums and we'd have 25,000, 30,000 people in the stadiums.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We would have a fever pitch, it was incredible what was happening that last two months of the campaign. And coming into the last month I thought we were going to win. We were getting massive crowds. My opponent was not getting good crowds at all.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She was getting, you know, singers and entertainers to fill up the stadiums. They'd finish singing and then everybody would leave and she was left there. So I'm telling you, I really thought I was going to win, and I very much wanted to win. If I didn't win I would have been very disappointed.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> You've had an extraordinary year. Whether people love you or loathe you, it's been extraordinarily eventful. Depending on who you talk to, you're either delivering on a lot of your promises, beginning to make America great as you vowed, or, and you know the other half of this, you're a raging tweeting wrecking ball who's destroying the country and terrifying the entire planet. How do you plead?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I plead not guilty.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> To all of it? Or the second bit?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think I shakes things up. It had to be shaken up. The country had to be shaken up. We're doing incredibly on an economic basis.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Financial -- stock market just hit another new high. We've had 84 -- since the election -- 84 new market highs. Think of that. It's incredible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's never happened before. It's a record. That in itself is a record. During the course of a little more than a year we've had -- think of it -- 84 stock market records.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's going to go higher. Regulation -- nobody's done anywhere near like I've done. That's also a record, a world record for presidents. But what happened is, we passed a tax bill -- not easy to get.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Many people have tried to do it, they weren't able to do it, and this is the biggest one we've ever passed, bigger than the Reagan bill. And it's had a bigger impact than anybody even thought. But I would also say that the tax cuts, added to the regulation cuts, is what made the difference. And people...
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> How significant was the Apple move?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I thought it was great, but that was one move. They're going to invest $350 billion, they're going to build plants all over the place, they're going to build a college, they're going to build this incredible campus. They are fantastic.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it's a $350 billion investment, which I guess is probably the largest -- or certainly right up there -- largest ever made by a company. So we're doing very well, people are coming back into the country in droves. One thing very exciting to me is Chrysler -- they're leaving Mexico and they're going back to Michigan. You haven't heard that in a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're doing things that nobody thought possible and the country is becoming very very strong again economically. Unemployment is at record lows. Women unemployment -- 17 years. Think of it, 17 years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Black unemployment -- the best record in history, the history of our country. African American unemployment, best. Hispanic unemployment, best in the history of the country. All of the things that I said on the campaign trail coming true, so I'm very happy about it.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> A lot of people will listen to that -- a lot of people don't want to give you any credit -- but a lot of that is indisputable. The economy is in good shape. The global economy is in good shape.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And that's been taking... a lot of the global economy Piers is because of how well we're doing. Most people won't admit that, but we are doing well, that's helping all around the globe. That's a very good thing.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Your supporters get frustrated that a lot of the tweeting -- the tweetstorms, the controversies, some of the more outlandish things that you occasionally say -- that they distract from that kind positive message. Do you accept that? Do you care?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think it's so many of my supporters. I think a lot of other people, they use that... I don't call it tweeting, I call it social media. And you're a big social media man by the way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> you do great with it. And I think you might agree with that statement.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> I like your tweets. I like the kind of unfettered access to the President's mind in real time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I wasn't able to do that -- I call it a modern day form of communication, OK -- if I wasn't able to do that, because I get a lot of fake news, I get a lot of news that's very false, very made up. You saw all of the stories that were wrong this year. I mean one of the stories was so wrong it drove the stock market down substantially and it was wrong. They've made a lot of mistakes and lot of them were made on purpose.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I don't have that form of communication, I can't defend myself. Unless I'm going to have a news conference every 15 minutes...
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Do you actually tweet yourself?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. I do. I also give it to people and sometimes I'll have -- I had one case where a lawyer did a tweet, you know they'd call it. I have a man, Dan Scavino, and I have people that are with me, you know Hope [Hicks] and you know Sarah [Huckabee Sanders]...
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> The whole world waits for you to wake up, on tenterhooks.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...It's a crazy situation.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Are you actually lying in bed with your phone working out how to wind everybody up?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, perhaps sometimes in bed, perhaps sometimes at breakfast or lunch or whatever. But generally speaking during the early morning or during the evening, I can do that, but I'm very busy during the day -- very long hours, I'm busy -- and sometimes I'll just dictate out something really quickly and they'll give it to one of my people to put it up.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> There's been a few big events in the last week, one of which was the big Women's March on the first anniversary of your inauguration. The #MeToo and the Time's Up campaigns have really resonated with millions of women. And they partly hold you to blame for a lot of attitude towards women. Do you have a message for them? Because we're a year on from the last time there were all these marches, a lot is happening in that area of sexual harassment and you've seen what's happened in Hollywood and so on.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> What message could you give these women who are marching that you're for them and not the problem?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I am for them and I think a lot of them understand that. You know, I won many categories of women and the women vote in the election, and people were shocked to see it. I was running against a woman and I'm winning all of these categories. You know that better than anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think I would do even better right now... In fact we've just had polls coming out just a little while ago, just before I walked into the room that are really up tremendously. I think that's maybe because of the economy, but I just said before that women have the best unemployment numbers that they've had in 17 years. And they're doing tremendously in business, they're doing tremendously in so many ways, and people are starting to see that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, you're always going to have marches, and I guess the march was a lot smaller than it was last year...
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> But do you agree with their basic principles, which are gender equality and safety. When it comes to safety, women want to feel safe, particularly in the work place. Do you sign up to that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do, but I also think they want to feel safe at the border. I think they don't want people pouring into their country. I think they want to see our military get much stronger. I mean women, you know, families, they want to see strength at the border.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They want to see a strong law enforcement. I'm a very much law and order person and candidate when I ran. The uniformed services, the military -- there's nobody better than me on the military. I've increased the budget, we're going to have a budget, $700 billion this year.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The Democrats were not going to have anywhere near that. I think women really like that. I think they want to be safe at home in many different respects...
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> A lot of the women I spoke to about this, they said it would be great to hear the President, given some of the more disrespectful things that have been out there, and the way you've spoken about women, would you acknowledge that you had said things that perhaps you wouldn't say now? That you have also listened -- as many men are listening right now -- that you've changed, you've changed as a man?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I think we have to evolve. If we don't evolve, there's something missing. But I have tremendous respect for women, and I think you know that very well because you know me, and you've spent a long period of time with me. You see all of the women I have working around me and working with me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Tremendous respect for women.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> You have a lot of strong women around you. Melania, and your team here, the press team. Do you identify as a feminist? Are you a feminist?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I wouldn't say I'm a feminist. I think that would be maybe going too far. I'm for women, I'm for men, I'm for everyone. I think people have to go out, they have to go out and really do it and they have to win...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And women are doing great. And I'm happy about that.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Move to Britain. A lot of stuff has been going on between you and my country, which has been...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's good. I think I'm very popular in your country.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Let's not be too hasty Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I believe that, I really do. I get so much fan mail from people in your country. They love my sense of security. They love what I'm saying about many different things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a great... I own the great Turnberry and other things in your country -- Turnberry in Scotland -- and I'm getting tremendous -- I mean we get tremendous support from people in the UK.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> But there are a lot of politicians, mainly the opposition politicians -- Jeremy Corbyn, Labour Leader, Sadiq Khan, London Mayor...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know the man, I don't know the man.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> They want you banned. They don't want you to come on any kind of visit, a normal visit, state visit, anything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's their problem. I mean, if they don't, I could very nicely stay home. But I can tell you I have a very good relationship with your Prime Minister, who I just left. And I think she's been doing a very good job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We actually have a very good relationship, although a lot of people think we don't. I support her. I support a lot of what she does and a lot of what she says and I support you militarily very much. I mean, we will come to your defence if anything should happen, which hopefully will never happen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I am a tremendous supporter of the UK. Tremendous supporter. There's nobody that believes more strongly.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> You're half-British right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, my mother was born in Scotland, in the Hebrides.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> That makes you half-British.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My mother was born in Stornoway. You know what they call that? Serious Scotland, right? That's serious Scotland. She was born in Stornoway.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Do you feel half-British?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I sort of do. I love the country. I'm in Aberdeen with a tremendous... I also have a great situation over in Ireland in Doonbeg over there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And of course Turnberry... that's the Mona Lisa, one of the great Mona Lisas of the world in terms of sport and golf, and I own Turnberry. And I love the UK. I have a special -- maybe because it's my mother, who I thought was one of the great people I've ever known...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> What would she have made of what's happened to you, your mother?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She would have... you know she had a great sense of regal. She had a great sense of... She had a love for the Queen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She had a love for the Royal Family. She really respected the Queen. And she loved the pomp and ceremony -- and circumstance -- but she loved the ceremony. The fact is, she loved the UK...
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> She would have loved you to get a state visit, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she would go back every year to Scotland. She just thought it was incredible. You know, she came over here when she was 19, she came over to the United States when she was 19. She met my father very...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> it was not a long time. They got married, they were married many many decades and they had a great marriage. You know, she was a terrific woman, and maybe that's... and again she loved Scotland and maybe that's one of the reasons that I feel the same way...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Do you feel sad that neither of your parents ever got to see their son become President of the United States?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I do, but they're seen me have great success, because I've had great success. And you know, I've been successful even if you talk about, I do a show on television. They always turn out... very rarely does a show become a big hit like I had.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I go into that, the real estate... I've had a lot of hits. So they got to see a lot, but there's nothing like what happened here. I mean, the presidency is something special, but more importantly, I'm so happy with the results, because if you look at what's going on, and you look at our country, and you look at the way it's thriving.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're having a stock market like just about they've never had before. Ever before. We've picked up... Piers, we've picked up $8 trillion in value during the course of 12 months...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> I just want to pick you up on one thing about the reaction in Britain. Because a lot of people don't like you in Britain, fuelled by these politicians, fuelled by some of the more inflammatory things you've said. The one particular thing, because I want to try and just clarify with you -- you retweeted an organisation called Britain First, one of the leaders, three times. And this caused...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, three times -- boom boom boom.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> This caused huge anxiety and anger in my country, because Britain First is basically bunch of racists, fascists...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Of course, I didn't know that.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Well, that's what I wanted to clarify with you. What did you know about them when you did those tweets?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I know nothing about them, and I know nothing about them today other than I read a little bit, and I guess -- and again, I'm in the United States, so I don't read as much about it. Perhaps it was a bit story in Britain, perhaps it was a big story in the UK, but in the United States it wasn't a big story. I did a retweet. You know, a retweet sometimes you do...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When you do your own tweeting or you do your own social media, it's fine. When you do those retweets, they can cause problems, because you never know who's doing it to start off with.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> The way it was interpreted -- you didn't take those down retweets for several weeks -- the way it was interpreted was, you were effectively endorsing this bunch of racists, and that caused a lot of anger.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't know who they are. I know nothing about them, so I wouldn't be doing that. And I am as I say often, I am the least racist person that anybody's going to meet. And certainly I wasn't endorsing anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I knew nothing about them. They had a, I guess, a couple of depictions of radical Islamic terror. Radical Islamic terror, whether you like talking about it or not Piers, is...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> No, I'm going to come and talk about it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ...Because you look at what's going on, you look at what's going on in the UK, you look at what's going on all over the world...
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> And you're absolutely right about that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So you can try and shield it and say...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> I'm not shielding anything. I do just want to get one thing out of you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Given the amount of offence it caused, and given that you've now acknowledged that you didn't know who these people were -- they've had their accounts suspended by Twitter -- do you regret now those retweets and do you wish you, with hindsight, hadn't done it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, look. It was done because I am a big believer in fighting radical Islamic terror. This was a depiction of radical Islamic terror.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> They were unverified videos. At least one of them was not what it seemed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But this was... I didn't do it, I didn't go out and... I did a retweet. It was a big story where you are, but it was not a big story where I am.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> I get that, I get that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So you're telling me something...
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> This is airing in Britain, and I want them to get to the real you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I tell you, the real me is someone who loves Britain, who loves the UK, who loves... I love Scotland. I wish... You know, one of the biggest problems I have in winning -- I won't be able to get back there so often.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would love to go there, as you know before this happened, I would be there a lot. Very special people and a very special place. So I don't want to cause any difficulty for your country, that I can tell you.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Can I get an apology out of you just for the retweets of Britain First?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you're telling me they're...
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> I think it would go a long way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Here's what's fair. If you're telling me these are horrible people, horrible racist people, I would certainly apologise if you'd like me to do that. I know nothing about them.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> And you would disavow yourself of people like that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to be involved with people, but you're telling me about these people, because I know nothing about these people.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Thank you Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> It means a lot to people in Britain. On the issue of trade, you were very encouraging when you met Theresa May. And Barack Obama came over to Britain just before the EU referendum and said if we voted to Leave, we'd go to the back of the queue. What is your position now? Are we at the front of the queue for a new trade deal with America?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we are going to make a deal with the UK, that will be great. As you know, somewhat restricted. Because of Brexit you have a two year restriction. And when that restriction is up we're going to be your great trading partner.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a tough restriction to have. You know for a couple of years, you have very strong lack of being able to do things.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> [How come you called the referendum result correctly?]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because I know the British people and I understand the British people, and the British people wanted to have control over their country. And they don't want to have people coming from all over the world into Britain and they don't know anything about these people. And I said because of immigration, and to a certain extent because of trade, but mostly immigration, I said that Brexit is going to be a big upset and I was right.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> And now we've seen how it's played out. Do you believe that we're in a good position in Britain? A lot of people are still very nervous, very anxious, but hearing the President of the United States saying 'There's plenty of good trade coming from me' -- that's a big deal to people in Britain.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, would it be the way I negotiate? No, I wouldn't negotiate the way it was negotiated. But I have a lot of respect for your Prime Minister, and I think they're doing a job. I think I would have negotiated it differently. I would have had a different attitude.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> What would you have done?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think I would have said that the European Union is not cracked up to what it's supposed to be, and I would have taken a tougher stand in getting out... I have a lot of problems with the European Union.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Yeah. You've done business with them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're very... no, it's not a question of doing business. But I will tell you, representing the United States, it's a very unfair situation. We cannot get our product in.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's very very tough. And yet they send their product to us -- no taxes, very little taxes, it's very unfair. I've had a lot of problems with the European Union, and it may morph into something very big from that standpoint, from a trade standpoint. The European Union has treated the United States very unfairly when it came to trade.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're not the only ones by the way. I could name many countries and places that do. But the European Union has been very very unfair to the United States, and I think it'll turn out to be very much to their detriment.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> So are we front of the queue? Or are we behind the French? Because we're a bit worried about Emmanuel Macron who's been all over you trying to be your new best friend.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I like him. He's a friend of mine. Em-man-u-el! He's a great guy, his wife is fantastic. I like him a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, we had dinner at the top of the Eiffel Tower.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Well he rolled out the red carpet!... My irritation with my country. We've given state visits to Bashar al-Assad, to Robert Mugabe, to Vladimir Putin and to President Xi. So the implication from them trying to ban you, is that somehow you're worse than they are.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I hadn't heard about banning, but I think a lot of the people in your country like what I stand for, they respect what I stand for. And I do stand for tough borders.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> I'm going to come to that now, but to those who don't, what do you say to them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't care, I don't care. It's just one of those things. I don't say anything. You know why? Because I don't care.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Let's turn to security, national security. You've been very tough on this. You vowed again, in an interview with Good Morning Britain, you were going to hammer ISIS hard. ISIS is now out of Iraq and Syria.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> I mean, that's a big double success for you, right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By the way, we would have never been there with the previous administration.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Are we winning the war..?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I have to say this. With the economy, had the previous administration in its own form, in a different form, or let's put it, had the Democrats won -- instead of being almost 50% up, they would have been 50% down, because the United States was heading in a very bad direction. Yeah, we've done very well in Iraq, we've done very well in Syria, we've hammered them. But they spread.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They go all over. It's not a good situation, and nobody knows it better than the folks in the UK. You've had some tough bouts.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> A lot of Muslims think you hate them. That you hate Muslims.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, totally false. No, that's false.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Clarify what you feel about that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I feel love for all people, but if a person's bad, we've got to do something about it. There's got to be retribution. But I've had great great relationships with Muslims, and I had good support from Muslims during my presidential run. And I think I have good support right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, it's interesting. They want to be safe also, Piers. And they like me because I give them security. I have a great relationship and respect for Muslims.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Only 8 people were killed in American by Islamist terrorism in 2017. By comparison, domestic gun violence killed at least 30,000. There was another mass shooting in a school this week in Kentucky -- the 12th this year alone. Two of the worst mass shootings in American history have happened on your watch, in Las Vegas and at the church in Texas.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> People will be saying you're very tough on security, you want to keep Americans safe, but if you don't do anything about gun violence at all, that seems an irrational position, for somebody who wants to keep America safe.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm a very big Second Amendment person, as you know very well. But take a look at Paris, where you have very very tough gun controls, take a look at that horrible slaughter that took place at the cafes where so many people were killed. And you had these thugs come in with guns. One by one for a long time, they just killed and hundreds of people wounded to this day still in the hospitals.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was one of the worst. And you've had many of them, where there are no guns except for the bad guys. So the bad guys have the guns, and if you would have had somebody with a gun right here when they walked in so that you could have had bullets going in the other direction, you wouldn't have had hundreds of people killed... By the way, you have many of those.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at San Bernardino, California. These guys walk in -- the people that they knew -- they walk in and they start one by one shooting them. They had no chance.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> But here's the difference...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Piers, they had no chance.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> OK, but let me give you the other side of this coin. I come from a country with very few guns. We have 32 deaths a year. In America, every day...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have a lot of terrorism.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Right. That's separate to it, but on the gun issue. Let me just put this to you. The Vegas shooter, Stephen Paddock, he bought 55 guns legally in the year prior to his rampage, including 13 AR-15 semi-automatic rifles, which he then equipped with bump stocks, which effectively converted them into machine guns, which are illegal.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> And he rained bullets down on 20,000 people in America.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I remember it very well. It was terrible.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Why has nothing been done to stop somebody doing that again?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We do have gun control laws, and this sick person -- he was a sicko. I mean that's the big problem, there's sick people. If he didn't have a gun he would have had a bomb or he would have something else.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> But he had 55 guns.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The point is he would have had 55 bombs. He would have had 55 of something else.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Why can't you make it difficult for him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, it's an argument that people have... I've heard it every different way and we can go around this argument. I'm a Second Amendment person. I think you need it for security.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it would be far worse. I think you need it for security. But again, you've had so many attacks where there was only a gun -- a bad person's gun -- going in this direction, and if you had one on the other side -- so many. In fact, that's a very big example.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if they had the bullets going in the opposite direction, you would have saved a lot of lives. So I get what you're saying, but I believe in the Second Amendment.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Quick fire -- climate change. For you, is it about the science or is it about the money? The Paris Accords.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's about everything and I'm a believer in clean air and clear water. The Paris Accord for us would have been a disaster...
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Are you completely out of that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm completely out of it.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> No way back?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There could be a way back. First of all, it was a terrible deal for the United States. If they made a good deal, like if they made a good deal with TPP -- you know, having to do with trade -- there's always a chance we'd get back, but it was a terrible deal for the United States. It was unfair to the United States.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Do you believe in climate change? Do you believe it exists?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There is a cooling and there is a heating and I mean, look -- it used to not be climate change. It used to be global warming. Right?
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That wasn't working too well, because it was getting too cold all over the place. The ice caps were going to melt, they were going to be gone by now, but now they're setting records, so OK, they're at a record level. There were so many thing happening, Piers. I'll tell you what I believe in.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I believe in clear air. I believe in crystal clear beautiful water. I believe in just having good cleanliness in all. Now, that being said, if somebody said go back into the Paris Accord, if we could go back into the Paris Accord, it would have to be a completely different deal because we had a horrible deal, As usual, they took advantage of the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We were in a terrible deal. Would I go back in? Yeah, I'd go back in. I like, as you know, I like Emmanuel... No, no, I like Emmanuel, I would love to, but it's got to be a good deal for the United States.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Quick question on trophy hunting. You seemed to indicate that you've had a change of mind about this, or you'd like the administration to.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I changed it. I didn't want elephants killed and stuffed and have the tusks bought back into this. And people can talk all they want about preservation and all of the things that they're saying, where money goes toward -- well money in that case was going to a government which was probably taking the money, OK? I do not, I turned that order around. That was an order.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> I know you did. I was very pleased to see that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I turned that order around.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> I tweeted to congratulate you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Were you shocked? Were you shocked?
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> I was surprised, but I also said to people you will listen to argument. And my problem with all the hysterical liberals who lie on the floor kicking and screaming all day long about you, if they actually tried to reason with you and argue with you, I noticed on that you indicated you'd changed your mind and you've now said you have...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was done by a very high level government person. As soon as I heard about it, I turned it around. That same day even. Not even a day went by.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I was not believing in conservation that...
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> People will love to hear that. A question about your health. Everyone was being led to believe that you were insane, and physically incredibly unfit. It turned out from your recent medical that you are 30/30 in your cognitive tests...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Which most people are not going to do too well on.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Right. You've got to hand it to you. As you said 'stable genius'. Your words.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am a stable genius.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> And healthy. You've never had a drink, you've never smoked, you've never taken drugs. We do see lots of pictures of you with burgers and Cokes and stuff. It's an unusual diet.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Don't want to change that! No, they build that up. I eat fine food, I eat really... some of the finest chefs in the world. I eat healthy food.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I also have some of that food on occasion. Sometimes it makes sense. Actually when you're campaigning there's a lot of sense to it because it's boom boom boom. But no, I think I eat actually quite well.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Have you got an invite to the royal wedding?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Have I?
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not that I know of.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Would you like to go?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want them to be happy. I really want them to be happy. They look like a lovely couple.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Meghan Markle did say you were a divisive misogynist.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I still hope they're happy.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> I'm going to make you happy, because your son Barron is a massive fan of my football team in London, Arsenal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true!
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> And we saw pictures of him... he's an Arsenal fan. We've been going through a rough patch for a long period of time. People think it's time for a change of leadership at my club.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Barron, I'm sure, shares my view, right? I have something for you. I've done -- this is an Arsenal shirt.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He'll be so happy.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> ...'TRUMP 45'. We're looking for a new leader who has an attacking philosophy, who believes in a strong defensive wall and believes in winning at all costs. And only wants big trophies.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I think that's beautiful. You know I have a son who does love this sport. He loves this sport.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> And he loves Arsenal, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it's growing very rapidly in the United States.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Are you an Arsenal fan?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not particularly, no...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Don't kill the dream Mr. President!
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I have a friend who owns Manchester United so I know exactly what I'm going to do with it.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Really? Wow! That will kill our special relationship! Anyway, that's for you, and if you do want to come and manage Arsenal, we would love it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's great! That's beautiful. We'll do very well!
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Mr. President, it's been great to catch up with you. Thank you very much for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
