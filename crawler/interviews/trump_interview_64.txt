<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> First of all, Mr. President, welcome to Cincinnati.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Bill Cunningham> <Neutral> You have a long business relationship here.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do. I've had a lot of relationships.
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> Swifton [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I had Swifton along with my father a long time ago and we -- we did a good job. We fixed it up. We -- 1,164 units, I remember it exactly. Fixed it, I worked here for two summers.
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> By [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right. Right by Cincinnati. I don't know if it's still there.
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> No, they knocked it down about six months ago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, really? Wow.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> Yeah. It's gone.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The whole thing including the garbage --
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> Everything. Everything's gone.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And what's going to happen with it?
<Bill Cunningham> <Neutral> Make it a housing development.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Wow. Okay, good. But it was great for us. We fixed it and sold it for more money and it was very good. But I loved Cinci -- The Queen City, I love the Queen City.
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> Let's talk about what happened today with Pastor Bronson.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> Major accomplishment. You're like the hostage receiving president . All of the world they're coming in. How important was it to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he is, and he's a great religious leader and he was, you know, they accused him of things that he didn't do, but we got them back. And we got back [Inaudible]. We got back many people, actually. If you look at it it's like -- it seems like all the time we're bringing back people. And I know President Obama paid $1.8 billion --
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> For nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- to bring back a few people from Iran. $1.8 billion. And we got him back and he's going to be safe, very shortly he's in the air. Just -- literally just took off and he'll be in the office, he'll be in the Oval Office probably sometime Saturday.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> Big welcome.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A big welcome. Yeah. You know, Evangelicals, Christians, everybody, everybody wanted him back. What happened to him was incredible. And he was held hostage but now he's -- he's going to be happy. I'm sure he's very happy right now. He's in good shape.
<Bill Cunningham> <Neutral> Let's talk about your wife. Melania's trip to Africa.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> Which is unbelievable what happened there. Talk about what was the goal and what was accomplished with Melania in Africa.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she's a terrific first lady and a great human being, and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much about it. Some very good stuff but some very tough stuff in the sense of the way people live. And she made four stops and she also went to the pyramids in Egypt and it was quite something special. But -- and the poverty is incredible the level of poverty.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was very sad -- beautiful in one way and very sad in another. Kids were beautiful. They loved her. And she came back and she said I hope you're going to continue to give a lot of money because they need it. It's not a question of -- it's not a question of defense it's not a question -- or it's just on a human basis, they need it. And she had a big impact on me. I will tell you, Bill, she really had a big impact on me.
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> And the other thing, the Midwest. I look at Canada, Mexico, and South Korea. Millions of jobs have been created. And you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohen and others that, you know, the Canada deal is probably not going to happen.
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> Mexico is too tough. NAFTA is ingrained. What did you do that cost Canada, may not be real happy right now, and Mexico may not be really happy, and then South Korea to kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat us that way. What did you do with the trade deal?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come in and rob. And Mexico, we made a deal, and we tell them, "Look, otherwise we're going to have to just tax your car industry." which would have been bad for them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And frankly, I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico. We could not make a deal with Canada that just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster. You know that better than anybody.
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> Awful.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You saw what happened over here with --
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> Awful.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- you still have buildings empty --
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> Awful.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- well, they just -- everybody moved out. I don't know what they were thinking. So that's why I refuse to call it NAFTA. I said, "The deal we're making, I refuse." So we called the USMCA and it works good but we made a great deal with -- with everybody. What happened then is Canada came along in the end. We were unable to make it. I said, "We're going to tax you cars coming in."
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> Then what happened?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And they made a deal.
<Bill Cunningham> <Neutral> They made a deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with. I hope they're very happy with. I hope everybody is. But it's a fair deal for us and we have -- now we just made a deal with South Korea, which is --
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> Fantastic.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- much -- a much improved -- approved deal, you know, improved. I will say that Hillary Clinton, you remember, she made that deal and she said it's 250,000 jobs, and she was right, for South Korea. So they got 250, we didn't get 250. It was a terrible deal. So essentially, we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea. So we're doing a lot.
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> Mr. President, how many jobs are talking about here? We talk about Canada and Mexico. Are we talking about a million? [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we're talking about millions of jobs. But don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to us.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you look at Canada, we couldn't sell our dairy product there, and if we did it was a 300% tariff. People talk about that. You know, if I put on a 10% or 20% tariff they make a big deal. They have 300% actually, 300%, 275%, 285%, these are the tariffs they charge.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So essentially, that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product, it's so expensive. So we've opened up Canada and we have a very good relationship now. I think they respect us more than they did before but now at least it's fair, and our farmers are in love with it, you see what's going on.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> It's beautiful.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union, which have absolutely taken advantage of our country. The European Union has been brutal in the way they took advantage of the United States for many years. I mean, they were formed to take advantage of the United States. That was the reason they were formed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How can we -- how can we take from the United States. So the European Union they formed and they are very unfair to us. They have barriers where we can't sell into their -- into their countries. They have tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet they sell Mercedes-Benz and BMWs, by the millions they come in.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Millions. And we charge them, essentially no tax. It's 2.5% but for the most part they don't even collect it. So we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars. If we want to send a piece of grain, okay, if we want to send a piece of grain, we can't do it into the European Union. So it's unfair.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We met with them, I told them I'm going to start taxing your cars, because Obama they wouldn't even talk to America. They said, "We're very happy the way we are." and that's -- that was it. Obama just went away. And then with us I said, "Look, we want to talk." I didn't hear from us. I said we want a talk I didn't hear -- Third time I said, "Listen --
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> We're serious.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- if you're not going to call me back but I'm going to give you one more chance. And he said, "That's okay. I'm going to tax you cars at 25% coming in." which is frankly more money.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's devastating to them but it's more money. And they immediately hopped in a plane and came over and talked and now they want to make a deal. I don't know that we're going to make a deal with them. I can tell you, they want to.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we're going to make it one way or the other. The easy way [Inaudible]
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> We've built China $500 billion a year, $ 5 trillion over 10. We've built Shanghai. We've built Beijing. At some point we're going to start building America. They've got the new airports, we don't have the new airport. They got the new bridges, we don't have the bridges. At some point our money's got to come back to America.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're so right. So, China has been taking out $500 billion yet people have no idea what that is. $500 billion. We have rebuilt China.
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> Can't do it anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I have a very good relationship with President Xi but I said we can't do it. Very simple, "We can't do it anymore." We're not going to do it anymore. So we've now put on $250 billion worth of tariffs. And by the way, there's been no impact, there's been no effect.
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> No. No.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But what people don't say is that we're taking in billions of dollars in our treasury because it's a 25%. So we take it in billions of dollars and we have -- we're going to create jobs. Now some of these things that we're not buying from China, or they become expensive because of the tariffs, they're going to start building these plants here to make the product here which is the old fashioned way. That's the way we used to do it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So China has been -- Look, China is the biggest of them all by far, it's probably 60% of our trade loss. We lost, over the last few years, an average of $800 billion a year on trade. We lose with everybody. Those days are over, Bill.
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> Now lastly, we have the midterms coming up. One of my favorite movies is Jimmy Stewart, It's a Wonderful Life. I look at Bedford Falls, Pelosi takes the house, Schumer takes the Senate. Your life becomes miserable the last two years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What do you say to middle class Americans all over the country that say, "You know what? We don't want Bedford Falls the way it looked. We want the New Bedford Falls." What do you say to those who say, the midterms, relax take it easy, not important, Renacci, whether it's Blackburn or Heller, we don't have to worry about that. What do you say to motivate the base?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I hope Renacci's going to do well, first of all, he's a great guy, but I just say, this is countrywide. Just forget it countrywide. You have to go out and vote. My poll numbers are so good but a lot of people say I'm not running so we're not going to vote.
<Bill Cunningham> <Neutral> 51% Rasmusen, 51.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now we're doing great. And then they say you can add a lot to it because when people hang up and they say we don't want to talk to you that means it's a Trump vote. I don't know if that's good or bad but that's what it means. We have to do well. I will say, I think we're going to do very well on the Senate and a lot of things have happened since Justice -- now Justice Kavanaugh [Inaudible]
<Bill Cunningham> <Neutral> And 15 judges -- 15 new judges.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Many, many judges. And we're going to have 145 judges fairly soon. When you think about it, I mean, 145, it will be close to 50% of the whole judiciary. Not only two Supreme Court justices. So -- but that was a very big thing happened over the last couple of weeks with Justice Kavanaugh because I've rarely seen a person treated so badly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The man of great distinction, a great life, and the way they treated him was horrible. And since that happened Republicans are looking, so is everybody. They see what's going on --
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> Is that the law of unintended consequences? Because as -- I've had many women whispered in my ear, "You know, Bill, I'm with Kavanaugh." They don't want to say it publicly but if you sense -- in a weird sense Kavanaugh is motivated the Republican base. Otherwise, it wouldn't have happened.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I don't know if you're going with me later, I hope you are. And you've been a great friend of mine and I appreciate it. You've been a very terrific guy.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> It's easy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're also a terrific talent. You know a lot of people can't do what you do. You know --
<Bill Cunningham> <Neutral> All I do is talk.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there's Rush and about -- that -- not too many. And Shawn, as you know, Shawn is great, but these are great people, great talents, and I appreciate it. Now we have to do well. I think we're going to do well in the Senate. I think we could pick up some seats in the Senate. And the polls, if you look three weeks ago and you look now, it's like --
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> Especially Blackburn, like Blackburn. She was down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's 10 points down, now she's 4 or 5 points up. Marsha from Tennessee, almost all of them. Now, I don't know how you're doing here. I know it's a tough race but it's unfortunate because he's such a good man. I mean I don't know.
<Bill Cunningham> <Neutral> Sherrod Brown is a socialist but, you know, he -- a lot of Trump voters are voting for Sherrod Brown.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's going around and a lot of people think he's my best friend in the world. The ads are like Trump ads.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> He talks well about you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know, it's amazing, except it's only during this period of time.
<Bill Cunningham> <Neutral> That's six weeks.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> After it's over, so it's one of those six. But I hope it does well and I hope that Steve does well. I think he's doing well for Congress.
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> Sherrod for the win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hear he's doing well. So I think that's very important and I'm here for him. But I just want to thank you for everything you've done and hopefully people are going to realize that this is a very important election. Midterms.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think, frankly, I think people are viewing this as very important. You know, usually midterms are like sleepers. People, they are energized. And for those that say that the -- that the blue is energized, meaning the Democrats and we're not. I think, personally, I think we're more energized.
<Bill Cunningham> <Negative> Wait until you see 11. They lined up yesterday morning. There's 20,000 trying to get into 2,000. It's a problem with the size of the arena. Wait to see what happens in about an hour. You're not going to believe the energy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we had it in Erie Pennsylvania the other night with 25,000 people outside of a 12,000-seat arena. It's been amazing. And if that kind of, you know, action shows up in three weeks, can you imagine? It's just a little more than three weeks.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> We got the energy for the next three weeks because you're like Elvis in Aloha and that 1968.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. I know. It's good old days.
<Bill Cunningham> <Neutral> You got three more weeks. You got three weeks.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I have 25 days, and 25 days I'm out campaigning for many of those days. I'd do all of them. But you can only move this big equipment so often --
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- okay, and Secret Service and all of that but we're very, very busy and we'll go into the races that are close, we're slightly ahead or slightly behind. And we're making a lot of stops and this one we're doing for Stevie, he should win.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's really good and he should win. But I will be very upset if he tested but I think he's going to.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> Mr. President, you're the best. You're a great American.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And so are you.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> I say that all the time but you're a great American. Keep doing what you're doing for the voices you don't hear and the faces you don't see. You're going to see a few in an hour or so, but those people, you're the hero. I was with Reagan in '84 when he came here, I thought Reagan was a star, he was the Rolling Stones you're The Beatles. You're on the Ed Sullivan Show. I'm serious about this. Wait to see what happens in Warren County.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Are you going to be down? I wish you'd come if you want. I mean, I'd love to have you. I'd love to have you, we're going to have a lot of fun down there.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> Well, let me see, let me see.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've got to get down there you come backstage with us, okay? I'd love to -- But I really do appreciate your support, Bill. You're such an important voice and you've been with us and you know, just say hello to all your people, you have a lot of them.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> You're a great American.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you very much.
<Bill Cunningham> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you. God bless you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> And Donald Trump joins us now on the phone. Donald, congratulations.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Donald - Donald, are you feeling more presidential this morning?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, yes I get...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Oh, stop it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... more and more presidential.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> No, no. no, no. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> What? What?
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> He's going to sound presidential, hold on. Sound presidential for us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I get more and more presidential as I have victories, absolutely.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Sounds like he's lying in bed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm not.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Okay.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> You sound really excited to be on Morning Joe.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am. It's always exciting.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> What a night. Talk - talk - talk - okay, yes, he's being presidential, intentionally boring.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> It's - it's - it's wonderful. The first time it's happened. All right, so - so should Ted Cruz and John Kasich drop out of the race?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They should have. In fact, I heard they were having a news conference last night to drop out of the race and they canceled the news conference. So, I don't know. Look, they have to play their game. John is now 1 for 47 and Ted is, you know, a disaster. I guess I'm 3.5 million votes up on him or something. It's -- it's a crazy thing. It's crazy. And they have no highway, it's over. So I think we're doing very well. I think we're going to do very well in Indiana. We have the great Bobby Knight endorsing me tonight, which I look forward to, and it's going to be exciting.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So, can you - are -- are you ready to predict that you're going to get to 1,237 and more when it comes to delegates?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've been saying that for a month. I think we're going to get it. I think we're going to get it fairly easily and I think we're going to have an amazing -- I think we're going to do great in Indiana, I think we're going to do great in California, and I think there's some states in between that we're going to get.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Are you - are you going to start turning your attention now to Hillary Clinton and the general election?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A little bit. I want to finish off the final two leftovers, you know, two guys that shouldn't be here. And you know, for the sake of the Republican party, they shouldn't, because we want to unify the Republican party. But I have two people that are still here hanging around, as the expression goes, not going to get anywhere.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And - but it's going to take time and, you know, t's a process. You have to wait a week and then you have to wait another week. Instead of that, we could be raising money for the Republican party, a lot of it. I have a lot of friends who would give a lot of money to the Republican party.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know, we -- we're not going to do it until they find out whether or not I win. I have friends that are going to give tremendous amounts of money to the Republican party.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Yes. Were you surprised last night by the scope of the victories?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yes, talk about that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the scope was fantastic. You know, I was told if I get 50 it's good, and I was told that you couldn't get 50 in all of them because, you know, getting 50, Joe, you and I discussed this and I discussed it at length last night, but getting 50 is very tough when you have three people.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Right.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know, if you look at where I won by 60 and 62, and last week it was 62 in New York, and you have three people, I mean, if you had 62 and you had one person, that's considered a landslide victory, right? And if you win by 5 points, you know, if you're one on two, it would be, you know, really, really amazing. Now, I mean, if you win on a one-on-one by 5 points that's considered pretty much of a landslide, right? So I'm getting, you know, essentially 60 percent against two other candidates.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Pretty amazing.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Are you -- are you at this point, I mean, you have to be thinking about vice presidential picks. Are you starting in your, excuse me...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am in my own mind, but I don't want to talk about him because I don't want to even think about it until this is over. You know, I heard Cruz is going to start to think about vice - you know, vice presidential picks. He may - he may pick Carly Fiorina. And, oh, I see Rhode Island, I'm just looking at your screen, Rhode - Rhode Island is 64. That's a good number.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yes, hey, Donald, listen, by the way, we wanted to talk to you about that. That appears to be your ceiling...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Yes.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> ... and maybe you should just kind of drop out of the race.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know. And it's my ceiling with three people, Joe.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not my -- don't forget, if I had two people, the 64 would have been 80.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Hey, why has - I wrote a column about it in The Washington Post Why has the media underestimated you so badly at every turn? Well, I mean, you -- you've been seeing it, you've been living it, you actually paid a compliment to the media last night, I ask you why you did that. But also, why have they misread you so badly over the past nine, ten months?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm an outsider. I don't play by the traditional rules. I'm self-funding my campaign which maybe has an impact on them. And you know, I think the media is under pressure and I think they look very bad because when I came out, they all said I was going nowhere. I wouldn't announce. You folks were great, but not everybody was. I wouldn't - and you gave me a hard time, too, even. But they said I wouldn't announce.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> When did I give you a hard time?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Well no, we gave you a hard time on things we disagree with, but we always thought that your candidacy was successful.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Yes, we always - we always said...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Which is - we don't understand the people who didn't get it. Mike Barnicle has a question.
<Mike Barnicle> <Positive> Donald, congratulations on your...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, Mike.
<Mike Barnicle> <Negative> ... crushing sweep last night, first of all.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you.
<Mike Barnicle> <Negative> Secondly, of - of all the candidates on both sides of the aisle in the course of this campaign, you have the most resonant campaign message, let's make America great again. It's clearly identifiable. People have clung to it and listened in to you for the past several months. So in your mind, what period of time, or what specific year do you want to make America akin to in the past? What - what year or decade or generation would it be?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> None, because I think we can make it better than it ever was. I think we can actually make this country better. I think if Hillary Clinton gets in, it will never have the opportunity again, because we're going down fast. We're really going down fast. If she gets in, we will never have the opportunity. But -- so there's really none. The -- we're going to have our own era and it's going to be a great era. And there are so many things we can do to make our country rich again, and great again and respected again. And I would say none, Mike.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right, so...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There were some interesting times, but - but you're going to see something -- we will make America greater than ever before.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Donald, last night, Hillary Clinton spoke about you during her victory speech, and it was specifically about gender. Take a look.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh. [Begin Video]
<Hillary Clinton> <Positive> The other day, Mr. Trump accused me of playing the, quote, woman card." Well
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> It seems that would be the one area where perhaps you - I mean, I don't know what - you - you say you have plans for Hillary, but I would think she's incredibly strong on those issues.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I haven't quite recovered, it's early in the morning, from her shouting that message. And I know a lot of people would say you can't say that about a woman, because of course a woman doesn't shout. But the way she shouted that message was not - oh, I just -- that's the way she said it, and it's -- I guess I'll have to get used to a lot of that over the next four or five months.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Well, what about issues pertaining to women that she discussed, including equal pay and right to choose?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, we'll - we'll do -- we're going to do very well. We're going to do very well with Hillary and with women as soon as we start our process against her. We're going to do very well. I don't even know if it's going to be Hillary. I mean, we're all waiting to find out what happens with the e-mail scandal. I - I don't know what's going on with the e-mail scandal. It's taking longer and longer.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's - she's guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, but they don't want to - they don't want to go after her. I -- it's going to be an interesting thing, but she's got a problem because people at the far left are sitting in jail cells.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> I don't think she's guilty... [Crosstalk]
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So, you said Hillary Clinton was shouting her message. I think Bernie Sanders shouts his message, too, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Bernie Sanders has a message that's interesting. I'm going to be taking a lot of the things that Bernie said and using them. I can re-read some of his speeches and I can get some very good material. He said, you know, in many ways she shouldn't be there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He said some things about her that are actually surprising, you know, that essentially she has no right to even be running and she's got bad judgment. When she said - when he said bad judgment, I said, sound bite. But Bernie has been very effective, been treated very badly by the Democrats and by the Democratic party and, frankly, should run as an independent, I think.
<Nicole Wallace> <Neutral> That would work out great for Republicans.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Nicole.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> By - by the way, Nicole - Nicole is here, and her parents were texting her furiously all last night, a good night for Nicole's mother and father.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Yes, they're - they're very - cheered.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, congratulate them. They -- I like - I like Nicole's parents.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> They - pass along the same to you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nicole is a very beautiful, nice woman, but I like her parents perhaps better. [Crosstalk]
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Yes, fair enough. You're giving a national security speech today and I think there's a lot of anticipation created in part by the lengthy interviews you gave to the The Washington Post" editorial board and "The New York Times" editorial board. And I think even you would acknowledge there's a lot of filling in to do about the kind of foreign policy you would execute as president. I wonder if you could take us behind the scenes for that process.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Did you put some of your favorite generals, or thinkers or writers on the plane? Did you debate out some of the, you know, long held conventions about our alliances? Tell us about the process, not just how it was written, but about how you arrived at what you're going to detail today?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we did. We had a lot of very good experts, I'll be naming them today, that helped people of great consequence. I will say that a lot of people that I've - I've looked at have great names and they've been involved with nothing but failure. You know, they have wonderful names. Oh, you should use general so and so, and you should use this one and that one. And they've been - but they've been involved for a long time with the strategy of our war - war plan, which has been going on for...
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> So, no one involved in -- I'm sorry, but no one - so you view Iraq and Afghanistan affair, so you -- no one involved in either going to war or executing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is anyone you would consider to be part of your foreign policy team.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they are considered and I am using some, but I will tell you that there are some that I just couldn't take it anymore, you know, when they're giving me their credentials. One guy walked in, Mr. Trump, I've been involved for 14 years at the highest level of the Iraq war. And I said, well, I would really not be interested in using you, sir, and all due respect and we'll forget about you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know, we need new thinking. We need a lot better thinking because this is ridiculous. What's going on for so many years is ridiculous. And you know, whether we like it or not, there are people out there that haven't had a claim but maybe I like their ideas better.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we have combinations of both. I'll be announcing names later, but we have combinations of both they're very, you know, very good people. All very good -- everybody is a good person, but some ideas just haven't been working and when I see people, you know, like Lindsey Graham working on the war floor as long as he's been in the Senate, and then he says I've been doing this for many years. Well, that's the problem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It shouldn't take many years. It might take many months, it might take many weeks if we had the right people.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> John Hilemann.
<John Heilemann> <Positive> Donald, congratulations. I'm looking forward to this - to your speech today. I'll be down in Washington to hear you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good, John.
<John Heilemann> <Positive> I've got a question about your campaign. I've heard various descriptions now of the roles that Corey Lewandowski and Paul Manafort play. Some people say that, you know, one of them is the CEO, the other one's the COO. You know, I'm putting it in business terms. I'd just like to hear you describe how you see their respective roles and what they do for you within the campaign.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay, so let's go back to the beginning. We started with Corey, and Hope and a few people, right? When everybody said, oh, well, Trump's only going to do this for a few weeks and he's not going to have much fun. And I didn't start with - I didn't start with Hillary where she had 8 or 900 people sitting in an office, in a finished office space in Brooklyn because she has money from PACs and everything else. You know, when you fund your own money, even though I have a lot more money than any PAC, than all the PACs put together, I like to watch my money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, you know, I just sort of like it. I don't know. It's an old habit. And - and what happened - what happened - so, we have a - actually, but far the best in the history of campaigns, we have the best locations.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Joe, would you say that's right, and Mika? In the history of campaigns we have the best location, okay.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> It is. You...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> It's a...
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> .. could afford to build it out a little bit.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> It's got cement walls.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> But I - but I don't...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't want to build it out. No, it's... [Crosstalk] ... concrete walls... [Crosstalk]
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Concrete walls, wires hanging down.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I already have the space rented for a fortune. The day - the day the campaign ends, I get the highest rent in the city. The day the campaign ends, I'll build it out for a computer company. You know, it's one of those things.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yes, yes, yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, it's fine.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But - but I like it in concrete. To me - I like - I actually like it in the concrete, so the other looks sort of ridiculous to me. And there's a rough space, so, we have - we have that. And it started off, and we came in in Iowa second, a close second, got no credit for it, and Marco got a lot of credit for coming in third.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I came -- got no credit for coming in second. It's a race that I could have -- should have come in first actually, and because I had - I had the votes, but the caucus process was not a process that - that I frankly ever heard of, okay? You know, I had - I had -- I'd been doing this for a of couple months.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Hey, Donald, you're - you're locking down the nomination and you're still going back to Iowa.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, they asked me about the campaign.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> You remind me of someone I know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, they asked me about the campaign.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, then we went to New Hampshire, I won it, we went to South Carolina.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We went to all these states and I started winning like crazy and have been winning ever since. But the campaign has gotten bigger, it's evolved, right? And so, we started with Corey as the manager and Hope doing a lot of work. Hope is terrific, too. And all we're doing is adding more people.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, Paul actually gets along very well with Corey. They get along. They have different functions. And they are -- the functions are broken up. But I brought - I brought Paul in because a very, very smart friend of mine who knew him very well said he is fantastic, okay, and - and he's somewhat political, my friend. He's actually a very successful businessman, but he's - he's a political type.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He loves politics, like - like all of you. And he said this guy is fantastic. I brought Paul in, and Paul has done a really good job. And the two guys get along, the only time they don't is when a phony paper like POLITICO" will write a story that has no bearing in truth
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> You're the one in charge. Let me ask you about...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they don't even call me to ask.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Like they would -- they should call me. How are they doing? And I say, they get along great. [Crosstalk]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> It's not like you're not available.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then - and then I'll read a story that is so unbelievably bad, but they don't call me to ask me that question, so they can never know the answer.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I'm telling you, they get along really well.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Doing fine, okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They - they have separate functions, very separate functions, and they're doing great.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> So, let me ask you, in closing, you had said that Bernie Sanders -- by the way, I just want to go back. Yes, we - we have been critical of you from time to time, but we've never questioned, like everybody else, whether you were going to win this thing or not because it seemed obvious to us, especially Mika, from the beginning, that you would.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Mika knows talent, I will say. She's like a talent scout.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Exactly, she's been trying to get me fired for nine years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She - she knows - she knows great talent.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yes, she does.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And Jeb Bush does, because in the midst of the campaign, Jeb Bush said Donald Trump, he calls me Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump is a gifted politician. So... [Crosstalk]
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> There you go.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Yes, you are.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> So, there you get that.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> I think you're more than a politician.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> So - so let me ask you, let me ask you though, you had said last night that Bernie Sanders was not being treated fairly by the Democratic party. You said it again this morning.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> I agree with that.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> And yes, we - we certainly agree with that. They have been -- that process has been rigged from day one. Let me ask you, though, on the Republican side, how is the RNC treating you? Are you being treated fairly...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Are you talking with them?
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> .. and with sufficient respect? And if you win the nomination, are you going to clear out the RNC and get new leadership there, are you going to keep Reince Priebus and everybody else in place?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I get along with Reince well, I like him a lot, he likes me, I think, as much as you can like somebody that is causing a little bit of difficulty by all these wins. You know, these wins were not supposed to be, they were supposed to pick a senator who would have lost, or they were supposed to pick a, you know, congressman generally, Senate -- not so much a congressman, but sometimes, or they were supposed to pick a governor. I mean, that was the way it was supposed to be. Then you had Ben Carson come in.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a - he's a great guy, he endorsed me and he's a great guy. And he was effective, he was actually very effective. He was the most effective in a sense. And Chris Christie came in, a lot of them did well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A lot of them did much better than Kasich, but they didn't stay in. Now, you look Marco, as an example, Marco rubio has far more delegates than Kasich and - and, you know, he didn't stay in. He said, well, it's - it's -- I've got to get out now and he did the right thing. And Kasich should get out also.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I - I think, Joe, that this is a campaign that has a lot of legs, it's a campaign that has a lot of - a lot of good brain power, and I think it's a campaign that's just going to work right to the end.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> But - but - but are you going to work with the RNC or are you -- if you win the nomination, are you going to get a new group of people in there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm going to try, Joe. I think so. I mean, the campaign, the - the -- and - and to a certain extent the RNC inherited this, but this delegate system is a scam. It's a scam. Now, with that being said, in Pennsylvania I did really well, because I got the 17, plus I got many, many more that are already pledged that you - I have -- I don't think have reported, but I have many. They have a great - a great chairman there.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Rob Gleason. And I have - a great -- really a great leader. And I got many, many delegates in Pennsylvania that you people haven't been reporting on because you don't know yet, and - and it will be announced, but a lot of them. And you know, we did the whole pledge card thing.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And we -- but the - but the whole system of - of what's being going on, where I win in Louisiana and end up with less delegates.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Oh, it's outrageous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The whole system is a scam.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> And you know, right now, Donald...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the whole system is rigged.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right now, Donald, we're - we're showing showing...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hey, Joe, the only way I...
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> ... we're showing Pennsylvania right now. The entire state, it's all red. You won every county in the entire state. It is hard to believe that every single delegate there is not going to back you. If they don't, that is a scam and it's a rigged process.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> They're not representing Pennsylvania.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> And I would be saying that... [Crosstalk] .... I would be saying that if John Kasich or Ted Cruz won every county. You won every county...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> How do you not automatically get every delegate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Every single - by the way, every single county, so I should get every delegate. And in Pennsylvania they do have a morals provision where they will back, you know, they - they're morally inclined to back if - if you win, and I won everything there.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I will say this, right now in Pennsylvania you have lying Ted Cruz and his staff of honchos, and they're going around trying to pick-off people, they're taking them to breakfast, they're taking them to lunch, they're taking them to dinner. They're all over the place. And he lost the state, in fact, he did horribly in the state. And you know, he only - out of five states, I think he only came in second in one. I mean, Ted Cruz, in all fairness to John Kasich who should not be in it, 1-for-46, Ted Cruz last night came in fourth --came in third in four states.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Third, yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, so I don't know. I don't know where he's going.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Ted doesn't have the ability to get votes. Mika picked that up a long time ago, perhaps faster than anybody else. Mika gets nauseous when she watches this guy speak.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Now, come on.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And frankly, Ted - Ted Cruz...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> I do, I do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... cannot -- I'm trying to be nice to you, okay?
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Stop.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> No, I appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Ted Cruz cannot get votes. The only way Ted Cruz gets votes is when - when it's a scam deal. He'll go to Colorado where they don't vote, he'll go to Wyoming where they don't vote, he'll go to a caucus which the caucus is fixed. The guy can't get votes. He's not a good politician.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And - so, but he shouldn't be trying to pick-off delegates. We should get 100 percent of the delegates in Pennsylvania, and it looks like that's where we're heading.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> We're looking at that story closely. We'll be watching. Donald Trump, congratulations.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Congratulations. A huge night, Donald.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Thank you, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you very much. I really appreciate it.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right. Talk to you soon.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> So, what did Donald Trump do? He wrote a book, that's what he did, and he called it Surviving at the Top. Some might say, "what arrogance, what nerve." But his publishers have every reason to believe it will be a best seller.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Trump's name has been a magnet, and his first book, The Art of the Deal, was at the top of the best -- seller list for weeks. Donald Trump may have his problems, but he's not a quitter. A lesser man might have thrown up his hands at the events of the last several months. Trump's answer is: bravado.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> This spectacular display in April was a Trump extravaganza. But even fireworks couldn't vanquish the aura of vedink [sp?] that clings to this most expensive casino ever, anywhere. It's Donald Trump's billion-dollar Taj Mahal, which's been setting Atlantic City gambling records since this opening day.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> But it's still barely breaking even. And the Taj is draining revenues from the other two casinos that Trump owns. But the Taj Mahal's opening did steal headlines for a few days from the soap opera of Trump's personal life. First, in February, there was the publicity over his separation from his glamorous wife of 13 years, Ivana.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Add to that the spice of his friendship with an also glamorous model, the younger Marla Maples. And the tabloids had a field day. On the business side, there were growing financial problems.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> In May, Forbes magazine reported that Trump's financial work had dropped by two-thirds to half a billion dollars. In June, Trump missed a payment to the bond holders of his Trump Castle Casino in Atlantic City. The Trump shuttle, which he bought last year from Eastern Airlines, wasn't making a profit. Manhattan's largest tract of undeveloped land, all 76 acres of it, was just sitting there. Trump bought it six years ago for $95 million. It's still undeveloped, and there are no buyers in sight.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Trump's bankers had a choice: they could force him into bankruptcy, or loan him more money. They chose to lend, but the terms were harsh. He had to relinquish a great deal of control over his empire, and Trump had to either get his assets to produce more money or sell them. Assets like this jewel, the Plaza Hotel, marking its second year under Trump ownership. It's still struggling out of debt.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Above it all, literally, sat a confident Donald Trump. From his 26th floor office in nearby Trump Tower, he was reassessing his options. Trump's office wall is decorated with magazine covers of happier times, but there are none on his wall from the past several months. And Trump had recently been reluctant to see reporters.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> But as his new book reached the stores -- today is publication day -- he agreed to talk with me. For it's particularly important to him, these days, for this book to be a success.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> While the new book is entitled Surviving at the Top, there are many people who would say, "failing at the top."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think what the press has done is taken a situation where they see something and blown it to kingdom come. I've never seen anything like it. Whether it's a marriage, by the way, or whether it's financial, I've never seen press reporting as I have with regard to me. I hope the general public understands how inherently dishonest the press in this country is.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> As a member of the press, let me try to clear up some of the things which you say are untrue. You write in your book, "My bankers and I worked out a terrific deal. It allows me to come out stronger than ever. I see the deal as a great victory, and eventually, the rest of the world will, too." Being on the verge of bankruptcy, being bailed out by the bank - --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You don't have to say - --
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> -- what, skating on thin ice and almost drowning. That's a business man to be admired?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You say on the verge of bankruptcy, Barbara, and you talk on the verge, and you listen to what people are saying - --
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> I talked to your bankers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's fine, and what did they say? I mean, you know, depending on which banker you're talking to - --
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Several.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- what did they say? The deal I worked out is in the process. The deal I worked out is something that I think is good for everybody. The economy is down the tubes. Nobody knows how bad the economy is. I listen to the people on Wall Street, talking about the possibility of a recession. We're not in a recession. We're in a depression.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, when you're in a depression, you have to sort of go with the punches. You have to go see your banks, you have to deal with people, you have to work things out. And there are a lot of people -- unfortunately, I'm the only one people write about. I mean, they don't write about other people.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> You have a little more debt than most people. You're something like $3 billion in debt.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I also have a little more assets than most people.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, it's sort of an interesting phenomenon. I have many friends -- they are negotiating with their banks the same as I am. And I always say to them, "How come you never get any publicity? You don't end up on the front page of the various garbage tabloids."
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> They weren't on the front pages to begin with. They don't have 50 magazine covers behind them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you, they also don't end up in the Wall Street Journal, and I do.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Let's try to be accurate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Some of your friends have told us that you deliberately missed a payment on the Trump Castle debt, so that you could negotiate this deal with the bank. Is that true?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Did I deliberately miss it? In other words, did I just say "I'm not paying it?"
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Yeah, because, "then I can deal with my banks, and I can get short-term agreements over the long term."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't want to comment as to whether or not I deliberately missed a payment.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Why not? That's important.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think that the deal that's been worked is a fair deal. The Castle is doing very well, it's starting to deal really well. Atlantic City is in the midst of a recessionary area. People are not going down like they used to, because they don't have the money.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> And the Taj Mahal, which was going to save everything, is just about breaking even, and your other two casinos are down 20 percent from last year. You have debts to pay back.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> You have huge loans to pay back. You say the country is in a depression. What makes you think that you can pay back those loans, and further, what your bankers have told us is that the only way you even have a chance is by selling that property out there, totally, the Plaza.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't know what the bankers have said. The Plaza's a very valuable property. Everybody told me, "Oh, you paid too much. You paid too much." Now they're all saying, "What a great deal he made on the Plaza."
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> No, they're not.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think you'll find that it's a great deal, when the deal is all said and done. I mean, the Plaza is doing very well. The Taj Mahal broke every record. That doesn't mean it's doing well, but the Taj Mahal, last month, had the highest win in the history of casino gaming.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> I know, but it still was not enough -- it just barely broke even in terms of what it cost you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's doing record business, but it has to do probably more than record business.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Your bankers wish you well. When I talked to your bankers, they said "we hope he does it." What I am saying to is, you did over extend yourself. Okay?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> All right. How are you going to get out of this mess, surviving at the top, when everything is down, and you owe a tremendous amount of money?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> 'Cause I have great - --
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Are you going to sell that Plaza?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know why? 'Cause I have great assets.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Are you going to sell the shuttle? Are you going to sell them?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The answer is: because I have great assets, and the assets are doing very well. Take the Trump shuttle. Take the shuttle.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Not enough to pay back your debts.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Barbara, other people owe money far in access what their assets are. They have lousy assets. I have great assets. I have the best assets.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> You gotta sell them in order to pay back your bills.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Perhaps you have to sell some of them. No, I don't have to sell all of them. Perhaps I'll have to sell some of them.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Which ones?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's unlikely the Plaza gets sold. I think it's unlikely the shuttle gets sold. The shuttle is doing very well. We started off with 12 percent of the market, we're up to 50 percent of the market. Now what happens with the fuel oil, I don't know.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Have you had any bidders? Anyone want to buy it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, absolutely.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Why haven't you sold it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because I'm not satisfied with the price, and because I'm not sure that I'm looking to sell the shuttle.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Suppose things don't turn up. They don't get better. And you have to sell them all. And you may, and you may. And you've got the railroad yards on the West Side, you can't develop them. They're sitting there. You've got a lot of problems. Suppose it doesn't get better. Is it surviving at the top? Can you start all over again?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, I think it's surviving at the top, Barbara. If the economy goes further bad, and that's a possibility. That can happen. I'd have to sell more assets. But the assets are world-class assets that have values far in excess of the debt.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> You say in your book, and I quote, "The truth is, that almost nothing in life is what it's cracked up to be, except the battle to get where you want to go." Well, many people disagree, they enjoy their work and their families. They have hobbies, they have interests. They don't think that nothing in life is what it's cracked up to be. That's rather cynical.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that a lot of people would disagree with that. I think most people would disagree. And I think that's great, I mean, that's what it's all about.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Nothing you get, or got, or have is what it's cracked up to be?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very little.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> In your book you say, "Success is so often a matter a perception." What do you think the perception of you is today?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I really don't know what the perception is. I think people see me as a fighter. I think people have always seen me as a fighter. They know that I don't take a lot of crap from people and from others. And my life would be a lot easier if I did, to be perfectly honest.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> In the current issue of Vanity Fair, the author, Marie Brenner says that you read from Hitler's collective speeches, My New Order. And that these are speeches that you seem to admire. What's your reaction? Do you have this book? Do you have these speeches?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. A friend of mine sent me a book. A man who I think is Jewish, although I don't know -- sent me a book. It happened to be that book. All of a sudden Marie Brenner somehow found out that he had sent me a book. It is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen, and I'm probably going to sue Vanity Fair over it.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> The author, Marie Brenner, quotes you as saying to her, "When a man leaves a woman, especially when it was perceived that he has left for a piece of ass -- a good one -- there are 50 percent of the population who will love the woman who was left."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do remember saying that. I don't remember having used those words. That's possible. But I believe that if a man leaves a woman for almost any reason, that that particular person, the man, is going to be at a major disadvantage in terms of the public eye, there's no question about it.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Do you think that your marital problems with Ivana, in some way, cause some of this to happen?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Probably.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Is there a connection? What is the connection?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think there was a -- that the publicity was so huge, so intense, so incredibly intense. I mean, 22 days in a row, or something, on the cover of the tabloids. It's never been anything like that, and it's disgraceful. And somehow, in a bad economy, people focused on me as opposed to everybody else.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I signed a prenuptial agreement with Ivana. The reason for a prenuptial agreement is it takes away uncertainty. When it takes away uncertainty, it's quiet, it's nice, it's clean, everything. Well, Ivana decided to sue me on it. Brilliantly decided to sue me on it. So now she sued - --
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Brilliantly?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, brilliantly, sarcastically brilliantly.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> I see.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She decides to sue me on it. She's not going to win the suit. I thought it was dishonorable to do it, but she decided to do it. That caused tremendous turmoil, tremendous publicity, tremendous everything else. And I have no doubt in my mind that that was a very negative factor. There's no question in my mind.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> There's some confusion as to you marital state. You're still married, but you've told friends that you'll probably be divorced.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am still married. I don't know what the legal definition of marriage is, to be perfectly honest.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> You don't the legal definition of marriage?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The legal definition of marriage in this context. I am married. I don't know whether or not you'd consider it a separation. I can't tell you what's going to happen because I'm not even sure I know myself.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> You've said in your book that Marla Maples did not cause the breakup of your marriage, that you and Ivana would have split anyway. But didn't it hasten it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Had nothing to do with it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's an absolute correct statement. Marla Maples is a friend of mine. I have a lot of other friends. It -- nobody caused - --
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> You treat the other friends the same way?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean they had me -- they had me going out with every woman in the United States.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> We're not talking about that. We're talking about this one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Marla Maples is a friend. I have a lot of friends. Did it hasten the breakup? Absolutely -- in my opinion, absolutely not. The breakup was going to occur. And I'm not going to disparage Ivana. You'll never hear me disparage Ivana, for one reason. She's the mother of my children, I'm not disparaging. But you grow apart.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> While we're talking about Ivana as a mother, there have been reports recently, in the paper, some of them attributed to Marla, that Ivana is not a good mother. That she has left her children this summer. But the truth is that she is with her children right now, on a boat - --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think Ivana's a very good mother.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ivana's a good mother.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> And the -- also, the truth is, that you yourself said that you saw your children maybe once a week. You're having a lot of difficulties with your 12-year-old son, Donnie. You haven't talked to him since May. I mean, this is a very painful situation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am not going to disparage Ivana as a woman or as a mother.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> You do say she is a good mother.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I say she's a good mother. I say that Ivana is fine. As far as myself, I think I'm a very good father. I've been a very good provider, and I guess you have to leave it like that, Barbara. I mean, what can I say?
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Do you believe in fidelity in marriage?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, absolutely I do. Absolutely. I think that there's nothing better than a good marriage. There is nothing worse than a bad marriage. I'm absolutely a believer in marriage, I'm an absolute believer in fidelity. But if a marriage isn't working, that's a different ball game.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> I want to clear something up. In your book, the new book, you say, "The fun is in the getting, not the having." Does that include women? No kidding.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Interesting question. I think the hunt is always fun, whether it's deals, whether it's women, whether it's anything. I think, however, that with respect to women, there would be nothing that would make me happier than having a great marriage. An absolutely great marriage, and that would certainly supersede the hunt.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> My colleague, Diane Sawyer, did an interview with Marla, in which Marla said that she loves you. Do you love her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not going to comment on it. I'm not going to talk about it.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> And that's where Trump drew the line. He's still in litigation with Ivana over the validity of the prenuptial agreement. Because of that, he said, he would not discuss Marla any further.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> With all of the publicity, and with the way that you have answered, there are people who say "Why won't he show some humility?" Why say surviving at the top?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that means a lot of things. Surviving at the top - --
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Well, I mean, you never say , "I made mistakes. Gee, I'm in trouble." Things are bad.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everybody makes mistakes.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> You haven't said it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I make mistakes.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> I mean, people don't think you show any humility.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know. I mean, I think that I'm a rather -- and you will be surprised, but I can be a rather humble person if I want to be. If I feel I'm in the right environment. You're always guarded. I'm not going to let my guard down because you happen to be asking me questions. You're somebody that I know and have a great respect for, but I'm not going to let my guard down because Barbara's here asking me questions.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> I can understand that. You have a brother, whom you were very close to, Robert. You had another brother, Fred Jr., who died. Who just somehow couldn't make it in life. What did you learn from that, or did you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it relates to your previous question. I mean, Freddie was a great guy, had everything. He was very open. Very much the opposite, in a sense, he was very open. And because of his openness, he got himself into a lot of trouble. And ultimately it was alcohol that just decimated him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was a horror show. And it really took Freddie's life, alcohol. And I'm glad I'm not drinker. I mean, I've never had a drink in my life. But frankly, you know, it gives you the opportunity if you do -- the negative opportunity -- that if you do, it can really hurt you. And it hurt him.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> Your brother was open. Too vulnerable, maybe. Drank. Did this make you, I don't know, close up? Keep it all inside?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I learned a lot of things from Fred. But I did learn for myself that I don't want to be open. I don't want to make myself vulnerable. I also learned that you have to do what you want to do.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> You say, "Just wait five years." Look ahead five years. Where is Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know. There's too many variables. You live for today, you do for today.
<Barbara Walters> <Neutral> Is today okay?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Today's okay. Hey, today's not great. I mean, between a marriage and between all the struggles and between life and everything else, I mean, it's not like it's the greatest time of my life, but it's not the worst. I've had a much worse time in my life. And I live very much for the moment. I think the future is very important, but the moment is here. You don't know if you're going to be in the future.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> So where do Donald and Ivana go from here? Well, Ivana is still running the Plaza Hotel, and she's in town, taking care of her three children. Her future looks good. She's handled the situation with discretion and has received many offers to come out with her own line of products. As for Donald, well, this week he received yet another blow.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> When the New Jersey Casino Control Commission revealed that his financial empire is worth far less than he claimed last year. And further, if he had been forced to sell his assets this spring, they say he might not have realized enough money to get out of debt. Still, with all of his troubles, there's something very disarming about Donald Trump, and he possesses both courage and daring.
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> Like him or not, the man is an original, determined to survive at the top. Well, coming up next, we're going to bring you a man who, if possible, is even more controversial than Donald Trump. The man who runs the Yankees for just three more days. An exclusive interview with baseball's most famous owner, George Steinbrenner.
