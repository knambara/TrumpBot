<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> And Donald Trump is joining us right now on the phone. How did that meeting with Mitt Romney go, Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I think it went really well. We had the meeting at Trump Tower, and I learned a lot about him. I think he learned a lot about me. We had a really great meeting I think, Wolf.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> Because, you know, last April -- and we looked it up -- you were not all that positive about his chances. You didn't think necessarily he resonated with voters. But that's changed? Is that what you are saying?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think he did really well in the debates and he's showing something that's very good. We have to see. It's a long way to go and nobody is endorsing anybody. And we'll have to see how it all really comes out. But we had a really good meeting and I think we'll have other meetings. We hit it off very well, I will say. I think even better than I had anticipated.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> That wasn't the first time you've ever met him, was it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I've met him before.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> So what did you talk about specifically?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't want to get into that too much, but we discussed the basic points. And one of the things that I hit very hard, and I think he is real believer, is that China is taking tremendous advantage of this country, and we can't get in country back on track unless we do something about China and unless we do something about OPEC. Every time the country starts getting a little more solid, OPEC raises the price of fuel and raises the price of oil.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And all of a sudden, we go off and nobody knows why. But every single time a good report comes out, they raise the price of oil, and it's disgraceful. And we discussed that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he's a believer. And I think we just agree on certain very important issues.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> Was there anything you disagreed with him on?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't want to comment on that, but certainly we agreed on a lot of things. And I just think it's extremely important for the right candidate. I mean, if the right candidate doesn't comes along, somebody else is going to come along. I just think it's very, ,very important that right candidate go against President Obama and wins. This election is vital.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> Did he ask for your advice, Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't want to put it that way, but certainly we threw out ideas that I think both of us either agreed on or certainly are subject to agree on. And we had a great talk.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> Here is a question that's already come up. There were a lot of camera crews, as you can imagine, waiting outside of Trump Tower. They wanted to get a picture of you and Mitt Romney, but no photo opportunity, no picture and contrast to some of your other meetings with the Republican president candidates. Was that deliberate or was that just a snafu? What happened?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it was deliberate. And we wanted it keep it as private as we could. We also -- you know, from the standpoint of Mitt, there is no endorsement or anything at this point. It's very early in the process. And I think that I'm not sure that either of us would have felt comfortable at this point with pictures.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> Because there were pictures with Rick Perry and Sarah Palin and others, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, yes, but the cameras are pretty good. I guess maybe we did a better job this time.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> What did you think -- who was more impressive, Rick Perry or Mitt Romney?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't want to say. That's an unfair question, I think. I certainly wouldn't say that because I had great meetings with both, and with Michele Bachmann and, frankly, with Sarah Palin. And I don't know what Sarah is going to be doing. I guess people are waiting and waiting. And really, it's sort of an amazing thing. We just don't know. She is hard to figure. And maybe that's not so bad, that she is hard to figure. But I don't think it would be a fair question or a fair answer.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> You say Mitt Romney has done well in the debates. Rick Perry, everyone seems to agree, hasn't necessarily done all that well. You watched the debates. What did you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, actually, I was in Australia, and I came back and I watched the debates. And I think press was very, very tough on Rick Perry. But certainly, I would think he would be the first to admit it wasn't his finest hour, or, as the expression goes, two hours. He didn't do as well as he would have liked, I guess. But I think the press was extremely tough on him. I do think Mitt did very well. And I think he did better than press is reporting, but let's see what happens.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> Do you think it's still possible that another candidate could emerge like Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, despite all of his repeated assertions that he's not running?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Chris is a very good friend of mine and I know him very well. And I have been with him for a long time, and I just don't think he's running. I think he has been a great governor. And I own a lot of property in New Jersey. And I can tell you, he has had a positive impact on New Jersey and values and even the image of New Jersey. But I just don't see him running. I really don't believe he is going to run. I mean, he has told me the same thing as he has told everybody else. And, you know, I hear all of these reports where he is thinking about it and he is giving it another thought. I just don't see it happening.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> Because the last person who seemed to suggest that it's still possible was the former governor, Tom Kean, of New Jersey, quoted as saying that maybe Governor Christie is in fact rethinking his refusal to run. And they go back a long time, as you probably know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true. That's true. I don't think he is. I think he has really made up his mind. But the world and life is full of surprises.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> This is still a wide-open race. I wrote about that on my blog, my Situation Room blog today. Donald, I'm going to play a little clip. This is a new DNC ad. I don't know if you have seen it yet, but listen to it, and then we'll discuss, because it mentions you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK.
<Narrator> <Positive> Mitt Romney and Donald Trump are meeting today. Well, they do have a lot in common. They both have done well for themselves.
<Narrator> <Positive> Both support an economic plan that will help out the richest and the big corporations, but not the middle class; that would slash Social Security and Medicare as we know it; cut funds for health care, research and development, and schools; eliminate investments that will create jobs and keep America competitive.
<Narrator> <Negative> And what do the American people have to say to those who would return to the same failed policies that created our challenges?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I -- If I -- [End Clip]
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> It ends with a picture of you, sort of -- it's an obvious statement. What did you think of that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, actually, I got to see that. I saw it on one of the shows this morning, and I thought was amateur night. The ad was, you know, not a very good one. It was also -- you know, they talk about keeping America competitive. We're not competitive. That's the problem. We're not competitive at all. The world is laughing at us, Wolf. And so we're certainly not.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I was very insulted at the airplane they used because my plane is much, much nicer than that, so that was a great insult. And of course I say that with a smile, because somebody will write that Trump was really insulted. That's the way the press does it. But I thought it was amateur night, personally. I just didn't think it was a very effective commercial. Maybe it is. I do say this though -- when they talk about America being competitive and effective, we are not competitive right now, we are not a competitive nation any longer. We have lost our competitive zeal and drive. And we need the right leader.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> I will leave you with one final question. I don't know if you saw the brand new Forbes 400 list which just came out. A year ago we were in your office when it just came out. Right now you are number 128 with a worth of $2.9 billion. Is that accurate?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's not. But it's OK. Certainly, I will be able to eat well. But it's not an accurate number at all, no.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> So you have more or you've got less?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, they don't know -- well, I don't want to even comment, but they don't know my numbers. I'm a private company, and they don't know my numbers. And I think they are very professional, I think they try, but it's not an accurate number, no.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> All right. So you won't tell us if it's high or low. I assume you think it's low, but that's just my assumption.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I can say that. Yes, it's low.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> It is low. OK. Because last year --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That I can say. It is not accurate.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> ' -- you told me flatly, whatever number they had a year ago, you thought was low also.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't even know. What was the number a year ago?
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> I don't remember what it was, but I remember you said --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Did I go up? I guess I went up.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> I think you did go up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Good. So that means not too many people went up. At least I went up.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> It's been a good year for Donald Trump . I'm not surprised. Hey, Donald, thanks very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. [End Clip]
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> We did some checking. Last year, his net worth, according to Forbes, was $2.4 billion, now $2.9 billion, so he went up a half billion dollars, according to the Forbes 400 list.
