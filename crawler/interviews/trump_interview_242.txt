<Reporter> <Positive> What is the future of The Apprentice franchise going to be going forward?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think very [Inaudible]. It's going so well, and so nice, and I think it's going to be very [Inaudible].
<Reporter> <Negative> Has the network approached you about making a [Inaudible]?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yea, they wanna do it, they wanna do it.
<Reporter> <Neutral> And will we ever see the traditional Apprentice again?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There might very well be. I have so many people asking that question, so many people on Twitter and Facebook, where they'd like to see the traditional Apprentice. So that could happen, yes.
<Reporter> <Positive> Would you like to see that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I sort of would. I mean, I love this. This is, this is more fun for me personally. But that could happen.
<Reporter> <Positive> You have to tell us why you don't like Bill Cosby. You can't just bait us like that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, there was just an incident that took place years ago that I thought he was, I didn't think he handled it well, and I didn't like him for that reason. It just stuck in my mind. Nothing to do with his situation. It was just an incident that happened years ago that I did not think he was, led me to believe he was not a good guy.
<Reporter> <Negative> OK. Gotcha. What do you think it is about the format keeps it so popular with viewers all these years later?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think we have a good cast. Look, we've had 15 copies of The Apprentice -- 15 -- cause I consider The Apprentice and Celebrity Apprentice sort of the same thing. So we've had, we're in Season 14, this is the end of Season 14. We've had 15 copies, the Mark Cuban copy, Richard Branson copy, Tommy Hilfiger copy, Hilton, many many others.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Every one of them failed. And here we are in, you know, 10 years 14 seasons. So there's something going on.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think I do a good job. Everybody said I should have gotten an Emmy. I agree with that 100 percent, but I'm not in the establishment so they wouldn't give me an Emmy. On the first show, everybody, everybody said there's no way that Trump doesn't get the Emmy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And when they announced the Emmy I stood up and started walking down to pick it up, and it wasn't me. It was this crazy Amazing Race. So we blew them away in the ratings and everything else. I literally, 'And the Emmy goes to.' They said he did a great job, he earned it, and I stood up to go and I start walking down, and I said, 'Well wait a minute, that wasn't me.' They announced Amazing Race.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was called give me a break. But, it's just a good show. It's a show that works, and the cast is important, and I will say I cannot overestimate the fact that we're back to one hour per show. Two hours is a long show, you know, Gone With The Wind is a little bit more.
<Reporter> <Neutral> Three hours, it's sometimes you used to do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we actually had three-hour shows. And, you know, when you get to two hours and three hours, you're talking about Gone With the Wind territory, right? And that's hard to compete with, so the fact that we're back to one-hour shows is so important. Now you can have a nice boardroom and a nice desk.
<Reporter> <Negative> [Inaudible] sometimes there can be too much Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In what way? You mean for the longer shows [Inaudible] That's a terrible thing for me to admit. Too much Trump, I agree. I'll admit it.
<Reporter> <Neutral> Do you have final say in who participates, and did you all know everybody beforehand?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I have final say, and I recommend some. I mean, one of the people I'd like to have on the show is Pete Rose. They say, most people want to go to the show and it's been great for careers. I said about some of the people that won, but the truth is many of the people that lost also do great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, if they're on four or five episodes they do great. But I will say that, and I would like to have Pete Rose. You know, I call him, I said, 'Pete why don't you do it?' He said, 'I couldn't stand if you ever fired me.' You know, he just doesn't want to be fired, it's very interesting. But there are a few people, but for the most part it is really easy to get people to do the show.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They really want to do the show. It's not easy to do, either. They find that out later. But we have a tremendous group of people that want to do the show.
<Reporter> <Negative> Why does it seem like it's the same people all the time? Half the panel here was on Dancing With the Stars, it seems like there's a very small pool.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there's a group of people I guess, that sort of work. You know, I mean, in the world you have actually a lot of celebrities, but, you know, you have certain celebrities that work. We do want to pick celebrities that are gonna work.
<Reporter> <Negative> You have any thoughts about the 2016 presidential race and are your own aspirations for that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. Well I'm going to make a decision over the next number of months.
<Reporter> <Neutral> You're still considering it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh yea, I'm seriously considering it. Absolutely.
<Reporter> <Neutral> And what was the conversation --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, the last thing we need is another Bush. The last thing we need is a retread like Romney, who failed the first time. I mean, he failed miserably, should have won that race. We don't need Romney and we don't need another Bush.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yea, I'm giving it serious thought.
<Reporter> <Positive> What were the conversations like with NBC when you were contemplating running?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No conversation. Well obviously, I can't run during the show.
<Reporter> <Neutral> Because of equal time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can't run during the show. You have a thing, equal time, which I don't know if that makes sense or not. But during the show I can't. The last time the show was going on at the same time as the race, you know, it would have been an impossible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But this is, the timing is amazing here. The show goes off in February. So I'm, after that I can do what I wanna do. Now, they want to renew the show.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, they want more of these shows.
<Reporter> <Neutral> If not you, who would you support?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In terms of politically? At this moment, it's too early to tell. I don't know who is running yet.
<Reporter> <Neutral> Maybe you could have Mitt Romney on as a contestant.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll put Mitt on as a contestant. He'd do very well, actually.
<Reporter> <Neutral> Would you let Burnett make a show out of it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's very int-- nobody's asked me that, out of the run, you mean, out the run? That's a very inter -- where's Mark? Hey Mark, they have the greatest question. Can I steal him for a second? C'mere c'mere.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Clay Aiken was here yesterday, [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's an amazing question. Go ahead, ask him. This is an amazing question. They said, 'Are you going to run for president, and, if so, would you let Mark Burnett make a show out of the run?' I said, 'That is sicker than Mark.'
<Reporter> <Negative> Hate to put you on the spot, Mark.
<Reporter> <Neutral> Would you make a show?
<Mark Burnett> <Negative> I'm not sure. Are you allowed to do that? I mean, I think if you do that, don't you have to, I guess you can make a movie about it, but for a show, it's gotta be equal time, isn't it?
<Reporter> <Neutral> Yea.
<Reporter> <Negative> Would have to air after the election, probably.
<Reporter> <Neutral> Yea.
<Reporter> <Negative> A lot of Republicans thought you were seriously considering running for governor.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh really? is that true? Well, they wanted me to. Look, you know I never said yes. They came to me, they saw me, I had groups of 40, 50 of the top leaders come. I just had no interest in running for governor.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do have interest in the other situation but I had no [Inaudible] pretty close, I kept saying no. And they kept coming. In retrospect they were right because the other guy never had a chance.
<Reporter> <Negative> Mr. Trump, every time a squad, professional sports team comes up for sale, your name comes up either [Inaudible] do you have actual interest in owning a sports team?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not much. I did put a bid in on Buffalo, a billion-dollar bid. But generally speaking, not much. They use my name all the time, you know, because they think they're going to build up the price.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> 'Oh, Trump wants it, Trump wants it.' That happens in real estate too. A piece of real estate's for sale in some location that I never even heard of. All of a sudden I hear I'm one of the bidders. They use my name all the time.
<Reporter> <Negative> Mr. Trump, you're the king of knowing how to fire someone. Can you give me a few tips on how to fire?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well the main tip is to make sure they're bad, and if they're bad just fire their ass. [Laughter]
<Reporter> <Negative> Do you ever find yourself looking back on a boardroom decision and saying, 'Well maybe I didn't ---
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Yes.
<Reporter> <Neutral> Any in particular?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've had some. I won't mention them, but I've had some decisions that I've second-guessed myself. Not generally. You know, we're only human.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But there are some decisions where if I had it to do again I might have made a different decision.
<Reporter> <Neutral> You can't tell us what they were?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because it's, you know, what's past is past. But, you know, I've had some very tough decisions to make. I mean, I have some, I'll tell you, Nick Jonas was a tough decision.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was a tough decision. It didn't have to go that way. I mean, he was, he did a good job. I don't think it was the wrong dec-- but have had some where I really second-guessed myself bigly.
<Reporter> <Negative> We were shown a documentary, HBO, down here about the jinx, about the real-estate family [Inaudible] and have you seen that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Reporter> <Negative> You know anything about it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, what is it?
<Reporter> <Negative> It's the murder, the member of that family --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, Durst?
<Reporter> <Neutral> Yea.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm not a fan of Durst. I think Durst is the brother, the real-estate brother. And I'm not a fan of him at all. And, frankly, his brother, who's obviously got some difficulties, perhaps was not treated very well by the brother that's one of my competitors.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Which could be a problem [Inaudible].
<Reporter> <Negative> If you were seriously to consider a run for president or any other office, would you be concerned that, sort of, your reputation as a ringleader of this three-ring circus that is The Apprentice, and Twitter feuds and all that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I think this has been great for me, too. I mean, you know, first of all, it's been amazingly profitable but, I mean, it's been just an amazing thing. And I think it's been overall very good for my brand.
<Reporter> <Negative> But credibility-wise, do you think you'd be taken seriously?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I think so. I mean, I really think so. Look, it's a show, it's done well, it's been, you know, one of the most successful shows and, you know, [Inaudible] Season 1, you remember that, that was a monster. And continues to do really well, and I have a lot of fun with it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No I think, I don't see that as being a difficulty. No.
<Reporter> <Positive> Now, I'm based in Vancouver and you're changing the Vancouver skyline right now. What can you tell us about that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's going to be a great job. We have fantastic success with it. It's a fantastic market. It's a twisting, beautiful building.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's incredible architecture, and Vancouver is a great place. So say hello to the folks. Tell them we're very proud. That's what I mean, I'm doing all these jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He said Vancouver. I'm doing a job in Vancouver. It's not that easy. You know, it's easy for these characters that are politicians to say, 'I'm gonna run.' With me, it's, it's a big, and The Apprentice is the least of it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, this is one thing, but with me I'm building buildings all over the world, Vancouver's one of the places, and it's not as easy for me to say, 'Oh, I'm gonna run.' But I think that's what the country needs now. The country needs somebody that's, you know, understands the art of the deal.
<Reporter> <Positive> Were you happy with the way the building turned out in Toronto?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's been a very good building, yes, it's doing very well. Doing very well.
<Reporter> <Positive> Is keeping that option open, too, like you said, you've got all these things going on, like, for sports ownership, too. You get involved with that, then people identify you with that, people are always [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think the sports ownership to me is less likely but I'm doing like amazing real-estate deals, and that makes it more difficult for me just in terms of timing. A politician, all they have to do is say, 'I'm running for office' and they start running. With me, you know, it's, with jobs all over, and I am very proud of that job in Vancouver.
<Unknown speaker> <Positive> Mr. Trump, we're gonna wrap it here.
<Reporter> <Negative> Wouldn't you actually be losing money if you run for the presidency?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Tremendous. You have no idea how much. Tremendous, but it's not about that. If I ran, I would like to make America great again.
<Reporter> <Neutral> How?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By being intelligent. By proper leadership. Good luck, everybody.
