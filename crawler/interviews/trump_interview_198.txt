<Randall Lane> <Positive> You've always talked about having fun as a key to business. Are you having fun?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am having fun. I'm enjoying it. We're accomplishing a lot. Your stock market is at an all-time high. Your jobs, your unemployment is at the lowest point in almost 17 years. We have fantastic numbers coming out. And I think we'll have, over the course of the next, fairly short period of time, and more importantly over a long period of time, we're going to have great numbers coming out of our country.
<Lewis D'Vorkin> <Neutral> What's your personal thought?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I enjoy success. And we're having tremendous success, as a country. We have some difficulties with respect to North Korea, the Middle East. I inherited --  and I've said it often -- I inherited a mess. The country was having many different problems. Among them, the Middle East, ISIS, which we've done more with respect to ISIS in nine months than we've done in nine years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we have really done, we have done, I would say eight months in eight years, to be specific. But we have done a really, really good job with the military. We're building up our military. We just had an over $700 billion budget, which will be approved.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're, you know, there's been few times where the military was more important than what it is right now. And, in addition to that, which is by far the overriding element, it's lots of jobs in the United States. So, what the country is doing, we're doing very well. And on an economic front, we're doing very well.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Now that we're almost a year from the big upset and the big win, do you think your business background prepared you for this job? And were you ready, now that you have a year in?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it helped. It's certainly a different kind of job than, really there is anywhere. Because you have so many skills necessary. But certainly the campaign was successful. What people don't realize is that I spent much less money than Hillary Clinton. So right there, perhaps that's business. You know, if you look at the numbers it's astronomically different.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think anybody's ever written that. You know, in the old days, if you spent less money and won, that was supposed to be a good thing. Today nobody talks about it. But I spent much less money and won. I think that's -- so we start off there -- I think that was good. I also think that, yes, being in -- just last night I had dinner with all of our generals and admirals, at the highest level. You probably saw that.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Yeah, I saw the picture right here. Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was lovely. It was fantastic. But I talked about business. I said, "Your equipment is coming in too slowly and at too great a cost."" And I actually got involved in negotiating
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> Mhmm.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And she's a terrific person. But I developed a bidding system between Boeing and Lockheed. And I was able to reduce the price of the Lockheed by billions of dollars. By billions of dollars. And this took me, actually, a very small amount of time. And I read a story, and this when I was president-elect, had not come here yet. And I called the military. I said, "What's the problem?"" We met with the generals."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I then met with Lockheed. I then -- the generals were unable to get anything off the price. And in fact, they wanted to raise the price and claim extras. And I met with Marillyn [Hewson], from Lockheed. I then went and had a very frank discussion with her. I then met with Boeing, and I said, "Well
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Well, again, you're negotiating with them. You have obviously a lot of negotiation skills that you bring.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And that's one thing. There are many, many things that I was too late into the game for the President Gerald Ford aircraft carrier. But it took too long to build, and it was way over budget. And you know, those things, we're being much more conscious as a country about things such as that.
<Lewis D'Vorkin> <Negative> So you've had pain points in business, obviously.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know.
<Lewis D'Vorkin> <Neutral> If you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Pain points?
<Lewis D'Vorkin> <Negative> In other words, obstacles that you have to overcome.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, sure. You always have obstacles.
<Lewis D'Vorkin> <Negative> So, if you take away the politics of being president, and what you're trying to do with the economy, what are the obstacles that you are finding that you necessarily didn't find in your business life?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you have Congress. That's a big obstacle in many cases. You have, in some cases, well-meaning people in Congress that truly feel strongly about something. And I understand that and actually don't mind that. And then of course you have grandstanders and others that want to try and make a point or want to do something that really isn't necessarily in the best interests of the country
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And those people I fight. And what people don't know is that I've had just about the most legislation passed of any president, in a nine-month period, that's ever served. We had over 50 bills passed. I'm not talking about executive orders only, which are very important. I'm talking about bills. We've had a tremendous amount of legislation passed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Like VA accountability, which nobody could get passed. Meaning people are accountable now, because before you couldn't do anything if you caught people who worked there doing very bad things. But many, many bills have been passed. And now we're going for taxes. I will get health care. I'm one vote short of health care. I'll get health care.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think block-granting it back to the states is going to be a great thing to do. I think it'll be great for the people. Smaller government, great for the people. They'll be able to handle it better. But we're one --
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> Are you talking about the Graham-Cassidy bill?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I like it very much. I do. I like it. It's block-granting. It's granting the money back to the states.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> Right, right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you have a smaller form of government that's going to be able to do -- if they do a proper job -- that will be able to do. There are certain states where they are very well run. And I could name them. I could name certain states where they really -- they will do miracles with that money, in terms of health care.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It'll be far better than it is. Because Obamacare has failed, badly. So I'm working on that now. But we actually, I would say, I either have the votes or I'm one vote short. And I believe we'll get health care done sometime prior to the election.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> With Obamacare, until you come up with something different, don't you feel there's a lot of things going on with Obamacare right now, where, don't you feel you need, as CEO of America, an obligation to make it run as good as it can while it's still the law of the land?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's an interesting, that's a very interesting question. It's a failed concept. It's thousands and thousands of pages. It's been amended by additional thousands of pages. It's a total mess. The premiums are going up, you know.
<Randall Lane> <Negative> But while it's still the law, don't you think, you know, we're cutting back on advertising, we're shrinking the window of signing up, so --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we're actually, what we're doing is trying to keep it afloat, because it's failing. I mean the insurance companies are fleeing and have fled. They fled before I got here. But with that being said, no, Obamacare is Obama's fault. It's nobody else's fault. In fact, if you go back to --
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Yes, but now it's your administration's responsibility.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. But I've always said Obamacare is Obama's fault. It's never going to be our fault. With that being said, I think the Democrats want to make a deal. At the same time, I think I have a deal with the Republicans. So I have the best of both worlds. That's business to a certain extent --
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- when you asked the business question. And as you have noticed, I'm very able to make deals with Democrats if I have to.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Who have you found so far are better deal-making partners, the Ryan-McConnell set or the Pelosi-Schumer set?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the Republicans have something called the filibuster rule. Which is a disaster. And if they don't get rid of that, it's always going to be very tough for them. You know what that is.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Yes, well, of course.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The filibuster rule is --
<Randall Lane> <Negative> It's a disaster when you're in the majority. It's a friend when you're in the minority.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you need eight Democrat votes every time. I mean, they literally need eight Democratic votes. And, they keep it for the sake of history. But history is that, in 1789, when it all began, what it actually, when they started voting, it was 1789, the first votes, that was a simple majority. And we should go back to a simple majority.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If we had the filibuster rule, if we had the 60 votes for Justice Gorsuch, he would not be sitting on the bench right now because for the judges that has been taken off. And part of my plan is that the Democrats would take it off in two minutes. And the Republicans --
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Well, they didn't when they had a majority.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they were going to. Well, they did it for the judge. Don't forget, 95 percent of that work was done before we got there. So I think the filibuster rule is very bad. At the same time, I think if we pass taxes, I think we'll have health care and taxes before. I believe we'll have a great infrastructure bill before, which is easiest of all of them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In fact, I think I'll have more Democrat votes for infrastructure than I will Republican votes. And I also have another bill that I think will be very -- an economic development bill, which I think will be fantastic. Which nobody knows about. Which you are hearing about for the first time. But I'm going to do that. But before --
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> What is that? What does that mean?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Economic development incentives for companies. Incentives for companies to be here. Incentives for companies to do things.
<Lewis D'Vorkin> <Neutral> What kind of incentives?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it'll be a great bill. It's something I've had. I just don't want to do it before I do health care --
<Randall Lane> <Positive> So business, like Carrier? Business incentives to create jobs, keep jobs?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So that when companies leave our country, they get penalized severely. So that when companies stay in our country, they're incentivized. But there won't be any more companies, and it's really stuck. I hope you have seen -- again, this is an interview where I am doing the talking, I guess -- but I hope you've seen that companies are moving back into our country. You saw Toyota, five plants. Other companies, car companies are moving back into our country. They are expanding their plants.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> So is it a carrot --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have a lot of --
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> So is it a carrot to get companies to stay and/or grow? Or is it a stick that you penalize?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's both. It's both. It's both a carrot and a stick. It is an incentive to stay. But it is perhaps even more so -- if you leave, it's going to be very tough for you to think that you're going to be able to sell your product back into our country.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> How comfortable are you, as a businessperson, having the government involved in a business decision about where a company wants to locate? And where a company wants to put jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very comfortable, because there's no tax if you stay. There's no tax. We have to protect our companies. And if you looked at what's happened, they've been ravaged by the stupidity of politics and, frankly, the stupidity of politicians. They've been ravaged. And we have to protect our companies. We have to protect our workers. And the only way you're going to do that is you have to create rules.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, when you talk about, Randall, when you talk about fairness, do you think it's fair that some countries charge us 100% tariff, or tax, to sell a product in their country? And yet the same product coming out of that country coming into our country comes into our country for no tax.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> See, that makes it unfair for our companies. And what I want to do is reciprocal. See, I think the concept of reciprocal is a very nice concept. If somebody is charging us 50 percent, we should charge them 50 percent. Right now they charge us 50 percent, and we charge them nothing. That doesn't work with me.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> You are also taking steps with the corporate tax rate. Which I think there's a lot of consensus on that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> In terms of the individual tax code, you campaigned on tax reform that does not increase the deficit. Are you sticking with that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. This will not increase, this will lower the deficit, because I think we're going to take off like we have never taken off before. This is going to bring jobs back. This is going to bring $3 trillion dollars back.
<Randall Lane> <Negative> The corporate tax cuts.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, well, the offshore money.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> Offshore money, right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's part of it.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> But in terms of individual tax-rate reform, without spending cuts, even with dynamic scoring, it's going to increase the deficit. So are you committing to then having offsetting --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> -- spending cuts?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> First of all, we're going to have some spending cuts, okay. We are going to really have some spending cuts. But I will tell you that most of what we are going to do is we're going to gain. Look at GDP. So GDP last quarter was 3.1%. Most of the folks that are in your business, and elsewhere, were saying that would not be hit for a long time. You know, Obama never hit the number.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> He hit 3%. He hit three a couple quarters.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He never hit it on a yearly basis. Never hit it on a yearly basis. That's eight years. I think we'll go substantially higher than that. And I think this quarter would have been phenomenal, except for the hurricanes. The hurricanes were very very -- actually there was some really good things on the jobs report that just came out. You saw.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Yep, yep.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The hurricanes had a huge impact on and, you know, as soon as I saw the first hurricane I said, "That's bad."" Then I saw the second
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What I'm saying, though, is that the tax cuts will spur business. Companies will stay in our country -- they won't be leaving. Companies will be hiring people. They'll be expanding. They'll be building new plants, and that's what it's all about. It'll be a great spur, so through growth, our deficits will come down.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Last week you said twice, both on the South Lawn and in Indiana, that you won't personally benefit from this new tax reform. Do you still hold to that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, what I say is that the, this whole concept, everybody benefits if the country does well. We all do. You guys benefit. Everybody benefits if the country does well. We're the highest-taxed nation in the world -- now some people like to say "developed nation
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're the highest-taxed developed nation in the world, probably the highest-taxed nation in the world. It makes it very uncompetitive when you're paying 42 and 44%, if you start including state taxes and other things that many businesses have to, depending on what state they're in, and in China you're at 15% and in other countries you're at numbers far lower than that. So, we're bringing it to 20, I was thinking in terms of 15.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> The corporate tax, the corporate tax rate.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Actually. The corporate tax rate. I was actually saying 15 for the purpose of getting to 20.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it was a spread that I didn't like. You know I didn't want to be talking about, so we started at 20 with the understanding I'm not negotiating. I actually wanted the 15, so that, because as you know, this will be a negotiation --
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- for the next 30 days.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> But in terms --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I wanted the 15 in order to get to 20.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> But in terms of the tax reform and what's on the table so far, there's a lot of people saying, "Oh
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Did you say Trump's not as rich? What?
<Randall Lane> <Positive> No, other people are saying that. We say Trump's worth billions. You say you're worth more than we estimate, but the point is, if the estate tax in the current plan is going away, that's more than a billion dollars, even on our number, that benefits you. How do you square that and being able to sell that to the American people?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we're going to have to see what happens. We're going to have to see what happens. The estate tax is for many, many family companies where people are forced to sell their businesses. That includes farms. But it includes a lot of businesses, any business -- not even small businesses only.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Large businesses also, where the estate tax is so onerous that families are forced to sell and some cases have fire sales and not get proper pricing. And in many cases, those businesses don't do very well after the family leaves.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So that's the primary reasoning behind the estate tax. But we'll be talking about estate tax. We'll be talking about all of it. You know, it will be a very serious set of negotiations going on over the next period of time. But the estate tax is really for those businesses, of which there are many, that are forced to go out of business or forced to sell for that reason.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Yes, but you could raise that threshold higher. I think the point that for someone like yourself, as president -- the first businessman president -- how do you push forward a bill that would, right now, as written, give you and your family more than a billion dollars' worth advantage just on that clause alone?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the big advantage that I would get is if the economy does well. That's a great thing for me -- politically and otherwise. But the economy is a very -- you know it's very interesting, Randall. I built a great business, but it doesn't mean anything to me. My children are running it. It doesn't mean anything to me anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't even think about it because this is so big, what I'm doing now, so big and so, so important because this country was going in the wrong direction. We were heading toward a really bad situation. And if you remember, when I got elected, the stock market dropped and then they heard my speech, and it dropped. And then it went up more than it dropped. It went down like 800 points, and then it went up a lot -- whatever it was, much more than that. And then since then, it's gone --
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Yeah, you're up 15, 20%.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How much?
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> Up 20%, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, 25 since the election. You have to go since the election.""
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Depends which index, but yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Since election day it's 25%. It has gone up since the Election Day $5.2 trillion -- $5.2 trillion. If Hillary Clinton would have won, the markets would have gone down substantially. Instead of $5.2 trillion. It was interesting, I just saw the number today, $5.2 trillion. It was just announced that since election day, November 8, the markets have gone up $5.2 trillion dollars. They've gone up 25%. Because the Nasdaq was 26, et cetera, et cetera.
<Lewis D'Vorkin> <Neutral> One of your sons, I believe it was Eric, told Forbes that he would give you quarterly reports on the your business, on your former business. Is that happening?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have not seen a report. You know, I have, I built, I think the thing that I -- look obviously people know I've been very successful but I built a truly great company with truly great assets and very little debt, and I don't think that's been recognized to the extent it should. And I don't care about it so much anymore because this is -- you know, I'm here.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> But do you talk? Do you check in on how they're doing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what? He may be doing quarterly reports. I haven't seen any yet. I know he's, you know, he's doing a very good job because I know the kind of person he is. He's running it with Don. And they're doing a very good job, I would imagine. But it's very good stuff that they're running.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Again, between your business success and then this big tax bill, do you think the American public has a right to know how you will personally fare with this new --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> And then to that --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You see, you have to understand, if what I do is good for the middle class, that's also good for me, and then if I do what's good for the upper class, that's good for me. Don't forget -- the companies that we're talking about -- many people own some of these companies. And sometimes wealthy people own them, and sometimes poor people own them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But when we make life and business better for companies, that's a great thing for everybody, including me... . But people are dying to know if I have any benefit.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I ask them, and I tell them, most important, this is a jobs bill. This is a jobs tax cut and reform. It's a tax cut. It's a massive tax cut.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Will be the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. It's a massive tax cut, and it's a reform. It's both.
<Randall Lane> <Negative> So it's a massive tax cut, but then that runs against your pledge to not increase the deficit because you can't, you know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because, no, because a tax cut will spur growth.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Yes, that is true, and there is dynamic scoring
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The growth, the growth will be so much that it'll be --
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Yes, but history has shown that you can't just cut. It does spur growth, but it won't pay for itself. History has shown that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, history has also shown the opposite. I mean, you've had it both ways. It has shown both ways.
<Randall Lane> <Negative> Which time have you been able to cut and out of growth cut --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, during Reagan, during Reagan, during his cuts, he -- tremendous growth.
<Randall Lane> <Negative> It spurred growth, but it also ballooned the deficit.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> My feeling is that we are losing so much business, and so many companies are leaving our country, and so many companies are doing so badly. Look at our steel industry. Look what's happening with our steel industry. Now I'm going to give them additional help, as you'll see later from economic development plans, because we're not going to let these industries be taken advantage of by the other countries.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What has happened and what will be happening is not only will we have massive tax cuts and reform. Not only will we have the largest regulation cuts in the history of a presidency -- there has never been a president who has cut regulations anywhere even close, and I'm not nearly finished. You know the ones I've done.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm actually doing one next week, which will be massive. But we've cut. Now, I believe in regulation, by the way, but it's got to be reasonable regulation. It can't take 21 years to build a highway --
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- to get approved.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It can't take, to put up a structure someplace, 15 years before you find out that you're not allowed to build it. You know, that's what's been happening. You saw what I did with Keystone Pipeline, the Dakota Access Pipeline, approved within 24 hours -- approved. In fact, the one is now built, and the other one's under construction. Forty-eight thousand jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now we're going to have massive growth. We're going to have massive job production. We are going to, I think very, very importantly, help the companies because I'm going to be following this up with a bill that makes it more fair for our companies. One of the unfair, probably the -- I won't even say the worst aspect, but one of the bad aspects -- was taxes, but we have worse because some countries treat our companies so unfairly that it is almost impossible for them to compete.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we will be straightening that out in a different bill which will be coming, which I've never really discussed publicly very much, but which will be coming fairly soon after the tax cuts... . We have cut, we have cut regulations, or deregulation, but we have cut regulations more than any president ever in history, and it's not even close, and this is only nine months. And there's more coming. I don't know if you saw when I held up that highway chart a few months ago.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Where it took anywhere from 17 to 21 years. We have highways that have been under negotiation for decades. Roads, bridges -- you know you can't build. Those days are over. We're trying to get it down to a maximum of 2 years, so that instead of 20 it'll be a maximum of 2. And, by the way, they may not get approved. But if they don't get approved, you're going to know fast. You're not going to be going 20 years and then find out you can't build.
<Lewis D'Vorkin> <Positive> So besides your own vision for the Trump Organization and the success that you provide, you've always said talent matters. Talent you bring in matters. How do you feel that you've done so far with managing the talent that you've brought in to your White House, to your administration?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think you have different kinds of talent. I have some that is terrific, that is unknown to the public for the most part, that has been incredible.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> Who have been your biggest successes?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've had a lot. I hate to point them out because then when I don't point somebody out they're disappointed. And then I have had some that I've been disappointed in. I've had some that I thought would be very good that I'm not as happy as I thought. But I've had some --
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> Examples?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- I've had some disappointments. Excuse me?
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> Example?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't want to use examples now, but I've had some that I'm not, that I haven't been happy with and that frankly right now I'm not that thrilled with. I was disappointed. I thought they'd be better. And I've had some that turned out better than I thought.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> What did surprise you about the ones that didn't turn out better? Was it --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You never know when to fire. You can meet somebody, and you can see somebody sitting in front of you, and you can even look at their record to a certain extent. Don't forget one of your early questions is: How does this compare with the business? Well, it is a different set of skills. You need more skill for this. And you need more heart. You also need more heart. Because a lot of your decisions here are based on what's good for people, not just what's good for the budget or what's good for the pocketbook.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, so it is, there are tremendous skill sets from the world of business that are great. But you need additional skill. You also need political skill --
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> Where --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you need political instinct. People in business, many people in business have no political instinct, or you don't know if they do. But I've had people that I'm extremely pleased with, that I actually think have been better than I would have thought. And I've had some -- I mean for the most part I got it right -- but I've had some that I'm disappointed. I've had some that I'm still disappointed.
<Lewis D'Vorkin> <Neutral> You're very public about that. Do you think that's a positive?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I think it's positive. I think people understand it. That's the way life is, sure.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> Where are you today with Secretary Tillerson?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He came out of a great company. A company that has been around a long time. I don't mind opposing views, but he and I have some opposing views. I think we have to be a much, much stronger in stance. And, ultimately, my view matters. That's the way life goes. But I have a very good relationship with him. And generally speaking, we get along very well.
<Randall Lane> <Negative> There are reports out today over the last couple days about him calling you a moron privately. Has he talked, reached out to you about that? Do you believe that he said that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we may have to, if he did that -- which he says he didn't, by the way, he said he didn't. And they announced with the State Department that he didn't. I think it's fake news, but if he did that, I guess we'll have to compare IQ tests. And I can tell you who is going to win.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> You have had a lot of turnover, you've had --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But so does everyone else.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Yeah, you know we --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, one of the biggest advantages that I have, that somebody like me has, is that I was not in politics, so I haven't gotten to know Washington for 30 years. I don't know everybody here. I've had to make new relationships. So that's --
<Randall Lane> <Negative> So was that hiring mistakes or was it management mistakes in terms of --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, in some cases it wasn't a mistake. It might just be a different style. But overall I think I've got it right, and I think that there's always a lot of turnover, especially in the early years of a White House. But overall, I think I have a great group of people.
<Hope Hicks> <Positive> I just, I know you have a speaking engagement soon so just one or two more [questions].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What time is it, 12:30? That's all right. Feel free.
<Hope Hicks> <Positive> Okay
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Okay, thanks. A lot of your appointments -- you say this, and it's true -- it has taken you longer to get them through the Senate, but you've also made fewer  --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no, it's not taking me longer.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> It's taking the Senate longer to confirm
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's taking the obstructionist people.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> Absolutely right. But you've also made many fewer appointments than other presidents at this stage. Is that an intentional --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's because I don't need as many people. And that has to do with business also. And I've said that loud and clear, but nobody wants to write it.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> So is it that you're not going to make those appointments, ever?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm generally not going to make a lot of the appointments that would normally be -- because you don't need them. I mean, you look at some of these agencies, how massive they are, and it's totally unnecessary. They have hundreds of thousands of people. And you look at -- so the appointments, I've made some great appointments. You take a look at the appointments we've made.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But two things that nobody mentions that I think are very important: judges. I have many, many judges in the pipeline. Already we've had approved a number. Federal judges. I'm not just talking about Justice Gorsuch, Supreme Court, I'm talking about many federal judges. And I will have approximately 145 federal judges. I'm getting praised -- right, I mean, are you disputing that? It's approximately 145. That doesn't include the court-of-appeals judges, which will be about 17.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we've had a tremendous amount of judges. Many are in the pipeline, and we're being praised for the quality of the people we're putting on the court system. That's a very big factor. In addition, so if you look already in nine months, numerous judges have already been approved. Many are in the pipeline. Others are now, as we speak, being chosen. And our system is working very, very well. We will have made a stamp on the court system the likes of which I don't think anybody has ever been able to do before, because we have so many.
<Lewis D'Vorkin> <Neutral> Who do you call, who do you pick up the phone and call and say, "I need to talk. I have a question."""
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have friendships, I have relationships. Largely the relationship is where I am -- in other words, now it's very much of a Washington relationship. I deal with people here. It's a very fair question. I do like to call friends.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't have much time, believe it or not. I am definitely a working president. I come in early. I start very early. Today I've already spoken to the head of France and the head of other countries. And you know, I mean, this is very much of a, in fact I have my actual working desk inside. This looks very nice, don't let that fool you. But more family, I think, than anything else. Plus I have some very good friendships in business. And I do like to get opinions. I am somebody that very much accepts opinions from people that I know understand what's going on in the world.
<Lewis D'Vorkin> <Neutral> Is it at times lonely?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a lonely position, because the decisions are so grave, so big. If it's a big -- like, if you buy airplanes, it's tens of billions of dollars. It's not like you're buying a plane. It's hundreds of billions of dollars. But that's not -- the decision I made on Syria, for example, going in and firing 59 rockets, missiles, into Syria.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When I had to give the go-ahead for that, that's a very hard decision to make. You don't know. Every one of them hit their target with incredible technology -- Tomahawks in that case, but incredible technology. And I was actually sitting with the president of China at the time, having dessert in Florida, at Mar-a-Lago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know those decisions are tough decisions. It's lonely. And you have to make them yourself. And the military is -- we have the greatest military. And by the way, our military is getting so much stronger, so much better. And rapidly. But I will tell you, you make those decisions all by yourself.
<Lewis D'Vorkin> <Neutral> Did business prepare you for that decision?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, nothing prepares you for that. Nothing prepares you for --  when you send missiles, that means people are going to die. And nothing really prepares you for that.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> So where are you and North Korea right now, and what's the endgame? You spent your whole life negotiating, but you haven't left any room for negotiation. So where do we go?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There's not that much room left. There's not that much room left. Look, this should have been taken care of by four or five previous administrations. It certainly should have been taken care of over the last eight years. And every year makes it a more difficult situation. And right now, I mean President Obama told me -- sitting right there, the two of us.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He said that the previous -- in the meeting we had prior to my coming into the White House -- he said that was his toughest decision. But I said, but you didn't make a decision, because you didn't do anything. You let it go on. I just, I feel strongly you cannot allow him to have nuclear weapons.
<Randall Lane> <Negative> And you've kind of shut off, again with Secretary Tillerson. You've told him, stop wasting his time with diplomatic --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was wasting his time.
<Randall Lane> <Negative> Let's hypothesize that there could be a good-cop, bad-cop scenario. How can somebody who is under you be taken seriously as any kind of cop if his boss has undermined his authority?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm not undermining. I think I'm actually strengthening authority. But in the case of North Korea, they have been talking for 25 years. Obviously, that doesn't work.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> Similarly, you inherited a lot of deals. Iran, TPP, Paris ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> TPP, I'm very proud of the fact that --
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> But don't you think, just the question --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Don't you have an obligation as CEO of America, even if you don't agree with these deals, to continue some of these deals --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> Otherwise every administration is just undoing each other's deals.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, TPP was not a signed deal. It would have been a disaster. It would have been a large-scale version of NAFTA, which is a disaster. I inherited the NAFTA. It's a disaster for this country.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> A lot of business loves, thinks NAFTA has been great, so --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. You take a look at your car manufacturing plants, go down to Mexico.
<Hope Hicks> <Neutral> Just two more minutes, we're wrapping up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Five more minutes. If you take a look at your car manufacturing plants, Randall, NAFTA has been a disaster for manufacturing in this country. We have lost so much of our car business to Mexico. NAFTA is a disaster as a deal. Now we're renegotiating it. I happen to think that NAFTA will have to be terminated if we're going to make it good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Otherwise, I believe you can't negotiate a good deal. It's a terrible deal for our country. It's been a terrible deal. It was a mistake. TPP would have been a large-scale version of NAFTA. It would have been a disaster. It's a great honor to have -- I consider that a great accomplishment, stopping that. And there are many people that agree with me. I like bilateral deals.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> But we're in a multilateral --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We would have gone into a hornet's nest. No, no, but you can have it this way and do much more business. And if it doesn't work out with a country, you give them a 30-day notice, and you either renegotiate or not. But TPP would have been a disaster for the country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, let's look at it differently. I also took things and made them happen that weren't going to happen, like the big pipeline deals. Those were deals that were not going to happen -- 48,000 jobs. Those were deals that were not going to happen that I made happen, and I made them happen immediately.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Is there a focus on deals versus policy? We're in a multilateral world -- at least take something like the Marshall Plan or foreign aid. Are you still talking about cutting foreign aid even though a lot of people acknowledge that the Marshall Plan was actually great for America overall? As a single deal, it might not look great, but as a policy, it was incredibly effective.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> For me, it's America first. We've been doing that so long that we owe $20 trillion, okay? It's America first. We have to build up our country. I got elected. It's called Make America Great Again. We have debt. We have deals going. I mean, the deal we made, as an example, the trade deal we made with South Korea, is a terrible deal. We're renegotiating it. It's a terrible deal, and we're renegotiating that deal right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> At the same time, we're helping them militarily. But they have to treat us fairly, and other countries have to treat us fairly. As an example, we defend Saudi Arabia. I'm very good friends with many of the people in Saudi Arabia, including the king. I have great respect. Saudi Arabia is a very wealthy country. Why are we defending them, and not being properly taken care of economically?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It doesn't make sense. Nobody ever thought of it. There are many countries that are extremely wealthy that we defend. Why are we defending them, and spending money to defend them, and they're not reimbursing us properly and fully? And I'm doing that. At the same time, we will have better relationships than we have right now. You know, I have very good relationships with the leaders of countries.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> In terms of Russia, the Department of Homeland Security reached out to 21 states and confirmed that Russia was meddling with their elections. Do you think Russia meddled in the U.S. election in 2016?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they just announced that there was no vote change, number one.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> I don't think the question has ever been messing with the total tally. Really it's been influence.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They just said there was no change in vote. They just said that. They also just said that there has been absolutely no collusion. They just said that. Yesterday. Two days ago. Senate. There has been no collusion. I didn't speak to Russians. Everyone knows that that was just a statement put out by the Democrats so that they could have an excuse for losing an election that in theory they should have won because it's very easy for the Democrats to win the electoral college.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And not only didn't they win, it was 306 to -- what was it? -- 223, if you could get the right number. It was 306 to 223. That was an excuse for the Democrats not winning the election. [Ed. Note: Clinton received 232 electoral votes.]
<Randall Lane> <Negative> But now that you're in this seat, does it bother you that the Russians tried to meddle with the election?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It would bother me greatly if that's the case. It would bother me greatly. And I look forward to seeing what the final reports are. And hopefully they'll come out soon, so if there are suggestions, we can do those suggestions prior to the '18 election. But it has been taking so long, all of the various studies and reports, but I would like to see what everybody comes up with, so that we can, if there's something to do with respect to the '18 elections, which are right around the corner, we'll have time to do it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Don't forget, we have those elections now in about a year. There's not that much time. So I would like to see that, because I don't want Russia messing with our elections, nor do I want anybody or any other country messing with our elections, that's for sure.
<Hope Hicks> <Negative> I'm so sorry, we do have to wrap up. If you have one closing question to just kind of tie everything together.
<Lewis D'Vorkin> <Negative> So Las Vegas, hurricanes -- nothing like that happened in your business of that magnitude. What were you able to bring from your former business career that helped you deal with that kind of thing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've gotten very high marks for the hurricanes. And I think I really feel that the reason is because of what I've done, to a certain extent, in business. We mobilized. I put some excellent people in charge of FEMA. We have some excellent people that I worked with. We had fast mobilization. We had mobilization before the hurricanes even hit, which other people didn't do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You probably noticed that in terms of signing emergency orders, they were signed immediately as opposed to waiting for long, long periods of time, and then, by that time, it was too late. And you had catastrophes that had lasting damage. I think, yeah, I think that there is a natural business instinct for that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we worked closely with the governors, and we've had some really great governors to work with. Governor of Texas. The governor of Florida. We have really had some, I think, great relationships, but the mobilization went very, very well. And you look at what's going on in Texas. They're rebuilding. They're going to be back very soon.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Florida is going to be back, way ahead of schedule. I've done a very good job in Puerto Rico -- haven't been given the same kind of credit, but if you speak to the governor of Puerto Rico and other representatives, you'll see that they were thrilled. Virgin Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands -- people don't even talk about it, but the governor of the Virgin Islands, Governor Mapp, gave us an A+
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He said the job we've done has been incredible. He said that yesterday, very officially. Governor Mapp. Kenneth Mapp, terrific guy. But yeah, we've gotten very high marks for that. Then we had the tragedy in Las Vegas, which is a whole different thing. That was a very, very sad occurrence. I was there. I was in the hospitals. I met some incredible people, though horribly wounded. They were horribly wounded. But it, in one sense, taught me how great our country is, the fact that they can get back on their feet so quickly
<Lewis D'Vorkin> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. We have some great -- the people of this country are just great. I mean, more than anything else, all of the hurricanes, the Las Vegas tragedy, it teaches me how great the people of our country are.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Do you support these initiatives about the bump stock?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, we're going to look at that very closely. This has just come up. And we're going to take a look at that very closely.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Last question, related to what Lewis just said, you've pretty much never had a boss. In some ways, now you do have a boss -- the American people. How has this changed?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have about 330 million bosses.
<Randall Lane> <Neutral> Right. So how has this changed how you operate as an executive?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It doesn't change, because all I want to do is the right thing. You'll see that I'll make decisions that aren't politically popular, but they're the right thing to do. So I do have all 330 million bosses, but it doesn't matter, because I'm going to do the right thing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think that's another thing that maybe you'll do more as a businessperson than you would as a politician. A politician is going to do the politically correct thing. I'm going to do the right thing for the country.
<Hope Hicks> <Positive> Thanks guys.
<Lewis D'Vorkin> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Randall Lane> <Positive> Thanks. Thank you, Mr. President. Appreciate it.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> So, lots to talk about this morning. Let's go right to the man at the top of the Republican pack here in New Hampshire, Donald Trump, who joins me by the phone. Mr. Trump, thanks for joining us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good. Thank you, Jake.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> Let's start with last night's debate. A lot of pundits and analysts say you did well, Christie did well. A lot of them also seem to think that Marco Rubio had a rough night. What did you make of his performance?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't want to criticize anybody. I know he had the one moment where he would repeat about Obama, and, after four times, that was a lot. And so that was a little bit -- but, you know, I just -- I'm not one to comment on somebody else's performance. I was really happy with the way it came out from my standpoint.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> You seem to be not as critical of your rivals as you have been in the past. I mean, there are criticisms you made about Jeb Bush, about Ted Cruz being afraid of attacking you. But, generally, you seem to be holding your fire a little bit.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know. I'm -- I'm trying to be a nice person. I am a nice person. I have had good relationships with many people over the years. And, you know, politics is an interesting thing. I have been doing this for seven months, and I'm having a lot of fun doing it. But, much more importantly, you know, my whole theme is make America great again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's what we have to do. We have to make America great again. And, you know, I'm really enjoying it. I love New Hampshire. It's -- you know I have been here many times prior to the electoral process. But I have really loved the -- New Hampshire and the people of New Hampshire for a long period of time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I seem to be connecting with them, I hope.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> I want to follow up on a question and answer from last night. You said -- quote -- "I would bring back water-boarding and I would bring back a hell of a lot worse than water-boarding." Now, as I understand it, the law, as amended in 2006, bans treatment of a captured enemy that causes -- quote -- "serious and nontransitory mental harm which need not be prolonged." It calls it cruel and inhumane and it makes it punishable as a war crime, and this includes water-boarding, including -- according to the authors of the act.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> How would you bring it back, if it is currently a war crime under U.S. law?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I would go through a process and get it declassified, frankly. And I would -- certainly water-boarding at a minimum. They're chopping off heads of Christians and many other people in the Middle East. They're chopping heads off. They laugh at us when they hear that we're not going to approve water-boarding, and then they will have a James Foley and others where they cut off their heads.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, you know, you can say what you want. I have no doubt that it does work in terms of information and other things, and maybe not always, but nothing works always. But I have no doubt that it works. But, more importantly, when they're chopping off the heads of people, and innocent people in most cases, beyond water-boarding is fine with me.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> You have enjoyed some big leads in the polls here in New Hampshire for many months. You're still on top of the polls. Is Tuesday must-win after the loss in Iowa?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There wasn't a loss. I came in second. And I only came in second because of the fact that Cruz took a lot of votes away from Carson that should not have been taken away. I mean, he's apologized, but I don't know what comes of that. Let's see what happens. But that was the only reason I came in second. So, I came in second out of the original 17 candidates.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't consider that a loss, Jake, and I probably came in first in actuality.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> OK. But do you need to win here in New Hampshire, you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I hope to win. I don't know. I don't think so. I came in second. I picked up a lot of delegates. And, you know, I picked up one less than Cruz, and maybe that gets turned over. Who knows what's going to happen? But I picked up a lot of delegates in Iowa. And in New Hampshire, I think I'm going to do very well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a great relationship between the vets and all of the people of New Hampshire. They just seem to be very positive for me. They have known me for a long time. And they're great people. I think I'm going to do very well in New Hampshire. But, no, I don't -- I don't think -- I want to win New Hampshire, but I don't think I have to win it, no.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> You mentioned Ted Cruz taking votes from Ben Carson at the debate last night. You have talked about it on the trail. You have also talked about that voter form, the voter -- voter-shaming document that Cruz sent out that the Iowa secretary of state criticized him for. Are you driving at a larger criticism of Ted Cruz?
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> Or are these just tactics you take issue with? Are you saying that there's something about him that is being revealed by these tactics?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think a voter violation form, which looked like it came from the IRS -- I mean, it looked like it came from a government agency -- was a fraud. But I'm not thinking about that right now. I'm thinking only of New Hampshire and the people of New Hampshire. I'm going to be here all for the next three, four days.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm going to love it, and then we're going to go to South Carolina. And, you know, we had -- I was there two nights ago. We had 12,000 people in a stadium that was amazing. It was like an amazing evening in Florence. And we had -- you know, I think we're going to do well there. And we're pretty much doing well everywhere.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I just -- the -- hey, look, the theme is make America great again. And everybody wants it. And they want to see intelligence. They want to see good deals, not bad deals. We don't -- we don't win anymore. And I tell it over. I mean, we don't win anymore as a country. We don't win on trade. We don't win on war.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We don't win with ISIS. We don't win on health care. And we're going to start winning again. And people see that, and they -- they like it. That's what they want.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> After Iowa, you said you didn't have much of a ground game in that state and that you would fix that in New Hampshire. "The Wall Street Journal" today is reporting that you're still relying a great deal on your star power, and not as much on a data-driven voter targeting and get-out-the-vote effort. Could that be a mistake?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, if you think about Iowa -- and, you know, I didn't know the term ground game too much. And I think we had a ground game, maybe not the greatest ground game. But I did get more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican caucus, other than one, because, you know, the voters -- number one, we had 50,000 people more voting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But my second-place finish, which was substantially second-place -- I mean, Rubio wasn't that close. And my second-place finish, which, again, I say was first-place -- but my second-place finish had more votes than anybody in the history of that whole thing -- history. That includes everybody, other than Cruz.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, you know, Rubio came in third, and by 2,000 -- more than 2,000 votes back. That's a lot, as you know, with the numbers in Iowa. That's a lot. And everybody said how great he did and I didn't. And I'm trying to say, I'm not even a politician. I just started being a politician seven months ago, if I can call myself a politician, which I would rather not.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I think we did great in Iowa. And I don't call that a loss, I mean, coming in second. A lot of people -- a lot of governors and senators that came in way behind would have liked to have come in second. That, I can tell you. So, I don't think you can really call that a loss, do you think?
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> One of these -- well, I think -- I mean, if you want -- if you're actually asking my opinion, I think one of the issues might have been the expectations game, where you were leading in the polls, in several polls, and people thought you were going to win Iowa. And then you're right. Second place is much better than every other place except for first.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> But then by...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I can't help, though, the expectations. You -- yes, hey, Jake, you know, I spoke to you, and you asked me, are you going to win? And I said, I don't know. Now, I will say this with Iowa. I will say that it's very tough to poll caucuses. It's a very different ball game, whereas, in New Hampshire, you know, you're going to go in and vote.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think it's much different. And I think it's also a different kind of a ground game. It's not the same kind of a ground game. But, look, all I can do is -- I think I did really well at the debate. Most people said I won the debate. Almost everybody said I won the debate last night. I mean, we had a very -- we had a good debate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that was very important for me. I think, if I would have had a poor debate performance, that would not have been good.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> In New Hampshire, it's interesting, of course. Independents are the biggest political group here, and they can vote in either the Democratic or the Republican primary. And, for that reason, you and Bernie Sanders in some ways are both competing hard for some of the same independent voters. Are you surprised that you're competing with Bernie Sanders?
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> And what's your message to those independent voters who might be trying to decide between you and the Vermont senator?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's very interesting that you say that, because the one thing we very much agree on is trade. We both agree that we're getting ripped off by China, by Japan, by Mexico, by everybody we do business with. The difference is, I can do something about it. I'm going to renegotiate those trade deals and make them good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, believe me, they're going to be really good. I have got the greatest people in the world. I have Carl Icahn endorsed me, the great businessman. I have many other great businessmen are endorsing me or have endorsed me. And I will tell you, we will make them good. Bernie can't do anything about it, because it's not his thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He won't be able to do anything about it. I will create absolute gold out of those deals, whereas, right now, we're losing tens of billions and even hundreds of billions of dollars. I will create gold, and Bernie will just talk about how bad they are.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> You said this week -- quote -- "I'm a unifier," and you said you would bring the country together if you won. A lot of people out there might have a difficult time believing that, given how divided the nation has been about your candidacy. How will you bring the nation together? How will you unify the nation, especially after some of the things you have said about citizens that many have found objectionable?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I am a unifier. And our current president is an absolute divider. He's a very divisive person. And you look at the way the country is so divided. People are going to be shocked to see. We will bring the country together. I'm going to bring jobs from China, from Japan, from Mexico, from Vietnam. We're losing so much of our -- you know, so much of our business, so many of our jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we're also now starting to lose companies. I don't know if you read where Pfizer is leaving and great companies are leaving because our taxes are so high. And I will be able to change and stem that tide very quickly. I know exactly what to do. These politicians don't know what to do. And that's why the people are on my side.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Politicians don't know what to do, Jake. They don't have a clue. When I say we're going to strengthen the border and we're going to build a wall, last night, a couple of guys said, we're going to build a wall. It's first time I had ever heard anybody say that. Now they're all saying, we're going to build a wall.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> First of all, they wouldn't even know how to build a wall. They wouldn't get it. Their wall would be 5-feet-high. We're going to build a real wall. And it's going to be done not at our cost. It's going to be done at somebody else's cost, and you know who I'm talking about. And it's going to be done. They make a fortune on us. And we're going to build a wall, and we're not going to pay for it.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> Last question, sir. I'm just wondering, has this experience of running for president, so different from anything you have done before, has it changed you in any way?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, perhaps it has. I have learned a lot. I will tell you what I have learned. The people in this country are amazing. They're great. When I go to these rallies and I meet the people that are, you know, supporting me, they're incredible. And my level of support -- you know, it's sort of interesting. You do the polls all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The people that are with me are we me. They're with me through thick and thin. These are great people. But the people of our country are great people. There's no reason to have Apple in China making their computers. We're going to try bringing Apple back here, so that we can make the computers in this country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have amazing people. And it's sad to see all of this product, all of these things being made, you know, in other countries. We're going to get it back here. We're going to bring it back here. The other countries, and in particular China, they devalue their currency, they do all sorts of games and tricks that make it very tough for companies like Apple -- like Apple to do it here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we're going to bring companies and we're going to bring the jobs back here, where they belong. And we're going to do it big league, and people know that and people see that, in addition to the military and the vets and all of the other things that we're going to do. And health care, we're going to repeal Obamacare, replace it. We have so many things to do. It's going to be so exciting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We can make -- you know, the theme being to make it great again. We can make our country great again. I honestly believe that, if we do it now, we can make it greater than ever before.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> Donald Trump, thanks so much for joining us. We will see you on the campaign trail. Good luck on Tuesday.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Jake.
<Keith Jackson> <Positive> First, we have Mr. Donald Trump, who is the visitor from New York City and the New Jersey Generals owner. Sitting with us, Mr. Marvin Warner, who is a native son of this great state, and has got to be very happy with the big crowd we've got today. First is the visitor. Donald, let's welcome you to the community of the USFL, and your intense interest in merchandising. I think it's been striking from the very beginning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well thank you very much Keith. It's great. I think they have 65,000 people, I just heard Marvin, so I congratulate you. It's been really fabulous. We're very happy.
<Keith Jackson> <Neutral> I think the general way that you have been presented in the media is money. You have absolutely declared that you're going to compete. You're competitive at this point. But you've got one more crop to harvest, perhaps, following the NFL draft. Is that the next phase that we see where the USFL owners are making their move for better people?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it could very well be Keith. But the overall the quality of the league, you see it just in the play today. It's an exciting game. The people are going wild. The quality of the league has made it exciting. The quality of the players has brought 65,000 people out to watch a game in Birmingham Alabama. I suspect that Bear Bryant might be looking down on the stadium right now.
<Keith Jackson> <Positive> Last year, it appeared that the USFL had a good plan A. They came out of the block strong. Big start. No plan B. Plan B looks like it's in place this year.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think last year... I don't... I disagree with the way I was handled last year. Frankly, you know that. I've been very open. You really have to go out. You have to get the stars. Last year, it started off reasonably strong. This year, it's going to stay strong. You're going to see a very big week next week. You can see a huge week the following week. It's going to stay strong. It's going to stay strong for a long time.
<Keith Jackson> <Positive> The man is optimistic. He is also successful. He does what he believes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Pleased to welcome to the Hugh Hewitt Show now Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, welcome, it's great to have you on the program.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's great to be with you, Hugh.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> I read yesterday you hired Chuck Laudner in Iowa. Is that true?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That is true. I've had a lot of respect for him for a long time. I really know the people of Iowa very well. They all feel the same way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a really, just a great guy.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Now it was announced yesterday I'm going to be asking some questions of the presidential candidates in September at the Reagan Library. Are you going to be on that stage?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I very well may. I mean, we're going to look at it very seriously. We have been looking at it very seriously. You know, the country is doing horribly, to put it mildly, like a laughing stock, actually.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we're run by incompetent people with incompetent leadership, and I think that I am going to surprise a lot of people if I say a certain word known as yes.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> And when do you have to have make that decision by, Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would say sometime prior to June, June or prior to, during the month of, maybe, but right around that territory.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> I'll come back to the politics in a moment. The questions I'll be asking in Simi Valley will be about national security, I hope.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> ...because people always want to know is the person who wants to be president qualified to be the commander-in-chief. Quick question, have you read The Looming Tower by Lawrence Wright?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me? I didn't hear you.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Have you read the book, The Looming Tower by Lawrence Wright?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have not.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> How about the new Atlantic article about ISIS, called What ISIS Really Wants?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've seen it. I haven't, I sort of got a synopsis of it, but if you look at what's going on, it's almost obvious what ISIS wants. I mean, they want domination. They want complete domination.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they've wanted it for a long time. And it's disgraceful that we're allowing this to happen.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> If you were commander-in-chief, what would you do about ISIS?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would go after them to a point that they would be very, very nervous, if they existed at all. You have to go after it. You have to kill the cancer. You have to go after them really strongly, which is exactly what we're not doing right now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I was a little bit surprised, because originally, when they said bomb them, you would think bombing would do the trick. It's not doing the trick, and they're almost using it to their advantage. I mean, they are using it to their advantage. Now, they're going in and taking people hostage, killing them, burning them, beheading them like medieval times, and I think it's a disgrace what's going on.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, you have to be very, very strong and you have to just wipe them out, and you have to do it rapidly and with great force.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> So would you send American ground troops back to Iraq, Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If necessary, you would have to do that, Hugh. If necessary, you have to do that.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> All right, now, and more generally speaking about our Defense budget, you know, it's going down, down, down, and our Navy is shrinking, shrinking, shrinking. It's down to, like, 270, 284 ships if you use the new math of the Navy, 274 if you count it the old way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Which is unbelievable.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Is that adequate to our needs?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's not, and our Defense, and look, I'm a very large real estate person. And all the time, I get listings, we call them listings, from areas where they're selling forts, and they're selling all sorts of bases, Army bases, Marine bases. They're selling all them. I keep saying how many of these bases do they have, because so much is being closed up of the military, and I say to myself, why are we doing this? We probably need our military now more than almost any time in the history of this country, and it's getting smaller and smaller.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Our weaponry is getting outdated, and you look at what's happening in China. As an example, China, with the aircraft carriers they're building, with the destroyers that they're building, they're going wild. And by the way, they're taking our jobs. They're doing so much to really strip our country, and then they're building up their military, and we're making ours smaller.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So no, you have to go, we have to make our country great again. But we have to make our country rich again so that we can afford all of these things. And a person like myself, if I decide to do this, is able to do that, because we have such tremendous potential if we had people that know what they're doing.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Now I don't do ambush interviews, but I'm curious if you're prepared, yet, to talk about, for example, the number of aircraft carriers that we need, the number of, how we replace the Ohio-class nuclear submarine. Are you up to speed on questions of that level of detail?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Not in particular. I just know this. Military is very important to me. We need more, and we need proper weaponry, not wasting it because some guy has political contacts and we're doing things that we don't need.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We need, as an example, I saw on 60 Minutes something that was very, very terrible, I mean, like terrible. They did a whole thing on our nuclear weapons system, that they're outdated, that they're totally obsolete, nobody even knows if they work, and that even the telephone system inside, the wires were all rotted, and the telephone system doesn't work. You know, when you see things like that, and then you have Putin making a statement like he made four weeks ago talking about the fact that Russia has nuclear weapons, it's a pretty sad commentary. So you don't have to know exactly, you know, the question that you're perhaps posing, of which I don't even know if it was really that.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yeah, it's that. And you know, we've got 18 Ohio-class nuclear submarines.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> And they all age out in 2029.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> And we haven't begun to build the replacement, yet.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's crazy. I mean, it's crazy. We need them, and we need them badly. We need them worse now than ever before.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know, one of the bigger problems that we have is that you know, in this day and age, nuclear, once the other side gets nuclear, talks are over. I mean, they're as powerful as we are. We could have the most power, we could have the most ships, we could have the most, it all doesn't matter. If we allow other people such as Iran to get nuclear, it's all over.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, we no longer have any kind of power that people thought we had. And we're allowing this to happen. What's going on with the talks in Iran is disgraceful, because they're just tapping us along. They're obviously making nuclear weapons, and they're obviously doing things that we don't know about, we don't have a clue.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We take off our sanctions. Whoever heard of a negotiation where we go into a negotiation, they say we demand that you take off the sanctions, we take off the sanctions, and we negotiate? We should triple up the sanctions before we start negotiating. So you know, what I see here is just gross incompetence, Hugh.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Now yesterday, Susan Rice, the President's National Security Advisor, said Prime Minister Netanyahu's visit to the United States is ÒdestructiveÓ. What do you think of the President's attitude towards Israel? Is he a friend of Israel?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think he's one of the worst things that's ever happened to Israel. You look at what's going on, and I know Bibi very well. In fact, he asked me if I'd do a commercial for him. I think I'm the only so-called celebrity that did a commercial for him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know, and it was a nice commercial and everything else, and I hope he's going to do great, and I think he's going to do great. But when you think about it, and I have so many friends of mind that contributed the Obama campaign, and that because they're so pro-Israel, I said how can you contribute to the campaign? This guy is the worst thing that ever happened to Israel. And if you're living in Israel, believe me, you believe that.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Now you're a real estate guy. You mentioned this. I want to go back and thank you for some of the most entertaining audio I've ever played, which was the 2005 testimony on the U.N. renovation.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> We played the whole thing on the show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, that's great.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Did it turn out...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what happened with that?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> No, I was going to ask you. How'd it turn out?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'll tell you what happened. I said I can do the whole thing. They were going to spend $3 billion dollars. And the ambassador, I believe, from Sweden called me up, and he couldn't understand why did a renovation of a building cost $3 billion dollars, because he read that I built a 92 story building directly across the street for $350 million dollars.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So he said how come we're going to spend $3 billion? Smart guy. How come we're going to spend $3 billion dollars when he built a brand new building that's much bigger and much more beautiful and everything else, and a tremendous success right across the street for like $350 million dollars? And he said how could that be possible? And it was actually less than 350, if you want to know the truth. So he said it doesn't make sense. So I got involved because of that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He asked me could I come. I came. I said I could do the whole thing, I believe the number, Hugh, was $500 million, and maybe I would have lifted it to $750, because when you hear they're going to spend three and a half billion, you say, well, maybe I'll make it a little bit more. But it was about I can do the whole job for either $500 or $750 million, and I testified before the Senate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And everybody agreed with what I said. And they said yeah, but what's the difference. And I said the difference is it'll be a much better job with much higher grade materials. They would use terrazzo, and I would use marble.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It would be a better job. And that was the end of it. I then met with the head of the U.N. and everything else.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody ever did. You know what they spent on that thing?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Billions. Billions. They never called me, they never took up my offer. And you know, I'm not looking for more work, in all fairness.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I thought this was outrageous. And they never called me to do it. If I would have done it, I said what kind of a system do you have for heat? Is it a boiler system? Is it New York Steam? The head of the project had no idea what either was. He didn't know what New York Steam was.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> It was terrific testimony. We may go back and play some of that testimony later today.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know what happened, though? Nothing. They didn't take me up on the offer. I guaranteed it at that price, and they didn't take me up on the offer. So it's a sad commentary.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> In that testimony, though...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I lost a lot of respect for the U.N. during that little period of time.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yeah, in that testimony, you said I'm a big fan, a very big fan of the United Nations and all it stands for. Are you still a big fan of the United Nations?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I do think the United Nations, if properly run, could have a great impact. But I will say I lost a lot of respect during that particular period, because you know, I went in, and they had press all over the place, it was going crazy, and I figured they'd come back to me and say listen, if you could do this for $500 million or $750, we would love you do to it, and the job will actually be better? And I said yes, better. And that was the last I ever heard of them. And you know, they had sessions, and a lot of people, they had the hearings, and a lot of people, I mean, it really did awaken a lot of people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But from what I understand, they spent $3 billion dollars, or three and a half billion dollars, and I asked, it's sort of funny you bring this up, because I asked about a year ago what did they end up spending, and they're still spending, and I think the number is way over $3 billion dollars. That's what I was told.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> That's interesting. Well, let me turn to politics, now. And I don't have to ask you this. You're the maven of social media, but you know what it means to troll someone, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Okay, do you, some people say you troll the Republican Party to promote your various shows, buildings, golf courses. How do you respond to that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's not. Look, I'm a Republican. I'm a very conservative guy in many respects, I guess, in most respects. But I'm so disappointed, and many of the Republicans have come up to my office.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Walker just left, and you know, all good guys. I mean, they're up here and they want support, and they want a lot of other things. Who know what they want? But they do come up and they do respect my audience, because I have a big audience. As you know, I have many millions of people on Facebook and Twitter and all of this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I don't do, I am so disappointed that whether it's Benghazi or whether it's so many other subjects Ð IRS, so many subjects, whether it's having to do with whether it's Hillary or the President, it's all talk and it's no action. They start off, they're going to go after it, and that's the last you ever hear of it.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> But you're not just promoting the latest Trump Tower or the latest Trump golf course?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't need that. I get more publicity than any human being should want. I don't seek it. I don't even have PR people.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, they just call, for some reason, I've always had a lot of press.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Well, you're not shy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It must be because I'm so handsome.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yeah, you're not shy. Let me ask you this. On the day you declare, how many years of tax returns will you release?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd certainly go over tax returns, and I will tell you nobody knows the tax return business or world better than me. And you have to understand, I'm a businessman, and I work for myself. And I have a phenomenal net worth, and a lot of cash and very little debt, and you'd see that. And actually, I did that, you know, I'm the only candidate in history that actually submitted his financials the last time, and I didn't run.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I actually submitted my financials, because to be honest with you, I'm very proud of my financials.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> But I mean, would you actually...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And my financials now are much better.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Would you release tax returns, though?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would release tax returns, and I would also explain to people that as a person that's looking to make money, you know, I'm in the business of making money until I do this. And if I won, I would make money for our country. I would make so much money for our country that they wouldn't have to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, that we would be able to have a strong, we would take the jobs back from China. We'd take the jobs back from Mexico.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know if you know, the new great abuser in this country is Mexico. They're taking our jobs, they're killing us on the border. People are just fleeing across Mexico. If you want to become a citizen of Mexico, do you know it's probably the hardest or one of the hardest nations in the world to become a citizen of? And yet they let people flow across their borders, and they push them through our border, because we don't know what we're doing.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> I got it, but I want to stay focused on the tax returns. How many years back?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So the answer is yeah, I would do it.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Three years? Five years?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, I would do something, but I will tell you up front, as a private person, Hugh, I would be, and you know, I'm very proud of this. I want to pay as little taxes as I can as a private person.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Of course. Of course. That's the American way, legally.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, why should I be, why should I say I'm looking to pay a fortune in tax? It's part of the complexity of the tax system.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> How many years back would you go on the day you announce? Three? Five?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I don't know. I mean, I actually have not even thought of that, but I would certainly show tax returns if it was necessary.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> At least a couple of years?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, what have they been doing? They've been really doing one year, other than people that never made anything. But I would certainly, I'm very proud of what I've done. I do pay tax. But I'm very proud of what I did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will say this. You will see piles and piles and piles of paper stacked many feet into the air, because the system is so complex that it's disgraceful. And the tax system does have to be changed.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> That's what I, you know, I think two or three years would be great. I think anyone, if you did two or three years...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we'll take a good, strong look at that, Hugh. I mean, it's obviously not something I thought of, but you know, I've given any real thought to, but I have no objection to certainly showing tax returns.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Now are you worried at all? Governor Christie's going to be in this race, and you know, he's been the U.S. attorney in New Jersey, he's been the governor, he knows that state so well. And you've got the Taj Mahal hotel which has filed for bankruptcy last year. Are you worried that Christie has dope on you that nobody else does that he can use?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, not at all, and frankly, I've known him for a long time. I have a great relationship with him. But just do you understand, I left Atlantic City seven years ago. A lot of people don't understand this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I left Atlantic City seven years ago. I've gotten great feedback from intelligent people, people that are really smart in terms of the world of finance, I've gotten great credit for my timing in Atlantic City, because Atlantic City's gone to hell in a hand basket. Caesars just filed, I mean, whoever hear of this one, Caesars just filed for bankruptcy. Most of the buildings in Atlantic City now have either filed or will be filing for bankruptcy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The place is a disaster. I left seven years ago. Now one other thing, I never went bankrupt. I've played bankruptcy like Carl Icahn has, like Henry Kravis has, like Sam Zell has, like Caesars, but I never filed for bankruptcy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have many, many companies, many hundreds and hundreds of transactions, and many, many, many deals. And of them, in a few cases, in order to negotiate great deals, and in some cases, you buy something and you throw it into a bankruptcy, and then you negotiate from the power of, you know, you use the powers of the law. But I've never filed for bankruptcy. I've never gone bankrupt.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know, a lot of people say oh, but Trump went bankrupt. I never went bankrupt. Now Warren Buffett, all of these people, Carl Icahn, all great businesspeople, they all do the same thing as me. But unfortunately with me, if I take a company and buy it, and throw it into a chapter and negotiate a great deal and make a lot of money, everybody says oh, Trump went bankrupt.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I never went bankrupt.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> All right, now let me ask you a couple quick more questions. I don't want to abuse your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Common Core, it's the hottest issue out on the domestic policy trail.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> What's Donald Trump think about Common Core?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well first of all, I think it's going to kill Bush, and I think that education should be local, absolutely. I think that for people in Washington to be setting curriculum and to be setting all sorts of standards for people living in Iowa and other places is ridiculous.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Why is it going to kill Bush?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that is a killer of an issue, frankly, for Bush.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because I think people don't want to have somebody from Washington looking down and saying this is what you're going to be studying.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> But do you think he's responsible for that part of it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, but he's responsible for supporting it.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> All right, now what about Snowden? Is he a traitor?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I think he's a total traitor. I think he's a disaster, and I think it's disgraceful that we have so little power or respect of and from Russia that we can't get this guy back. To me, and I will say, I've tweeted very strongly that he's a traitor and we should get him back, and I get hit by so many people saying he's not a traitor, he's a wonderful, great American and everything else. I think he's a total traitor.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's really hurt us with people. He's really hurt us, you look at Germany, and you look at some of these, you know, where we're getting phone messages. Now you don't think they're doing the same thing with us? If you look at Russia and others, but we have a guy that went out and released all of this? Number one, how does that happen? But number two, he's a total traitor, and he should be treated in the harshest of forms.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Last question, because you've been very generous, I appreciate the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I've enjoyed being with you, Hugh.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> And it goes to a tweet that you put out. I love the fact that you tweet your own stuff. You wrote massive combined inoculations to small children is the cause for a big increase in autism. Spread shots over a long period, and watch positive result.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Do you stand by that, Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, I do, and let me explain it real quickly. I am a total believer in getting the shots and having it done, and I am a total believer, 100%, nobody a bigger believer. What I don't like seeing is that 20 pound little baby going in and having this one massive inoculation with all of these things combined. I'd like it spread over, because look, our autism rate is at a level that it's never been.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody's ever, you know, in the old days, you didn't even hear about autism, and now it's at a level that's so high, especially in boys, but so high that nobody can even believe it. What I'm saying is 100% I want to see it happen. I want everybody, but it should be spread over. Smaller doses over a longer period of time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So spread it out over a year. There's no harm in that, and I believe autism will go way down.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> So you're saying there's a causal connection...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I totally believe, but I would like to see it spread out and in smaller doses.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> So you believe there's a causal connection between vaccines and autism?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, a lot of people do. I mean, there are many people that do. And I know at least two people, one of them who works in the building that I'm in right now, a beautiful woman, has a child. The child is 100% healthy, takes the child, who was I think around a year and a half or two years old to get the shot, gets this massive shot of fluid pumped into the baby's body, and a few days later, catches a fever, and all of a sudden, is severely autistic.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And many people, many people have had that experience, Hugh. And I will tell you, on Twitter and on Facebook, where you know, so many people, I feel, it's sort of interesting, because I get so much response, people are praying for me that I at least say that. So I totally believe in the shot. I totally believe that you should be vaccinated.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But let them spread it out over a little period of time. You can't pump that, because have you ever seen the size of these inoculations? You can't pump that much fluid into a little baby's body. And I think it's having an effect. And I know of at least two cases in my, but many people say the same thing happened to me where their child is totally healthy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They get pumped up with this huge pile of liquid, with many, many different vaccines, and their child turns out to be autistic after it. And all I'm saying is spread it out in smaller doses over a longer period of time.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> If a group of scientists came to you and said look, The Donald, that's just, that's not right, you're giving out misinformation, would you change your mind if presented with facts on that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've seen babies that were totally healthy that weren't healthy, and I'm not asking for anything. All I'm doing is saying spread it out over a period of time. I'm not saying don't get inoculated, don't get the shots, don't get the vaccines. I'm saying spread it out over a period of time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It doesn't hurt anybody other than probably the pharmaceutical companies, because they probably make more money putting it into one shot. Maybe it hurts the doctors. I don't know. But I can say this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everybody would get the vaccines. They just, they wouldn't be pumping these massive amounts of liquid into a child.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, absolute last question, popular culture question. We have some favorite authors here Ð Brad Thor, Daniel Silva, Chuck Box. Who do you read in the fiction world?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I read a lot, and you know, to be honest, I read a lot of fiction, but I really like to stay away from fiction now. And over my life, I've read so much. But now with what I'm doing in real estate, with what I'm doing throughout the world, I don't get to read a lot. I mean, I read the New York Times, I read the Wall Street Journal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I read the Post and I read lots of other things, but I don't get to read fiction anymore. And as much as I'd like to, I just don't get to read very much.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> How does Donald Trump relax, then, if you don't read a good thriller?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I love playing golf when I have the option. I have some of the greatest golf courses in the world. We in fact, one we recently have is Doral, which is just incredible and a big success in Miami. And you know, it's a form of relaxation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I actually love watching television, watching the news, watching what's happening in the world, which is scary. You know, when you look at television today, it's very depressing. Every newscast is negative. One thing I'll say about our nation, too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When's the last time you hear something positive, that we beat such and such a nation, that we're doing better than China, that we're doing better than, as an example, Mexico, which is cleaning our clock, that we're doing...we're not doing better than anybody, and we can't continue to go on like this, Hugh, because we're not going to be a great nation any longer, believe me. And that's part of my theme, is make America great again. And if I run and if I win, I would be able to do that.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Donald Trump, great to talk to you, come back again soon.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you, a great honor, and you have a great show. Thanks a lot, Hugh.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Thank you.
