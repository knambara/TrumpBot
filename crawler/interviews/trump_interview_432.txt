<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> If Donald Trump wants to endorse before the Iowa caucus, well, he better hurry up! Right now may be his last chance for pre-Iowa caucus endorsement. Donald Trump joins us by phone. Good evening, sir. And you have said so often that your endorsement is very powerful. On the eve of -- we're about 22 hours away from the doors opening, are you interested in endorsing a candidate?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Not at this moment, Greta. I'll be maybe making that decision soon. But I have not decided as of this moment to endorse anybody.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. There is a report today that you are even considering, still considering running. Is that still in the mix?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, there's a group of people, a large group of people that want me to. I think they did some filing or something out in Texas because you had to have it filed prior to January 1st. And I'm honored by that. But it's nothing that I've been involved in. And we'll see what happens.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I'll fill in the blanks a little bit. The Texas activists have filed paperwork to create the, quote, "Make America Great Again" party, and with the single purpose to encourage you to run for president.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I do love the name. I think the name of the party is fantastic because that really is what it's all about. America soon will not be great. A lot of people would say right now it is not great. You look at what's happening in the world, you look at what's happening with other countries, they're eating our lunch.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We don't have any leadership. And it's really a very sad thing, what's going on with this country. So I think the name is a great name. I will say that.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What's your reflection on what's going on in Iowa, the caucus, and in part the level of vitriol between and among the candidates, and also the presence of the super-PACs which have only added fuel to the vitriol?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, a little bit, and to a certain extent, it's playing into Obama's hands because the level of dislike -- you know, I just listened to Rick Perry talking about his friend. And you know, they're all friends. They all talk about friends, friends, friends. But they're not friends, obviously. They're doing very negative campaigning.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And it really plays in the hands of Obama to a certain extent. And that's what we can't allow. We can't allow Obama to win. This country has been set back so far under his leadership or lack of leadership. And we cannot allow that to happen.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. Governor Sarah Palin was on our air earlier today, and she had this to say about you. I'm curious what you think about it. Let me play what she said first.
<Sarah Palin> <Neutral> [Begin Video Clip] Donald Trump has a lot to offer. He is a businessman. He understands that government's overreach just quashes the ability for him and others to create jobs for the rest of us, who so desire to make it on our own and not to look to government to make it for us. So you know, for those who have continued to cut down Donald Trump, I say, you know, Enough is enough. [End Video Clip]
<Sarah Palin> <Neutral> Just shut up about it and don't vote for him if he's a third party candidate. Work even harder for your candidate.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Two things. One, is obviously, you've got an ally. She's certainly a fan. Secondly, is that she's sort of hinting that if you -- if indeed you run as a third party candidate -- and of course, then that leads to the problem is, if there is a third party candidate, is that playing into the Democratic playbook and guaranteeing a Democratic win in November?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, first of all, I think she's a terrific person. I've gotten know her, and she loves this country. And she's really an amazing woman. And I have a lot of respect for her. So I appreciate her words. I was leading in the polls when I left. You know, when I decided that I wouldn't run as a Republican, I was leading in the polls and leading even substantially in the polls.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And that was literally as I left. In fact, I was watching "Meet the Press," one of your slight competitors, and I was leading in the polls. And then the next day, I said I'm going to be doing what I'm going to be doing. So it's sort of interesting. I have a lot of people that I don't know if they like me. I think they like what I'm saying.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They don't want to be ripped off by the world. We're like a whipping post for OPEC and for China and for India and for anybody that does business. You know, we used to be the kings. And we're not the kings anymore. We're the...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> So do you -- do you -- do you regret pulling out tonight, as you watch on the eve of this caucus and you see everyone sort of, you know, running around the state and trying to convince voters to vote for them and a little blood on the floor in the process? Do you wish you had stayed in a little bit?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, what people don't realize is that I really have a legal responsibility. You know, I have a very successful show. And if you haven't -- I think it's very unfair because, you know, Obama can go around, do television programs, can fly around in Air Force One, can raise funds and using our money to raise funds for his own campaign, which is about the only thing he's good at. And frankly, I think it's very unfair.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But because I have a show called "The Apprentice," I'm not allowed to run. It's an equal time provision. I'm not allowed to run. So I wouldn't been allowed to run as a Republican because of the show, as you know.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Are you taking this, though, dead serious, or are you just sort of playing with people in terms of, because, you know, the intrigue, because you got a lot of followers, or are you really in your mind dead serious about considering running as an independent?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, you know, as I've said to you and others, Greta, if the Republicans pick the wrong candidate, which is a possibility...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, what is that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, you look at what happens...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What is that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, we're going to see very soon whether or not it's going to be the right candidate, in my opinion. I mean, number one, it's got to be a candidate -- the biggest thing, it's got to be a candidate that can beat Obama. If that candidate is not going to, in my opinion, beat Obama...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, well, we know...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... and if the economy continues to be bad, which I think it will be because we have no leadership whatsoever, then I will certainly consider it very strongly.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. In terms of the group of candidates that are running now, is there any Republican candidate running in Iowa now who you think can't beat President Obama?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Who?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I don't think...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Who can't beat President Obama?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't think Ron Paul would have even a little chance of beating him. I don't think he'd...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Anyone else?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think that the fact that he's doing so well in the polls -- I can't imagine he does well. But if he won, I think it would be a tremendous black eye for Iowa, and I really think it would bring Iowa down as the first great state in terms of the process. I really think it would be a very, very bad thing for the reputation of Iowa.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Is there any other candidate who you think couldn't beat President Obama in November?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, but I'm not going to mention the names of them.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Give me a hint.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'd rather be positive. I'd rather see -- let's see what happens. But at a certain point in the fairly near future, I'll be letting my views be known. But certainly, there are some that I think could win and there are some that I think could not win.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. One last question, and I'll stop beating a dead horse. All right, so you say Ron Paul. You say there are others. How many more of the others do you think couldn't beat President Obama out of the universe that are running?
<Don Lemon> <Positive> And joining us with that, and a lot more, to be sure, the Donald, Donald Trump himself.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I don't really want to make a big deal of that tonight, Greta, because it doesn't matter. But I don't think Ron Paul would have even a little bit of a chance. And you know, I don't think he'll run as a third party candidate, by the way, because I don't think his son could allow that.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> With 41 percent undecided tonight, do you think it's fair to say that nobody knows who's going to win tomorrow night?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Probably, that's true. And if you look at it, it's like a bunch of yo-yos in terms of it goes up, it goes down. One person's leading -- I mean, you go from 1 percent -- and you know, whether you like Rick Santorum or not, I mean, he never gives up. I write books about, Never give up, never quit, never, ever, ever quit.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, he never quit. And it's sort of amazing when you look at what happened. I'm not saying love him, like him or anything else, but he never quit. And you see somebody going from 1 percent to being number three -- it's a very, very unstable process. There's no question about it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. And are you going to stay up to midnight to watch our special live "On the Record" tomorrow night?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Only if you're on the show. [Laughter]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I am! We're going to expect you. We're going to have lot of coffee. We'll see you at midnight. We'll talk. Thank you, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Very good. So long, Greta.
<Don Lemon> <Positive> Good afternoon to you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Good afternoon.
<Don Lemon> <Positive> Last time we talked to you, you were -- you know, you were pimping your new vodka. And we certainly enjoyed... [Laughter]
<Don Lemon> <Positive> ... enjoyed that.
<Don Lemon> <Positive> How does it feel? This is this your most favorite piece of real estate so far?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, this probably is. I mean, who would have thought this was going to happen? I have gotten a lot of awards for the building business, but never for the entertainment business. And The Apprentice has just become this great success. And I'm really honored by it. And to be honored on the Walk of Fame has been terrific
<Kevin Phillips> <Negative> So, how did you find out about it, Donald? How did you get the word? And what went into this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, really, the great Johnny Grant, who runs it, called. And he said: You have been nominated, and you have been accepted. And, if you would like, we want to give you a star on the Walk of Fame.
<Kevin Phillips> <Positive> So, everybody knows the name Johnny Grant, because he is synonymous with the Walk of Fame. And it was my great honor.
<Don Lemon> <Negative> Yes. So, how long ago was that did he call you up?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And straight ahead: what is going to happen… [Video ends]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that was about almost a year ago.
<Don Lemon> <Negative> Yes? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was almost a year ago. And it takes a long time, the preparation and everything. But this has been a great day. We have perfect weather, beautiful, not too warm, not too cold, a little breeze to mess up my hair.
<Don Lemon> <Neutral> Yes, we were noticing...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People at least see my hair is real.
<Don Lemon> <Neutral> Yes. [Laughter]
<Don Lemon> <Negative> We were noticing that earlier. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... it's real. They're saying... [Laughter] [Crosstalk] Everyone is saying it's real. They can't even believe it. [Laughter]
<Don Lemon> <Negative> You know what? We noticed your son. What is his name again? [Crosstalk]
<Kevin Phillips> <Neutral> Barron.
<Don Lemon> <Neutral> Barron.
<Kevin Phillips> <Neutral> Barron.
<Don Lemon> <Negative> His hair looked a lot like yours. Does he have the same comb-over or that same hairdo that you have?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, Barron has a comb-over. But I have another son here. Don, he doesn't have to comb it over. [Laughter]
<Kevin Phillips> <Negative> He doesn't have to...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He is lucky.
<Kevin Phillips> <Positive> He doesn't have to worry about the -- the comb-over yet. It is looking pretty good there.
<Kevin Phillips> <Neutral> Now...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's got no problem. So, who did Barron's comb-over? [Laughter] Well, Melania did Barron's little comb-over. She loves that. She goes like this, a little flick of her wrist. [Laughter] And Barron has a comb-over. And she loves it. So, I guess that's the way it's going to be, right?
<Kevin Phillips> <Positive> Like father, like son.
<Kevin Phillips> <Neutral> So, I'm curious. Did you call Rosie to tell her that you have a star on the Walk of Fame now? [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I thought we would keep her out of this, to be honest with you.
<Don Lemon> <Neutral> I...
<Kevin Phillips> <Negative> You didn't invite her, huh?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. She wasn't invited.
<Don Lemon> <Negative> Yes, I thought -- I was going to ask you, was there an agreement that you -- you know, your star couldn't be as close to Rosie?
<Don Lemon> <Negative> Is there anything that you want to add to that? Because much has been made of that, and it seems like much ado about nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think it really is. And it just got blown totally out of proportion. And it is unfortunate. But, you know, no matter where I go, even if it's a star, they will ask me a question. And then people criticize me if I talk about it. So, I never talk about it. But everyone seems to ask me that as one of the questions. But I don't.
<Kevin Phillips> <Negative> How about your rising star Tara Conner? What is going on with Miss USA?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she is a rising star. And she's doing very well. She is in rehab. She comes out in a very short period of time. And I hear she is just absolutely going to be fine. And I'm very happy that I gave her a second chance. I think she's going to be an inspiration to a lot of people that need a second chance.
<Kevin Phillips> <Positive> Well, speaking about inspiration, the rumor is, she might be posing for Playboy. Is that true?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, that's not Tara. That's somebody else. And Playboy has asked about Tara. We're going to make a decision on that. But we will see what happens. That's a little bit into the future.
<Don Lemon> <Positive> We saw a lot of people at the ceremony today, a couple of your good friends -- among them, Larry King. How did you decide who to -- who could come? And tell us a little bit more about Larry King -- you know, he is one of our colleagues -- and your friendship.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Larry is a great man, and really an iconic figure. And, when I had the chance to get Larry, I was really thrilled. I have done his show many times. It's a great show. I will say this. When I do Larry's show, everybody sees me. When I do a lot of other shows, I never hear about it. So, Larry is a very unusual guy. And there's really nobody like him. And having Jay Leno and Mark Burnett and everybody else, all the folks from NBC, is really an honor for me.
<Kevin Phillips> <Negative> So, talk to me about Condoleezza Rice. Stepping up, talking politics now -- you're not a big fans of hers. Why not?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's not a question of not being a fan. I think she's a very nice person. I think she's a really wonderful woman. I would like to see somebody that is a negotiator. We need a negotiator. We don't need sound bites. We don't need people walking off planes, waving sitting with a dictator, waving, getting back on the plane, waving, and nothing happens. We need negotiators.
<Kevin Phillips> <Neutral> So, you think you could get in there and negotiate world politics?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it doesn't have to be me. The answer is, yes, I could do a very good job. But I know 20 people that would be fantastic at it.
<Don Lemon> <Neutral> Yes. Now that you have a Hollywood -- a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, what is next for Donald Trump , I mean, ruler of the world? What is next for you? [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, this has just been amazing. I mean, having this honor is something totally unexpected. And I have received so many honors in real estate, but to get it for the entertainment business and for the success of The Apprentice
<Don Lemon> <Negative> Yes. Does this sort of cap off every -- you know, you have gotten a lot criticism, one, from people like Rosie, what have you, but does this sort of add a special cap, and go, huh, so here?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it does. It's been very special. I have a lot of great friends. I have Bob Kraft and Tom Brady, great friends of mine, the New England Patriots, they are watching right now, as a matter of fact. And I have so many great friends that are watching CNN and everyone else that is live. And I'm just honored by it. But this has really been a lot of fun for me.
<Kevin Phillips> <Positive> Donald Trump , congratulations on the star. I'm sure we will be talking about all kinds of projects this year. It's going to be an interesting 2007.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it will be. Thank you very much.
<Kevin Phillips> <Positive> Thank you.
