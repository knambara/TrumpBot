<Maury Povich> <Positive> Must be going well since the show?
<Megan> <Positive> Yes, it has.
<Maury Povich> <Neutral> Wasn't it nice to meet Tiffany, because you could understand, and she could understand how you all live your life?
<Megan> <Neutral> Yes.
<Maury Povich> <Positive> She wasn't the only person who took a special interest in you. There was somebody else who saw, and he's a very famous person, and he wanted to give you a present too. Watch this in the monitor. I don't know if you know who he is.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi, Megan. My name's Donald and you probably don't know me, but I was watching Maury's show the other day and I must tell you, you really hit me right here. I think you are so beautiful and both inside and out. I had a little something, a little gift that I gave to Maury who's a friend of mine and a very good golfer.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Don't ever play him in golf, he's very, very good, believe me. I gave him a little gift for you and I hope you and your mother have a good time with it, and you're very special. You just keep it up and keep up that attitude. Good luck and you stay in touch.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Donald Trump.
<Maury Povich> <Negative> Donald Trump, he his name on more buildings in New York City than any other person, and besides that he is one of the most generous people I know, and he wants you and your mom to have a very special checks. When we talk about Donald Trump, when we he gives out checks, we're not talking chump change here. [Inaudible]. Look at that.
<Maury Povich> <Negative> Do you know how much that's for? You get all those zeros right? [Not transcribed]
