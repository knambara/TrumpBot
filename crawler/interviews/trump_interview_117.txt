<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Good evening. And welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight.
<Tucker Carlson> <Neutral> We just sat down for an interview with President Donald Trump. We boarded Air Force One with the President at Andrews Air Force Base outside of D.C. And flew with him to Detroit where he held a meeting with auto industry executives. When he landed, the President spoke with us at Willow Run Airport. That's where the Ford Motor Company built a bomber that helps win World War II.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> He had a lot to say about his tax returns. The wiretapped controversy which was interesting. ObamaCare and of course, the press. Watch. [Begin Video Clip]
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Mr. President, thanks for joining us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> So, last night your tax return from 2005, the first two pages appeared and the reporter who got it, he said in his mailbox. He said that the front of it, stamp, client copy and he suggested that it did not come from the IRS but that it was leaked to him potentially by someone in the White House. What is it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, certainly not from the White House. That I can tell you. I do not know where they got it. This guy has been following me for 25 years. You know, not much. And I don't know, I have no idea where they got it but it is illegal. And you are not supposed to have it. And it's not supposed to be leaked. And it is certainly not an embarrassing tax return at all. But it is an illegal thing. They have been doing it, they've done it before and I think it is a disgrace.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> So, it showed that you paid about a little less than 25 percent federal taxes on your income that year which is more than a lot of people but it's still less than 40 percent. That wage earners. People do investments would be paying. Is it fair to have a tax system, and you're doing tax reform soon, where wage earners pay twice the tax that investors do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I actually paid less than that. And it is not fair because the income was actually $250 million for the year. And if you notice, there was about $100 million in tax deductions and depreciation in various other charges.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, actually the income was at the 250 level and if you look at it, it's really a lower number and no I do not think it is fair. And I've been complaining about it for a long time. Because I do not care about me anymore. I care about the people out there. And you know, me, I am very satisfied. I am not going to go back into building major building somebody. I am not going to be doing what I am used to do. We used to have a good time doing it. This is what I'm doing now. And I am saving a lot of money on the airplanes, I save $725 million. Probably took me half an hour if you add it up all of the times.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we have saved a tremendous amount of money in government already. And that's just the beginning. I will tell you. People are paying too high a tax. And one of the reasons I want to get the health care taken care of and it has to come statutorily and for other reasons, various complex reasons. Having to do with politics and also Congress. It has to come first. It really has to come first.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But one of the reasons I want to get it finished, ideally soon is because I want to start on the taxes. People are paying too high, companies are paying too high. It is affecting our jobs. It is affecting a lot of other things. Now, with that being said, the country is doing right now really well. The level of optimism is up highest it has been in 15 years. You see the kind of numbers coming out, it's amazing. The enthusiasm. I saw it this morning on "FOX & Friends," I watched, I liked that group of three people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But they had a man who is saying Trump is the greatest president ever and they will never be one like him. Now, the thing is, I've only been here for like 50 days. But he was very enthusiastic. But he was talking. He is a manufacturer. And I have taken off regulations by the thousands.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we are just starting. We are just starting. So, there is great optimism about the economy. But we have to get the taxes reduced.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> But you want to start. And you can imagine a system where I think federal top is a little less than 40 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sure.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> Obviously taxes at the top. But you would like to see them --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, first of all, it is going to go way down for the minute less. It's going to go way down for business.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm going to try and get the 15 percent level if we can for the business. I think it will probably be a little bit higher than that but we're going to try and get the 15 percent level. There is tremendous waste in this country. There is tremendous, you know, the bidding procedures on the country, I'll give you an example, medicine. I met with a man that I really like. Elijah Cummings, congressman. And he was in my office. And so passionate about prescription drugs and drugs. The fact that they are so expensive in this country and so expensive for people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm going to work and put in this bill or shortly thereafter a new bill, bidding for drugs and prescription drugs. If you go to Europe, they buy them for a fraction, from the same company. They buy them for a fraction. Of what they pay in the United States. Because we have a middleman system. And we have a lot of bad systems but basically we do not have a good bidding system. And we are going to get drug prices so far lower than they are now. Your head will spin.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> So, you said in a subsequent bill, let's talk about this bill. So, it's seven years since ObamaCare past. And Republicans have said the whole time, want to get rid of it and give us something better. Are you satisfied that the bill we are now looking at, that Paul Ryan is pushing, is the best Republicans could do after seven years to think about it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think we're going to have negotiation. But you have to understand, we only have 52. We only have two votes. We have two votes margin. And you're always, you know, to get 52 people is very hard. If we had 60 or 60 votes, we could do something differently but we will never going to get a Democrat vote. If I had the greatest bill in the history of the world, they would not vote for us because they hate the Republicans, they probably hate me but they hate the Republicans so badly that they cannot see straight.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, they will always vote against us. It's really a shame because -- and that's one of the problems that we have when people coming to my office, about lowering drug prices, lowering other things. The Democrats will always going to vote against us. It's been simmering for years. The hatred has been there for years. Not just with me. I mean, the hatred has been there for years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, when I was in Washington years ago, I would come in and Republicans would fight with the Democrats during the day and then you would see them after dinner at a restaurant and their families would be out. I mean, they get along. The hatred is so incredible. And honestly, it has been like that for a long time. It has been like that through the Obama years.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's been like that to a large extent through the Bush years. But if we had 60 votes, perhaps we would do it a different way but the only way you're going to get it passed is with Republican votes because the Democrats -- no matter how bad ObamaCare is and it is the worst anybody has seen, it's a disaster. ObamaCare is a disaster. The premiums are going up. Numbers are as high as 116 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the way, this year will be the worst year of all. And I said the other day -- they criticized me. I said, look, Obama is gone. Smart guy. He put things on. Seventeen is going to be the worst year because he is gone. He knew that was the year. I mean, you know, let him be out before it implode. ObamaCare is imploding. It is a disaster. And the Democrats know that. If we had the greatest health care bill ever in history, and we needed eight votes from the Democrats to get us up to the 60 number that you would need? They would not vote for it. It's a very selfish thing. They are doing a very, very bad disservice to the country.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> This bill has as one of its centerpieces is tax cuts for investors, that would primarily benefit people making over $250,000 a year. Already done pretty well in the past 10 years as you know.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Tucker Carlson> <Neutral> A Bloomberg analysis showed that counties that voted for you, middle class and working class counties would do far less well under this bill. The more affluent county.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> It seems like, this isn't consistent with the message of the last election --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. A lot of things are inconsistent. But these are going to be negotiated. We have to go to the Senate. We're going to see what happens in the Senate. Now, right now, we have five or six senators that look like maybe they're not -- I am talking about Republicans.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because we're not going to get one Democrat to vote for. Again, if this bill were perfect, if it was the greatest thing for Democrats and Republicans, we will not get one Democrat vote. They're going to vote against it. Because of selfishness, because of stupidity, because it's politics. It's really bad for our country, what is going on. I mean, what's going on for years, but it is really bad for our country. We will take care of our people, I'm not signing it. Okay. Just so you understand, this is --
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Paul Ryan. I mean, it doesn't seem like you agree on economics or foreign policy or social policy. Are you confident that you share enough in common that he can -- that he's on board with your interest?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he's on board with the American people. I do believe that strongly. I think he is on board with my presidency. I think he wants to make it very successful. I like him. We have had our run-ins --
<Tucker Carlson> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- as you probably have heard, initially. But I think he is very much what he wants to do the right thing. That I believe 100 percent. We will going to take care of the people and by the way, we're not going to take care of the people. I am not signing anything. I'm not going to be doing it. Just so you understand.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am an in a little way, I'm an arbitrator. We have the conservatives, we have the moral liberal side of the Republican Party, we have the left, we have the right. Within the Republicans themselves, we have a lot of fighting going on. We have no Democrats. Again, no matter what we do, we will never get a Democrat. Maybe we'll get one along the way.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, if we could get -- and the one thing they don't have is phase three, because phase three makes a lot of things very good. But if we could get some Democrats vote, we could change the bill. We could have it different. We could have a repeal which really essentially we have anyway. But we could have a specific repeal. But we are not going to get any Democrats, no matter what we do. It doesn't matter what we do. We're not going to get.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, phase three, we will going to get some Democrats, I believe. Because phase three, there will be incentives added. And there are so many good things. Including, that is why I am going to put the bidding for medicine. I am going to put that. I want them to put that in phase three. Phase three is a part of it, you have phase one which you know about.
<Tucker Carlson> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Phase two which is really not a phase. That's where our secretary -- who is a terrific guy by the way, Tom Price is going to sign away. He's going to sign his heart away. And he is going to get rid of those horrible things that have been signed over the years. And then phase 3, a lot of the goodies are added in and we're going to add now in medicine. We think we're going to be able to do that. Or I am going to have a separate bill for the bidding of medicine. We will going to bring the cause of medicine way down. Prescription drugs and drugs.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> So, on March 4th, 6:35 in the morning, you are down in Florida, and you tweet -- the former administration wiretapped me, surveiled me at Trump Tower during the last election. How did you find out? You said, I just found out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I had been reading about things. I read in, I think it was January 28th, a "New York Times" article where they were talking about wiretapping. There was an article, I think they used that exact term it. I read other things. I watched your friend Bret Baier, the day previous where he was talking about certain, very complex sets of things happening and wiretapping. I said, wait a minute, there's lot of wiretapping being talked about. I've been seeing a lot of things. Now, for the most part, I am not going to discuss it because we have it before the committee. And we will be submitting things before the committee very soon that has not been submitted as of yet. But it's potentially a very serious situation.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> So, fifty one thousand people re-tweeted that. So, a lot of people thought that was plausible. They believe you, you are the President. You are in charge of the agencies. Every intelligence agency reports to you. Why not immediately go to them and gather evidence to support that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because I don't want to do anything that is going to violate any strength of an agency. You know, we have enough problems. And by the way, with the CIA, I just want people to know, the CIA was hacked and a lot of things were taken. That was during the Obama years. That was not during us. That was during the Obama situation. Mike Pompeo is there now doing a fantastic job. But we will be submitting certain things and I will be perhaps speaking about this next week but it is right now before the committee and I think I want to leave it there. I have a lot of confidence --
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Why not wait to tweet about it until you can prove it? Don't you value your words when you can't provide evidence?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, because "The New York Times" wrote about it. You know? Not that I respect "The New York Times," I call it the failing "New York Times," but they did write on January 20th. They're using the word wiretapped. Other people have come out with --
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Right. But you're the President, you have the ability to gather all the evidence you want.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. I do. But I think that frankly we have a lot right now. And I think if you watched the Bret Baier and what he was saying, and what he was talking about and how he mentioned the word wiretapped, you would feel very confident that you could mention the name. He mentioned it. And other people have mentioned it but if you take a look at some of the things written about wiretapping, and eavesdropping. And don't forget, when I say, wiretapped, those words were in quotes, that really covers because wiretapping is pretty old-fashioned stuff but that really covers surveillance and many other things. And nobody ever talks about the fact that was in quotes but that's a very important thing. Wiretaps covers a lot of different things. I think you will going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks. [End Video Clip]
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> And you may see some of those on Twitter, the President goes on to talk about tweeting. He's going to keep doing it even though it gets in his own way sometimes. And part two of the interview, the President will tell us why.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> And then there is breaking news tonight. The President wrapping up a rally in Nashville, Tennessee, where he addressed the latest threat to his new travel ban, a judge has weighed in. We will go live to Nashville for the latest. Stay tuned.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Welcome back, we traveled to the city of Detroit today in Air Force One and interviewed the President there. Here's part two of that interview.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> Do you talk to anyone before you tweet? And is there anyone in the White House who can say to you, Mr. President, please do not tweet that. Who you would listen to?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, let me say this about tweeting, I think that maybe I would not be here if it wasn't for twitter. Because I get such a fake press, such a dishonest press. I mean, if you look at and I'm not including FOX because I think FOX has been fair to me. But if you look at CNN and if you look at these other networks, NBC. I made a fortune for NBC with "The Apprentice." I had a top show where they were doing horribly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I had one of the most successful reality shows of all time. And I was on for 14 seasons. And you see what happens when I am not on. You saw what happened and the show was a disaster. I was on. I was very good to NBC and they are despicable, despicable in their coverage. CBS, ABC, you take a look at what is going on. I call it the fake press, the fake media. It is a disgrace what is happening. So, let me --
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> I mean, as you know, the response -- look, so you had this big speech on the Joint Session on Tuesday, you had great press all week, bipartisan and then you let off this tweet and immediately people say --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it wasn't that tweet. Excuse me. I had a very successful night. Joint Session.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Very successful. I got reviews even from people that I would never think I was going to get good reviews, I got great reviews.
<Tucker Carlson> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then all of a sudden they came up with a new dialogue in order to kill that. So, that speech was hot for about two or three hours after the speech was made. Because they came up with other things having to do with other people that they should not have been able to do and they should not have done but they did it. And you know exactly what I'm talking about. So, the news is not honest. Much of the news. It is not honest.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And when I have close to 100 million people watching me on Twitter, including Facebook, including all of the -- Instagram, including POTUS, including lots of things. But we have, you know, I guess pretty close to 100 million people. I have my own form of media. So, you know, if I tweet two or three or four or five times a day, and if most of them are good -- I really want them all to be good but if I make one mistake in a month, this one, I don't think is going to prove to be a mistake at all.
<Tucker Carlson> <Neutral> Do you think it's okay to make because the counter argument --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure. Sure.
<Tucker Carlson> <Neutral> -- even from people who support you, who say, look, I support Donald Trump, I believe what he believes and I want him to succeed badly But if the President says something That cannot be proved or is demonstrably untrue That it devalues its own currency.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, let's see whether or not I prove it. Let's see whether or not I prove it. You look at some proof. I mean, let's see whether or not I prove it. I just don't choose to do it right now. I chose to do it before the committee and maybe I will do it before the committee. Maybe, I will do it before I see the result of the committee. But I think we have some very good stuff. And we are on the process of putting it together. And I think it is going to be very demonstrative. But just on Twitter, if I do not do that, I won't get my word out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because when I tell, when I say things, the press does not cover it accurately. They cover it very inaccurately. Much of the press. Some of the press -- by the way, some of the finest people I know are reporters. Reporters are wonderful. I'm talking about the fake media, the fake news. And there is a lot of fake news. So, if I am not going to -- if they are not going to do me the honor or the public the honor of spreading my word accurately as it was meant, and you know exactly what I'm talking about, because there is been nobody in history that got more dishonest media than I have gotten.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You look at some of the stories in "The New York Times." You look at some of the stories in "The Washington Post." Take a look at what is going on with CBS, and NBC in particular, and ABC, take a look at CNN, it's a complete hit job. No matter what you do, no matter how good, no matter how great it is, they do not report it in a positive fashion. So, when I can reach -- whether it's 90 million or 100 million or 80 million, however many people that may turn out to be when you add everything up and then of course it gets disseminated from there, when I can reach that many people - - twitter is a wonderful thing for me because I get the word out.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Does it ever go through any kind of mediator?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure it does. Sure.
<Tucker Carlson> <Neutral> You show your staffs and --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sometimes I have something and I will say, what do you think about this? A lot of times my staff comes to me and they say, could you do a tweet of this and that because it's not being shown correctly. I mean, they will come to me a lot. And they will say, could you do, I probably wouldn't be -- I am not talking about twitter because it's only Twitter, Facebook and lots of other things. Okay? But I might not be here talking to you right now as president if I did not have an honest way of getting the word out.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> Last question. European nationalism obviously is flowering and a lot of it is about immigration and culture. Do you think it's possible to move a large Muslim population into the West and successfully integrate them into Western culture? Have you seen that anywhere?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's not easy and it certainly has not been easy. You look at Germany. You know, I took a lot of heat over Sweden. And then the next day, they have this massive riot, now nobody talks about it. It certainly has not proven to be easy. At the same time -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they have been trying, and we will let you know. The assimilation has been very, very hard. It's been a very, very difficult process. I want this country to be safe. I want this country to be great. It's called make America great again. That's why I got elected. I want people that love our country and many Muslims do. Many many Muslims do. But it has been a hard process. If you look at Germany what's happened, if you look at Sweden what's happened, if you look at Brussels -- take a look at Brussels, I mean, look at what is going on. Take a look at so many other places. It has been a very hard process. We are going to try very, very hard to make it work.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Mr. President, thanks.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. [End Video Clip]
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Mr. President, thank you so much for sitting down with me. How are you doing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm doing great. We had an incredible rally last night in West Virginia. It was beautiful. A tremendous crowd. And think we're going to win a race, big race over there. And I guess you could say that our number's in winning, whether it's for the Senate or for Congress or for governor, has been very good.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> How is our country's first lady doing, and how are your children?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's doing great. She's a terrific woman. She goes through a lot with all this publicity. But she is a terrific woman. She's doing great.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> How do you handle all of that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's part of my life. I guess my whole life has been this way. Somebody said, "Oh gee, this is always some such controversy." And, I don't know, I've always had controversy in my life and I've always succeeded. I've always won. I've always won. It was controversial when I ran, and I won, and now the country is doing better than it's ever done.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, we have the best economy we've ever had -- in the history of our country. And more jobs, today literally today we have more jobs, more people working in the United States than ever before in the history of our country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Black unemployment, Asian unemployment, women unemployment, Hispanic unemployment -- historic lows. It's been an amazing thing. And, you know, unfortunately the media never covers that. They don't like to cover that kind of thing. They like to cover nonsense. But it's one of those things.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Well, speaking of, yesterday huge news day. There's a lot breaking today as well. Michael Cohen. Tell me about your relationship with him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he was a lawyer for me for -- one of many. You know, they always say "the lawyer" then they like to add "the fixer." Well I don't know him as a fixer. I don't know where that term came from, but he's been a lawyer for me. Didn't do big deals, did small deals. Not somebody that was with me that much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They make it sound like I didn't live without him. I understood Michael Cohen very well. He -- well, it turned out he wasn't a very good lawyer, frankly. But he was somebody that was probably with me for about 10 years. And I would see him sometimes, but when I had deals and big deals I had outside lawyers, and I have a lot of inside lawyers too in addition to Michael. I always found him to be a nice guy.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> He said, one story said you didn't know anything about payments and now he's saying that you directed him to make these payments. Did you direct him to make these payments?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He made the deal. He made the deals. And by the way, he pled to two counts that aren't a crime, which nobody understands. I watched a number of shows -- sometimes you get some pretty good information by watching shows. Those two counts aren't even a crime. They weren't campaign finance.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Did you know about the payments?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Later on I knew. Later on. But you have to understand, Ainsley, what he did -- and they weren't taken out of campaign finance. That's a big thing, that's a much bigger thing. Did they come out of the campaign? They didn't come out of the campaign. They came from me and I tweeted about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I put -- I don't know if you know but I tweeted about the payments -- but they didn't come out of campaign. In fact, my first question when I heard about it was, "Did they come out of the campaign?" because that could be a little dicey. And they didn't come out of the campaign. And that's big. But they weren't, that's not, it's not even a campaign violation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you look at President Obama, he had a massive campaign violation but he had a different attorney general. And they viewed it a lot differently. You know, we have somebody that they seem to like to go after a lot of Republicans. But he settled his very easily. In fact, I put that out fairly recently.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So Obama had it. Other people have it, almost everybody that runs for office has campaign violations. But what Michael Cohen pled to weren't even campaign-related crimes.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Why is he doing this? Why -- he is your attorney.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because he made a great deal, because he was in another business totally unrelated to me, where I guess there was fraud involved and loans and taxicabs and all sorts of things -- nothing to do with me -- because he had an outside business. He worked for me, you could really say was more or less part time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He had other businesses, he had other clients. I'm not his only client. And Michael Cohen had I guess a taxi business and somebody reported him for some things in his taxi business. And that's how this started and they put the two counts of campaign violations in there. But a lot of lawyers on television and also lawyers that I have say they're not even crimes.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> If you're saying the payments, if they're not illegal, then why would he even, why would he use that information for a plea deal?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because he -- because he makes a better deal when he uses me, like everybody else. And one of the reasons I respect Paul Manafort so much is he went through that trial -- you know, they make up stories, people make up stories. This whole thing about flipping, they call it. I know all about flipping -- for 30, 40 years I've been watching flippers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everything's wonderful and then they get 10 years in jail and they flip on whoever the next highest one is or as high as you can go. It almost ought to be outlawed. It's not fair. Because if somebody is going to give, spend five years like Michael Cohen, or 10 years or 15 years in jail because of a taxicab industry, because he defrauded some banks -- the last two were the tiny ones -- campaign violations are considered not a big deal, frankly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But if somebody defrauded a bank and he's going to get 10 years in jail or 20 years in jail, but if you can say something bad about Donald Trump and you'll go down to two years or three years, which is the deal he made, in all fairness to him, most people are going to do that. And I've seen it many times -- I've had many friends involved in this stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's called flipping and it almost ought to be illegal. You get 10 years in jail, but if you say bad things about somebody -- in other words, make up stories if you don't know, make up stories. They just make up lies. Alan Dershowitz said compose, right? They make up lies. I've seen it many times.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They make up things and now they go from 10 years to they're a national hero. They have a statue erected in their honor. It's not it's not a fair thing. But that's why he did it. He made a very good deal. I mean, for what he did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I'll tell you there's somebody made a better deal -- Awan, the I.T. guy for Schultz, Congresswoman Schultz. He had all the information on the Democrats, he had all the information on everybody. He went to jail holding the hands of the Justice Department and the FBI.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They sat there together, they were smiling and laughing. And he got nothing. And he stole money. And he had more information on corruption of the Democrats than anybody. And they don't even have his computers and his servers. They just gave him -- you saw that, it was on your show -- they gave him nothing. Nothing.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Double standard?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Double standard? I mean, he was worse than anybody, in my opinion. He got nothing. He's a Democrat, he got nothing. The reason he got nothing, because the Dems are very strong in the Justice Department. I put an Attorney General that never took control of the Justice Department, Jeff Sessions. Never took control of the Justice Department, and it's a sort of an incredible thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have this country going so well. Mike Pompeo is doing incredibly -- all of my people, they're doing incredibly but the whole thing with, going on with the Justice and FBI when you see Strzok and his lover, Lisa Page, when you see Comey, with all the lies that he's told, when you see Mueller with the conflicts, he's so conflicted. Comey's his best friend.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He had a really nasty business transaction with me, which he never reported. I've been talking about, he never reports it. I mean, you look at the bad things -- he wanted the FBI job that Christopher Wray has. Now, Christopher Wray was recommended by Rosenstein. The FBI. I'll tell you what, if you took a poll in the FBI, I guarantee you one thing: I'd do very well.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Are you considering pardoning Paul Manafort?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have great respect for what he's done in terms of what he's gone through. You know, he worked for Ronald Reagan for years, he worked for Bob Dole. He worked, I guess his firm worked for McCain.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He worked for many, many people many, many years. And I would say what he did, some of the charges they threw against him, every consultant, every lobbyist in Washington probably does.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you look at Hillary Clinton's person, you take a look at the people that worked for Hillary Clinton. Look at the crimes that Clinton did with the emails and she deletes 33,000 emails after she gets a subpoena from Congress, and this Justice Department does nothing about it? And all of the other crimes that they've done.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they don't look at Podesta -- Podesta was supposed to be Manafort on steroids. They made him close up his firm. He was going to be indicted the next day, we heard. Never happened. Instead they go after Manafort. So, look, I didn't know Manafort well, he wasn't with the campaign long. They got him on things totally unrelated to the campaign.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the way, they got Cohen on totally unrelated to the campaign. I'm not involved. I wasn't charged with anything. You know, people don't like to say that, but I wasn't charged.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But when you look at the the corruption on the other side and they refuse to look at anything. When you didn't look at Strzok, where he said basically, "We're going to take out the president," the insurance policy and everything else. You look at Lisa Page the two lovers back and forth with these horrible, these horrible texts.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at the kind of talk going on about, it's really subversion, and our Justice Department doesn't do anything about it. People would say, "Oh but you appointed Jeff Sessions." I said "I did." But I really feel as long as this is going out -- I don't have to do this, but I will stay uninvolved. And maybe that's the best thing to do.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Mr. President, a lot of people are frustrated, a lot of your supporters are frustrated with the DOJ, with Jeff Sessions. There are rumors that you're going to fire him after the midterms, and Rosenstein. They also want these documents, they're wondering if you will use your power to get these documents released?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> At the right time I think I'm going to have to do the documents. I didn't want to. But I think I'm going to have to. There's such corruption. Before I got here. It's from before I got here. It's the Obama administration, and you look at what happened. They surveilled my campaign, it's very simple. The FISA report the phony, fake --
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Rosenstein signed the last FISA report.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It bothers me. It's always bothered me.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Will you fire him? Will you fire Sessions?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I'll tell you what. As I've said, I wanted to stay uninvolved, but when everybody sees what's going on in the Justice Department -- I always put justice now with quotes -- it's a very very sad day. Jeff Sessions recused himself, which he shouldn't have done, or he should have told me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Even my enemies say that Jeff Sessions should have told you that he was going to recuse himself and then you wouldn't have put him in. He took the job and then he said, "I'm going to recuse myself." I said, "What kind of a man is this?" And by the way, he was on the campaign.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, the only reason I gave him the job because I felt loyalty. He was an original supporter. He was on the campaign. He knows there was no collusion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now what's coming out of Manafort? No collusion. What's come out of Michael Cohen? No collusion. This is stuff that they got. How about with Michael Cohen? In all fairness to him, they raid his office at 6:00 in the morning? And how about with Manafort they raided his home at like 5:00 in the morning I think, on a weekend and his wife is in bed and they go in with guns? This isn't Al Capone. [Break in Interview]
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Let's talk about immigration. Mollie Tibbetts, another American killed by an illegal, an illegal alien. It's just adding fuel to the already controversial immigration subject that you've been outspoken about. What do you say to those who disagree with your immigration plan?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Mollie is this beautiful young girl who the father, I watched the father, he kept saying -- I sort of doubted it was going to happen -- "She's coming back. She just left, but she's coming back" and I'd say, that's called hope. And it's a beautiful thing in a way. It's hope. But now there's no hope.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She was killed by a horrible person that came in from Mexico. Illegally here. Found by ICE. Our great ICE, who's abused by the Democrats and the left. And without them, you might not be sitting here so comfortably right now. I just think it's so sad. We're building the wall. It's already started. We've spent 3.2 billion on it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're asking for 5 billion for this year's funding. The wall is going up, a lot of people don't know it. I'd like to build it even faster, but dealing with the Democrats is very tough.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The immigration laws are horrible. We're doing an incredible job, we're doing a record-breaking job. but we have bad laws. You know, when you have bad laws you can do good, but you can do a lot better if you had good laws, so they'll all get changed, but we have to elect more Republicans.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> The Nazi prison guard living here in New York, living in Queens. ICE officials deported him. Why was that so important for you? Cause I know that was on your agenda, has been since the beginning.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have a lot of Jewish friends who said to me about this man living in Queens -- I grew up in Queens, that's where I grew up. And he was a man that, not just a prison guard -- he was a prison guard that supervised the killing of many, many Jews. Many, many Jews. And he's lived here for decades.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he walks the streets of Jackson Heights. I know Jackson Heights very well. I walk the same streets. And he, I dunno, people came up to me and they, from the beginning of the campaign they tell me about this Nazi who lived in Queens. Walks the street like he owns the place. Now he's an old man, he's 95 years old.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the Obama administration was unable to pull it off. And frankly, the Bush administration was unable to pull it off. Dov Hikind, who's a very Democrat assemblyman from New York, heavy Democrat. I mean, this is a guy that never heard of a Republican, OK? He was giving me such praise.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was so nice he said, "Thank you, Mr. President, thank you." It was so nice to watch actually, because, because of the fact he's a Democrat. He was so -- he said, "I don't care whether he's a Republican or a Democrat. What he did is something that nobody else was able to do."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I've done many things like that -- they don't get reported. They don't get reported. What we're doing for health care is incredible. We're even keeping the remnants of Obamacare. You know, we've mostly got it killed. And we got rid of the individual mandate, but we're getting, the remnants of Obamacare.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The increase is much less than people thought. That's because of us. And we're getting rid of it slowly. We're putting in new health care systems, which is a beautiful thing
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Seventy-six days away from the midterms. Hard to believe. If the Democrats take back power, do you believe they will try to impeach you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, I guess it says something like high crimes and all. I don't, I don't know how you can impeach somebody who's done a great job. I'll tell you what, if I ever got impeached I think the market would crash.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think everybody would be very poor. Because without this thinking, you would see, you would see numbers that you wouldn't believe, in reverse. If Hillary Clinton got elected, instead of 4.1 up -- and each point is 3 1/2 trillion dollars and 10 million jobs. When I took it over it was at one. And it was going to be down, it was going down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I freed up, I got rid of regulations. The tax cut was a tremendous thing. But even before the tax cut, right from first day I got rid of regulations. I approve the pipelines, 48,000 jobs. But it did a lot of things. Had Hillary and the Democrats gotten in, had she been president, you would have had negative growth.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We've picked up $10 trillion in worth. China, by the way, has gone down $15 trillion, OK? You know, when I came in China was a dominant force. Now -- they like me very much. I get along great with President Xi -- but I said, "We can no longer give you 500 billion a year on bad trade deals" and you see what's happened over the last 90 days. And the reason I even waited was because of North Korea, because I wanted China's help on North Korea. Otherwise I would have done it sooner.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And China has been a big help on North Korea. I hope they continue to be because eventually I had to say, "Look I have to get going now on trade." But last year China made 500 and se -- we had a deficit with China, $517 billion. Not gonna happen anymore. [Break in Interview]
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> What grade do you give yourself so far?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I give myself an A+. I don't think any president has ever done what I've done in the short -- we haven't even been two years. Biggest tax cuts in history. Soon to be two unbelievable Supreme Court justices.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm sure that Justice Kavanaugh will be approved. Justice Gorsuch has been a star. You look at all of the things we've done with regulations, the economy is the best it's ever been in history.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The only thing I'm doing badly in is the press doesn't cover me fairly. I thought after I won -- you know, they killed me during the campaign just killed me. I said, "Well one good thing about winning, I've showed them. So now I'm going to get fair press." Guess what? It got worse. It's worse.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So the press does as -- I would say, I would honestly give myself A+ and so would many other people. You go to the, you go to the people of West Virginia -- you saw them last night? -- that went to a state that was down and out and now it's flourishing. You go to some of these states that were down and out, and now they're doing fantastically well
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And when I finish the trade deals you watch what happens for our farmers, which have been going down for 15 years. You watch what happens. They're going to be very, very happy. They're going to be very wealthy. [Break in Interview]
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Is the press the enemy of the people?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No not at all. But the fake news is, and the fake news is comprised of a lot, it's a big chunk, OK? Somebody said, "What's the chunk?" I said, "Eighty percent." It's a lot. It's a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If I do something well, it's not reported other than in the 20 percent. I mean, New York Times cannot write a good story about me. Their crazed. They're like lunatics. If I do something well -- I often joke I'll do some great thing, like meeting with Kim Jong Un. That was a great success.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hey, they've been working on this for so many years and they get nothing. I just got, I just left, what, three months ago or less? I left Singapore. You've had no missiles shot. You have no rockets shot. You have no nuclear testing, and we got back our hostages and I have a good relationship with them. You know, we have a good chemistry together.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know if that's good or bad. We have a good chemistry. I spoke with Prime Minister Abe of Japan this morning. He started the call by saying, "I want to thank you for the great job that you've done with North Korea." He said, "We haven't had missiles shot over Japan in so long." He said, "The people of Japan feel safe, and, Mr. President, I want to thank you for the great job you've done with North Korea."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They don't feel that hostility. When I took over, President Obama thought we'd have to go to war with North Korea, and I asked him, "Did you ever speak to Kim Jong Un?" "No." I said, "Wouldn't it be maybe a good thing to give it a shot?" And if you remember the only thing they got me on, they said, "He spoke," "He met."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, I didn't give him anything. Gave him nothing except sanctions. We have very heavy sanctions on North Korea. We actually put some more on yesterday because we'd like it to move faster. But we have a good relationship. But I didn't give him anything.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'll never forget -- you talk about the fake news -- they said, "Donald Trump met" -- the first day it was incredible. Nobody could believe I was able to do it. Obama couldn't get a meeting. Clinton couldn't get a meeting. Bush couldn't get a meeting, with the family. Bush couldn't get a meeting. Nobody could get a meeting. And this one's tougher than the father. I say that with respect, but he's tougher than the father and tougher than the grandfather. They couldn't even get a meeting.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I got a meeting. So the first day it was like unbelievable even fake news CNN said it was unbelievable vented about you know five or six hours went by and they had to get their narrative straight. And they said -- very interesting -- "Donald Trump agreed to meet." I meet, and that was supposed to be like a loss.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was a great success. My meeting with Putin was a tremendous success. I got killed by the fake news. They wanted me to go up and punch him in the face. I said, "I want to get along with Russia. I want to get along with everybody." They said I was too rough on North Korea. Remember that? Too rough.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But with Putin they said I was too soft. My meeting with Putin was a tremendous success, including Syria and Ukraine. And if you look at Crimea, that was given away by President Obama. Has nothing to do with me. Nobody wants to mention that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we've had tremendous success. And just to finish, NATO -- I raised hundreds of billions of dollars from these countries that weren't paying. They were delinquent, they weren't paying their bills.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The press doesn't like to talk about that. The press talks about the fact that I insulted a lot of the leaders because I was strong and the fact that they had to pay. I said, No, the United States is not going to be paying your bills." With that, I'm having a good time.
