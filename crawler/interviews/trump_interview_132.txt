<Chris Plante> <Negative> The president is now headed over in our direction from, from across the room, or being vectored over here, so we're standing by for the arrival of the president, who will hopefully join us and sit down in just a couple of minutes for, for a quick interview on the, the news of the day, and first, of course, he wants to talk about taxes. Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nice to see you.
<Chris Plante> <Positive> How are you, sir? Very nice to see you. You know, I sat two tables from you on Saturday night at the Trump Hotel -- we happened to be having dinner at the Trump --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, I said hello, huh?
<Chris Plante> <Positive> You, well, you know what, I talked about it the next day on the radio and what you were doing was the right thing. You were talking to the staff. You were, you were saying hello to the people with the white jackets with the chokers and so on. You were thinking all of the right people is what you were doing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good. Absolutely.
<Chris Plante> <Positive> So thank you for for being with us today. I appreciate it very much. And I know that you're, you're talking about taxes today and I've just been speaking to some of your, some of your staff, some of your people about all of that. Now, what's the one thing, the key thing that, that the American people and your voters need to know about about tax reform?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we’re the highest-taxed nation in the world. Our companies are leaving, although I've stopped the flow to a large extent, but our companies are leaving because our taxes are so high. So they're going to other countries where they pay much lower taxes, they're firing our workers, everybody's fired, they open up and then they build product and they sell it right back into our country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we're the highest-taxed nation in the world. We’ll be one of the lower-taxed nations in the world -- not the lowest, but one of the lowest. We’ll be highly competitive.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at China, they're at 15%, we're at 35%. You look at other countries like Ireland and many other countries are, I mean, they're 8% and 10% and 12%, so we're going from 35 all the way down to 20, which will have a massive impact and keep companies here. I mean, it's going to keep companies here and companies are going to move back to the United States.
<Chris Plante> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And what it really means is jobs, because those companies are gonna need people to work, and it's going to be jobs. It's going to be great jobs and great wages.
<Chris Plante> <Negative> Well, and, and all the predictions from the Obama administration people were that you could never get the 3% economic growth, and it took you to the second quarter, and you didn't even own the first quarter. It's the second quarter -- boom we’re at 3%.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Three point two. And this one would have been even better other than we’ll be affected somewhat by the hurricanes. The hurricanes were so massive that we'll have some kind of an impact by the hurricanes, but we're doing even better than we did then. So you're right, they hadn't hit, as you know, for a full year they never hit 3%, the weakest, the weakest recovery ever by far, and we've already hit 3.2%. And we're doing good, but the tax cuts really make us something special.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, every point in GDP, there's $2.5 trillion and millions of jobs, but think of it, 2 1/2 trillion. So 1 point pays for everything, and I think we're gonna have numerous points not just one point.
<Chris Plante> <Negative> Well, and there are so many things going on and the world is such a wacky place these days. If I could, I was reading this morning and yesterday that ISIS was being crushed. They're on the run, they're losing their last strongholds. Even in Syria and in Iraq, crushed.
<Chris Plante> <Negative> What is going on with that, surrendering by the thousands we're hearing, giving up, running away. Paradise is no longer there. Was that about a change of rules of engagement, was that about Secretary Mattis, what’s --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It had to do with the people I put in and it had to do with rules of engagement. We weren't fighting to win, we were fighting to be politically correct. It had to do with a whole set of things that I did. I also gave the power to the people on the ground. The White House used to get calls, ‘Can we do this? Can we do that?’ to places and in places that they've never even heard of, and by the time they get back a week and two and three weeks later, there was no fight left, OK? It was ridiculous, so I totally changed rules of engagement.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I totally changed our military. I totally changed the attitudes of the military, and they have done a fantastic job. Yea, ISIS is now giving up, they're giving up, they're raising their hands, they're walking off. Nobody's ever seen that before, and that's good.
<Chris Plante> <Negative> Why didn’t that happen before?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because you didn't have Trump as your president. I mean, it was, It was a big difference. I mean, there's a big, big difference if you look at the military now -- and you look at what's going on in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is a breeding ground for terrorists.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's why I had to stay in. I would have loved to have gone out, but I had to stay in.
<Chris Plante> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you see what's going on with Afghanistan, we're making more headway in the last, I changed rules of engagement about a month ago and we're fighting now to win as opposed to fighting to just stay there, and, and you know, we were losing, now we're winning. So you know, a lot of good things. We have to get rid of the terrorists.
<Chris Plante> <Positive> Yeah, I think almost almost everyone would agree with that anyway. Now --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Probably not everybody.
<Chris Plante> <Negative> Probably not everybody. I remember when you when you were president-elect and you came to the White House and President Obama hosted you, and it was supposed to be a 15-minute meeting, they said. It and it went on for considerably longer, and you said that President Obama was very gracious and I have no doubt that he was -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That’s true.
<Chris Plante> <Negative> -- and all of that. Now, General Kelly, your chief of staff, said at the podium the other day, that, he said, you know, he didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings, but he said really they were left -- you, I'm sorry -- were left a lot of messes, a lot of t
<Chris Plante> <Positive> What, what kind of messes were, did you find on your plate that took you by surprise when you got here?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I was left with a big, fat mess, the Middle East, North Korea, so many different problems, so many bad relationships with other countries, an economy that was not doing well, an economy that had the lowest, you know, it was the lowest improvement that anyone's ever seen outside of some very bad times, and we were not doing well, people were leaving, jobs were leaving, and we've turned it around. I've turned much of it around. Now, North Korea continues to be a big problem and we will handle it. The Middle East is something, it’s too bad we ever went there in the first place I wish that they decided not to go.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I wish President Obama didn't get out the way he got out because that's, you know, left the vacuum and ISIS was formed, but we have done some job in the Middle East and we've done a great job with ISIS in terms of getting rid of vast numbers. We've done more in terms of ISIS, doing what we have to do -- doesn't sound very pleasant, but doing what we have to do. We've done more in nine months, than the previous administration has done literally during the entire eight-year period.
<Chris Plante> <Negative> What surprised you the most and in terms of big messes left on your plate when you got here that just sort of knocked you back?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I've been surprised by a lot of things, and when you say surprised, I know the level of viciousness in the world, I know the level of hate in the world, I know the level of -- actually, dishonesty in the media is one of the things that surprised me the most. I thought after I won the media would become much more stable and much more honest. They've gone crazy. CNN is a joke.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> NBC is a total joke. You watch what they report, it bears no relationship to what I'm doing. But the media is absolutely dishonest and I have never seen, frankly, I've never seen anything quite like it. But the New York Times, The Washington Post, they write whatever they want to write.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, they have an agenda. We'll have to figure out what their agenda is, but they do have an agenda. I think that's one of the biggest surprises, is a level of dishonesty. Interestingly, after I won, I said, ‘Well now I'll bet the media starts to shape up, and, you know, it's over, so now …’ and it actually has gotten worse than during the campaign.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What what impresses me most is that the people, the voters, they get it. They get it and they, I think we're higher now than we've ever been. I think people are loving the job I'm doing. Yesterday you saw what we did with Iran.
<Chris Plante> <Positive> Yep.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you saw what we did with the CSR payments, which were going right into the pockets of the insurance companies, and now we're going to be able to do something very good, so we're doing a good job.
<Chris Plante> <Positive> You think it would be in good shape by the midterms?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think so. I think we'll have a lot done. We need some votes from some of the Republicans that, for some reason, they weren't there on health care. They should have been, we thought we had it, but John McCain voted no, which was a shocker.
<Chris Plante> <Neutral> Was taking shots at you again yesterday.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're, it's a shocker and, you know.
<Chris Plante> <Neutral> You heard what he said yesterday, Senator McCain.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yea, well I’II hear it and people have to be careful because at some point I fight back.
<Chris Plante> <Neutral> Yea.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I'm being very nice, I'm being very, very nice, but at some point I fight back and it won't be pretty.
<Chris Plante> <Positive> All right. Mr. President, thank you very much. Getting the wave off over here from your good people.
<Chris Plante> <Positive> I appreciate your time. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you for everything. We really do appreciate you very much. You take care of yourself.
<Chris Plante> <Positive> Thank you very much, sir. Thanks for being here, Mr. President. President of the States, Donald Trump, here, at the here at the White House, and [Inaudible] stand by, and perhaps we could take a minute here.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> This is the Chris Plante Show.
<Robert MacNeil> <Positive> For the second time this week, a team in the new United States Football League has signed a young player to a multiyear, multimillion-dollar contract of a size that stunned the sports world. On Monday the Los Angeles Express said quarterback Steve Young had signed a deal reportedly worth $40 million -- $6 million for four years, and $34 million in deferred payments through the year 2027.
<Robert MacNeil> <Negative> Young, All-American quarterback at Brigham Young University, is 22 and has never played professional football. Today the New Jersey Generals extended their contract with Herschel Walker, their star running back, through the 1989 football season. Walker will reportedly get $6 million on top of the reported $5 million for his current three-year deal with the Generals.
<Robert MacNeil> <Positive> Walker, also 22, has played only one year professionally. Walker is a former All-American and Heisman Trophy winner at the University of Georgia. He touched off a controversy over USFL recruiting practices when he left the university in the middle of his junior year to play for the Generals. He was the team's star and chief crowd pleaser last year in the USFL's first season of competition.
<Robert MacNeil> <Negative> The new Herschel Walker deal was announced at a New York news conference today by the owner of the New Jersey Generals, Donald Trump. Trump is a millionaire real estate developer who bought the Generals last September for a reported $9 million.
<Robert MacNeil> <Negative> First of all, are the figures I've given for Herschel Walker roughly accurate, $6 million on top of $5 million?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, they're not really accurate, Robin, and it's been reported in the press, and it's just incredible to me. It just amazes me every time I look atthe numbers that are being reported in the press -- they're really not accurate. Nor are the numbers accurate for Steve Young. And it's one of those things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> To say that a player is going to get $40 or $45 million is just so preposterous. It amazes me when I read the papers and I pick up and I read all of a sudden that we're paying these kind of numbers, or that the Los Angeles Express is paying - --
<Robert MacNeil> <Positive> Well, do you want to tell us what you are paying Walker?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're paying less than that to Herschel Walker. Herschel Walker's really -- what's happened with this league is so phenomenal.
<Robert MacNeil> <Negative> Well, I mean, just to get some idea of how, proportionately, how wrong you think we are and the rest of the press. I mean are you paying him 50% less or - --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would say we're paying a good -- you said - --
<Robert MacNeil> <Positive> I said $6 million on top of $5 million.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say we're paying probably 25% less than that, and that's paid over a period of years. So when you look at it really, it's not $6 million. Assuming you were paying $6 million, even, over a six-year period -- that would mean a million dollars a year. That's really less than $6 million. That comes out -- time value of money brings that to about $4 million, perhaps even less. After taxes you're talking about $2 million, and even less than $2 million.
<Robert MacNeil> <Positive> But is that four, on top of the five that he's already getting for the current three years?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he got money last year. I didn't pay it, because I purchased the team three or four months ago. But he got money last year. This contract would be an extension of two years that he's got left on his current contract, and that money's paid at that time. It's not paid now; it's paid at that time.
<Robert MacNeil> <Positive> Well, even with the figures you've now corrected, why is a 22-year-old football player worth that to a team like the Generals?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, only in that the NFL was trying very hard. It's a market value for a player, and the player's in a very good position right now. All of the players, the good players, the stars, are in a tremendous position. You have two competing leagues, each wanting to get the best players, each wanting to get the biggest names.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Herschel Walker right now at this point in time is probably the most important name in terms of football players anywhere in the country. We felt it was important to the Generals. The Generals have sold -- we should have 60 or 70 thousand people next week. Last week we had 73,000 people at a game. The week before that we had 63,500 people. The television ratings have been so phenomenal
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In fact, ABC, which broadcast a game, was about 12 times what the other networks were in terms of watching this particular General game. So we want to keep that going, and if it means that we have to spend a little money to keep our stars, we'll do that.
<Robert MacNeil> <Neutral> But television ratings in the normal season have been going down for football for the last couple of years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you're talking about in the NFL season but you're not talking about the USFL. The USFL has been very hot. The Generals have been very hot. And we hope to keep it that way. The NFL ratings have been going down, that's correct.
<Robert MacNeil> <Neutral> And so this is a direct consequence of your attention -- what? Not only to divert attention from the NFL; to do what? To bring players over from the NFL?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know. When you look at the draft, I mean the NFL draft this year is going to be a shambles. There's almost nobody left. Most of the good players and the great players -- Rozier and Young and last year Herschel Walker and Reggie White and this one and that one -- all of the great players have already signed with the USFL.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't even know why the NFL bothers having a draft this year, frankly, 'cause there's almost nobody left. They might as well just get together and do whatever they have to do. The fact is the NFL has got some problems now. The USFL has taken the media, they've taken the interest of the fans. When you look at games -- Pittsburgh this week is sold out, 60,000 people, sold out. They signed Mike Rozier.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Tampa is going to have, I understand, 55 or 60 thousand people at the Tampa game. We're going to have 60, 65, maybe even 70 thousand people, and I'd have 78,000, which is the maximum, if we wanted to black out the New York-New Jersey area, which I just chose not to do, because I think the people that can't go to the game would like to see the game.
<Robert MacNeil> <Negative> Do you see a danger of turning off football fans? I know you've got a rush of new attention to the new league now. But turning off football fans with salaries like this, on top of football's other problems?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's very possible. You don't know what's going to happen. It's a very deep psychological - --
<Robert MacNeil> <Neutral> It is possible? You think it is psychologically possible?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, no, I think it is. It's a deep psychological, and you really don't know what's going to happen; you don't know what the fan response is. I can tell you that the signing of Herschel Walker and keeping Herschel Walker, the NFL very desperately wanted to get Herschel Walker into that league, as you can well imagine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The keeping of Herschel Walker was a very, very important thing to the New York fans. The New York fans are used to losing people and losing games and losing everything else, especially in football. And the keeping of Herschel Walker was a great signal, and we've had that response already in the form of ticket sales. The fans appreciate that we went out and we kept somebody, because they're just not used to that happening.
<Robert MacNeil> <Negative> How can the Generals afford to pay Walker that kind of money when the team reportedly lost over a million dollars last year?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the team lost a million dollars last year, and basically what's happened this year -- I mean, last year, in my opinion, I'll be perfectly honest, I was not in the league last year, I wasn't involved too much with the league last year - --
<Robert MacNeil> <Positive> So you can afford to be honest.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I can afford to be honest for last year. But the fact is that the league last year didn't quite hit the way it should have hit. This year it's hit much greater than anybody anticipated. When I say that we had 73,000 people and 63,000 people at our two away games already, that's about three times what we projected. So we're getting tremendous additional revenues - --
<Robert MacNeil> <Negative> Good. You're saying it's paying off. You said we were also wrong, or the press is also wrong about the figures for Steve Young. If we're wrong, what are the right figures?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the figures are substantially different than that. If you said Babe Ruth in 1928 made $100,000 and then you said what would that $100,000 mean in terms of 1984 dollars or 1983 dollars, you'd say, well, that could mean $25 or $40 million or $30 million. So a sportswriter in 1928, when Babe Ruth was getting $100,000, could say Babe Ruth signs for $24 million or $40 million. It's just preposterous. Steve Young, if you present-value his contract, is getting probably about $5 million over a four-year contract, and perhaps even less.
<Robert MacNeil> <Negative> I said six over a four-year contract. And then another 34 in deferred payments until the year 2027. Is that wrong?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, what does that mean? That means that you're going to take about a million dollars and put it into a bank, an interest-bearing account - --
<Robert MacNeil> <Positive> One million dollars now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> About a million dollars, paid now into an interest-bearing account in a bank, will be the kind of money that you're talking about. So an owner isn't paying $40 million or $45 million as they report, but - --
<Robert MacNeil> <Positive> So it's like creating an annuity.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's all you're doing, is creating an annuity, but it's so inaccurately reported. Because I pick up and I read where Steve Young is getting $45 million and all of these players are getting these ridiculous amounts, and it's just not so.
<Robert MacNeil> <Positive> Well, Mr. Trump, thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Robin.
<Robert MacNeil> <Neutral> Charlayne?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Well, after years of speculation and flirtations, Donald Trump formally entered the race for the White House this week. And we sat down with the wealthiest presidential candidate to get his ideas on the economy, jobs, and also something else. What was that?
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Well, his surprising answer to who the best president of the last 25 years was. But first, we wanted to know, why jump in now? Take a look. [Begin Video]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> It's official.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> You're doing it.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> You are doing it.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Why did you decide to do it this year when you passed all the other years?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I looked at it but not very seriously. Mitt Romney let a lot of people down last time. He was supposed to do better and he like disappeared. He choked. Something happened to him at the end last time. The country is in trouble. We have a big fat bubble coming up. You watch. We have artificially induced low interest rates, we have a stock market which has benefited me, but we are in a bubble like you have never seen before.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Explain.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Probably we have 20 percent unemployment, not 5.6 percent. So I just think the country is doing terribly. We're ripped off by everybody, every country, including China, big league. Including Mexico.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So describe the bubble. You're talking about this bubble. What bubble?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We are in an economic financial bubble, in my opinion. It's got to be fixed fast. We owe $18 trillion, I would say going to the $20 trillion mark pretty quickly. You know, you look at what's going on. So we'll see what happens here, but I predict some bad things. Without proper leadership, I predict you're going to see some very, very bad things happening economically. You probably have a 20 percent unemployment rate. You have interest rates -- I borrow money, like I'm buying the Old Post Office. You pay, like nothing. They give you free money. Now, that's bad; that's not good.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> And we've always heard -
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know who gets hurt? The people that saved their money, Joe. They saved their money. They did it the way you're supposed to. For 30 years, they saved their money. Always -- now they go to the bank, they're getting a getting a quarter of 1 percent on their savings. Those are the people, the middle class - the middle in this country has been wiped out.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> That's what I want to ask you. So what policies would you put in place? What changes would you make to try to lift up the middle class in ways that has not been accomplished before? Specifically.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The biggest thing we have to do is new trade agreements. China is killing us, Mexico is killing us, Japan is killing us. Everybody is beating us. We have incompetent people negotiating trade. We are losing money at every single step. We don't make good deals anymore.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Give us an example.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And that's why, Joe, I go out to speak, and I think Mark will tell you, although he's only about 70 percent there. But I think he will say I get the biggest crowds, I get the biggest ovations. I'm getting very good poll numbers and nobody until yesterday thought I was running. I mean, we're doing - it's funny. It's funny.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Well, actually, that's what we said yesterday. But give us an example of how, because a lot of people believe that, right now, especially while we're negotiating the latest trade deal, that the United States is always out-negotiated on trade deals. Give me a good specific example of that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, because China and all of these people, Mexico is the new China, by the way, Mexico is unbelievable, what they're doing with cars and with industry. They are taking our business like we're a bunch of babies. We don't have our best and our brightest negotiating for us. We have a bunch of losers, we have a bunch of political hacks.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have diplomats. And China puts the people -- hey, look. I know the smartest guys on Wall Street. I know our best negotiators.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know the overrated guys, the underrated guys, the guys that nobody ever heard of that are killers, that are great. We gotta use those people. We're using people --
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> So who would be a guy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll give you an example.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Who's your Secretary of Treasury?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Joe, let me give you an example. Caroline Kennedy, I have seen 60 Minutes". She goes in
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We don't have people that know what's going on.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> So, again, specifically, who -- give us a name on Wall Street that you might consider as a Secretary of Treasury, that'll be a tough negotiator.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll tell you what, I'd like guys like Jack Welch. I like guys like Henry Kravis. I'd love to bring my friend Carl Icahn. I mean, we have people that are great. We have people that are better than any of their negotiators.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> That are tough.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We don't use them, Joe. We use people that are soft and weak and frankly stupid and incompetent.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> What's your position on the issue of whether or not to raise the minimum wage?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say leave the minimum wage. That's not the problem, Mika, whether somebody is getting an extra -- [Crosstalk]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> But people can't live on what they're being paid.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Mika, the problem is we have to get jobs in the country. The jobs are being taken by Mexico and by China. The jobs are being taken by India. You call up American Express and you talk to somebody on the phone, they have an accent. You say where are you from? We're talking to them in India. And I say, we can't do that ourselves? We have to bring back jobs.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> But don't you think wages are a part of that issue? And OK, obviously, you don't agree with raising the minimum wage, but do you agree that stagnating wages are a huge part of the jobs crisis in this country? And if so, what would you do to fix that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Gross domestic product for the first quarter went below zero. That's unheard of. It's unheard of. I mean, where do you see it going below zero? In China, it goes up 8 percent, 9 percent. India, you look at these countries. Look at what's happening in Japan now. By the way, Japan is back, big league. They just devalued the yen. People are buying Komatsu tractors instead of Caterpillar tractors. I'm telling you, we're in trouble. We have a president who is incompetent, doesn't know what he's doing. And this country is going to go down. We have got a lot of problems in this country.
<Mike Barnicle> <Positive> Two things, Donald. One, you're smart enough to know that words are --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What do you mean, smart enough? What does that mean?
<Mike Barnicle> <Positive> You're smart enough to know that words are weapons.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> He went to Wharton.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I went to the Wharton school of Finance. I have to sort of say that. Because you know, like somebody says, You're smart enough. But go ahead.
<Mike Barnicle> <Positive> Words are weapons. So you have to have some form of collegiality if you're President of the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I get along with everybody.
<Mike Barnicle> <Neutral> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I get along with the Chinese. By the way, people think I don't like China. I love China. I sold an apartment for $55 million to a Chinese gentleman.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The largest bank in the world from China, by far the largest bank -- Citibank is like, I asked them, Citibank is like a small subsidiary, they told me. OK? The largest bank in the world is a tenant of mine in Trump Tower. I have buildings - I bought - I own the Bank of America building, big, big deal. I own the Bank of America building in San Francisco.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I deal with China. I have a great relationship with China. Businessweek" magazine has an article So don't tell me about china. I know China.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> China cannot believe they're getting away with what they're getting away with.
<Mike Barnicle> <Negative> What would you do about the tax code in the United States?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We got to simplify it. At a minimum, simplify it. Too complicated. I spend millions of dollars a year for lawyers and for accountants to do my taxes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, they do a great job. And somebody said, do you pay a lot? I said I pay as little as possible. I mean, I frankly -- I was sort of getting a kick out of watching poor Romney last time. He choked so badly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Joe, he choked. That should have been won. That should have been so easy. But he said, oh, well, I pay 16, but it could be 18.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me tell you -- everybody wants to pay as little as possible. Including Warren Buffett, by the way, despite what he says. And so they said what's your tax rate? I don't know, I pay as little as possible. Because I'm an honest guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I say it like it is. You have to simplify the tax code, at a minimum. Now you could go to the fair tax, the flat tax; there's a lot of things you could go to. But at a minimum, you have to simplify the tax code.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> We've had four presidents since President Reagan. Which one was the best and why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, if you're asking me about the different presidents - I, first of all, I'm a Reagan fan. You know, I was a very good friend of Reagan. I was a young guy, he was a much older guy, but I was a very good friend.
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> But I'm talking about the four presidents after.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know. I've had relationships with -- I can tell you who is our worst president.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> Well, I know what you're going to say for that, but of the four, who is the best?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who am I going to say?
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> I'm going to guess you would say Bush. People would think you'd say Obama, but I'm going to guess you'd say Bush 43.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not a fan of Bush, OK, and a lot of people are surprised. But he got us into Iraq. And if you look, Mark, in Reuters in '04, that's 11 years ago, Reuters, I said don't go into Iraq. You're going to destabilize the Middle East and the worst elements are going to take over the oil. And that's what happened.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> ALL right, so of the four, who is the best?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well -
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Bush 41, Clinton, Bush 43, or Obama, and why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would really say Clinton, probably. I would have to say Clinton.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> And why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There was a little spirit. Frankly, he would have been, had he not met Monica, had he not met Paula, had he not met various and sundry semi-beautiful women, he would have had a much better deal going. Do you agree with that, Joe? He would have had a much better - no, no seriously. He was destroyed by that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was really hurt really badly by it. But he's a tough one. You know, it's amazing the way -- look at the e-mail situation. Anybody else that would have been -- she would have been brought down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, I know how strong you are on that subject. But anybody else, can you imagine if a Republican deleted all of their e-mails after getting a subpoena? They would be in jail right now. With her, it's like, they don't -- I don't even hear them talking about it anymore. So I have to hand it to Clinton.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Her, to a lesser extent, but now maybe more. [End Video]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Ahead, Trump's rare personal insights into raising his family. What he had to say about Marco Rubio's hair --
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> What?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> '-- too. Marco Rubio's hair?
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Yeah, well, that's all straight ahead. You're watching Morning Joe. [Break]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Back now, Morning Joe's definitive interview with Donald Trump. How did the Donald raise such a remarkable family? We asked the presidential candidate to reflect on his three simple rules for raising children. They're good ones. But first, he shared his rough assessments of his Republican opponents. [Begin Video]
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Before you get to Hillary, you got to go through the Republican field. Is Jeb Bush conservative enough to be president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hear you talking about Jeb Bush, and except I know you're a very honest guy, I would have said you're on his pay roll. I say what the hell is he talking about? He couldn't answer a simple question on Iraq? Is Iraq good or bad, the war?
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We spend $2 trillion, thousands of lives lost, wounded warriors all over the place, who I love and who I help, and we have nothing. Yesterday, Iraq went to Iran, their meeting. They're going to merge. And exactly what I said in the Reuters article.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you ask that question, it took four days to say an answer. So I just think you're so wrong on him. I think he's a -- I think that Bush is a nice man. I call him -- he's a man that doesn't want to be doing what he's doing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I call him the reluctant warrior, and warrior is probably not a good word. But I think Bush is an unhappy person. I don't think he has any energy, and I don't see how he can win. In addition to that, he's in favor of Common Core and he's weak on immigration.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> What about Marco Rubio?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think he's highly overrated.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> What's your take on -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He lost me when he grabbed the water in the middle of his deal, like when he was responding to Obama's speech. He grabs the water. And it wasn't in a glass or even a cup. See? It wasn't -- it was a bottle of water with a label on it. And I said, what happened? I think he is highly overrated, and by the way, I have much better hair than he does. OK?
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> You have better hair than Rubio.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And you know it's my hair.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Well, I do because I tugged on it once. He let me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She tugged on it crazy.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> On this set.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Is there -- oh. Right there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hairspray, but it is mine.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> We're going to go to Mark for the next question.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right, off the rails. OK, then I have a question. Go ahead.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> Yesterday was a pretty big -- your announcement day was a pretty big day. What was it like for you and your family to be declared a candidate? You spent a lot of time with them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it was exciting. And I've gotten tremendous reviews on the speech for the most part. I've had a couple of people -- I'm not a fan of Krauthammer. I'm not a fan of George Will.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think he's a total dope, frankly. I know him. I think he's a total dope. You know, he's still angry.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He made a speech at Mar-a-Lago, and at the time, I wasn't interested. It was a terrible speech, George Will, and I didn't show up. I didn't want to go. I'm the one who got him there; I didn't want to go.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because I found him to be a boring person. And that was like 12 years ago and I probably should have gone, because he interviews -- but he's, you know, he's a zippos. I'm not a fan of those guys. Generally speaking, I've gotten fantastic reviews.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> I'm trying to humanize you here. I'm here about your time with your family. What was it like? On a big day, you announce for president. Did anyone cry?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody cried. Look, it wasn't -- [Laughter] There wasn't a dry eye in the house. No, nobody cried.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> Nobody cried.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody cried.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> Was there hugging?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My wife was happy. There was hugging, there almost kissing.
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> Almost kissing.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Almost.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let me tell you, that's not what people -- like somebody said, Donald, you do really well on this stuff. You do -- you know, I'm doing, and I think you will say, considering nobody, like nobody, thought I was running, I think I'm doing quite well. Right? They're all saying, oh, gee, he's taking the place of some senator who's a stiff. You know, all the people, right? I built $9 billion worth of net worth. I own some of the greatest properties in the entire world, mortgage free for the most part, very low debt. I do a show on NBC, The Apprentice
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> That's what I wanted to --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do a book, I do a book called The Art Of The Deal." It's probably the No. 1 best selling business book of all sometime. I go to the Wharton School of Finance
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So why do you think is?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> What do you think is behind that?
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> What's behind it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't want to say it because that would sound conceited. But there are --
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Please, go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, I don't want to do it. Why would I do that?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Well, no --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to be that way. But I will say this: My family is behind me 100 percent. But the reason I sort of want to laugh at the question a little bit, and I think it's a very nice question and I have a great family, I have a great wife. And you know my wife, and she's great and she's beautiful and my kids are beautiful, and Ivanka did an unbelievable job. They had 37 live feeds. They had cameras -- you have to say, that place was mobbed yesterday. You know it. There more cameras than to any other presidential announcement by a factor of three or four.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Mark Halperin, is that true?
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> Not by a factor or three of four.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, come on.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> There weren't.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Was anybody -- OK.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> There were as many cameras at the Bush announcement on Monday. There were.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We had many more.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> No. You didn't have many more.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'll tell you --
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> How do you know how many cameras were at the Bush announcement?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because the people who do it told me. They said we had many more. But here's the point. The point is very simple.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This -- somebody said to me yesterday, Mr. Trump, do you think you have the personality? You're not a nice person. Do you think you have the personality to win? I said, actually, I am a nice person. I have great relationships, I have great friendships, I have great everything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am. But I'll tell you what, it doesn't matter, because this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence. Because people are tired of being patsies for China, for Mexico, et cetera.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> All right, so Mark, you tried to humanize him. Now I'm going to try.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He tried.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> I tried.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> It didn't work. So this is what -- so for people who don't like you from a distance, and there are many --
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> And you don't know what that feels like. [Crosstalk]
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> No, no --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Joe, and many people who do.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> But let me finish. It's building up to something here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It sounds good.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Then they meet your children. And they do a 180. And they will all say, all across New York, I know you have heard it too. They say, you know what? He gets on TV and he's like a blowhard and he's like all this and all that, and then you meet his children, who are humble and kind and sweet.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> And accomplished.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> And giving, and accomplished, and they're working with their dad hard around the clock. And then they go, all right, I don't know what he's got, but he's got something because he's a hell of a father. Talk about that. Talk about, I mean, that must be, at the end of the day, you talk about a lot of different things. [Inaudible]. But at the end of the day, your two greatest accomplishments -- with the help of their mother, as you always say -- are your children.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right, I have smart children, good children. I'll give you an example. Yesterday, Ivanka got up, and in front of a tremendous throng of reporters and cameras and killers, some good, some bad, mostly good, really good response. I said, would you do me a favor? Would you introduce me, a couple weeks ago.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She said, Daddy, I would love to do it. Now, Ivanka went to Wharton; she was a phenomenal student. She was a very successful model and then she just gave it up cold turkey. She went to the Wharton School of Finance; she was a phenomenal student and does great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And she's a great kid. She got up in front of that throng yesterday, which was crazy, and she delivered the most beautiful five-minute little talk on her father. It was great to watch it. It was really great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I said, there aren't many young women her age that could even think about doing that. I was very proud of her because that was not easy to get up and do it. And she did it flawlessly. There was no stuttering, there was no mistakes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Other than the good things she said about me, of course. She said great things about me. But she's terrific. I have terrific children and they're doing very well in the business.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm lucky. I mean, I'm very lucky. I was tough with them.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> I was going to ask you, how did you keep them balanced? Because, unfortunately, we have seen these documentaries of kids of billionaires and they end up on drugs and they end up in rehab and they end up, a lot of them, dead. And they end up lost and wandering around for the rest of their lives. What did you do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I always tell me children -- I drive them crazy -- no drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes. Before they could speak. Like when they're 2. I take Ivanka, Don, Eric, now Barron, I have Barron, he's doing really nicely.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a good boy. He's tall and he just turned 9. He's 5'5. Can you believe it? He just turned 9.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hope he's not 7 feet. I mean And I tell them, no drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes. I usually say no tattoos, too. But if you look at society, I think we have given up on that, right? But I say no drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I remember Ivanka, she said, Dad, you're driving me crazy. And she didn't even know what drugs and alcohol was. And from a time there, right, because I have seen, Joe, friends of mine that are very successful people and they have kids that are very smart kids. They go to Harvard, they go to Wharton, they go to Stanford, they get on drugs, they get on alcohol, they're wiped out.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> No alcohol ever, not a glass of wine?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've never -- you know, I own the largest winery on the East Coast, in Virginia. The Kluge Estate, I bought it. Bought it out of bankruptcy, good deal. I make good deals. They were in for $178 million, I bought for $60 [Inaudible]. [Crosstalk]
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right, so anyway. Back to your point.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But the point is, I just think -- first of all, you know, you're born smart, you're born not smart, whether we like it or not.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Finish that story. So what were you going to say about alcohol?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I've seen people that have very smart children. When they go bad on drugs or alcohol, and I add cigarettes in there. But when they go bad, these kids are wiped out. Doesn't matter how smart.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The world is so competitive that you can't lose that extra percentage. And I've seen children that were really, really brilliant kids, top students, top scores in tests, top -- they get into drugs, they get in -- So I really think that the drugs, you've got to stop them. It's one of the things I do, because a lot of people do say how did you do so well with your children? How's that possible that you'd do so well with your children? And I do get a lot of credit from my children. They're very good children.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, now if I could find some wood, I'd start knocking on wood, because who knows. But they're great children. But I've really been --
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> By the way, he sounds like your dad there. Who knows?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Knock on wood.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Every time you get all about, every time say something good about your kids, you knock on wood. And then I cross myself even though I'm a Baptist.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right, because you don't know. Then you get a phone call, and you say oops.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Yes, exactly. You never know. [Crosstalk] And, by the way, we all get that phone call. [End Video]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Up next, the conclusion of our interview with Donald Trump, where he tells us whether or not he can do The Apprentice" from the Oval Office. Keep it right here on Morning Joe. [Break] Welcome back now to the conclusion of our wide ranging interview with Donald Trump where he told us --
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> This is like epic. It's kind of like North and South"
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> It's kind of fascinating in his own way --
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> It is remarkable.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> '-- where he told us what kind of vacations he would take as president, and to answer the burning question, what's going to happen to The Apprentice". [Begin Video]
<Mike Barnicle> <Negative> Donald, let me ask you, following you, listening to you, can be exhausting, because you do it from one topic to another, and you know, at high speed. Do you ever stop and just reflect on things? And what do you reflect on if you do stop and slow down upstairs?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Mike, you know, I love what I do. And you can see that. But I love what I do. I'm having fun doing it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now I'm doing this. I mean, I gave up a lot to do this. I'm not -- you know these politicians, they run, they lose, they win. They just run.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's what they do. I give up a lot. I give up hundreds of millions of dollars of deals. I give up a major television show.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not like a normal thing. You've got to love what you do. I like it so much, I don't really need a lot of down time. But when I have down time -- and when I have down time, I have the greatest resorts in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I'll go to Turnberry in Scotland, I'll go to Doral in Miami. I only go to my places because they're better. But I do have down time. Joe knows I have down time, Mika knows I have.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> So The Apprentice is not going to happen?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So The Apprentice" has been renewed. NBC loves Donald Trump Then I said, well, what about Ivanka? I think she would be great. But they said, no, no. They renewed The Apprentice.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Mark Burnett said you're the only guy I have ever seen that didn't take a big renewal. They want to do a big renewal. I'm not doing it because I'm doing this. We'll see what happens, Mika.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, if I -- I want to do well. But I'm not a masochist. You know, I have always heard that a very successful person cannot run for a political office. I've always heard that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Maybe it's going to be true. I'm going to find out.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Strategic advice for you for you: Do not call people losers. Say they have lack of command on the issues. Something like that, OK?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That takes too long. [Laughter]
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> Could you do The Apprentice" as president?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you can't. You see, the problem is --
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> You can't as a candidate, but --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're not allowed to do it because of the equal time rule.
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> Yeah, but what about as president?
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> You could as president.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> I don't know. I wouldn't, honestly, as president, this country -- I wouldn't be thinking about Apprentice.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right, Donald Trump, it's good to have you in.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good to have you. Thank you.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Very good to see you again. Thank you very much. Congratulations on officially jumping in this time. This is it. We'll be right back with much more of Morning Joe. [End Video]
