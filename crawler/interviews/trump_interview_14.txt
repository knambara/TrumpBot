<Bo Thompson> <Positive> Newstalk 1110 WBT. I'm Bo Thompson with the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. Thank you for being with me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Bo. It's an honor.
<Bo Thompson> <Positive> Welcome back to Charlotte. What a week to be at the end of the week in Charlotte after a week for the ages for you, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you got me in a very good time. That's why you're paid so much money I guess. You can get them at the right time. But I'm here and it's, you know, it's been a great state. North Carolina, it's been a great state for us and we're having the convention here as you know on August and we look forward to it. They wanted it badly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A lot of cities wanted it because it's a lot of economic development a lot of jobs. So for all of these big conventions you know they -- they want to have them but this is going to be a big one. There's gonna be a beauty. And we chose your state your city. I've done well here. I like it. It's a great place.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know so many people here. We have tremendous friendships. We won the state. Perhaps that has something to do but we won it. You know, pretty easy fashion. I hear we're up much higher now than we were even at Election Day, so that's good. We had a good week. The impeachment hoax ended and we have just a lot of good things are happening.
<Bo Thompson> <Negative> The State of the Union on Tuesday night. You awarded Rush Limbaugh with that Presidential Medal of Freedom. Rush Limbaugh has been on WBT for almost three decades and I'd love to know the background, a little bit of behind the scenes of how you made that decision and how it came to be and how he reacted.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I will tell you so Rush's the biggest of all time when you think of it. Many many millions of people a day. Nobody can do what he does. He speaks for three hours and no phone calls, no anything. You -- how tough a business it is, right, and you know you have so many millions of people. But from the day I ran, I came down the escalator with our future first lady and Rush was saying such great things and I didn't know Rush at that time other than I knew him by reputation, and he was No. 1 by a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Always has been, I guess pretty much. And he was saying these great things then I got to know him. He went all-in, right at the beginning. He went all-in. He agreed with everything I was talking about whether was immigration, whether it was Second Amendment, everything I talked about he agreed with. The military, we have to fix our military.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We did that cutting taxes. We did that so many other things and I kept hearing about Rush, that he was, you know, just for me. And over the time I got to know him a little bit that I got to know him a lot. He's an incredible guy who's going through a rough spell right now as you know it. Was announced with lung cancer but he's being treated and hopefully, he's gonna be OK. But he is an incredible guy and I know he's with you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're in a little slightly different time but he's -- he's gonna be a tough one. I think that rough -- Rush will -- He's such a strong guy. He's going to beat whatever it is. We hope he does. But you know he's got a very serious problem with that.
<Bo Thompson> <Positive> Sir, at that speech we all saw what happened behind you at the very end of it. I am curious. You didn't see it because you were looking forward. I imagine you got out of the chamber and -- and eventually, you saw it on a phone or something. How did you first learn about that and what was your initial gut reaction.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I didn't hear it either. You know normally you can hear somebody ripping up that much paper but I didn't hear it. It's an important document. It was really not allowed to do it, it's a criminal event. She's not allowed to do that but she is very sad if you want to know the truth. When you think about it, it's sad but I didn't see it. I was looking forward, that was the end.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Everybody was -- When I say everybody, a big portion of that room was going crazy and the other portion sits very quietly and still and angered, a lot of anger. But success is bringing everyone around. I mean, you see, we've never been this successful, we've never had a country this successful. Where No. 1 in the world by far.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If the opponent got in, China would have overtaken us and now we're way ahead of China and doing really well. We made our China deal, we made our USMCA. Japan deal, we're taking in $40 billion from Japan. They never paid a cent since. South Korea and many others so, you know, we're just doing great. I think success brings it all together because ultimately that's what it's about, jobs and safety and all of the things that we provide.
<Bo Thompson> <Positive> Wow. We look forward to seeing you in several months and the convention your second time around. Is this one gonna be different than the first now that you're the president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we had our choice of going first or second because I'm president and we chose second, which is good. And then going being the second one out of the box is probably a better. But I just, you know, I love the state and we're here for that reason and Charlotte's been good. [Inaudible] You know, they really are -- and they really did, they worked hard to get it so many people did but they really worked hard to get it. So this is what we -- we did, we made this choice.
<Bo Thompson> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you very much for your time today. I appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. It's an honor to be with you. Thank you very much.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> We are happy to have you here with us the President of the United States, Donald Trump. It's so great to have you back here, sir. Thank you for joining us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well thank you, Rush, very much.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> OK. I have had a lot of people say to me, they're reacting to the media reaction of the action we took, that you took, against the Quds Force commander in Iran. Mr. President, people being scared that their kids are being scared to death out of their minds that somehow this is going to start World War 3. That that we are now more unsafe than we have ever been.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> Could you explain to people why what you've done here makes us safer, why it was necessary, and why what we did was right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well this should have been done for the last 15 to 20 years. Him in particular. He was there a real military leader. He's a terrorist. He was designated a terrorist by President Obama and then Obama did nothing about it except give them $150 billion and even more incredibly $1.8 billion in cash. You hear me talking about that all the time and you talk about it all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He gave me all this money. He never wanted to do anything about it. President Bush should have taken him out. He is responsible for the IEDs. That was the roadside bombs and bombs that blow up all over the place and then the sister, which is the big one, the big version that actually knocked out tanks and kills everybody within -- within earshot.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A really horrible weapon. He's responsible for all those incredible young people over at Walter Reed, where they do such a great job, by the way. And when they lose their arms and their legs, oh no, he gave so much of that technology, much of that stuff was made in Iran, and he should have been taken out a long time ago and we had a shot at it and we took him out and we're a lot safer now because of it. Now we'll see what happens, we'll see what the responsive is, if any, but you've seen what I said our response will be.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Well, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Our country is a lot safer, Rush.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> They said they got 21 targets they're looking at and you came back said, "Fine, I got 52 of yours." I don't think that they are accustomed to a president like you, sir. I mean you just mentioned it, Obama basically appears them. Obama worked with this guy on the Iranian nuclear deal. What -- A lot of things that will surprise you when you -- when you assumed office and found out some things done previously in policy.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> What was the purpose of American policy with Iran prior to your presidency?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think they had a purpose. I don't think they knew what was happening. Why does it give them $150 billion much of it going back into terror and you look at what's happening. When I -- they tried to do with appeasement and I can tell you the Logan Act, if there was ever an act that should have been used, they should look at the Obama administration and John Kerry, the Logan Act, because what he was doing with Iran and the relationship that they built up and the things that he said I would certainly love to see that be looked at because I think John Kerry was, personally, I think he was advising them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that the Obama administration was -- was just letting them get away with murder in the true sense murder, and you know right after they made the deal it wasn't like they were respected. They treated the United States worse than ever before. In fact, I said at least give him a little respect because they treated -- they got worse they actually got more hostile.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They took 150 billion and they took the 1.8 billion in cash and they got worse. And if you remember right before the payment was made. They took 10 sailors and they humiliated those sailors and they humiliated our country with the sailors down on their knees. And the other reason they released them was they wanted their first payment.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was just before the payment if they had taken them after they got the money they would have never released them. They'd be there now. Well they wouldn't be there now with me but they would be there for a long period of time. But you remember the 10 sailors that were --
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Fifteen feet across that line, probably they weren't they don't even know if they were in Iranian waters but they said they were slightly in Iranian waters so they humiliated them. But they released them because the money was due the following day. And they said, well we don't want to. Hey, why should they turn down 150 billion over the 10 sailors?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they humiliated those sailors and our country.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Well he also lifted sanctions on -- on solely money as part of the -- part of the Iran deal that looks like to me, anyway, that Obama looked at that administration looked at building Iran up as some way stabilizing the region as though Israel is not the good guys, it's though we're not the good guys that Iran needs to be made stronger, this is what they believe.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Otherwise, that whole region is kind of a tinderbox. But the thing really is true about this is the Middle East has changed in priority because of the massive improvements made in domestic energy in the United States we're no longer dependent on that region.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Right. Well that's right. And one of the things that changed. I know you talk about it. If you go back 10 years or eight years or maybe even five years, Israel was the king of the Congress, right. Our Congress protected Israel and fought for Israel. Now you look at the way the Democrats in Congress are treating, where you have AOC and you have Tlaib and you have Omar and they are actually, you know, anti-Semitic they are totally against Israel to things that they've said you go back to the past and you look at the things that they've said about Israel and Jewish people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's incredible. Ten years ago that would have been unaccepted it would have been -- it would have been -- nobody could have even believed it. I still can't believe it. You know I'm a little bit old fashioned, right, in that sense because I've grown up and there was always great protection and reverence for Israel and now it's the opposite.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In the Democrats, it's almost it's almost a negative. They're going out and what they do for Tlaib and what they do for Omar, Representative Omar, Minnesota, and AOC, I think it's incredible the way they talk about Israel. It just was unthinkable to do that 10 years ago and sooner.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> I actually think that you've had a role in driving them even more insane than they were. And let me give you some evidence. Let's go back to the day you came down the escalator and announced your candidacy. You announced the slogan: Make America Great Again, and all of a sudden Make America Great Again become some wildly controversial prospect.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> And I'm asking myself, what in the world is controversial at all? How can anybody disagree with America being great, becoming great, remaining great, and yet it was. How do you explain that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well you know politics has changed a lot over the last couple of years. For instance, I want low taxes, they want to raise your taxes. How do you think that works? I couldn't win as a politician. I don't think Abe Lincoln could win as a politician. Borders, they want open borders. When you see the people that we're sending back and we're capturing now at record levels, these are, in many cases, they're murderers and they're people that drug dealers and it's incredible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They want open borders. That means all of these people are going to be pouring in. And of course good ones will come in too but you have tremendous numbers of really bad people including murderers and rapists and others. They want open borders. They want sanctuary cities. They don't want a strong military based on everything.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, we have to fight like crazy to get the strong military. And we have to give up things that we wouldn't give up if we had The House, as an example, if we were able to have enough. You know we've always needed their vote because it was always very close. In fact, the first two years we had a very tiny majority.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we always needed their votes. But when you see they want higher taxes, right. They want -- They want much more regulation. You know cut regulations more than any president in history by far. Even though they were there for four and eight years and in one case more than that, we've got the all-time record, that was probably as important or more important as the tax cuts, the biggest, including Ronald Reagan, the biggest tax cut we've ever had and we're actually taking in more revenue now than we did when we had the higher taxes because the economy's doing so well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you know when you see them with open borders, Rush, you say -- and sanctuary cities and all of these other things you say, "Where are they coming from?" Well Israel is sort of the same. I put that in that same category. They're -- they're as far as I'm concerned they're anti-Israel, totally anti-Israel.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> Well it's -- it's -- it's always perplexed me that they have -- You have drawn them out. They have now with Twitter in the past two or three days since the attack on [Inaudible]. You mean literally you have the Democrat Party and elements of that party openly supporting Iran an enemy of the United States, openly supporting the terrorist actions of that country.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> And this is a country that beheads homosexuals and transgenders and has no human rights for the very constituency the Democrat Party claims to represent. Yet here they are tweeting their support for these people right simply in opposition to you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's amazing. Like as an example take -- take the wall. They were always for the wall and then I wanted it and they went against it. In fact, I said if I had it to do again I would have come out totally against the wall and I would have gotten their votes. OK. All I had to do is come out against the wall.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am opposed to building the wall and we would have gotten all the votes we needed. Now it's almost like they'll try and do whatever is the opposite. I think they've lost their minds. You want to know the truth. I really do. It's a terrible thing to say. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. Like even the impeachment hoax, you take a look at that and they have nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have nothing. With one of the biggest investigations in history they found nothing, the Mueller report, they found absolutely -- think of it. They spent $45 million, two years to hoax. They spent all of that time, all of that money, had brilliant people that happened to be, you know, very, very -- they were crazed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They were crazed. I mean, these people were dying to find something on Trump. They found nothing. I think there's very few people that you've ever met who could have had that. They had so many investigators, they were calling people that I haven't seen in years and they got nothing. Think of that. Nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very few people, and by the way, I'm sure they looked at my taxes. They looked at everything you had to look at. They looked at everything and $45 million and much more than that in the true sense. You know, in the real sense, it was much more than that, and they had 18. I used to call them 13 angry Democrats but they increased it to 18 angry Democrats.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Well, party.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's smart. And very smart, many were tied up with Clinton. They were involved with Clinton but these people couldn't find any. They found nothing. Even I was very impressed with how clean I am, Rush.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> You ought to be. You are -- you may be cleaner than any previous president that we can think of. Anyway, I got take a quick time out. We have President Trump with us for the remaining part of the program the last of the half hour and we'll continue with him right after this. [Commercial Break] And we are back with President Trump you mentioned the impeachment hoax.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> Nancy Pelosi has not delivered these two articles of impeachment that are, frankly, a -- they're both of them jokes. What do you suspect is happening here with this one. What is the politics of this? What are they trying to achieve here? I mean, I know throw you out of office now but what -- what's the point you're not sending these articles over?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I think what they're trying to do is affect the election illegally but that's what they're trying to do. But the reason that I said it because they're -- they are a joke. They are not crimes. There is nothing there. They found nothing. We went through two years of a Muller report. You know that better than anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody covered it better. And we went through to you [Inaudible] --
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> I think I'm more frustrated by it than you are. You have to deal with it but it makes -- it makes a lot of us livid that this is because there's nothing. Everything to this has been made up. It's worse than a hoax. The first part of it was a coup. And this is just a continuation of it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah. It's so sad for our country. I mean, think of it, we're fighting with Iran. We're fighting with all of these different places and in many cases doing great, making trade deals and doing so good, our country is doing so good. But I have to spend and my team has to spend time on this stuff. They found nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Just think of that for two years. And -- and unlimited budget, unlimited talent and they found nothing. And they come up with two -- two articles that aren't even a crime.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> Well that was nothing to find it was all made up. I mean, that's the frustrating thing here. It was all made it was nothing to find. There was nothing to investigate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They created a situation that was false, that was fraudulent, and then they investigated the false-fraudulent situation and they found nothing. It's hard to believe the whole thing's are to blame. And now on top of it they come up with two articles and they put it before. Now, what happened is she doesn't want to get a vote because, how could anybody possibly, it's totally partisan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know this was not what they had in mind as they call them the founders, right. They keep saying the founders, founders. But the founders didn't have this in mind. You understand. It's like I've never heard the word founders so much in my life.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> But they don't have anything in common with the founders anyway.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. You know we got a hundred, I guess, 196 or 197 to nothing with the Republican Party, plus we have three Democrat votes, and one person actually left the Democratic -- the Democrat party over it and joined the Republican Party as you know.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> Speaking of which, the Republican Party hasn't been as unified and I don't know how long
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Never. It's never -- I -- they say maybe never. And one thing I gave the Democrats credit for, they've always been very vicious and that's not necessarily a good thing. But what is a good thing is they always stuck together. And here, the Republicans stuck together even better than the Democrats. So we had like 196 or 197 to nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's unheard of. You know that because they're always -- always break it off and I don't know. And this is really for 70 years, 80 years. You know for some reason it's in the DNA. They just don't seem. And in this case they have been so good. And I think they said it will be the same way because the Senate knows it's a hoax.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everybody knows it's a hoax.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> Well it doesn't. A The Republican Party is now the party of Trump. I mean there's no question about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I just think it's a party of common sense. You know I view it -- somebody said, "Are you conserve -- ", well, I'm conservative. But I think it's common sense. It was -- like what we did this -- this two days ago with this horrible terrorists. He was a terrorist. You know they don't want to call him a terrorist.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now the Democrats are trying to make him sound like it was this wonderful human being.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> He was a poet. Yeah, he was a poet. Used to be poetry out there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, when you read the New York Times, you read The Washington Post, that are totally fake newspapers by the way, that would have both been out of business except I won. I wonder what happens and hopefully in five years, right, hopefully in five years. But I wonder what happens to those newspapers. Who knows.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they do well now. Although if you look at the unfunded liability, probably, they don't do so well. But you look at what they write. It's so fake, it's so phony and now they're trying to build him just like they did Al-Baghdadi. Al-Baghdadi was the number one terrorist in the world. We got him. They wrote very little about it, relatively speaking.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That story disappeared very quickly, as you know. But they tried to build him up into a -- into a relatively wonderful man. He was a total bad guy. Now he founded ISIS. He was doing it again. He was trying to do it again. You know I wiped out ISIS by our -- during our administration we wiped out the entire caliphate 100% of the caliphate and we wiped him out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, you know, got little credit but our our people know that we did it, Rush, because if people like you and Sean Hannity and Mark Levin and so many others. Your friends at Fox and Friends in the morning are so good. You know, people are getting it, they really get it because of social media and my Twitter, without Twitter, I think, we'd be -- we'd be lost.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We wouldn't be able to get the truth out.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> Yeah. That's a -- that's a good point. People still say to me, "You'd need to ask him to stop tweeting." So what I tell them, "Look it's the only way he can get his message out and it's not a negative at all, people." He needs to you need to dial back the drama, needs to dial back the chaos. I disagree with that.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> I think you're doing exactly what you have to do given the circumstances presented to you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I wish I didn't have to do it. I wish we had legitimate newspaper and legitimate media. We don't. I mean, it's much of it is -- is really, I call it corrupt, it's the corrupt media. And you know it's very internal. You understand this better than anybody. If they do a story in me, I immediately know if it's false or not false so I don't mind a bad story of if it's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I know. A person reading the story doesn't know that it's false. So I'm able to tell them through social media. I don't even call it Twitter. I call it social media because it goes to everything, you know, goes to Facebook, it goes to Instagram and we have hundreds of millions of people. You know we have a tremendous amount of people just on one side.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm up to I guess close to 70 million people.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Negative> Yeah. They're jealous as they can be [Inaudible] Of course they want you to stop.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just had dinner -- I had dinner with Mark Zuckerberg the other day and he said , "I'd like to congratulate you." in front of a large group of people so I'm not that -- But he said, "I'd like to congratulate you. You're No.1 on Facebook." And, you know, it's it's incredible. And that's --
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You had dinner with Zuckerberg?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I did.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Oh, wait the world finds out about that. And he just did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have semi-breaking news, I guess a couple of people might have reported it but they're not like you. So I just got a list to TSL Power 50, the No. 1 show on radio. There's a guy named Rush Limbaugh. Did you ever hear of him? Rush Limbaugh, No. 1. Have you? And this is the 50 most influential and most listened-to streaming talk shows in the country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Rush Limbaugh, No. 1. So I hope you saw that but now we've just made your interview. But your viewers have to know that, your listeners have to know that. No. 1. Great job.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Thank you, sir. You know your timing is impeccable you're a you're a broadcast specialist from The Apprentice and so forth and you've -- you're right up to the break here. I can't thank you enough for this. I wish we had even more time. People love you, sir, and they are grateful, and they know what they know that you still are focused on them, that you're still implementing the [Inaudible] --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love 'em. I love 'em.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> They know that too. Thank you so much for your time and have a great, great rest of this day and year. Hope it's the greatest year of your life, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Well, thank you very much, Rush. Thank you for everything and congratulations on your incredible success. I really -- it's so important for this country what you do. Thank you very much, Rush.
<Rush Limbaugh> <Positive> Thank you.
<Jackie Coffin> <Positive> You mentioned Ronnie Jackson and Brett Kavanaugh as reasons that you're coming to Montana to campaign against Jon Tester. Is this race personal for you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's very personal, because they were treated so unfairly. Ronnie Jackson is an admiral, and he's a doctor. He's been a doctor for years at the White House. One of the highest thought of, and regarded men anywhere. Just a fantastic man. He was the doctor for President Obama, President Bush, and myself. And what John Tester put him through is disgraceful.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Tried to ruin his reputation, in a way did ruin his reputation, and it turned out to be false, and it was a horrible thing that happened. And then on top of that, he voted against Justice Kavanaugh, now Justice Kavanaugh. And, as you know, a woman just came out and said that it was a fake story, she made it up. It was a lie.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, they're waiting for other things to happen. And what they put him through was horrible, Justice Kavanaugh. Just horrible. So yeah, it becomes personal when they do that to Admiral Jackson, who's -- again, his son just graduated at one of the top spots in Annapolis. Just graduated last year. One of the finest families, incredible family, wife, everybody, and for them to say the kind of things they said about him for political reasons, and then it was all false.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But by then, the damage was done to a family. That's why I'm here, and that was all done by Jon Tester. It was horrible.
<Jackie Coffin> <Positive> And another person you're campaigning for, Greg Gianforte, last time when you were in Montana, in Missoula, you made some lighthearted, joking comments about Congressman Gianforte's assault of a reporter. Are those comments you still stand behind? Is it okay to use violence against the media?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have to do this, okay? I have to tell you something. Greg is one of the most respected men -- in a short period of time, he's become one of the most, and I mean, one of the most respected people in Congress. Everybody listen to -- listens to him. His ideas are fantastic. and his whole thought process -- he's just a, a fantastic person.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we're really honored to have Greg, and I hear is doing very well, and I hope he does very well. But he loves the people of Montana.
<Jackie Coffin> <Negative> And, there is a huge problem in Montana right now with violence against Native American and Indigenous women. They're disappearing from our reservations and our towns.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That is horrible. Is this at a faster rate? Is this now at a more -- faster rate?
<Jackie Coffin> <Negative> -- And our towns? Yes, compared to other women in America, they face significantly higher rates of domestic abuse sexual assault, and they're disappearing without a trace. Could there be something done at a federal, or even a presidential level to bring awareness to this issue, and combat some of this violence?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the answer is yes, and I'll talk to Matt and I'll speak to Greg and I will do something about that. I have been hearing about it. I think it's terrible. This is again, maybe, human trafficking, which is worldwide, because of the Internet, it's at the highest level it's ever been. You know, who would think this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You would think it's 500 years ago we're talking about. Human trafficking is terrible. Now, that could be the case in this situation. But I have been hearing about it, and I've been actually hearing about it from Greg, who was saying that it's terrible, what is going on. We will look at it from the federal level.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Absolutely. It is horrible.
<Jackie Coffin> <Positive> All right. And turning to a little a little bit to agriculture, which is one of our top economies in Montana.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Jackie Coffin> <Negative> Farmers are feeling frustrated, because they're not able to sell their crops and the products they produce because of increasing tariffs from the Chinese market. Is there a point when you would roll back some tariffs to give our farmers relief?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we want to open the China markets. And, what we're doing is, you know we just made a great deal with Canada, where that whole market is opening up, which is great for your farmers. And we just also made a deal with Mexico, also made a deal with South Korea, and then we're in the midst of a real battle with China, who has really taken advantage of the country for a long time, and we're going to win that, and we're going to open up China to our farmers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, they will go through. This is a little bit of a short term. Don't forget, when I -- when I said Canada, they all said, you'll never be able to do what we did, and we did it, and it's successful, and everybody's happy with it. Your farmers are you happy with it. But, we are going to be opening up China, and in order to get them there, I have to do tariffs, and tariffs have really been great, because they are -- they want to talk.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They want to talk. We want to open up China to your farmers, which would make it better than it's ever been. You know, farmers have been going down economically over a 15 year period -- long before we got here. We're going to have to go the other way.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> Last question.
<Jackie Coffin> <Positive> And -- and also talking about farmers, again real quickly, in migrant labor, in our Montana's agriculture economy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Jackie Coffin> <Negative> Could there not be a place to bring migrants coming here, to places like Montana, with underemployment, where we need more people in our agriculture sector?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to allow people into the country legally. And that means -- that includes people that help the farmers. And that's part of what we're doing. We're openly allowing -- because we need workers. I mean, we're at 3.7% unemployment, which is the lowest in 50 years, which is great, but we need workers for the farmers and others.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we are going to allow large numbers of people, but they're going to come in legally. That way we have safety also.
<Jackie Coffin> <Positive> Any final message you want to send to the people of Montana?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I just would like to have you go out and vote for Matt Rosendale and for Greg, who are two terrific people, and they represent you well in D.C., and -- Matt's going to be a great senator, and Greg has already proven himself. He's been a great congressman, and we just had a terrific, a terrific group of people out there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I really enjoyed it. I love this state. Very special. Thank you very much.
<Jackie Coffin> <Positive> Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Great job.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I'm Chris Wallace.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Today, the Trump way. We go on the road with President-elect Trump for his first Sunday show interview since winning the election.
<Notes> <Neutral> [BEGIN VIDEOTAPE]
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> The CIA has concluded that Russia intervened in the election to help you win the presidency.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> We'll take you behind the scenes for an all-access look at a day in the life of the Trump transition.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> Now, let's go to election night. You were prepared to lose.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> And as he makes his unofficial debut as commander-in-chief at the Army/Navy game.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> We sit down at Trump Tower to discuss the big decisions he's made so far and preview what's ahead, on the cabinet he's putting together.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Fair to say you're going to take a wrecking ball to the Obama legacy?
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Whether he trusts the intelligence community.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> These are the folks you're going to have to rely on to know what's going on in the world.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> And, will he cut his ties to Trump businesses?
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> You're keeping your stake in "Celebrity Apprentice." You're going to keep your stake in your real estate business. Isn't that a huge conflict of interest, sir?
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> President-elect Donald Trump one on one. It's a "Fox News Sunday" exclusive.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> Then, we'll ask our Sunday panel about some of the Trump picks who have been fighting the departments they're now set to lead.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> All, right now, on "Fox News Sunday."
<Notes> <Neutral> [END VIDEOTAPE]
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> And hello again from Fox News in Washington.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Donald Trump is running a presidential transition unlike any other, acting in some ways as if he's already commander in chief.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Because of that, we're calling this hour "The Trump Way".
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> The president-elect sat down with us for his first in-depth interview since he started naming his cabinet and setting his agenda for an administration that starts in less than six weeks.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> We began with breaking news. The explosive story that the CIA has determined Russia hacked into Democratic files not just to destabilize the U.S. election but to push a specific objective.
<Notes> <Neutral> [BEGIN VIDEOTAPE]
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> According to The Washington Post, the CIA has concluded that Russia intervened in the election to help you win the presidency. Your reaction?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENT-ELECT: I think it's ridiculous. I think it's just another excuse. I don't believe it. I don't know why, and I think it's just -- you know, they talked about all sorts of things. Every week, it's another excuse.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College. I guess the final numbers are now at 306. She's down to a very low number.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't believe that at all.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> You say you don't know why. Do you think the CIA is trying to overturn the results of the election --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think --
<Notes> <Neutral> [CROSSTALK]
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> -- somehow to weaken you in office?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, if you look at the story and you take a look at what they said, there's great confusion. Nobody really knows.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And hacking is very interesting. Once they hack, if you don't catch them in the act, you're not going to catch them. They have no idea if it's Russia or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed some place. I mean, they have no idea.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> So, why would the CIA put out this story that the Russians wanted you to win?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not sure they put it out. I think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country. And, frankly, I think they're putting it out. It's ridiculous.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We ought to get back to making America great again, which is what we're going to do. And we've already started the process.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> You've said repeatedly you don't believe the intelligence community's analysis that the Russians were involved.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Take a look. They're not sure. They're fighting among themselves. They're not sure.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But the question is, these are the folks you're going to have to rely on to know what's going on in the world?
<Notes> <Neutral> [CROSSTALK]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Of course, we're going to make (ph) changes, you know, at the top. I mean, we're going to have different people coming in because we have our people, they have their people. And I have great respect for them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But if you read the stories, the various stories, they're disputing. And certain groups don't necessarily agree. Personally, it could be Russia. It -- I don't really think it is. But who knows? I don't know either. They don't know and I don't know.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> I just want to ask you about your skepticism about the intelligence community. You are getting the presidential daily brief --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> -- only once a week.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I get it when I need it.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But is there some skepticism?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> First of all, these are very good people that are giving me the briefings. If something should change from this point, immediately call me. I'm available on one minute's notice.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't have to be told -- you know, I'm like a smart person. I don't have to be told the same thing and the same words every single day for the next eight years. It could be eight years -- but eight years. I don't need that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I do say if something should change, let us know. Now, in the meantime, my generals are great, are being briefed. Mike Pence is being briefed, who is, by the way, one of my very good decisions. He's terrific. And they're being briefed. And I'm being briefed also.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But if they're going to come in and tell me the exact same thing that they told me, you know, that doesn't change necessarily. There might be times where it might change. I mean, there will be some very fluid situations. I'll be there not every day but more than that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I don't need to be told, Chris, the same thing every day, every morning, same words. Sir, nothing has changed. Let's go over it again. I don't need that.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> President Obama just ordered a full review of Russia's involvement, hacking in the election. And Democrats are now calling for hearings.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Do you think this is part of an effort to undercut you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it could be. I think President Obama's been terrific. He's been very respectful of the process and everything else. So, I saw that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But -- and I want it too. I think it's great. I think -- I don't want anyone hacking us. And I'm not only talking about countries. I'm talking about anyone, period.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But if you're going to do that, I think you should not just say Russia, you should say other countries also, and maybe other individuals. It's not necessarily --
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Do you think this is a political effort here?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It could be. I mean, it could be. Hey, look, we had many people saying one of the great victories of all time. They're very embarrassed.
<Notes> <Neutral> [END VIDEOTAPE]
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> We'll have much more of our exclusive interview with Mr. Trump a little later.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> Who will he choose for secretary of state, and will he really cut all ties to the Trump businesses?
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But first, we also went on a road trip with the president-elect to the Army/Navy game, a rivalry dating back to 1890. And along the way, we learned a lot about the style of our new commander-in-chief.
<Notes> <Neutral> [BEGIN VIDEOTAPE]
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> We pulled out of Trump Tower in a full-scale presidential motorcade. Streets in Midtown Manhattan were blocked off, and the crowd watched signaled how they felt about the president-elect.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> At LaGuardia, we drove right up to Trump Force One. It was the first time we could find a president-elect was going to an Army/Navy game. Mr. Trump climbed on board the plane, he says, is a step up from Air Force One.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Much of his team was there. Chief of staff Reince Priebus and senior adviser Steve Bannon, national security adviser, General Mike Flynn, and Rudy Giuliani, who just took himself out of the running for secretary of state.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Once we leveled off, I asked the president-elect about his new life.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Army/Navy game, in a sense, is this your unofficial debut as commander-in-chief?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, it's just something I've wanted to see. It's beautiful. It's hopefully going to be a good game. But really just something I want to see. It's the Armed Forces, the way I look at it. And I love and respect the Armed Forces.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, it's going to be -- I think we're going to have a good time.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> You spent five years at the New York Military Academy, a boarding school, where you became the captain of cadets. What did you learn there about military discipline?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I learned that I respected it. I respect people in the military. And I always have, at least since I've been there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we had military people there. We had drill sergeants and colonels. We actually had a general. I always respected those people. I learned at a young age, they're terrific.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> There is a lot of curiosity about your lifestyle as president. Are you going to live in the White House? Are you going to spend most of your time at Trump Tower?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm going to live in the White House with my family. Baron is going to finish up school because he's got just a couple months to go. So, it's a little hard to take him out of school. And Melania will be back and forth for that first couple of months.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, we'll be staying in the White House.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> You talk about the fact that Mrs. Trump is going to stay back in New York with Baron until he finishes school. Are you going to be lonely rattling around in the White House by yourself for a few months?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I'll be working. I'll be working. It's a very special place and it represents so much. And there's a lot to do. There's a lot to do. More than I even thought.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's -- so many things we can do to make America great again. That's what it's all about. And I'll be working. I won't be lonely at all.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Are your daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, are they moving to Washington?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're working that out right now. They're both very talented people. I won't be involved in my business at all, even though I have a legal right to be under the laws, as you know, because the president has a certain doctrine that he can do things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I just don't want to do it. Even if I could do it, which I'm allowed to, I wouldn't want to. I want to devote my time --
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> What about them? Are they going to -- are they moving?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, theirs is a little bit different. And I think we'll have to see how the laws read. I would love to be able to have them involved.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you look at Ivanka, you take a look, she's so strong, as you know, to the women's issue and childcare, and so many things she'd be so good. Nobody can do better than her. I'd just have to see whether or not we can do that. She'd like to do that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd love to have Jared helping us on deals with other nations and see if we can do peace in the Middle East and other things. He's very talented. He's a very talented guy. So, we're looking at that from a legal standpoint right now.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Then, it was on to the stadium for the game.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> First, a meeting with a group of Army cadets and Navy midshipmen.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who's going to win? Who's going to win?
<Notes> <Neutral> [INAUDIBLE]
<Unknown> <Neutral> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One picture, one picture.
<Notes> <Neutral> [CHEERS]
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> And when he appeared in public to greet the crowd from a balcony, he received a big ovation.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Later, we asked the president-elect about attending a game that now has special resonance for him.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> So, what do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's fantastic. These are incredible people. You see the enthusiasm, the spirit. Incredible.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> You're going to be the commander-in-chief in six weeks.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> You're going to be in charge of these young men and women. Thoughts about that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Big responsibility. We have to make the right decisions. You know, it really is -- it's a daunting responsibility. And we'll do the job.
<Notes> <Neutral> [END VIDEOTAPE]
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> And if you missed it, Army beat Navy 21-17, its first victory over the midshipmen in 15 years.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Coming up, much more of our exclusive interview with Donald Trump. We ask him to clear up exactly where he stands on climate change and about that big cabinet pick he still has to make for secretary of state -- as "Fox News Sunday" continues its special coverage of "The Trump Way".
<Notes> <Neutral> [COMMERCIAL BREAK]
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> And we're back now with our exclusive interview with Donald Trump. The campaign is over, but the president-elect continues to break the rules when it comes to building his administration and setting his agenda. And that's where we began this part of the conversation.
<Notes> <Neutral> [BEGIN VIDEOTAPE]
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> We're calling this program "The Trump Way", because I got to tell you, in almost 40 years of covering presidential transitions, I've never seen anything like this. You are setting markers for foreign countries. You're telling corporations and unions what to do. And you're in the even in office yet.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> What can we expect when you're actually the president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want to make good deals for this country. I don't need a $4.2 billion airplane to fly around in, OK? I don't need that, especially when it's totally out of control. You know, they've lost control of it. I let them know that I don't want this.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I just see things that's -- if you look at the F-35 program with the money, the hundreds of billions of dollars, and it's out of control. And the people that are making these deals for the government, they should never be allowed to go to work for these companies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, they make a deal like that and two or three years later, you see them working for these companies that made the deal. I'm going to a very -- you know, lobbyists I'm doing. This is bigger than the lobbyists. When people order from these massive companies, these massive deals, I don't want the people making these horrible -- and they're horrible deals -- the overruns, the cost overruns, I don't want them going to work for the companies after the deals are made. They should have a lifetime restriction.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> In the last few days, you have named cabinet heads, Department Agency people at EPA, at labor, at health and human services, education, who are diametrically opposed to what those agencies have been doing for the last eight years. Fair to say you're going to take a wrecking ball to the Obama legacy?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. No, I don't want to do that at all. I just want what's right. EPA, you can't get things approved. People are waiting in line for 15 years before they get rejected, OK?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's why people don't want to invest in this country. I mean, you look at what's going on -- and you can look at a jobs report, but take a look at the real jobs report, which are the millions of people that gave up looking for work, and they're not considered in that number that's less than 5 percent. OK?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, we have jobs that are in the pipeline, and I deal with all the executives, the big ones and the small ones. I have really gotten to know this country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And when you have to wait 10 and 15 years for an approval and then you don't even get the approval, it's no good.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Let me ask you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, we're going to clean it up. We're going to speed it up. And, by the way, if somebody is not doing the right thing, we're not going to approve.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Let's talk about the environment because in the last week, you met with Al Gore and you met with Leo DiCaprio, famous environmentalist.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure. And they were good meetings.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> On the other hand, you appointed Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to be head of the EPA.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sped up (ph) the process.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> He's been suing EPA.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> At one point in the campaign, you said it's a hoax.
<Notes> <Neutral> [BEGIN VIDEO CLIP]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, I think it's a big scam for a lot of people to make a lot of money. In the meantime, China is eating our lunch because they don't partake in all of the rules and regulations that we do.
<Notes> <Neutral> [END VIDEO CLIP]
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> On the other hand, you told The New York Times, you're open-minded about it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am open-minded.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> So, where are you on the environment?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm still open-minded. Nobody really knows.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've -- look, I'm somebody that gets it. And nobody really knows. It's not something that's so hard and fast.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do know this: other countries are eating our lunch. If you look at what China is doing, if you look at what -- I could name country after country. You look at what's happening in Mexico where our people -- just our plants are being built. They don't wait ten years to get an approval to build a plant, OK? They build it like the following day or the following week.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We can't let all of these permits that take forever to get stop our jobs. I won because of the fact that people that are great, great American people have been forgotten. I call them the forgotten man and the forgotten woman. They've been forgotten.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you, in all fairness, and all of the folks in your world, and business, you forgot about these people. They're not going to forget about them in four years. They're already trying to figure out what happened. But I understood it because I understand our country.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Let me ask you a couple specific questions. Will you still pull out of the Paris climate agreement, which has been signed by more than 100 countries to reduce carbon emissions? Will you restart the Dakota Access Pipeline, which the Army just stopped?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK. Let me not answer the Dakota because perhaps that'll be solved by the time I get there, so I don't have to create enemies on one side or the other. But I will tell you when I get to office, if it's not solved, I'll have it solved very quickly.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Meaning you're going to start it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not saying anything. I just say something will happen, and it'll be quick. I think it's very unfair. So, it'll start one way or the other.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> And Paris?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You'll have a decision pretty quickly. And also, the Keystone Pipeline, you're going to have a decision fairly quickly. And you'll see that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, Paris, I'm studying. I do say this -- I don't want that agreement to put us at a competitive disadvantage with other countries. As you know, there are different times and different time limits on that agreement. I don't want that to give China or other countries signing agreements and advantage over us.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> You have already named three retired generals for top positions. Any concern about having too --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> -- many military men at the top of your administration?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, President Obama named three generals also. And, you know, these are tremendous people. Sort of in certain cases, they transitioned into civilian life.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I like generals. I think generals are terrific. You know, they go through schools and sort of end up at the top of the pyramid. And it's like a test.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They passed the test of life. That's how they got to be a general and other people didn't. So I sort of like generals. I like the three that I have very, very much.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Have you settled on a secretary of state?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm getting very close. Getting very, very close.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Do you know who it's going to be?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just have -- I have someone in mind that I think will be really fabulous. I think we're going to have one of the great cabinets ever put together. We're getting that kind of review.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Let me ask you about Rex Tillerson, head of ExxonMobil. Why does a business executive make sense as the chief diplomat?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, in his case, he's much more than a business executive. I mean, he's a world class player. He's in charge of, I guess, the largest company in the world. He's in charge of an oil company that's pretty much double the size of his next nearest competitor. It's been a company that's been unbelievably managed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And to me, a great advantage is he knows many of the players. And he knows them well. He does massive deals in Russia. He does massive deals for the company, not for himself, but the company.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> He's the secretary of state --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no, but I have -- I have tremendous respect for him. He's a world class player.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> I'm trying to get you to say --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have others -- I know you are and you're doing very well. But I have others also that I think -- I mean, Bob Corker is a fantastic guy. Mitt Romney, I've really gotten to know him, and I get along with him really well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But these are -- you know, these are all very different types of people. But when you ask me about Rex, I mean, he's a world-class player. There's no question about it.
<Notes> <Neutral> [END VIDEOTAPE]
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> Just after our interview, there were media reports that Mr. Trump has decided to name Tillerson to be secretary of state. He denied he's made a final decision. And during our ride on Trump Force One, he was still asking his advisers who they think he should nominate, but don't bet against Rex Tillerson.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> Coming up, we ask Mr. Trump about his controversial call with the president of Taiwan. Was he sending China a message? And what will become of his business once he's sworn in? As "Fox News Sunday's The Trump Way" continues.
<Notes> <Neutral> [COMMERCIAL BREAK]
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Coming up, Donald Trump tries to draw a line between the presidency and all his businesses.
<Notes> <Neutral> [BEGIN VIDEO CLIP]
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> You're keeping your stake in "Celebrity Apprentice."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm so focused on doing a great job as president.
<Notes> <Neutral> [END VIDEO CLIP]
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> We'll ask our Sunday panel about possible conflicts of interest Mr. Trump may encounter, next on "Fox News Sunday."
<Notes> <Neutral> [COMMERCIAL BREAK]
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> And we're back now with this special edition of "Fox News Sunday," "The Trump Way".
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Donald Trump rattled the relationship between China and the U.S. when he spoke with the leader of Taiwan, breaking with decades of U.S. diplomacy. Now, he's doubling down on that decision.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Back to our exclusive interview with the president-elect.
<Notes> <Neutral> [BEGIN VIDEOTAPE]
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> You recently took a call from the president of Taiwan, and on the Sunday shows, including ours, some of your top aides said, oh, it was just a congratulatory call. But the next day, some of your top aides said, no, in fact, you had been thinking about this for weeks in advance to send a message.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> So, which is it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, it's all wrong. No, no. It's all wrong. Not weeks.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I took a call. I heard the call was coming probably an hour or two before. I fully understand the One-China policy. But I don't know why we have to be bound by a One-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, look, we're being hurt very badly by China with devaluation, with taxing us heavy at the borders when we don't tax them, with building a massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea, which they shouldn't be doing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, frankly, they're not helping us at all with North Korea. You have North Korea, you have nuclear weapons, and China could solve that problem. And they're not helping us at all.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I don't want China dictating to me. And this was a call put into me. I didn't make the call. And it was a call, very short call, saying, "Congratulations, sir, on the victory." It was a very nice call. Short.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And why should some other nation be able to say, I can't take a call? I think it would have been very disrespectful, to be honest with you, not taking it.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> You recently intervened with Carrier to save about a thousand jobs from moving to Mexico.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> You've said at one of your rallies you're asking for a list of ten companies that are thinking about sourcing so you can call them as well. Should the president of the United States be calling companies? I mean, how would you have felt if Barack Obama gets on the phone and says, "Hey, Donald, here's how I want you to do business"?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would have been honored. So, let me just tell you --
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Honored?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- I don't have to do it myself. I have great people. We have top, top smart people. But it's so easy to do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we're going to have to impose a major tax on companies that leave, bill their product, and think they're going to sell it right to our border, like we're a bunch of --
<Notes> <Neutral> [CROSSTALK]
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> What happen to the free market, sir?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That is -- that's not free market when they go out and move and sell back into our country.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> But that's the free market. They've made a decision that makes --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, that's the dumb market, OK? That's the dumb market.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm a big free trader. But it has to be fair. So, what's happened is we have lost, over a period of years, short years, 70,000 factories in this country. Chris, 70,000.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I always say to people, I think it's a typo. How could it be so many? Seventy thousand factories. We're being stripped of our workers. We're being -- I mean, we're being stripped of our jobs, our good jobs are really good down, and we've got to stop it. And the only way you're going to stop it, the nice way is, we're reducing taxes very substantially for companies so they're not going to have to leave because of taxes. We'll be reducing regulations. Now those are the nice ways of doing it and everyone loves it and everyone's happy. Businesses, way down. Also middle class, but way down, OK, taxes and regulations.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But when a company wants to move to Mexico or another company -- or another country and they want to build a nice, beautiful factory and they want to sell their product through our border, no tax, and the people that all got fired, so we end up with unemployment and debt, and they end up with jobs and factories and all of the other things, not going to happen that way. And the way you stop it is by imposing a tax.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, I've come up with a number of 35 percent. There is no tax if you don't leave. There is no tax at all. You know, people are saying, they don't understand, really, what I'm doing. I read The Wall Street Journal the other day. Honestly, their editorial board doesn't get it. I don't think they understand business. I don't think The Wall Street Journal editorial board -- and I know some of them. They're really nice. I don't think they understand business. They don't understand what I'm saying.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's a 35 percent tax, but there is no tax if you don't move. But if you move your plant or factory and you want to sell back into our country, you fire all your people, there are going to be consequences for that. There are going to be consequences. You know what's going to happen?
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> What?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'll tell you.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nobody's going to move. They're not going to move. They're not going to leave. They're going to stay here.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> You're keeping your stake in "Celebrity Apprentice." According to The New York Times, you're going to shift operations, but you're going to keep your stake in your real estate business.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, essentially I'm not going to have anything to do with the management of the company.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> I know, but isn't that a huge conflict of interest, sir?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When I ran, everybody knew that I -- I was a very big owner of real estate all over the world. I mean, I'm not going to have anything to do with the management of the company. You know, when you sell real estate, that's not like going out and selling a stock. That takes a long time. It takes -- I have -- I'm going to have nothing to do with it. And I'll -- I'll be honest with you, I don't care about it anymore. I'm so focused on doing a great job as president, I don't care if our rent (ph) (INAUDIBLE) goes up a little bit or down. I couldn't care less.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But you hammered --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My -- my executives will run it with my children. It's a big company. It's a great company. But I'm going to have nothing to do with management. I --
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> But you hammered Hillary Clinton over the Clinton Foundation and pay --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's different because --
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> And what -- and --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's taken in massive amounts of money from foreign countries and other things.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> And pay to play.
<Notes> <Neutral> [BEGIN VIDEO CLIP]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins. It is now abundantly clear that's the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office.
<Notes> <Neutral> [END VIDEO CLIP]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This is different.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Well, wait a minute, you're going to be making a massive amount of money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. If -- if like somebody rents a hotel -- a hotel room.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Wait, wait, country -- wait, wait, foreign -- foreign countries are already booking events at the Trump Hotel in D.C. You've got business operations, deals with foreign countries. I mean isn't this on --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Chris, this is all stuff that's done --
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Isn't this on steroids that --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Foreign interests trying to curry favor with the president of the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If I were going to do new deals right now, I am turning down billions of dollars of deals. I will tell you, running for president, the money I spent is peanuts compared to the money I won't make. And that's OK because this is so important. What I'm doing is so important.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is a calling. This is so -- this is a movement. It's not just me, it's millions and millions of people. You got to see it firsthand. I'm not going to be doing deals at all. No, that would be -- I don't even know if that's a conflict. I mean I -- I have the right to do it. You know under the law I have the right to do it. I just don't want to do it. I don't want to do deals because I want to focus on this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But by my not doing deals, I turned down seven deals with one big player, great player, last week because I thought it could be perceived as a conflict of interest.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But your -- are you going to be able to do it (ph).
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was -- it was probably a billion dollars of deals that I turned down because it was --
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But if your kids do it, isn't it going to be the same thing?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's totally different. They're not -- they're not -- they're not president. I mean, they're not president. But they're not going to do it either. Oh, I see what you're getting at. No, they're not making deals either for my company.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're not making deals. And they're going to run my company. I have a lot of property and great stuff. They're going to run it. They're going to run it. Hopefully they're going to run it properly. I'm sure they're going to run it properly. But I'm not going to do deals. And I think, you know, I think that's going to be good.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> How many times have you spoken to Barack Obama since you were in the Oval Office with him? What do you guys talk about? And has he persuaded you on any of his policies?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we disagree on things, but we haven't really discussed things that we disagree on. I've spoken to him another time. I'm going to be speaking to him today actually. He has treated me really well. He's made us feel very welcome.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But on the Iran nuclear deal, relations with Cuba?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't want to tell you what we discuss, but -- and some of it I've agreed with him a lot. You know, people don't read about the stuff that you agree on. But there are things that we disagree on. And probably never going to be able to change that. But we do get along well. I'm -- I'm surprised at how well we get along. And I think he might say the same thing. And I think you're seeing that from him.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Mr. President-elect --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Thank you for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you very much.
