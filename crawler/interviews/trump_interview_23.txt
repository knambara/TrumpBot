<Piers Morgan> <Negative> With all that's going on tonight in Washington, I sat down with Donald Trump at Trump Tower a little while ago. Now, surprisingly he was pretty blunt about the dysfunction that shuts down the government. He's In the Chair tonight. Donald Trump , if you were the CEO of Washington Incorporated right now, how many times would you been saying, You're fired in the last few weeks?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, probably a lot but they really have to learn to get along. I mean you just have a President that is not leading and not getting people into a room and not shouting, and cajoling, and laughing, and having a good time, and having a terrible time. But, you know, all of these different emotions are things you have to do but you have to get people in a room and you have to just make deals for the good of the country.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> He's finally done that today with Republicans. So a group of them had gone down there led by John Boehner. Many people are criticizing both Speaker Boehner and the President for not doing enough talking in the previous few weeks. In the Clinton-Gingrich Era, they talked all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I will say this. If the Republicans stuck together, they have cards like you wouldn't believe. You know, I hear so much about the Republicans don't have the cards. The fact is, they have tremendous cards if they stuck together. But, Piers, they're not sticking together. You have all of these different guys making different statements and they want to come back and we should be back. The fact is they have a lot of strength if they want but they're not sticking together.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> The government shutdown is painful but a debt ceiling crisis would be potentially catastrophic. Warren Buffet has called it the nuclear bomb option. And it should never be used as a political tool. As a top businessman, what do you think of that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, nobody knows. Its unchartered territory, you know, the debt ceiling, look, we're up to $17 trillion in debt. Nobody's ever ...
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Can you even believe that figure?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No. It was a word ...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Missed targets started out. It was perfectly normal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it was a word that didn't exist in our language 10 years ago. The space of trillion, the word trillion. Now, you hear, you don't hear billion anymore, all you hear is trillion. The fact is that it was a -- it's a number that's staggering, $17 trillion and going up rapidly. It's not stopping there. They're looking at $24 trillion. Now, at what point does it stop? The debt ceiling nobody knows what's going to happen. Now, you could have a situation where you don't raise the debt ceiling and people actually have to go and really cut and get the country back into shape. There are those that say that could happen also.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Would feel comfortable about the debt ceiling limit not being extended? Well, somebody who has so many fingers in so many businesses buyers in America.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The word comfortable is a hard word. Certainly, I wouldn't feel comfortable with it, because again your -- unchartered territory. But I will say this something has to be done to get debt down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We can't continue to go this way. We're looking at numbers that is just staggering and they're going up at a staggering rate. So, something is going to have to be done.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have to make deals. They have to sit down and say we'll going to have to do something. You look at what's happening with other countries.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How they're -- Look I've been doing this with you for a long time and it never changes. Nobody changes. Nobody does anything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When you look at China, when you look at some of the other countries the way they take advantage of this country, China gets their oil and they come through the straits. Now, they come through straits we protect the straits. China gets most of the oil and Europe by the way, we get 10 percent of the oil and yet we spend all of the money on them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why are people reimbursing us for this? Why are people helping us? Why are people doing things? We cannot continue to spend the way we're spending and really to a large extent it's to the benefit of others and in particular -- I mean China is the worst abuser. There's no question about it. But virtually every country that does business with us as a country takes advantage of the United States.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> From a business point of view, China is being extremely smart with America has pulled up more and more American debt.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very smart.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Nearly a third of American debt is own by the Chinese. If there was to be a default on the debt ceiling the first people that will get paid will be the Chinese with their bonds because otherwise the whole pack of cards comes down. I mean their power, if there is a default on the American debt, increases pretty rapidly.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I guess you can say that, but look, China has already been lecturing us don't let this happen. Can you believe this we put ourselves in a position ...
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Can you laugh at them saying that ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I can laugh ...
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> ... in a right way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think you could cry. I'm not sure about the word laugh. I mean it's sad how we put ourselves ...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> The laugh of the [Inaudible] because actually they have a position of strength don't they?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have played us. Nobody has ever played us like that, other than OPEC. I would say OPEC maybe even just played us better but I use them as the two chiefs abusers, China and OPEC.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody has played us like to. But China when you think of it what they've done is in the history of the world there is never been any country that has manipulated their currency to their benefit like China has. They manipulate their currency.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They take our jobs through this manipulation. What they do once our companies go there is incredible because they put rules and regulations on those countries. I mean when Caterpillar manufactures, they don't want it made in the United States. They wear a made in China. They also want all of the information, all of that incredible technology, they want all. And they ask the things that we can't even -- we don't even think of asking. And by the way they tax our products when we send them.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> How did you feel when you heard the death payments to the widows and families of dead servicemen and women in the American military were not going to be paid?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I thought it was one of the most outrageous things I've ever heard and I've been doing this for a quite a while. I've seen a lot of crazy things, stupid things, horrible things, and I guess you put this on the category of all of the above. I actually tweeted that if the government doesn't pay it, I will. And I assume in some form they're going to get paid, because I haven't heard back, but a lot of people respected what is -- I think it's horrible. Here you've lost a son or a daughter that you love and cherish and then on top of it, the government says, Well So, when you say how do you feel about. I thought it was outrageous.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Let's take a short break. When we come back I want to talk about The Arts of the Deal you've written a book called The Art of the Deal. You know Speaker Boehner well. You know the President obviously
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. I think one of the biggest problem is that they don't like each other. When you don't like each other it's very hard to make a deal.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Donald Trump when you look at John Boehner and Barack Obama as businessmen, putting aside your clear leaning towards the Republican, but just a straight forward businessman. It seems to be a real problem that the way both of them conduct business. John Boehner hasn't got control of his party. The President won't negotiate in the way that people think he should do, regardless of how this current shutdown all washes up. What advice can you give about the arts of doing a deal, of doing business?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think one of the biggest problem is that they don't like each other. When you don't like each other, it's very hard to make a deal. And you understand that its common sense, but they don't like each other. There's tremendous animosity. And I see it. I mean when I watch them I know John Boehner and I like him he's actually a good man, he's working very, very hard and he's got probably the second most difficult job. I think he has got some tough job. But ...
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> What would you do about the Tea Party? Ted Cruz and those guys, 40 people in his party effectively holding the entire country to ransom.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you see I'm a believer in the Tea Party, because what they want is what's really right for this country. They want something to be done about this horrendous debt, something to be done about a lot of different things going on in the country. I mean our country is in a free fall and these are good American people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> These are great American people. So, you know, sometimes severe, sometimes not so severe, but what they do want, what's good for the country. Now, the Speaker has to be able and the President could get along together.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When they play golf everybody calling me, Oh Now, in all fairness to the President he's never been a dealmaker. Never made deals before he became a senator or president ...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Is that a problem, do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it is, because I don't think he's a natural dealmaker. You know, it's like sports. You have natural hitters in baseball and natural shot makers in basketball, a natural plotters in golf. He's not a natural dealmaker. It doesn't come naturally to him. So, he's got to use other people. He's got to do something, because right now, you know, again when he said, I'm not negotiating that's fine
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In other words say it. You can say it to the world, but then you got to negotiate.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> But Bill ...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> When he says that he doesn't negotiate.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Bill Clinton told me an interesting thing which was when he was dealing with Vladimir Putin or with Newt Gingrich and when he met to any opponent. The technique he use was he'd kick everybody out of the room eventually and just go man to man ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's great.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> ... look them in the eyes and plenty of boom, boom, boom, they get stuff done. And he -- I said, did you trust Putin for example. He said, Well he never went back on his words to me about anything. He's already fast that he said and he said that in the end You go along with that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I do look. President Clinton did have a lot of good relationships and that was why he was able to make deals and he really did make a lot of deals and a lot of deals for the good of the country. The fact is right now, we have these stale mates. I've never seen anything like it. This constantly a stalemate. So, what's going to happen in two weeks is going to be more interesting. Now, maybe as we're speaking, they're going to make a deal where they do some kind of an extension, but an extension is not what you need. You need the overall deal. We have to make a big deal and it has to be the proper deal for the country.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Looking America Incorporated as a business, clearly some massive problems. What is the way forward because America built really through it last century on this great manufacturing ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> ... tour de force, which rampage around the world as a great superpower clearly is no longer that kind of country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> What do you do about it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, and again, it's jobs. You have to take jobs away from other countries, China, India, all of these countries, they're taking our jobs. By the way, Mexico we've made it so good for Mexico what they're doing to us is unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You've got to take that jobs, you got to make the economy strong. And you know what, when you make the economy strong Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security. All of the things that are in trouble, they won't be in trouble anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have this incredible machine but we're not using it. But if you can create a great economy, we don't have to worry about Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid, all things that are good things, we don't have to worry about them again.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Do you worry that America may not have a great economy again in your lifetime.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, if we don't have the right leadership, we will never have a great economy again and we frankly will not be a great country again. We need the right leadership. Right now, our leader, I think he is well-meaning, you know, he wrote sorts of things at all, he really doesn't want. It's ridiculous. He wants to do a good job. I really believe he wants to do a good job but his mind set is not on what we need. We need a great and strong economy and that will take him all the money pouring in is a positive thing, not of negative things. It's a positive. And that will take care of so many problems that we have.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Do you believe in the green shoots fear at the moment. The properties beginning to bounce back and car sales are good and so on.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's very, very fragile. One of things that we have is we have an artificially low interest rates. Now we've developed -- I love low interest rates. I love it. I'm doing the old post office on Pennsylvania. Everything, I'm doing do well. I'm getting this money for like nothing but that's artificial. It's not going to be that way. Don't forget. The biggest thing is when the government borrows money and pays interest, it's paying so low right now. When they have to pay a normal rate of interest, you want to see deficits? That's going to be the biggest deficit of all. So, we have to get the economy going before the interest rates start going up.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> How do you feel? When I heard the Statue of Liberty was being closed down ...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> ... because of the shutdown. I don't think many Americans realized how that looked to the outside world. This absolute symbol of America and liberty and freedom, closed for business. How do you feel as an American?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes ...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> It's been 17 shutdowns since the early '70s, nothing new and some of being Democrat, some being Republican. In fact more Democrat. As an American, do you not feel embarrassed when this kind of thing happens?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, when the Statue of Liberty, Piers, was closed and they announced and everything, I thought it was very bad. When the soldiers weren't able to get the money, the families of the soldiers to be buried that to me -- hit me much harder. The Statue of Liberty, it will open, but the case when where you loss your son or daughter and you can't get money from the United States, you can't get burial, they call it burial money. That to me hit me much harder. I thought that was just horrendous. I thought that was the worst. That was one of the worst things I've ever heard about this country.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> And we'll be right back. Finally, Miley Cyrus. [Commercial] Back now, Donald Trump on the 68th floor of Trump Tower, one of the most imposing buildings in New York as [Inaudible] my opposing guest this evening. Donald, I like just to give an immediate reaction to all the following names with your apprentice, [Inaudible], if they were in the board room, what you would say?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> John Boehner.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's really working hard, tough situation but I think he is doing a good job. He's trying to keep it all together. He needs more support.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Hired or fired?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OH, I'd hire, absolutely.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Barack Obama.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Again, I happen to think he's trying very hard. I don't think he's a natural at putting together coalitions and deals in this case deals but I do believe he is trying very hard. I think he does want what's good for the country.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Hired or fired.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He probably -- I would say -- let's not use hired or fired. I hope he turns out to be a great president. I've been saying this for a long time, but I do believe he's trying very hard.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Harry Reid.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know him. I again, think they're all working very -- you know, they have different views, they have different points of view. Different from mine in these two cases, but Harry Reid is a pretty tough guy. He's a pretty strong guy and he's a very, very worthy opponent.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Would you hire him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd hire him. I don't know if I'd hire him for the country but I'd like to have him on my side.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> ObamaCare?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ObamaCare is a disaster. ObamaCare, I would fire. ObamaCare is a very, very big detriment to the country. Companies are closing because of it. They will be closing and many have.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Ted Cruz.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd hire him. I mean, he's a smart guy and I really think that based on everything I've seen, you know, he is bringing the certain awareness to a situation. I would certainly hire him. I mean, all of his fit, the President. These are all smart people and they do mean well but they have very different points of view.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Finally, Miley Cyrus.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she stays at my hotel. So, she always has good -- I mean, always, she stays at my hotel. If she's at my hotel right now, she calls at the other day [Inaudible]
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Has she taught you how to twerk?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know if I can't do it like her. Probably, [Inaudible]. What you're talking about and you're asking her with between the President and Boehner and you're asking about Miley. So, she's doing something right. I think she's getting great attention. I happen to like her.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Donald Trump , it's always good to talk to you. Thanks very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Thank you, Piers.
