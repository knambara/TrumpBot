<Griff Jenkins> <Positive> President aside from the wall, and I just came from McAllen Texas Rio Grande Valley.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Griff Jenkins> <Negative> They're getting hit so hard from coast to coast all the Border Patrol chiefs tell me in addition to the wall they need Congress to roll their sleeves up and change this laws.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh Griff, we can change these laws in 15 minutes I could change them. Catch and release. You know that is. Democrats you catch the person you take their name and you release them. And we're not doing that anymore. And it's just a horrible thing. Chain migration where you come in and you have hundreds. You have a lot of people come in with you your mother your father your uncle your aunt your grandmother your grandfather your brothers and sisters and I mean we had a case where somebody that as you know radical Islam he ran somebody ran many people down on the West Side Highway in New York.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what well. And killed eight people wounded horribly injured 12 people. I mean missing arms and legs and he has many people under chain migration many of his relatives have come in with him. It's crazy. And then of course you have the lottery visa lottery where they pick them and they pick people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And these countries aren't giving us their finest OK. They're not giving us their finest. I'm not going to say they give us their worst but you know why wouldn't they. So we have to get rid of these things and we can have it so easy what has happened though and you've seen it is Mexico. Now for the first time is apprehending people and bringing them back with this.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Otherwise we're going to close up the border.
<Griff Jenkins> <Negative> Are any Democrats willing to work with you to change the law?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to find out. I think they're getting hurt badly politically. And then once they get hurt badly politically they'll start working with us in the meantime. Mexico is doing a job that we could be doing. But Mexico is now apprehending people at their southern border and they're bringing them back to Honduras Guatemala or wherever they come from El Salvador.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're also stopping the Mexicans from coming in. And we've had a great four days and it only started when I said we're going to close the border and I will close the border or I'll put the tariffs on the cars that they make and they send into our country essentially tax free and I'll put tariffs on there and then I'll close the border after that if that doesn't.
<Griff Jenkins> <Positive> So let's address that. How would you put a tariff when your own agreement precludes that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We haven't we haven't finished our agreement yet. So I'll put that in there I'm going to put it in there because if they look people are pouring through Mexico they come from other countries. I've already stopped the money we pay them over 500 million dollars. Honduras Guatemala El Salvador and others. We stopped the money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Some people would say oh you should give them more money the Democrats say give more money. They're forming caravans to get people out.
<Griff Jenkins> <Neutral> I've been in there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know what they're not putting the best people in those caravans. OK but they're forming caravans they're putting people in they're sending them up. You know it better than anybody. You know what's going on.
<Griff Jenkins> <Neutral> So Mr. President is it time to call for a summit between yourself the president Mexico the presidents of Honduras Guatemala El Salvador.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No I don't need a summit. I think we've done very well without a summit. They understand we stopped we're saving 550 million dollars. And I respectfully told and I thank him very much because for the last four days it's been great. You see that whole stream is drying up. They could stop him at their southern border their southern border.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you look at what's happening now. They pulled in fifteen hundred one thousand five hundred yesterday they brought them back. They pulled in over a thousand the day before over a thousand the day before that today I haven't gotten the number but I understand it's a lot.
<Griff Jenkins> <Positive> Well, where I was in RGV 14 straight days of a thousand plus 4500 yesterday. This is what I want to address to you. They're releasing now particularly the family units to the public in the fabric of the U.S. tens of thousands are being released and will continue. Are we witnessing the second generation of DACA forming.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, we're witnessing people that are going to be brought out of the country the country is full. We have our system is full. We can't do it anymore. We go by this horrible Flores situation you know that decision is a horror show we have to release after 20 days and we built big detention areas but they fill up immediately.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's never been so many people coming up and that's because they're gaming the system and the system is changed for the worse because of what happened with Democrats and what they've done in terms of Congress. So if we change the laws it would be very easy. But in the meantime Mexico if they stop the people from coming in. We won't to have a lot of people coming at the border.
<Griff Jenkins> <Neutral> News today your nominee for ICE Director Ronald Vitiello 30 years in the job. Why did you withdraw his nomination?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because we may go a different way. We may have to go very tough way and we're going to see and we'll see Ron's a good guy. I know him well done a good job but we may just go a different way a little bit tougher.
<Griff Jenkins> <Negative> Tough question for you since you've done so much on immigration and made it a central issue. We may end up by your administration's own projections upwards of a million undocumented immigrants added to the existing population. What does that say about your administration handling?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I think what's happened is I've proven to be right. If we were able to build the wall now I've gotten the the wall. And you take a look at this I hope you're covering it because we have miles and miles of it being built right now hundreds of miles are under construction. And more importantly they're under contract.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think 157 miles right now is under contract. They're getting ready to start the Rio Grande we're doing a lot of work there. That's where a lot of people come in and I've shown the people that I was right. I mean this is what's been happening for a long time it's been happening for a long time. They didn't even put down the numbers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They didn't used to put down the real numbers. I mean you look at what's happened you know in the old days they didn't mark down. They didn't say how many people were coming in. What we're doing is the gang members don't get in. And if they do get in ICE is getting them out the bad ones. We have a lot of bad ones you know that want to get in. And when you look at the caravans they're composed of people that I'm sorry but they're not supposed to be coming into our country and we're stopping it. But what we will be doing is now our system is full.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I told our people today our system is full we can't take anymore. The asylum is being scammed. The whole asylum system and you have gang members tough people saying they're afraid to be in their country they're not afraid. And then they'll come up with flags holding flags from their country. [End of first part.]
<Griff Jenkins> <Negative> Vice President Biden seems to be escalating words with you first on Twitter now. He said that you're a tragedy in two acts. Your reaction.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well we have the greatest economy in the history of our country. We have the best job numbers we've ever had. More people are working today in the United States than ever before. They're paying less tax then just about ever before we had the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. The regulations are cut lower than they've ever been.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean we have more we've done more regulation cutting than any administration whether it's four years or eight years. This country is doing well, we're rocking. The military has taken care of the vets are in the best shape they've ever been and we have choice now for the vets which they've been trying to get as you know for 45 years unsuccessfully.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know to him I just a part of the reason I'm here is because of him and President Obama. If they did a good job I probably wouldn't be president. What else you have to say.
<Griff Jenkins> <Positive> All right Mr. President thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. You do a great job there.
<Griff Jenkins> <Positive> I appreciate being on the border. I have to ask you I know you get asked every day. One final question that is are we any closer to seeing the Muller report so much made of it. There's no critics of your attorney general.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know there's no no collusion. OK. The famous word collusion. There's no obstruction because they put a decision and the attorney general made the decision he said no obstruction. So there's no collusion there's no obstruction. There's no nothing. It's all a big hoax and the Democrats want to keep playing it because they've done a lousy job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They haven't governed well again that's why I'm here. The way they governed is the reason that I'm president and we are doing a great job. So it's really up to the attorney general whatever he wants to do. But everybody waited for the Mueller report. Then it turns out that there's no obstruction no collusion no anything.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And now the rest is up to the attorney general. Schiff and Nadler they keep playing their game. They can't get off it and they were very disappointed but it was a very easy decision. And these were not people that like Donald Trump I called them the 13 angry Democrats these were people that were angry. They should've never been allowed to write about me. These were 13 angry people with hatred toward me. And then they added more 17 or 18 and they all were angry at Donald Trump and they still came up with no collusion.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very few people could that happen to where they go through almost two years of nonsense haters total haters and they come up with no collusion. Thank you very much.
<Griff Jenkins> <Positive> Thank you, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you Griff.
<Jeff Glor> <Neutral> [Segment Aired on Face the Nation, July 15, 2018] I saw the conversation you had with Jens Stoltenberg, which was a very direct conversation. As you approach the meetings with Vladimir Putin coming up, do you expect a similar tone?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't expect anything. I, frankly, don't expect -- I go in with very low expectations. I think that getting along with Russia is a good thing, but it's possible we won't. I think we're greatly hampered by this whole witch-hunt that's going on in the United States, the Russian witch-hunt, the rigged situation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I watched some of the testimony, even though I'm in Europe, of Strzok, and I thought it was a disgrace to our country. I thought it was an absolute disgrace, where he wants to do things against me before I was even -- I guess before I was even the candidate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was a disgrace. And then he lied about it and, you know, talking about shutting it down, and we, we. And he says, oh, I meant the American people all of a sudden. He came up with excuses, I guess, give to a lawyer. But everybody laughed at it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was a disgrace to our county. He was a disgrace to the FBI. So, when I look at things like that -- and he led that investigation or whatever you call it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say that, yes, I think it hurts our relationship with Russia. I actually think it hurts our relationship with a lot of countries. I think it's a disgrace, what's going on.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then you look how partisan it is, you look at what's going on where -- and they know. They know that. There's no way he can get away from those horrible texts that he wrote. So, the other side knows, but it's a very partisan thing.
<Jeff Glor> <Negative> The Russians who were indicted, would you ask Putin to send them here?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I might. I hadn't thought of that, but, certainly, I will be asking about it. But, again, this was during the Obama administration. They were doing whatever it was during the Obama administration.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I heard that they were trying or people were trying to hack into the RNC, too, the Republican National Committee, but we had much better defenses. I have been told that by a number of people. We had much better defenses, so they couldn't.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think the DNC should be ashamed of themselves for allowing themselves to be hacked. They had bad defenses. And they were able to be hacked. But I heard they were trying to hack the Republicans, too, but -- and this may be wrong -- but they had much stronger defenses.
<Jeff Glor> <Negative> Who is your biggest competitor, your biggest foe globally right now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think we have a lot of foes. I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade. Now, you wouldn't think of the European Union, but they're a foe. Russia is a foe in certain respects. China is a foe economically, certainly. They're a foe. But that doesn't mean they're bad. It doesn't mean anything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It means that they're competitors. They want to do well, and we want to do well. And we're starting to do well. You see what's going on. We have the best employment numbers probably that we have ever had. Black unemployment is the lowest level in history, Hispanic unemployment the lowest level in history, Jeff, women unemployment lowest in 66 years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Our numbers are great. Our GDP numbers are far greater than what they thought.
<Jeff Glor> <Negative> A lot of people might be surprised to hear you list the E.U. as a foe before China and Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I look at them all.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, E.U. is very difficult, I want to tell you. Maybe the thing that's most difficult -- don't forget, both of my parents were born in E.U. sectors, OK? I mean, my mother was Scotland. My father was Germany. And, you know, I love those countries. I respect the leaders of those countries.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, in a trade sense, they have really taken advantage of us, and many of those countries are in NATO. And they weren't paying their bills. And, you know I, as an example, have a big problem with Germany, because Germany made a pipeline deal with Russia, where they're going to be paying Russia billions and billions of dollars a year for energy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I say that's not good. That's not fair. You're supposed to be fighting for someone, and then that someone gives billions of dollars to the one that you're guarding against? I think it's ridiculous. So, I let that be also known this time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'll tell you what. There is a lot of anger at the fact that Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars. There's a lot of anger. I also think it's a very bad thing for Germany, because it's like, what are they, waving a white flag?
<Jeff Glor> <Negative> [Segment Aired CBS This Morning, July 16, 2018] President Bush said that he saw into his soul. I think he came to regret that you said that Putin toyed with Obama. How do you ensure that things are different in this administration?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. Look, I've met him two times, two and a half times. Most of you people were there when I met him. I think that I may have a very good relationship and I think I may have a very bad relationship with him. I have no idea.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love the United States. He obviously loves Russia. He's for Russia, I'm for the U.S. We'll have to see what comes of it. But I think we have a chance of a very good relationship. I mean the couple of times I've met him we get along very well. I mean, they were very short meetings, but we got along very well. And if I got along with him that's a good thing. You know we're a magnificent, powerful country. They're a very powerful country we're a nuclear country they are a nuclear country. And getting along is a good thing not a bad thing.
<Jeff Glor> <Negative> The Russians who were indicted would you ask Putin to send them here?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I might. I hadn't thought of that but I certainly will be asking about it. But again this was during the Obama administration. They were doing whatever it was during the Obama administration. And I heard that they were trying, or people were trying to hack into the RNC, to the Republican National Committee too. But we had much better defenses. I've been told that by a number of people. We had much better defenses are they couldn't. I think the DNC should be ashamed of themselves for allowing themselves to be hacked.
<Jeff Glor> <Positive> We aske the president what the goal of this meeting was he told me he'd tell us after we also asked about the tone what he'd like this new Tony like to strike in this meeting. He brought up investigations again saying they hamper relations between the U.S. and Russia on a continuing basis. I also did ask the president at one point who he thought America's biggest global foe was at this point.
<Jeff Glor> <Neutral> [Segment aired on CBS Evening News, July 16, 2018] Is there a Trump doctrine for the world?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would say strength and I would say I'm looking for peace. We're looking for peace all over the world we're looking for peace. We're also looking not to be ripped off as a nation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Who's your biggest competitor, the biggest foe, globally, right now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I think we have a lot of foes. I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade. Now you wouldn't think of the European Union, but their a foe. Russia's foe in certain respects. China is a foe,  economically certainly are a foe but that doesn't mean they're bad. It doesn't mean anything. It means that they're competitors. They want to do well and we want to do well and we're starting to do well. You see what's going on with the best employment numbers probably that we've ever had. Black unemployment is the lowest level in history. Hispanic unemployment the lowest level in history Jeff. Women unemployment lowest in 66 years.
<Jeff Glor> <Negative> A lot of people might be surprised to hear you list the EU as a foe before China and Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I look at them all. The EU is very difficult. I want to tell you maybe, the thing that's most difficult to figure out -- both my parents were born in the EU sectors, okay? I mean my mother was Scotland. My father was Germany. And, you know, I love those countries. I respect the leaders of those countries. But in a trade sense, they've really taken advantage of us, and many of those countries are in NATO and they weren't paying their bills.
<Jeff Glor> <Positive> What do you see right now is America's role globally?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I think we're perceived as a much stronger nation now than we were two years ago. I think two years ago, we were apologizing for everything. We were not doing certain things that we should have been doing. You look at our trade deals, they were a disaster. We're doing them, and we're going to make them very successful, and we're going to make them fair for our country and other countries. But we were in so many different ways in such bad shape. North Korea you look at us now compared to what we were two years ago. Two years ago they were testing nuclear all over the place. They were shooting missiles. They were shooting rockets. They were shooting all sorts of things.
<Jeff Glor> <Positive> Has Kim Jong un moved quickly enough after the after the summit in your estimation?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it depends on what. He moved very quickly on hostages. They got the hostages before, you know, before I went. And paid nothing. But I think it was a very smart move on his behalf because it really was a sign of goodwill. I think that you know this has been going on for many many decades. But I'm in no real rush. I mean, whatever it takes it takes in the meantime. Things are happening behind the scenes that are very positive.
<Jeff Glor> <Negative> Just this weekend U.S. and North Korean officials met at the DMZ to discuss repatriating the remains of Americans killed in the Korean War, something Kim Jong-un agreed to do immediately after his June meeting with the President.
<Jeff Glor> <Positive> They promised the remains would come back but they haven't come back yet.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well they're in the process of doing it. It doesn't go quickly. It's a complicated process but they're in the process of doing it. In fact, we're sending a two star general over there very shortly to meet one of their two star generals to work on some kind of a process. You know remains are complicated. Some of the remains, they don't even know if they are remains. I know one thing they would like to be able to do it if they can.
<Jeff Glor> <Positive> When you have a chance to reflect on weekends like this and especially coming here since that is the first time as president what does that do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I had a great life and I must tell you as good as it was I like my current life better as crazy as it sounds. I mean I like it, because I'm doing something for the American people we're really helping this country. Look, you know, it's Make America Great Again. And that's been the theme and that's what the whole thing is and we are making ourselves respected again. We're much more respected as a country.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> That's all for us right now. Now AC 360 with Anderson Cooper. Tonight, what's the deal with Donald Trump ? He's moderating a GOP debate but three candidates have dropped out already.
<Mitt Romney> <Positive> We've already set our calendar in December and I communicated to Mr. Trump that that schedule is completed.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Does anyone still want the Trump seal of approval?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The debate is December 27th. I'm looking to endorse somebody after that debate.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Has the Donald overstayed his political welcome? Tonight, I'll ask Donald Trump himself. Plus, the extraordinary life and times of the queen of hip-hop and soul. Mary J. Blige.
<Mary J. Blige> <Negative> I was dying. It was over. I was going to die. It didn't -- it didn't matter. But I didn't want to die.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> This is Piers Morgan Tonight. Good evening. I've got to know Donald Trump pretty well over the last few years, and I can tell you he's a man who's used to being number one. Now he's getting flak from members of the Republican Party who are saying he's dumbing down the political dialogue in this country. Tonight I'll give him a chance to respond. His latest book, It's Time to Get Tough: Making America Number One Again. And I'm delighted to say Donald Trump joins me again now. Donald, you're getting it in the neck a bit from your own people, really, the Republican candidates, who seem to be cueing up to have a pop at you. Why is that and do you care?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't really care, but I don't think I'm getting it too much. I think most people are totally in favor. We've had a great response.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have millions and millions of people on my Web sites, and they all want me to do something. And they want me to have debates. And as you know, a very, very good group of people, Newsmax, which is a big group and a powerful group, asked me if I'd moderate the debate, and I will, if they want me to do that, and they certainly have strongly suggested it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it certainly has gotten press. There's no question about it. But I consider it a great honor. We have -- as you know, Newt has accepted and Rick Santorum has accepted. A couple, we're waiting to see. I think there's a lot of pressure on a lot of people, frankly. I think they're under tremendous strain and tremendous pressure. I was disappointed that Mitt Romney, who's been up to see me at Trump Tower and called me, and, you know, we've had numerous calls, wants very much to have my endorsement. I was actually very disappointed that he didn't do the debate. I was actually surprised. He's a good guy, but I was actually surprised that he didn't do the debate.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Yes, I was surprised about that. Because I don't really understand what the big problem is, other than a bit of snobbery because you're not a conventional moderator. You're not a journalist or a TV host. But what you are is one of America's most successful business people. And I don't actually see any problem in you hosting a debate like this. I would imagine you would have some rather good questions for them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I know a lot of the moderators and some are wonderful, and some aren't, but I know the issues better than the moderators, that I can tell you. Every issue better than the moderators. And I think it would be interesting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know I'm somebody that built a great -- I mean, my book really explains it. I built a great business. And I actually -- in my financial disclosure forms, I actually printed the summary sheets in the book.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And so people can see what a great company I've built. A tremendous net worth, tremendous cash and very little debt. And that's what the country needs, frankly, on a larger scale. So, you know, I think I know the whole deal, and it would be, and I assume it's going to in some -- in some form take place. I think it will be very successful and I think it will be very, very well viewed.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Did Mitt Romney call you himself to say he wasn't going to take part?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, he did.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> And what did he -- what did he say?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he couldn't have been nicer. I mean, he said, Donald, I am so busy, and that day, I had roped off for something else. And you know, could not have been nicer. But, still, I was surprised. Because I think it would have been -- as you know, I get very good ratings. You're a good example of it, OK? I mean you --
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Yes. Absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You did so well on the --
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Every time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> On the Celebrity Apprentice. And we got great ratings and I get great ratings. And frankly
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Let's move to a couple of the others who really did say some extraordinary things. Jon Huntsman said, We have declined to participate in the presidential apprentice debate with the Donald. I won't kiss his ring or any other part of his anatomy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it's just a figure of speech. And look, he's disappointed because he's having a hard time really getting numbers. And I think -- I'll be honest. I don't know him at all, but he actually looks like a nice guy and he seems like a nice guy. And as I was telling somebody before, he's been very good to the Wharton School of Finance, which is the school I went to, which I think is the best business school anywhere in the world. And the Wharton School is great and he supports it, so I like that. But I don't know him at all. He just seems like a nice guy and I think he's under a lot of pressure. But he does seem good.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> So you're not going to miss him kissing any part of your anatomy?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I won't miss that at all. Believe me. [Laughter]
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Ron Paul called the event beneath the Office of the Presidency, which is a criticism a few people have come up with that because you host the Celebrity Apprentice and so on
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you have to understand, the reason I host Celebrity Apprentice and The Apprentice and it's become one of the top shows on television The reason I host it and the reason I'm a so-called, as they say, reality star, is because of my success. And that has nothing to do with television. That has to do with real estate and business.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And that's why I was chosen to do it. Now maybe there are some other reasons also. You know, whatever they may be.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Whatever it takes. But -- so I host this show, and it's a great show, because of my success in business. So I like to think of myself as a businessman.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When you look at my numbers in the book that show over $7 billion in net worth, that hasn't been taken too long to build, relative to other families and companies, et cetera, and you look at the kind of cash I have. Almost $300 million in cash. And when you look at the low debt, which is really what the country should be striving for, is low debt, lots of cash, tremendous worth, instead of owing $15 trillion, which is where we are right now as a country.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So I think that, you know, when somebody says Trump is a reality star and he shouldn't be hosting a debate, I'm only a reality star because I built a great company.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> I couldn't agree more. I'm going to play a clip from Jon Stewart from The Daily Show last night. He was in euphoric mood when he heard that you were hosting a debate. Let's watch this. Holy [Expletive deleted]). This guy is moderating a debate. If the people in the debate he's moderating don't satisfy him So he's chortling away at you there, Donald. Do you care? Do you find him funny?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't -- I think he's OK. I mean, to be honest, I don't get the humor. You know he's got something going, I guess, because he's got a little bit of an audience, not a big audience, but I don't get his humor too much. You know I think he's fine. I watch him on occasion. But I wouldn't say he's one of the funny men that I've ever heard.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Let's turn to Newt Gingrich.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But he's OK.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Newt Gingrich has accepted the invitation to come to the debate. He is the frontrunner. He is, right now, potentially the guy who will win the nomination. So you've got the main man.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Talk about Newt Gingrich for a moment. What do you think of him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all, the debate is a Newsmax debate and that's a very powerful organization, and they really are, and they've done an amazing job. It's not a Trump debate, it's Newsmax, and they asked me if I'd do it. I am really impressed with Newt.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm impressed from where he came. I'm impressed with the way he's handling himself. Even as an example, the debate, I mean he was decisive, he was quick.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He said, you know, this is a great opportunity to get some strong views on whether -- it's China, he knows that China and the world are ripping us off. That's frankly a very big part of what I'm all about because I see this country, it's being eaten alive from the outside. And that is by OPEC and China and South Korea, and virtually any country you want to name, we're being just taken to the cleaners.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, it used to be the other way, Piers. It used to be that we were great, we were strong, we were powerful, and now, all of a sudden, it's a whole different thing. It's a whole big different thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it's not that way anymore. Now everybody takes our lunch. We used to do it the opposite way, when we were strong and when we were great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it's too bad, but that's the way it is.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Newt Gingrich said an interesting thing this week. He went after this whole issue of child labor, saying that lots of these kids in inner cities in particular aren't brought up to understand what an honest day's work is. That the only kind of work they experience when they're young tends to be of an illegal kind. And he got hammered for it. I thought he made a few good points. What is wrong, inherently, with young Americans in these troubled areas learning the value of a dollar? What did you think of his point that he made?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't think he said it the way you said it. I think he said something very different. He was talking about examples and people to look up to.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he was saying that, you know, many of these children don't have people to look up to. People that leave the house early in the morning and come back late because they've been working hard all day. And he took a little bit of heat from that from some people and a lot of people agree with him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I happen to agree with him. I mean, this is a society where you have to get out there and you have to work. I mean, one of the problems we have in this country is, as I told you before, other people taking advantage of us.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But everybody has to get out there and work. And he was talking about examples. He was using examples.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And people need examples. I had a great example. My father was a very, very hard worker.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He really worked. And I watched that and, you know, he enjoyed his life. He really liked his life. He was happy. But he was happiest working. And I would see that growing up. And it was like by osmosis, I would sort of say, hey, that's pretty cool, and I love working. So I don't think what he said was at all bad, and a lot of people agree with that, but some people disagree.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Yes, I mean, just to clarify, he did talk about the role model thing, but he also said that the child labor laws are truly stupid. That children in poor neighborhoods don't have the habit of working, nor getting paid for their endeavors unless it's illegal. So he did -- he made that other point, too, which, you know, has gotten him into hot water.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> But at least he's thinking, I guess, about the way to get people back to work. Let's have a break, Donald. When we come back, I want to talk to you about time to get tough.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> What you would do as one of America's top and most successful employers to get these unemployment figures right down. Back with my special guest, Donald Trump . Donald , Barack Obama this week came out with a big speech, basically saying that the middle classes have been let down in this country, that it's time to tax the rich more and to extend tax breaks, effectively, tax cuts, for the middle classes. What do you think of that as a principle?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he's really playing the class warfare very hard. I've been watching -- I watched the speech, actually, and I guess from his standpoint, it's the way he's going to go, because not a lot of good things are happening with our country, in terms of the economy and what's going on. And even if you look at the recent job numbers, where 315,000 people gave up, and therefore they don't include them as unemployed, which is ridiculous. But you know a lot of things aren't going really right for him. So he's going with class warfare. Probably a very smart for him in terms of getting elected, but a really bad thing for the country.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> You know, a lot of CEOs have come out saying they don't disagree with what he's saying in principle. That maybe there should be a slide in taxation rate with the rich paying more, and you said this yourself, and you said in the book, but they don't like the tone, they don't like the rhetoric because it does smack of class warfare. Is there a better way for him to say the same thing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think there are a lot of better ways. And as far as taxes are concerned, it's a very dangerous time to be raising taxes. Because frankly, the rich and -- you know, if you want to say the rich, but we already pay and corporations in this country are actually the heavily -- the most heavily taxed companies in the world, OK? We're literally number one or number two on every list.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And -- so a lot of taxes are being paid. The problem we have is spending. The money gets spent far faster than they can get it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know when you owe $15 trillion, when you're borrowing from other countries, all of a sudden this country is like in a different ball game from where it was. So it's a pretty tough situation, but it's a very fragile economy and it's a very, very dangerous time to be raising taxes. That I can tell you.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> There were two things that happened last week, which were significant. One is the stock market enjoyed its best week performance wise since Barack Obama became president in '09. And secondly, the employment figures fell to the lowest level since he became president. Both of those things, whoever way you get into the detail, are clearly good news for him, because if it had gone the other way, it would be bad news. What do you read into that? Is there any momentum now building even slowly in the American economy, or is this false hope, do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I hope there's momentum. I mean it's been a long time and I hope there's some momentum. The employment numbers are very dangerous to look at because of the amount of people that quit.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And under the new way of calculating, if you're looking for a job and you stop, they don't put you -- I mean it's ridiculous, but they don't consider you to be unemployed. So if you add those numbers back in, those numbers are much different than the numbers reported. Look, I hope the economy is getting better.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Certainly, I mean, between interest rates being very low and other things. The problem that we also have is banks. Banks don't loan money. If somebody wants to buy a house, it's virtually impossible to get the money from a bank. And it's -- even if they have good credit. Even when mortgages are coming due, and people that have been paying a mortgage for 10 and 15 and 20 years, they can't get money or they can't get an extension from a bank. So the banks are really not behaving properly, that can I tell you.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Whenever you come on my show, Donald, I'm always very grateful that you do, and you talk a lot of sense, I get more reaction to you than I do to almost any other guest. And some of it is negative, most of it, I'd say, is positive from real people. The media give you, I think, an irrationally kind of what I call a caricature image.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> But when I hear you talk like this, I hear somebody who has flirted with the idea of running for president many times, but who -- you know, by your own admission, you said if you looked at the situation around this time and there was a still kind of lack of a real potential winner here against Barack Obama, you would be tempted, seriously, to run. Aren't we in that situation? I mean, are you not genuinely tempted?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all, I never flirted many times. People have always wanted me to run, I never wanted to, I never flirted at all. And then four years ago or eight years ago, I looked at it just briefly for a period of a few days, and just decided it wasn't -- I really like what I'm doing, as you know, probably better than most.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, you know, I'm going to see what happens. Number one, let's look at the economy and let's see where the economy is going. I don't think the economy is going to get much better.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And possibly, it's going to get much worse. We're going to have to see. But more importantly, right now, you have to see who is going to be the Republican candidate. I'm going to endorse somebody, Piers, fairly soon. And depending on how that person does, or if they pick somebody else, doesn't have to be endorsed by me, that I think is good, I would not run. I'd be very happy not to run.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If, on the other hand, they pick somebody that's not going to win or that's not going to do a good job, which is possible, that could happen, then I might very well look at running. But I never really looked at it before. This is the first time I looked at it very seriously.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And as you know, I was leading in the polls when I got out. And the only reason I got out is you have equal time provisions, where I'm not allowed to have this very successful show and run for president. It's sort of unfair, because the president can go on Jay Leno and he can go on your show and he can go on any other show and there's no equal time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But if I have a show or anybody has a show, and especially a very high-profile, successful show, you're not allowed to run, essentially, because of the equal time provision. So when I got out, I was leading in the polls. And I'm very honored by that. In fact, I was watching Meet the Press the day before the up-fronts from NBC and it had Trump at the top of the polls But, you know, if the Republicans choose somebody great, I have no interest in impeding them. That I can tell you.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> And would it be fair to say that right now it would be pretty unthinkable that you would endorse anybody outside of Romney or Gingrich?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't want to say that. I just don't really want to get into that. Because over the next few weeks, I'm going to make an endorsement, and I don't want to give any clues. A lot of people are looking for who I'm going to be endorsing, and I just don't want to get into that quite yet. But they do have some excellent people. I'm not saying all of them, but they have some excellent people running or trying to run, and we'll see what happens. I've gotten to know most of them. I respect many of them. And I'll make an endorsement some time over the next three or four weeks.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Would you consider being a vice president to any of these candidates?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think so. I mean, again, I love what I'm doing. My company has never done better, even though times are bad, I've sort of made some pretty wise decisions.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I just love what I'm doing. I love the real estate business, I love all of the businesses I'm in. And I don't see it, but, you know, I would do anything that's good for this country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If somebody told me that whatever they wanted me to do, it was going to be great for the country or good for the country, I would do it. I think, frankly, they should have me or somebody like me negotiating with foreign countries or trade pacts because whoever is negotiating our trade pacts is doing a horrible job. When China makes $350 billion this year, when Colombia makes $400 billion, when all of these countries -- everybody makes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know we can't have a great country and we're not going to have a rich country, when you talk about Social Security, when you talk about Medicare and Medicaid, all of those problems go away -- I mean, you make adjustments and everything else, but they go away with a really strong country and a strong economy. So, you know, what they should have somebody like me doing is leading a negotiation of trade pacts because we are being hurt badly by incompetent people.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> If one of these Republican candidates came to you and they became president next November, for argument's sake, and they said, look, Donald, we would like you to now be the trade negotiator for America, with China, with OPEC, and so on, would you take that job?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I certainly would consider that, because we need that. That's so vital. I can't believe some of the deals -- I mean, you look at the deal that we made with South Korea recently.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at some of the other deals. I'm saying, do we have anybody even negotiating for us? It's inconceivable. And you know, I was very honored the other day, Michele Bachmann said, no, no, I'd want Donald Trump to be my vice president.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm sitting here watching this television show or debate or whatever was going on and she immediately announced Trump as vice president. I've had others say we'd like him to negotiate our pacts. The fact is, I do a great job -- I really would. It's a strength. I'm very good at it. I would do a great -- and I'd do it in a friendly manner. But I would do a great job at negotiating great deals for this country with respect to other countries who are now just eating our lunch.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Let's take a final break, Donald, and just come back very quickly and talk about Lady Gaga, because in your book, you seem to be claiming full credit for her glorious career. I want to find out why. Back now with my guest, Donald Trump . Donald , it's a fascinating book, as all your books, of course, are. That's why they sell so many. A great story in there about Lady Gaga that she, apparently, may owe her success to you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, that's not true. She owes it to her talent and her drive. But it was interesting, four or five years ago, I owned the Miss Universe Pageant, and we choose talent for sort of like our halftime.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it's been an amazing thing. We've found some amazing people. And sometimes they're big stars and everybody wants to do it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then sometimes it's a young, aspiring talent. And in this case, it was Vietnam -- I think it was probably close to five years ago and we put Lady Gaga on. Now we don't even pay them anything.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But it broadcast all over the world. And she went on and there was like a frenzy. Everybody wanted to know who was the entertainer on the show because as you know it's broadcast again all over the world and, you know, live in the United States, et cetera, et cetera.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they weren't saying who won the contest, who was -- they were saying who was the entertainer. It was Lady Gaga. And then she really -- I think it was a tremendous boost.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then what happened is, about a year ago, when she did a huge show at Radio City Music Hall, I was sitting in the audience with a tremendous number of major celebrities, and her manager came up to me after the show, Mr. Trump, Gaga wants to see you in the back. Nobody else, nobody else. It was a little embarrassing to me. But she was -- she was great. She hasn't forgotten then. I know and she's a terrific person. And a great talent. But we put her on the Miss Universe contest, and to be honest with you, she was amazing. And the next day everybody wanted to know who the hell was that.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Yes, she' s a phenomenal talent.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great entertainment.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> You got this debate coming up in -- the debate is coming in three weeks, Donald. Before we go, I just want to get a little inkling on what you're going to ask these guys who do turn up, Gingrich and the others. What do you think the key issues are?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think there are a lot of key issues. You can talk about health care. You can talk about Obamacare, what the views are and everything else.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But a lot of it you've heard but you can also talk about OPEC and you can talk about how OPEC is just ripping off this country and how everybody is ripping off the country and that's something I haven't seen in the debates. And honestly, I haven't heard it from President Obama. They don't talk about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're not talking about what's happening on the outside of our country, where they're just eating us alive and we can't allow it to continue to happen or we're not going to have a country. So I find that it's been very, very weakly touched on and it should be one of the most important things. When you talk about jobs and we're outsourcing to India, and outsourcing to everywhere, why can't we have those jobs in our communities? In Alabama and in Iowa, and Nebraska? Why do we -- why are we doing outsourcing to India? You call up for a credit card and you want to find information half the time somebody picks up the phone and their stationed in India.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What's going on? Why do we do that and why do we create incentives for that? So I'd get into that very much because ultimately employment is never going to be down if we're going to continue to do this.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> And you're going to give them a hard time, Donald, if they start taking you on and shirking the questions?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think I -- look, first of all I know them. And I respect them. And honestly I don't see giving them a hard time. We have a problem, Piers. We have a country that's in serious, serious trouble. And somebody and something has to be done about it.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Well, strong words, Donald. It's a good book, Time To Get Tough And I will, for one, be watching that debate with great interest. I think it will be great -- great sport, great entertainment, good politics. And there's nothing wrong with that. So good luck with it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Piers.
