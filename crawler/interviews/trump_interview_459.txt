<Don Imus> <Positive> Well, I'm told backed by Christie and all of them, we have a package from Natalie Morales in Today's Show.
<Don Imus> <Negative> That brings us up to date on where we are with the Trump, Barbara Walters-Rosie deal. Do we want to play that or not? Do we want to play the Donald or not?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think so, because I looked very good on that clip.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Okay, all right, so I see... It's all about look. It doesn't matter what you say, it's how you look. That time I look good, so I'd definitely play it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay.
<Unknown Speaker> <Neutral> Rack it up.
<Don Imus> <Negative> All right. [Inaudible] with the comment from The View. Roll it, Big Foot or Big Butt, whatever.
<Rosie O'Donnell> <Neutral> What can you say about that guy?
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> That poor, pathetic man.
<Rosie O'Donnell> <Neutral> Yes.
<Barbara Walters> <Negative> He just can't, he just can't let go, but we are moving on.
<Rosie O'Donnell> <Neutral> The man is obsessed with me, and I'm happy to say, "His show tanked."""
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When somebody attacks, I believe in attacking back.
<Don Imus> <Negative> I don't like that.
<Natalie Morales> <Neutral> Donald Trump's name was never even uttered Wednesday on The View, but the attack on him and his NBC reality show The Apprentice was clear to Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Rosie lies. The Apprentice ratings were fantastic, it was the most successful show in the last 14 months in that time slot and Rosie made this statement, "Oh
<Natalie Morales> <Positive> According to the Nielsen ratings, Sunday's premiere of The Apprentice, now in its sixth season and this time on location in Los Angeles, showed growth, up 5% over the 5th season and winning the time slot. As for The View, the ratings are also up 24% from the same time last year, and since the war of words with Trump got under way, an average of about a half million more viewers have tuned in. A fact Trump is more than happy to point out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Rosie is a very sad figure and watch what happens after I'm finished with this and The View back to being The View, those ratings will tank.
<Natalie Morales> <Negative> Trump continues to insist that when Walters phoned him last month, she did make disparaging remarks about O'Donnell, no matter what Walters is saying now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because that's what she said. I hope Rosie is listening. That's what she said, Rosie
<Natalie Morales> <Positive> How does Trump feel about Walters?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I feel sorry for Barbara, because she's just a puppet now of Rosie
<Natalie Morales> <Neutral> But the women of The View are already showing a united fun.
<Rosie O'Donnell> <Neutral> Are you okay, Barbara?
<Barbara Walters> <Positive> I'm okay, darling. Are you okay?
<Rosie O'Donnell> <Neutral> I'm okay, too. We're both okay?
<Natalie Morales> <Neutral> Trump however is still not okay with O'Donnell.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She is disgusting.
<Natalie Morales> <Negative> You know there? Why go with the slob in the comments and calling her disgusting?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I actually like my hair, but she's always knocking it. Something interesting. She can criticize my hair, but I'm not allowed to criticize her. You want me to comment back? We'll have a big story, I'll comment back, right? I actually like my hair, but she sort of think like, [Inaudible] because she has nothing else to say.
<Natalie Morales> <Neutral> For Today, Natalie Morales NBC News, New York.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Well, here's my first observation. Don't say that, The apprentice tank when ratings are up and have won the time slot. You can't say that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hey, Don. It was the number one show in the last 14 months on NBC at that time slot. By the way, against Desperate Housewives and other things. I mean, after six years, we had 15 copies of The Apprentice, 15.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everyone bombed and this thing is still going strong after six seasons. I got to listen to this slob told me it bombed. I believe in attacking back and the one thing I'm very disappointed in, I just heard that my segment is sponsored by somebody. What the hell is that all about? You're supposed to be paying me, Don.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> North Fork Bank. That's one of my banks and they're a great bank and John Kanas is like one of the greats, right?
<Don Imus> <Positive> Well, yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can't believe they're paying for me to go on television. I don't know like this. I've got guys, I've got hundreds of guys begging me to do clips and do this and they're paying Imus. I don't know what is going on here, but that's okay.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Anyway. Well, my original observation about the Miss USA thing was hearing Trump. It was in my view and a lot of other people's view. He did this magnanimous thing.
<Unknown Speaker> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Don Imus> <Negative> Her criticism of him was idiotic, was beyond idiotic. If everybody who made a mistake in her life was precluded from doing anything else in her life, I wouldn't have a ranch for kids with cancer. You think parents from all over the world would send their kids out to somebody who was a drug addict and a drunk?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don, I gave Miss USA a chance, I gave her a second chance and Rosie went nuts. But you have to understand I know Rosie. I have a history with Rosie. Rosie understands that I know her and she wasn't really as upset about that as she is about me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That news conference was very large to put it mildly, it was like a monster. Nobody could even believe it. I gave her a second chance and it was a great thing to do, and she went nuts. I had a choice, I could just sort of let it pass or -- you know I have an expression.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When you deal with scum, you have to treat them like scum and you know Rosie is scum. She's garbage and I hit her hard, I hit her between the eyes. I learned a long time ago in high school, when you have a bully hit him hard right between the eyes and that's what I did. Every poll showing 91%.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The fact is, people hate Rosie and her ratings are up. You know why her ratings are up? Because of me. When I stop with this stuff which maybe will take me a long time, because I'm actually enjoying it, but when I stop with this stuff, I guarantee you that those ratings are going to plummet, because it's a dead show, it's a boring show.
<Don Imus> <Negative> Barbara Walters called you and said what she said. I've known her a long time and I suspect -- I'm just trying to be an objective observer here. There wouldn't be any reason for you to make this up. I know this...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don, why else would you call me?
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Exactly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She was on vacation. Why else would you call me? Rosie had just rant and rave like a maniac.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> She didn't expect you to say anything.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, actually she called, because she heard I was going to say something and that's when she said, "Donald
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don, if you notice she never denied that she made those statements. You know she's done everything. I thought it was very sad when Rosie hit her. In other words, they worked this out backstage.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The other day, one of the saddest moments in Barbara's career was when Rosie hit her about 'what do you think of him?' She was sort of caught off guard, and she was given a line to read, and she looks down at the table at her cue card and says, "That poor pathetic man."" You know
<Don Imus> <Negative> Yes, [Inaudible] Well, what I suspect happened was that, she just didn't think you would repeat what she said to you. I mean I'm sure it is, and if that's the case...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, she didn't tell me not to, Don. She never said, "Let's have this conversation in conference."""
<Don Imus> <Negative> No. [Inaudible]
