<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I mean, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How are you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm fine. And you, of course, are a super developer a casino guy and the whole thing and obviously, you want to say few words.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know I just wanted to congra -- I listened this morning and I would not have known what to do if you were going to be off the air, Howard. Believe it or not 7:00 in the morning.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> The whole country was sitting on pins and needles.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It wouldn't have been a good start of the day, Robin. Believe me if he wasn't on, so I'm very happy that Mel did the right thing and paid up.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, let me tell you something, also a lot of people were concerned because I think me leaving the station would have affected the stock market.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think maybe the stock would have dropped in half if you left, Howard. I don't know. Maybe they'll drop in half when they see what you're getting paid. I don't know.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Never mind me. What's really important is what hot piece of ass is lying next to you today?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, right now I'm in the office working very diligently.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> While you have a hot piece of hot lying next to you in the office, don't you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Don't I wish, Howard. How I wish.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you still with Melania? Are you still with Melania Knauss?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I am.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Let me tell you, I saw a picture of her the other day.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Where the hell was it. I don't know some magazine, she's wearing short shorts. What was it? The FHM calendar.
<K.C. Anderson> <Neutral> FHM calendar
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's what it was.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, yeah. All right. She did that, I believe. There's a lot of those things and she's great, she's really beautiful, and she's very nice
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're not kidding. You're not gonna marry that brother.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Has it been discussed, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Everything gets discussed.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why did I see you wearing a marriage equals death T-shirt?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know you always have to have those prenups out. You found out about that, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, yeah. No, but I mean you're never going to get married again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know I love the institution of marriage, to be honest with everybody.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know you don't.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, when you have somebody and you're married it's a little different. And I do love the institution. What I don't like is if you have to dissolve it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It gets very nasty. It's not a pretty picture.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I guess she's sitting right next to you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no. she's actually not. But it's not a pretty picture I found that out with Ivana. I found it out to a much lesser extent with Marla
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But Ivana was quite vicious in going after me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Don't I remember I had to stick up for you
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You really stuck up for me, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I did. But, listen. Now you're happy. Melania leaves you alone, and obviously sexually pleasing you, I know you're
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Really?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. Do you remember that quote
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That may have been the most complimentary quote I've ever had. Forget about making lots of money it doesn't mean anything. That was the ultimate.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> To get that headline is the best.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Number one selling point, and that was, that was a nice headline. I very much appreciate it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He's really JFK III. We lost JFK Jr.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, sadly.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donald Trump has become JFK III
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You think?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. He's quite boy attitude. Absolutely. Absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I had a good time. He was a great guy, he was a great friend of mine. I was a terrible thing. That was unbelievable.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thank God, it wasn't you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I guess you could say that. It was terrible.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yeah. It really was bad. And the thing is though, On happier note, I will be back for five years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's great. And of course, you know you're always welcome on the show whenever you want to be. Well, I know that. But you know, I just selfishly -- I would have really missed you and I really felt that there was no
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No blaming, they did.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I look at the ratings and you know for the people that -- I look at the ratings the ratings are huge.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just felt they probably had no choice. I would love to see the inclusion. I heard Penny before.

<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You bang everyone. You haven't banged Penny Crone, did you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like Penny a lot. I would not bang her.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You would not, all right
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I wouldn't do that. Out of respect for her.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You don't want to ruin her. Donald, thank you so much for calling in. The Great Donald Trump.
