<Shannon Bream> <Positive> Mr. President, welcome to Fox News @ Night.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi, Shannon.
<Shannon Bream> <Positive> Great to have you with us. Let me start by asking you about the hurricane response and coordination. I got to confess, I grew up there in the Panhandle. A lot of folks I love were hit today. I know you've talked to several of the governors. How does it look?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it was a tough windstorm. The wind was probably more dangerous than anything else. I was just listening to Rick, where it was third or fourth ever in recorded history, and that's exactly what it was. So to a certain extent, we don't know, because it's so dark, and all the electric is out, but we hear there's a lot of damage, and it's a tremendous wind damage. Tremendous. A lot of things are blown over. Hopefully not houses with people in them.
<Shannon Bream> <Negative> You were criticized tonight by some for going to the rally in Pennsylvania. I want to give you a chance to respond your critics who said it was political. You shouldn't have gone during the storm.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, if I didn't go, they would also criticize it. And the problem I had Shannon is this was set up a long time ago. We had thousands of people lined up from yesterday. I mean, literally, they stayed 24 hours and sometimes more than that to go to these rallies. They like them. You probably saw the pictures on television tonight. Tonight, thousands and thousands of people outside after the arena, it was a big arena but it was full, and we had to have 15 or beyond that thousand people outside. And, so you had these people waiting for hours, many hours. And if I didn't go, that would have been the wrong thing too. And, more importantly than anything, we have people in Florida, we have people in the White House. I had everything set up an Air Force One. I was in total communication. In fact, I spoke with the governors of Alabama, the governor of, as you know, of Georgia I spoke with Rick Scott. We were in constant communication. Did the rally, and people had a fantastic time. It was a very important rally tonight. But it would have been very unfair to have people waiting for 10 and 12 and more than that hours, and then say, by the way, I'm not going to be there tonight. It would have been pretty tough.
<Shannon Bream> <Positive> Well, Mr. President, as much as they like to go, we know you like to go too. I mean, you love to be out there campaigning as much as you can. Just under a month ago, now, to the midterms. Politico had this headline yesterday. It says the GOP house is crumbling. A lot of folks who turned out for you in 2016, are you confident they'll show up in the midterms as well?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that's what I'm trying to get out. I mean, I'm -- I guess, people like me, because you see what's going on, and you see the poll numbers,  it came out with 52 today, one of the big polls, and -- and we do -- and they say there were a lot of people beyond that, when they hang up, they say that's a Trump voter. That's my kind of person. But, the fact is that I think we're doing really well. I'm looking at the Senate votes, and races that we were not even going to contest, we're now winning. If you look at North Dakota if you look at -- I could name four or five of them, but I want to jinx myself by doing it, but many of the Senate races that we didn't think we were even going to be contesting, to a large extent, we are now leading. We have some great candidates, and very importantly, we're finding the same thing now with the -- with the House. A lot of it has to do with the horrible abuse that now Justice Kavanaugh suffered last week at the hands of these Democrats, they went --  they went absolutely crazy. It was disgraceful. I think they disgraced their party and they disgraced themselves.
<Shannon Bream> <Negative> Well, let me ask you about that because today, the FBI director Christopher Wray was on the Hill and taking a lot of questions from some of those Democrats. Some of them, who are on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and who really opposed now Justice Kavanaugh, and they were pressing the FBI director on whether or not you, or others the White House, tied his hands when it came to their supplemental investigation they did in that one week delay. What do you say?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, what did he say? I'd be curious, because I was out there working very hard on the hurricane, and other things. What did he say?
<Shannon Bream> <Positive> Well, he basically said there were some things that he couldn't divulge, and that they was carried out by standard procedure, and there are a lot of folks wondering if you would release the FBI scope letter that directed them in that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I do whatever really the Senate wanted, because, look, the Senate was well-run, so well-run by Senator Grassley, and whatever they would like to do is okay with me. If they want to release, it's okay, and if they don't want to release, I could understand that also. But again, it was going to be their vote, and I let them do whatever they wanted to do, and that included the investigation itself. What they wanted, and if they wanted something, they would have either let us know, or they could have directly let the FBI know, as far as I would be concerned. So, obviously the reports were very strong, because everybody that read them came away and said, everything said was totally uncorroborated, or not true. And, I think it was a disgrace, frankly. And I am glad we went the extra week, because by coming the extra week and going the extra week, we ended up exactly with that. So, it -- it was -- it was in many ways a very sad period of time for this country to have a man like that go through what he had to go through, and his family and his young daughters, to go through a situation like that, where they were leaking, and I think a lot of people think they know who leaked it, but where they were leaking, where they were doing things and saying things that were inappropriate. I think the Democrats disgraced themselves during the hearings.
<Shannon Bream> <Negative> What do you think about Dr. Ford? Do you think she went through a tough time? Do you think that she was acting on her own? Do you think she was acting on political or party pressure?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just don't have an opinion on that. It was 36 years ago. There were no complaints during this long, long period of time. When it came right down to it, she didn't know how she got there, she didn't know how she got back. She didn't know, really, the time or the year. She didn't know the house. She didn't know the section, the area. She just know -- she knew that she had one beer. She says she had one beer. That's about it. So, you know, do I have a -- do I have a statement to make? No, I'm not going to make a statement. But I can tell you this: I really believe you need a lot more than that to take somebody who is a world class student, who was a hard worker, who'd never had a problem -- and this wasn't covered, but if you take from the time he graduated from college to right now, he led a very spectacular, clean life, a beautiful life. And if he didn't, he was a high judge -- second highest court, as you know better than I do. If he didn't, that would have been reported in the newspapers almost like it would be reported if I did it.
<Shannon Bream> <Positive> Well, and with some minor exceptions, I would say, most folks thought that you were pretty restrained, when it came to Dr. Ford --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Shannon Bream> <Negative> -- commenting on the Kavanaugh process. Was that difficult for you? Is it something that you think you'll do with other major issues as well?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I really like the job the Senate did. I thought they were dignified in terms of the Republicans, that is. They were -- they they didn't have to take that time. They could have taken a much earlier vote, as you know. They waited. They watched. They asked the FBI to do a seventh investigation. Don't forget, that was the seventh investigation, Shannon. So they asked for a seventh investigation, and obviously it was very strong. Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham and everybody that went in to read it -- to read it came out and said, wow that was, it was -- number one, they thought it was thorough,  and number two, here was nothing there. So, I'm glad we took the extra week, and you know, people have said I was restrained, and I think that's good. But I was restrained also, because the Senate  really was doing their job as they were supposed to.
<Shannon Bream> <Negative> Let me ask you something else that's come up tonight as far as this involves the Senate Foreign Policy as well. This issue about this missing Washington Post journalist --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Shannon Bream> <Negative> -- the Saudi man Jamal Khashoggi. There's conflicting information coming in. But Senator Corker himself, obviously, a Republican, said: "Based on U.S. intel that he's seen he says everything points to the Saudis being responsible that he's disappeared or that he's been killed." The Turks say the same. The Saudis completely deny that. What does this mean to our relationship with the Saudis if you become convinced the administration at any point becomes convinced that they're responsible for his death or disappearance.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's a terrible thing and it certainly would not be a positive I would not be happy at all. And I guess you would have to say so far it's looking a little bit like that and we're going to have to see we're doing a lot of work on it. But it would certainly not be a not be a good thing at all.
<Shannon Bream> <Negative> What about the senators, a bipartisan kind of talk, now that they would block any further arms sales to Saudi would you support that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think that would be hurting us. We don't we have jobs, we have, you know, a lot of things happening in this country, we have a country that's doing probably better economically that it has ever done before. A part of that is what we're doing with our defense systems and everybody's wanting them. And frankly, I think that that would be a very, very tough pill to swallow for our country. I mean, you're affecting us and you know they're always quick to jump that way. I'd have to find out really before I discuss this. I'd have to find out what happened. And we are looking and so are other people. Turkey's looking and a couple of others are looking, the very talented people are involved and we will get to the bottom of it. I do hate to commit to what recourse we take at this -- It's just too early.
<Shannon Bream> <Neutral> Have you narrowed your list or made a decision about replacing Ambassador Haley?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know the incredible thing -- first of all, Nicky was fantastic and the incredible thing is I really have five or six fantastic people, I think they all do the job really well. And the answer is yes, I don't expect to be adding anybody the list but we have some really talented, brilliant people that will do a great job. Probably over the next week or two I will announce it. Nicky is going to be here as you know 'til the end of the year. And so anybody will be working with her for a little period of time at least, which will be good. But at some point to the very near future I'll be announcing the name.
<Shannon Bream> <Positive> Okay. You can come back here at 11:00. Any time you like to announce, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. The show is great, I think I'll do it.
<Shannon Bream> <Positive> Thank you. All right let me ask you about a piece you wrote today, going after this Medicare for All idea. You in that piece call the Democrats radical socialist, you say they want to turn the U.S. into Venezuela. Not surprisingly, Senator Bernie Sanders has responded. He says you're lying about his proposal and he says: "The polls show that Americans want what he's proposing." Your response.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't think so because basically you do what he says you're not going to have a country and you are going to have Venezuela and you're going to have to lift up your taxes by three times. You know, we've been cutting taxes and we're giving great -- we're giving great healthcare plans. We just came out with another concept of a plan today that a lot of people are liking very much, and we are -- we are doing a real job and, you know, we get rid of the individual mandate that people hated, which was horrible, that was the Obama plan and Obamacare. We're also keeping the premiums down at a much lower level than they ever were on the Obama administration. And we had to beat other than one senator, or you could put it differently, you know, one senator late in the evening happened to vote against it. Shockingly, even though he campaigned for 10 years -- for eight years against it, you know, we had it done. It was repeal and replace but we're coming up with -- we're really coming up with alternatives that are just as good, and in some cases maybe even better. But we've been able to keep the premiums down much lower than they had previously during the Obama administration, and that's good, and that was that's really through good management of health care. And we have things happening on healthcare that are going to be very, very exciting. But if you look at Bernie, and nobody ever says it,  but the country is not rich enough to even think about doing what they want to do. And number two, if you did what they want to do it would be lousy healthcare, really lousy healthcare. And I think you understand that very well.
<Shannon Bream> <Positive> Well --
<Shannon Bream> <Positive> We're right on it. And a lot of people are saying we're right on it. And if you look at the polls I mean I'm seeing polls that are showing us as per the first part of our conversation that the Senate. Everybody says we're doing very well but the House -- I think we're doing almost as well with regard to the House.
<Shannon Bream> <Negative> -- well, let me ask you though with the polls that show the House slipping away from the Republicans and into the hands of the Democrats. Do you think the polls are inaccurate purposely? Do you think they're flawed? Do you think it's that people aren't answering questions because they happen to be Trump supporters and don't trust pollsters? What's your response to the bad news?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I've had many inaccurate polls and I've had some that were -- where I found Rasmussen to be very accurate. Actually, The Los Angeles Times was a very accurate poll, Investor's Business -- Investor's Daily. I mean, we had some polls that were very accurate having to do with 2016, but we had some polls that were so far out and we knew they were phony polls, I mean, as far as I'm concerned. But this isn't about that. I think that polls, you know, they call it a generic poll and actually the Republicans are doing well in the generic poll. But I don't know that a generic poll means anything because there are individual races -- The House, there are many individual races. I think we're doing really well. We're looking at races that we didn't think we were going to be winning and now we're even up, but honestly, we're not going to know until November 6. We really are not going to know. And we'll see what happens whatever it is. But I'm out there working hard doing a lot of different things for House members as well as for Senate. They all want me out there and we're getting tremendous crowds and we're getting the word out and getting the word out.
<Shannon Bream> <Negative> I want to make sure I ask you another healthcare question before we leave that because your critics say that you and Republicans are stripping away any pre-existing healthcare condit --  coverage in these plans they say: the plans are cheaper because they offer less. Will you commit to covering preexisting conditions?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have. But I have for months. In fact, if you've listened to my speeches, pre-existing conditions -- I'm saying it's being covered 100% and Republicans are doing that. And there was a time where that wasn't being done. But -- and there was a -- there was a time for many years where it wasn't done at all and not even thought of we are 100% for pre-existing and covering people with pre-existing conditions. And I actually -- if you'd look at my last -- you know, for many months, speeches, I cover pre-exist -- I say: "We will cover pre-existing conditions." The difference is that Democrats won't be able to do it because it doesn't fit in their plans and it doesn't work monetarily. They will never be able to do it.
<Shannon Bream> <Positive> Tomorrow you've got a special guest for lunch. Kanye West is coming to the White House.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do. I do.
<Shannon Bream> <Negative> How does this work? Does he tell you what he wants for lunch? Do you pick what he's going to get for lunch? Does he get the order when he gets there? How does that work?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That was never discussed. And also, Jim Brown, who's --
<Shannon Bream> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- the greatest running back maybe ever in the NFL, I mean, Jim Brown is a great -- and he was a great lacrosse player that some people say he was a better lacrosse player and yet he was the best football player, he's a great athlete. But Jim Brown is coming. Jim has been a supporter from the beginning of me and, you know, when you look at the unemployment we're the best in the history of our country. Black unemployment is at the lowest level ever in history. You look at median income for African-Americans. It's at the best it's ever been in the history of our country. I mean, I'm doing things for the African-Americans that have never been done by the Democrats. And as you know the Democrats really have had that vote. They've had that vote locked up. It's not so locked up anymore, you know, because I'm producing numbers that they would never able to produce. So, it's a great thing. And Kanye West saw that. Kanye is a smart guy and he saw that, and he saw that a long time ago. Jim Brown saw it. I could name many other great black stars and athletes that are said. You know who they are and you report about them. We have a lot of support. We have a tremendous amount of support and it's gaining all the time because I'm producing. When you look at numbers like that, when it's the best in the history of our country how can somebody fight that?
<Shannon Bream> <Neutral> How long does the attorney general stick around, Mr. President?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're going to see what happens. Let's all see. The nice part is that we are --  everybody's working together. I have a great -- I really have a great Cabinet. Everybody's working hard. They're all working together. And as you can probably see, things are going very well. We finished a big deal with Canada, with Mexico. We finished the deal with South Korea. We're winning with China. China wants to make a deal badly. We're winning with China. We're winning at every front and that's the way I want to keep it. We're doing very well. We'll see what happens with the attorney general. We'll see what happens with some other positions but I will say we have a great Cabinet. I think we have one of the best cabinets ever.
<Shannon Bream> <Positive> How would you rate -- I'm going to give you three senators. Who's your favorite? Mitch McConnell, Chuck Grassley or Lindsey Graham?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All of them, I like them all. Don't get me into that. You get me into a lot of trouble. This could be your toughest question. No, the easiest thing --  Look, Chuck Grassley is a strong guy. Gruff, okay, and I say that in a very affectionate way because he's a great guy. He did a fantastic job that was not easy, and then they send the phony paid, you know, protesters in screaming all the time. And frankly, they let them scream because they discredited themselves and they were all put up by the Democrats, they actually admitted, the Democrats admitted that they worked with these people. It's terrible. But Chuck Grassley did a great job. As you know, Lindsey was outstanding. I mean, Lindsey was just absolutely outstanding. His level of -- he just couldn't believe what was happening, it was so nasty and so false, and so such fabricated stories and lies. Lindsey Graham was incredible. And I'll tell you what, Mitch -- and I've been a fan of Mitch, a lot of people don't know this but I've been a fan of Mitch for a long time and we have a very good relationship, which, again, a lot of people don't know that. We've had a lot of success together. And Mitch was fantastic. So really, all three were stars.
<Shannon Bream> <Negative> All right. One last question to you before we go. The dow today, a lot of folks very concerned about what they saw. I know that you've had some theories on that some of your critics say that it's in part because of the trade war with China.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I don't think that.
<Shannon Bream> <Neutral> What do you think of that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I don't think it's sad at all. I mean, the trade war with China would take it as billions of dollars in tariffs from China, from Chinese goods, and it hasn't hurt us at all. We're taking in billions and billions of dollars. We're going to make products here that we're now buying in China. Now that wasn't it. The problem that I have is with the Fed. The Fed is going wild. I mean, I don't know what their problem is, but they're raising interest rates and it's ridiculous because we're winning. I don't call them trade wars, I'd say we're doing, you know, we're doing a little bit of battle, not much. But China, you know, we put $250 billion worth of tariffs and potential tariffs at 25% and we have $267 billion more if I want to do it. But they want to make a deal. Hey, you said that we all said: "Oh, Canada will never make a deal." Well, Canada made a deal, that's a great deal. We opened up Canada for our farmers. You look at Mexico we made the deal. Look at the horrible deal that we had with South Korea that was totally thrown out and renegotiated and now it's a good deal. We'll make a great deal so that's not the problem. The problem, in my opinion, is treasuries and the Fed. The Fed is going loco and there's no reason for them to do it. And I'm not happy about it.
<Shannon Bream> <Negative> All right. One more thing on this issue of civility today. We heard from the former Attorney General Eric Holder saying: "Instead of when they go low we go high." You said: "When you go low it's time to kick them." Hillary Clinton has said: "We don't return to civility until the Democrats either get the House or the Senate back because power is now the only thing Republicans understand." But when you talk to or press people on that they'll say you started this whole thing by encouraging people to, you know, rough up protesters and by going after people with nicknames and all kinds of things. How do you respond?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't think so. You know my rallies have been very peaceful. And even at the beginning when there seemed to be conflict they sent paid people to disrupt our rallies. And when you do that, you know, bad things happen, but they were the ones that started everything. So, no, it wasn't us it was -- it was totally the other side. I would have a rally and paid people were going into those rallies causing trouble and in many cases it didn't work out so well for those people. Paid people --
<Shannon Bream> <Negative> But not okay to punch them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- Shannon, paid people were in those rallies. But when I hear Holder making a statement like he made today I think it's a disgrace. And Hillary I really understand she just doesn't get it. She never did. She never will. And that's why she lost the election.
<Shannon Bream> <Positive> Well, I think we all hope that we can get back to some form of civility where we can have disagreements about tough subjects and respect each other in the process. In the meantime --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I hope so too. I do. I hope so too. I hope we're going to be able to do that.
<Shannon Bream> <Positive> Mr. President, we really appreciate your time and feel free to come in or call any time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Shannon.
<Shannon Bream> <Positive> Have a great night.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Goodbye.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald Trump joins us. Good evening, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hello, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, big discussion, big picture in the news today and over past few days has been race relations in this country. The president used the "N" word today, which is striking a controversy in some circles. Secretary Hillary Clinton used the term "white privilege" over the weekend. Tell me, are all these discussions, I mean, tell me how are race relations in this country in your mind and what would you do as president?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it's always going to be a big topic. There is no question about it. You would have thought, with an African-American president, at a minimum, you would have thought he would have been a cheerleader for the country. And frankly, it would have been a lot better but it hasn't worked out very well. It's probably as bad as it has ever been.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's a big problem. One of the things that you have got to do is get the country working again. Get jobs, create jobs. Take jobs away from China. Take jobs away from Mexico and all the other places that are taking our jobs. People have no place to work. You know, the real unemployment number, Greta, is probably close to 20 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Might even be higher than that, according to many. We have to create places and jobs. If we don't do that, it's going to be a very, very long couple of years, I can tell you, and beyond.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> So you think that the deep wounds have historically been in this country are healed with more jobs?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it's going to help. I mean, you need lots of things. You need family. You need jobs. You need education. But jobs is something we can really do something about quickly. We have to take the jobs away from other countries that are making our products. They are taking our money. And they are, in fact, taking our jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Whether we like it or not, whether people want to talk about it or not, you look at what's going on in Japan and China and some other places, you look at the manufacturing that's going on, we are not doing it they are doing it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. Let me talk a little bit about jobs, the Trade Promotion Authority. And you have tweeted this -- that's the Trade Promotion Authority that's pending in the U.S. Senate. It says, "The Senate must not pass TPA. Any Senator who votes for it is disqualified for being president of the United States.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Protect the American worker and manufacturer." A lot of Republicans and president, bipartisan, want the TPA. Why do you see this as disqualifier for any Senator who votes for it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because lobbyists and donors, who really control the politicians in this country, they want it because they are representing companies that benefit. But the country is not benefiting. And I will tell you, we are really -- that is really a bad thing. I just mentioned jobs. That is really a bad thing. That trade pact is a disaster for jobs in our country.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We should not have it. It doesn't talk about currency manipulation the way it should. It covers too big an area. We should do individual agreements with individual countries. The fact is Obama is not a negotiator. The last person I want negotiating for me is President Obama. And he has got free wheel on this thing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So, it's absolutely a disaster for the country and a disaster for business and jobs.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> It's official. You are in, 100 percent?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Which would be very disappointing to a lot of people that are all talk and no action, the politicians. You know, there is a whole big thing out there. These people will never bring us back to the promise land. They will never do it. A lot of politicians and a lot of pundits are very disappointed and they said, oh, he will never file. [End Video Clip]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I filed. As of today, I'm filed.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Mr. President it's good to see you.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Thank You
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Today, the tax plan announced. Now... and it's interesting, you're getting... you're getting hit from the left and some on the right. Rand Paul's going to vote for it, I think.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> But he said it's not significant because the upper income tier doesn't get a lot of tax rate relief, or any. And then Ron Wyden calls it basically a middle class con job. It's not really a tax cut for the middle class. So, left and right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they're big tax cuts... the biggest cuts in the history of our country, actually. We have reform, and we have simplification. And honestly, I am surprised a little bit to hear what you're saying, because we've really gotten great reviews. people are loving it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Even a certain newspaper that I don't like very much came out today and they gave Schumer four... four Pinocchios, and they said because he was not telling the truth, when it came to the middle class, because he said it's for the rich, and it's really not for the rich.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's for the middle class, and it's for jobs, and I would say, maybe even in that order. So the middle class is a big beneficiary. Jobs and companies are big beneficiaries, but the companies really create the jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we really have, Laura, we've had tremendous receptivity to it, to a point that I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, and I do think Rand Paul, by the way, who I like, I think he's going to vote for it.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> Hillary Clinton said last night that paying for the dossier... she defended it basically.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> She said it's different from meeting with Russians, Like, meeting with Russians. She was trying to make a, make a, make a comparison, to say, oh no. But she totally defended it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she talked about oppo research. It's wonderful. Oppo research, and it's... but not when it comes to us, okay? Oppo research for us, of course, is no good.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. That dossier, which is totally fake, and made up. It's like a novel. But that dossier is a disgrace, and it should not have been allowed to be used. And then I hear the kind of money they spent?
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> Nine million.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, it's inconceivable. It's absolutely inconceivable. It's horrible.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> So we don't know who authorized payment. We don't really yet have...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they're trying to find out, and we'll find out. But they'll really... I think it's a disgrace that a thing like that can take place.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Donna Brazile in her new book writes about the DNC Democrat primary rigging, and talks about corruption. Internal corruption and unethical finances, and she tags Hillary Clinton. Are you surprised about this --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think it's --
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> -- given what you said about Bernie Sanders being fa..... being... being given short shrift?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> think it's a maj... you know, like it's a major story now. Now, I don't know if the mainstream fake media, because they are fake and phony, but I just don't know if they're going to pick it up. But I want to tell you that is a big story, what she's saying.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's illegal, number one, and it's really very unfair to Bernie Sanders. I'm not a Bernie Sanders fan, although I must say I got a lot of his votes, when he was thrown out. Many of those people voted for him because of trade. Because I agreed with him on trade, we're just doing more about it than he can do, and we're doing a lot about it. But that was... I thought that was terrible.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> The justice system a joke and a laughingstock. What were you referring to exactly?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, when I look at immigration, and I look at this whole thing coming in by lottery, then we can't do anything about it quickly, and I look at what's going on with justice, when it comes to so many different topics....
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Criminal justice, you talking about criminal justice issues?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I really feel... a lot of Justice. This guy would be tied up forever in the court system. You look at some of the cases that are going on forever, and you have them dead to right. Now the justice system has to go quicker, and it has to be really stronger and fairer. It probably has to be fairer too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, it's very sad. When you look at a lottery system, and you have people coming into the country through the form of a lottery.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> Fifty thousand.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know, the countries, just so you understand, the countries are putting their finest in there. They're not putting their best and their greatest in their finest in there. And this kid came in through a lottery system that's going to end, and it's going to end fast.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In fact, I've already instructed Congress: they must end it. And and I think we're going to get even Democrat support on this.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> You had DACA talks today, for the dreamers --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I did.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> -- and to your base, and what you campaigned on was a real common sense policies. you talked about E-Verify, building the wall, chain migration, which is a huge problem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All of those things are happening. Chain migration...
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> -- and is that going to be part of any DACA deal?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> So if the Democrats want Dreamer help, they're going to have to do...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah we're going to...
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> They're going to have to do [Inaudible] chain migration?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sure. Sure. Chain immigration is one of the most important things...
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> Is that a requirement for you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Until yesterday, most people never heard of chain migration. I gave a form of a press conference and I started talking about chain migration, and this horrible animal, he's an animal as far as I'm concerned.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Twenty three people have touched him -- maybe, came in because he was in... and he was only in with a green card, supposedly. But chain migration is where his whole family comes in. His mother can come in, his father, his grandmother, everybody comes in. Chain migration is a disaster for this country, and it's going to end.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now I've been talking about it for a while, but I think the public until yesterday probably never heard about chain migration.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Well, the Republicans didn't want to touch it for a long time. You've held up a mirror to what the Republicans weren't doing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they're touching it right now. It's become a very, very strong point right now.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Will that be part of a dreamer deal? A DACA deal?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, it'll be part of a DACA deal. DACA is a lot different than Dreamers.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> I mean, for the, for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> Will you require that if any amnesty talks will... will... will require chain migration to end?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think any Republican would vote for anything having to do with leaving chain migration. Chain migration is a disaster for this country, and it's horrible. I mean just take a look at him. 23 people, potentially 23 people?
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> Is that verified?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's what I heard. It's what I gave, whether it's 23 or whether it's two as far as I'm concerned.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> That's a big difference, two and 23.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I know that. But I hear it's 23. So it's a lot of people.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> The wall. When I was at rallies, that's what people... they want that wall built.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's one of the things. But we're going to have a wall.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> But, Paul Ryan said at one point 4 billion, he would, he would start... then perhaps that number has been thrown out. But that is a pittance.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Phase one. Phase one, during the first... well, first of all they say the wall is going to cost $40 billion. It's not going to cost anywhere near that.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Half that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Democrats are saying... we're talking about less than half. Also you don't have a wall... you have two thousand miles. You have mountains, you have rivers, you have things that you don't put the wall in, you don't need them. It never was planned for that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, I think for $18 billion or less, we're going to have a great wall. We're doing prototypes right
<Donald Trump> <Positive> One of the things that's come up pretty strongly is we want to have vision through the wall, because you want to see what's on the other side of the wall. You know, you think we're going to build a nice simple concrete wall, but it's not that simple. No, we're having the wall. We have to have the wall.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We need the wall for another reason: drugs. Drugs are pouring into our country. A lot of them are coming in through the southern border, and the wall will be a tremendous tool to help facilitate the ending of the drugs coming in. No, the wall is actually coming along pretty well. That will also be apart of DACA or whatever.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> But a down payment or a guarantee?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look when we get the down payment, we're going to have a guarantee. Believe me. We're not taking a down payment and then saying where's the rest of the money.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Not that can be a scam as well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because, you know you don't spend all the money immediately. So we can put it back. But when we take a down payment, I'm going to say, I want to make sure the rest of the money is coming.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> You're heading heading off to Asia. Huge trip.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Lots of stakes. You've got North Korea, a deal with the Chinese. You're going to stop in Seoul. Your State Department still has some unfilled positions. Are you worried that the State Department doesn't have enough Donald Trump nominees in there to push your vision through? Because other state departments, including Reagan's at times, undermined his agenda.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> And there is a concern that the State Department currently is undermining your agenda.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we don't need all the people that they want. You know, don't forget: I'm a business person, and I tell my people when you don't need to fill slots, don't fill them. But we have some people that I'm not happy with there.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> But Assistant Secretary of State, you're not getting rid of that position?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right, but let me tell you, the one that matters is me. I'm the only one that matters. Because when it comes to it, that's what the policy is going to be. You've seen that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You've seen it strongly. We're filling up roles. And don't forget Schumer and the Democrats are just obstructing. You can't get anything through. We have almost about half the number of people coming through as Obama had. But in addition to that, we don't need all of the people. You know, it's called cost saving. You know the old days...
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> But you want your vision pushed?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want my visio, but my vision is my vision anyway. It's called cost saving. There's nothing wrong with cost saving. Rex is in there working hard. He's doing his best. He's doing the best he can.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> Is he going to be with you for the duration?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we'll see. I don't know who's going to be... duration. I think the duration... I'll tell you this: I don't think any president in nine months has done the job that we've done. And that includes bills being passed by Congress.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You look at what's passed by the Senate, by the House. I think we're close to 70 bills, maybe over 70 bills. It's almost a record. You look at all of the deregulation, you look at Supreme Court Justice Gorsuch. You look at all of the other district judges, federal district judge and court of appeals judges. I don't think.... and then of course, the economy. Take a look.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Look at the economy. Look at the economy. Are you getting the credit for this economic revival, without your tax cut getting through, without Obamacare repeal yet. And this is a stunning economic revival in ten months.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's one of the greatest in the history of our country, and I'm in here now 10 months, and we are setting record after record, day after day I think we hit another one today.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm not getting enough credit for it because a lot of the reason is enthusiasm level, business level and also the fact that I've cut regulations to the extent that I've cut them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, I can tell you jobs that were never going to get built are now being built. Take a look at the pipelines, the Keystone Pipeline, the Dakota Access pipeline. I mean, every day we're hitting new highs. Very important: GDP.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You take a look GDP. 3.2
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> Two quarters.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And now three, and the last one was after four or five really obviously horrible hurricanes. And that's the equivalent of a point. So that would have been a four. A four was unthinkable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And each time we go up a point that's two and a half trillion dollars and thousands... I mean millions of jobs, actually. The thing I'm most proud about: companies are starting to come back into our country. They were leaving...
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Repatriating.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are coming back. And one of the things about our taxes, you talk about repatriation. We're bringing in, probably, I think the number is going to be over $4 trillion coming back into our country that's going to be put to work.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Speak of, are you going to do China enforcement on this trip? Tell China, intellectual property theft, subsidies, dumping in our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Are you, are you going to be tough on the enforcement side, given what they're doing to this country?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, I would be... you have to understand something very important. We have a problem called North Korea.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> But you.... you delinked it with Korea, with South Korea's trade deficit.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, well, we're going to see. But we have one problem that's a very big problem, it's called North Korea. China has been helpful. We are talking trade with China.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I am also, you know... you have, you not just...
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> It's complicated. Yeah, it's not just one thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not in a total vaccum. And President Xi has been pretty terrific. Most people have been saying, you know, whether it's cutting the banking system off from North Korea, whether it's cutting the oil down to North Korea, or cutting supplies down.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I must tell you, North Korea is a thing that I think we will solve, and if we don't solve it, it's not going to be very pleasant for them. Tt's not going to be very pleasant, I guess, for anybody. But China is helping us.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Japan's worried. They're worried.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, of course, they're worried. They should be worried. You know, they're very close to North Korea.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> They want a nuclear pledge from the United States, if they go after Japan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, Japan, Japan is a warrior nation. And I tell China, and I tell everyone else that listens, I mean, you're going to have yourself a big problem with Japan pretty soon if you allow this to continue with North Korea.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Are you going to make any pledges to Japan to defend them with our [Inaudible] capacity?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look they're an ally. They're an ally. The prime minister is a very good friend of mine. Prime Minister Abe... I've become very close. I've become very, very close to President Xi of China. I think a lot of good things are going to happen. I think is a very important trip.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> think this is one of the more important trips that a president is...
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> You don't like traveling now, right? You're not a big... you're not a big fan of traveling.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't love it. But I think it's important. I'm going to China. I'm going to Japan, South Korea. I'm then going to Vietnam where we have a tremendous trade conference, trade. And we're starting to do well in trade. Look, NAFTA is a disaster. NAFTA is killing us.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> You've going to talk to Putin? You going to talk to him on this trip?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we're renegotiating it. And we may have a meeting with Putin. We may... and again, Putin is very important because they can help us with North Korea.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> Syria?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They can help us with Syria. We have to talk about Ukraine.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Are you having fun in this job? Is it...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am. I love it. Well, there's been a lot of false reporting that I'm angry about things.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> I never... I've never seen any angry. I've known you for 14 years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think the press is fake. A lot of the media is fake. But, so you could say there's a certain anger there, but it's not really anger. It's really amazement at how dishonest, you know, when you get right down to it, how dishonest the news is.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> You're family is adjusting well?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I am, I am really... Well, I think my family has been treated unfairly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think that Ivanka has been treated very unfairly, frankly. Melania is really just powering through it. She's been incredible. People love Ivanka. People love Melania and, you know they go through it. But I do think the family's been treated a little bit unfairly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In the end, what is very nice is we really have, I don't think, I'm notsaying this in a braggadocios way, I don't think over a period of nine or ten months there's been any president in the beginning of their presidency that's done anywhere close.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When you think about regulations, and Supreme Court, and so many different things... things, and stock markets and the economy.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> I like the fact that you're impatient for change in a city that is slow moving, and moves at a glacial pace, and that's something you got from that business. You're impatient for change.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, and the most impatient most important thing that we're going to be doing is tax cuts tax cuts if we get this through, and I think we will, you're going to see this economy take off like a rocket ship.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Thank you so much Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> I really appreciate all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Appreciate it. Thank you.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Thank you.
