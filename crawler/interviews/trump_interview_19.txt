<Roop Raj> <Neutral> All right, let's do this. Mr. President, you're here right now. You penned the deal yesterday, and today you're here. Why? Tell us.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, we're very proud of Michigan. The state has so -- has been so great to me, as you know. We had a big victory in Michigan, and I brought a lot of car companies back, a lot of cars, a lot of companies are coming back. It's had the best year it's ever had, and we're very proud. We have a lot of car companies coming back into Michigan, in addition.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So, we want to be up here and really, celebrate, and that's what we're doing.
<Roop Raj> <Neutral> Well, as you celebrate, of course, you celebrated the state of Michigan with a good 16,000 votes at least.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Roop Raj> <Neutral> We know that this is going to be a swing state. What do you tell a moderate Democrat out there, who's on the fence about you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, when I started, Michigan was in big trouble. Everybody was leaving. The car companies were leaving. Companies were leaving, period. Now they're all coming back into Michigan, and they're coming back strong. I was with Prime Minister Abe recently, and I said you've got to bring some more of the companies back, and they're bringing them back.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And you've never seen anything like what's happening, and that's because of the federal government, that's because of what I'm doing. So, it's been a tremendous thing. Jobs are at a record level. All over the country, they're at a record level. But Michigan is now doing great, and you're getting all these car companies coming back to Michigan.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's pretty much what I have to say. Nobody can believe it. Also, I fixed the Soo Locks, you know about that? We're even working in the Asian carp. That's your new problem, and we're going to get that solved.
<Roop Raj> <Neutral> Well, it's been an issue for a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's been a long time, for a lot of years, but Soo Locks, from 1980, this was a problem. They couldn't get it done, and I got everything financed and it starts work almost immediately.
<Roop Raj> <Neutral> You take a look at this country. Do you see it as -- as divided as the media shows it, or do you think it's not as divided, and what responsibility do you have to make sure that we bridge those gaps?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think it's not as divided. We have a tremendous group of people. They're so proud of what America has become and how we're doing and how well we're doing. We're the envy of the world. Our economy is the best anywhere in the world. By far you just look at Michigan and what's happened in Michigan, with all the car companies coming back.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So I really don't think -- so I really don't think -- I think it's been divided but it's been really in much worse shape from that standpoint. If you look at when I took over, we had a country that's totally divided. I think it's coming back because of the tremendous success that we've had with the economy and other things.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We've rebuilt the military, the vets are now taken care of. We've got Choice approved. We've got -- I mean, nobody thought we could possibly get Choice approved. We have Veteran's Choice approved. So many things have happened and it's -- it's great and Michigan is really one of the big beneficiaries.
<Roop Raj> <Neutral> Would you think about the tone of the campaign? Whoever ends up with the Democratic nomination, how -- how -- how out of hand you think it'll get relative to the back and forth it's a fiery campaign already.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think it's going to be very hard for them to beat the best job numbers ever in the history of our country. The best African-American -- If you look at the African-American employment and unemployment numbers, they're the best numbers we've ever had. More people are working today than any time in the history of our country.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You look at all of that, Roop, almost 160 million people. When you look at that, it's pretty easy to, I think, win a campaign.
<Roop Raj> <Neutral> Last question. Detroiters were watching us right now, who may not vote for you. What do you tell them to change their mind?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think they're changing their mind. If you look at the polls, African-American votes are through the roof. We're one of the highest they've ever seen for a Republican and I think I want to get into a level that, frankly, nobody's done so much for people as I've done, the jobs, the employment numbers, opportunity zones, as you know, it's been a fantastic thing, and all of the things that we've done for African-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-American.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're setting records with every group. So I think we're in good shape.
<Roop Raj> <Neutral> You're talking to local news right now. Why?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because I like you.
<Roop Raj> <Neutral> Good to see you, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Have a good time.
<Roop Raj> <Neutral> Thank you so much.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you very much.
<Roop Raj> <Neutral> Appreciate your time.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Appreciate it.
<Roop Raj> <Neutral> Thank you.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Positive> Donald Trump is with us now on the phone from Iowa. Mr. Trump, good morning. Thanks for getting up extra early. Appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you, Savannah.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Negative> So, tell me how this came about. Did Sarah Palin come to you and say, I want to endorse?" did you go to her? How did it all come about?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We've known each other for a long time.  I've always liked her a lot and respected her a lot, and she called and sees what's happening with the campaign.  She sees what we're saying, what I'm saying, and she sees it has really become like a movement.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's an amazing thing that's happening.  Today, we're going to be in Iowa, we're going to be in Oklahoma.  We're going to have 10,000 people, maybe more than that in Oklahoma.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's like getting to be small crowds for us. So, it has just really been captivating for everybody, including myself, and she called, and it was such an honor, because everybody was trying to get Sarah. Everybody wanted that endorsement.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Negative> I wanted to ask you about that, because obviously she has been a supporter of Ted Cruz over the years. He said she was key in his Senate campaign, and yet she chose you over him. Did she say why? Did she act as though she wrestled with that decision?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think she likes what she sees, I think she likes what she sees in terms of what I'm talking about in trade, where we'll start trading properly.  We have some of the greatest people on earth, Carl Icahn and many of the business leaders are going to start negotiating our deals with China, and Japan, and Mexico and all of these countries that are beating us so badly in trade.  They won't be beating us very badly long.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, right now we have political hacks negotiating these deals.  She sees what's going on with ISIS.  She knows my stance on the military.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She knows I'm going to take care of our vets, build up our military, and, you know, so many other things, and she really gave a very, very good speech yesterday, about a half hour speech, and it was terrific. But every candidate wanted Sarah. I mean, everybody. They all respect her a lot.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Negative> You're in a battle, of course, with Cruz in Iowa. You are the top two candidates. If you had to name one thing that you would tell to Iowa voters, that's the reason they should vote for you over Cruz, what would that one thing be?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think I'm going to make much better deals in terms of trade and in terms of the military, in terms of the vets.  Obamacare is going to be terminated and we're going to come up with something much, much better.  Obamacare is a big failure, you know, premiums are going up 25, 35, 45 percent, all of that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the one thing would be that I'm going to win.  I mean, the polls are showing that I beat Hillary Clinton and I beat her soundly, and I'm going to win.  I haven't even started on Hillary yet.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I haven't started on them yet. I have, you know, 13 people left on the Republican side, so I'm really focused on them, but -- and once I start, it's going to be great. But the polls are showing that I beat Hillary very soundly, and I think that's an important element also.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Negative> Back to Palin for a moment. Would you consider her as your running mate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't think of -- to start off with, I don't think that it would be something she'd want to do.  She's been through that, and you know, interestingly, Savannah, and this is a 100 percent fact, when she came to see me and when she talked to me, and I could see that she really liked what we were saying, she never said, gee, I'd like to do this, I'd like to do that.  She never made a deal, like so many people want to try to make deals.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, she just said, I really like what's going on.  It's an amazing thing.  I've never seen anything like it in politics." A lot of people have said that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Just read the cover of Time magazine this week But she said, I've never seen anything like -- I've seen
<Savannah Guthrie> <Neutral> But see -- but see, the question, would you consider it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I haven't discussed it with her -- no, I haven't discussed anything with her about what she would do. But she is somebody I really like and I respect, and certainly she could play a position, if she wanted to.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Negative> You wouldn't rule her out as V.P.?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't think she'd want to do it.  I mean, I don't think she'd want to do it.  And you know, I really don't get into it right now, because I -- and that question is always asked of me, who do you have in mind? And I don't even have I about V.P.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> right now.  I just want to win.  I've always been a closer, I get the deal done, and I have to win before I start thinking about that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There are a lot of good people in the Republican Party, there are a lot of good people. As far as Sarah's concerned, never asked me about that, never asked me about anything else, just wanted to support, and it's such an honor, because, as you know very badly, so many people are so disappointed that she didn't support them, but certainly there would be a role somewhere in the administration, if she wanted. And I'm not sure that she does want that, but there would certainly be a role.
<Savannah Guthrie> <Positive> All right. Mr. Trump joining us from Iowa this morning. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Savannah.
