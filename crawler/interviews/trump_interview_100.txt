<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Interview begins in progress] state. It’s a special state, I have so many friends here. Kevin Cramer is running and I think Kevin Cramer is going to do really well. He is respected so much in Washington, in DC. He’s helped us with tax cuts, he’s helped us with everything. Worked on health care and done a great job, as you know. And he loves the people, he loves the people here and he loves the people of the country so, and I can’t normally do this, but I wanted to do this in honor of Kevin Cramer and his family.
<Chris Berg> <Positive> Thank you for being here. Big news today with Justice Kennedy retiring.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, Yes.
<Chris Berg> <Negative> You tweeted recently that Heidi Heitkamp was always a no when you needed her, but she did vote for Gorsich. Do you think you can get her vote, if you can get a vote before the election on this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well she’s been a no. I mean she voted no on the tax cuts. The fact is that they go along with Pelosi and Schumer, and now add to that Maxine Waters, this... she seems to be a new leader in the in the Democrats and she’s been a no in almost everything, and I just can’t rely on that. We need... we have great things that we are doing and we're putting forward.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the people of North Dakota love what we are doing and we can’t have the no votes. You know, we have 51 right now, which is really not a majority. You know, it’s essentially not a majority, because of the 51, you can’t... right.
<Chris Berg> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You lose one and all of the sudden you can’t win so we need Kevin so badly, and I think it’s gonna happen. I see the enthusiasm, you see the people here tonight
<Chris Berg> <Positive> We love you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- and it’s a special place I appreciate what you just said.
<Chris Berg> <Negative> Quick question sir, FBI over Peter Strock testified today in front of a house committee. The news is, is that Bob Muller hasn’t even interviewed him about this. Does that confirm your idea that this is a witch hunt?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah it does, I’m not even that surprised. Normally, you would be shocked at a thing like that but I’m not that surprised. It’s terrible. And what Strock did -- and don’t forget: he was with Bob Mueller for over a year. Somebody said fired. Well he fired because they found out. But he was with him for over a year, and I heard it was just an embarrassment today what happened. So, yeah, I’m not... I'm not surprised to hear it. I should be surprised, but I’m not.
<Chris Berg> <Negative> Last question sir to our farmers. They are a little bit nervous about the tariffs. What do you say to the great farmers here?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> First of all they are great patriots. Just hang in there a little while. We are doing the tariffs, They’re negotiating with us. If you look at Canada, they've shut you out, and you see what’s happening. You look at the European Union, you can’t sell your product in there, or it’s very hard to, and they tax you, and they barrier you. You know, they put these non-monetary barriers up, and they are ridiculous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hang in. We are going to open up the markets like you’ve never seen before. Don’t forget: farmers have been flat lining and even going down over 15 years. We’re going to get it so they go up. That’s what I want. They have to hang in with me just for a little while. I’ve been very successful at doing this stuff.
<Chris Berg> <Positive> God bless you. Thank you.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Now honored to have our guest, Mr. Donald Trump. Mr. Trump is one of the most successful real-estate entrepreneurs in the history of the country.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> He's a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. Mr. Trump, this is what I don't understand: How can a guy that's created -- and by the way, how many jobs have you actually created, do you know? In your life, high-paying jobs, in various companies?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right, I'm trying to figure it out, but it's tens of thousands over the years. I have thousands right now but it's tens of thousands over the years. It's crazy.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> So tens of thousands of high-paying jobs of employees that, and I'm sure The New York Times has been through to try to get every disgruntled employee, but you know --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true, I would imagine so. I haven't heard about it yet, actually. Sort of amazing when you have that many and there haven't been stories. It's sort of incredible.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> That's what I'm saying. I'm sure there will be some disgruntled, maybe down the road, but you would think --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They'll find something.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> They will find somebody. This is what I don't get: Tens of thousands of employees, a guy -- you know, last cycle with Romney was all about job creators and you know, job creators this and job creators that and the guys who create jobs. So hey, we got a guy that's actually created jobs -- real jobs, real careers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> OK. An entrepreneur, a graduate of the Wharton School. And there's a group called Club for Growth, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Club for Growth, it's supposed to be about entrepreneurism and growth. And they have gone out of their way to take attack ads on you in Iowa and are running around bragging about the fact and trying to raise more money that hey, our negative ads on Trump are working and you guys got to pay attention. Hey, over here, donor class, let's go raise some money. What does it say about the state of the institutions of the Republican Party and various things associated with their historical donor/consultant/permanent political class in D.C.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> that a group that purports to be, to back entrepreneurs and really talk about entrepreneurial finance and how you get that, that they would go out of their way to take negative ads on, I would say, maybe except Wendell Willkie, the most successful entrepreneur ever to run and to take a serious run for president of the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, it is pretty sad. And I will tell you that -- and you know about this, Steve -- the head of it is, I guess, a nasty guy. Came up to my office, asked me for a million dollars. I never even heard of the Club for Growth, alright? Which is fine.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That doesn't make it a bad. And what happens is he came up to my office, asked me for a million dollars, and he came through somebody that I know, and I said, 'A million dollars for what? What am I doing?' You know, we could be rich, but we don't have to be stupid. And he said, 'Well, you know, we're the Club for Growth.' And I said --
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> He clearly hadn't been prepped to go in and ask Donald Trump to write a check for a million bucks. You gotta be spring-loaded.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, at least, you know, give me a good answer, right? So I said, 'Why?' And he gave me something. I said, 'Well, write me a letter.' He wrote me a letter asking for a million dollars. I don't know if you've seen it.
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> I've seen the letter.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He sent me a letter asking me for a million dollars. We politely turned him down. We said no. All of a sudden, like, you know --
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> By the way, in the letter -- correct me if I'm wrong -- in the letter, didn't he praise you as, like, the great, one of the greatest entrepreneurs in human history?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was very nice. lt was a very nice letter. But the bottom line is that the important sentence in the letter was, you know, we'd like 1 million dollars. A contribution or a donation or whatever they would call it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So he asked me for a million dollars at a meeting, he asked me for a million dollars, and we very nicely, Steve, turned him down. And immediately thereafter, I think, he had a press conference to announce what a terrible person I am, etc. etc. etc.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he brings up this thing about eminent domain -- and by the way. I'm No. 1 in the polls in Iowa again. So, you know, with this with all the money they spent I'm still No.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> 1 in the polls in Iowa. So I don't know. I don't think that had any impact frankly. But I'm No.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> 1 in Iowa and doing really well there. We have rallies that are incredible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But the interesting thing -- so they use eminent domain. Now, I don't like eminent domain. But if you're going to have a government, and if you're going to build a highway, and if you're going to build a road, and if you're going to build a sewer line, and if you're going to build anything, in order to function you need eminent domain. And in fact, the big pipeline that they're all, the Keystone Pipeline is a huge -- which they are in favor of, and probably you are, and so am I, by the way -- is all eminent domain.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have hundreds of miles, thousands of miles, whatever the length of it is -- you're not going to get any of that land if you don't use eminent domain. You understand. You know, you're going through farms and you're going through areas and you're not going to get that. So they're in favor -- I assume they're in favor, most conservatives are in favor of the Keystone Pipeline.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But let's assume they are. They have a whole chapter, a whole big section, when you read about the Keystone Pipeline, that the Keystone Pipeline -- people put out about eminent domain, what a wonderful thing it is etc. etc. So they're attacking me primarily on eminent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, they can't attack me on jobs, because who's done a better job than me?
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> But they're also -- this is what I don't get. Why are they attacking an entrepreneur when they've got Bernie -- they've got a socialist running -- and then who knows what Hillary Clinton is, right? She's so far left, you know, and they don't attack her, but they're talking, a guy. The other thing, in the subtext, is the, your protectionism is gonna lead us into a great trade war with our trading partners. And by the way we had James Delingpole on earlier with The New York Times article talking about how the Chinese have been lying -- been lying about carbon emissions, about their coal mine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, absolutely.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Every number out of China is a false number. They just make stuff up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, absolutely. No, they're terrible. I mean, look, they're friends of mine. But they're terrible, what they do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I've done tremendous business with China. I've made a lot of money against China. I have the Bank of America building in San Francisco, I own a big chunk of 1290 Avenue of the Americas, one of the biggest office buildings in New York, all through China and against China. I mean, I've done great with China.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They buy apartments, they paid me a fortune. But what they're doing, and I know many of the biggest people in China, they can't believe they get away with it. They cannot believe they get away with it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So what happened with Club for Growth -- so the bottom line is I say no nicely. And they go out and they do this thing. I don't think it had an effect because I'm still No. 1.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I mean, it's like one of those things. But you're right. You know what I find? And this is really sad. The liberals attacked me, but I find that the conservatives attacked me much more viciously.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't understand it. And I've heard it all of my life. If you're a conservative, if you're a Republican, you'll get attacked more viciously by certain conservative groups. I won't even mention the names.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't don't understand it, because most of my views are their views.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Do you think -- well, Politico had this story. Politico has a story -- of course, when I say it's a story, it's all unnamed sources, it's all, it's a guy who talked to a guy who saw your son-in-law at a party talking to another guy who might know a guy. Right? It's like connect the dots. But you're supposed to be going around now begging for money from the Kochs, begging for the money from Paul Singer, begging for a meeting with Sheldon Adelson.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> It appears that that is another thing of the donor class. Somehow the donor class is upset that Donald Trump's not taking their money, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they don't -- I had a guy come up to my office, he wants to give me a fortune. I said, 'I don't take it.' I mean, there's no way I can take it. I'm not, you know, I don't have the PACs and stuff. You know I closed -- we had, I think, 10 or nine or 11, many PACs were organized for me by people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, they just set up a PAC. This whole thing with PACs, Steve, is a scam. I mean, it's really a horrible thing that's going on. And they're controlling all of the candidates, by the way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We wrote legal letters to all of the PACs closing them down. So other than that, we can't take anything. Now, we take little money. People send in $50 and $100, and we take it, because if you sent it back it would be terrible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> How do you send it back with a letter that we don't want your money? You know, these are people that write in and they send seven and a half dollars, $12, you know, and they're invested. I love that. I think it's a great -- that's the way the system should work.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we closed down at least nine PACs where we wrote letters to them. And some of these people are very good people. I'm sure they did the PAC, they did it for the right reasons. And some, I'm sure, are going to live off the PAC.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But what's happening with the candidates is they are totally being, the candidates are totally being controlled by their super PACs. And their super PACs are, you know, I mean some of these things have tremendous money in them, and they're totally controlling -- if you look at Carson, his campaign in Iowa is being run by his super PAC. It's being run by the PAC. And it's not supposed to be.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at Jeb Bush, where he has an event --
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> A hundred million, he's got a $100 million super PAC.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He has an event where the super PAC is in one ballroom and he's in a ballroom right next to it. And there's not supposed to be any coordination.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> This is our buddy Dave Bosse's thing, but we'll come back to that in a second. I just want to get back --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love Dave Bosse, but we've got to find a better way, that when people put up money, let 'em put up money where it's not this way, this whole concept of a super PAC.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> You don't think it's probably, you don't think they have the first -- you don't think they have a freedom-of-speech right to be, if they want to put money up and back a Jeb, if a bunch of guys want to write checks for $100 million dollars and back a Jeb Bush --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You invite them to a campaign, and I think there should be full disclosure that they put up the money and everything else, but they should write it to a campaign. And frankly, the people should be able to spend it. But you know, they're not even --
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> This is not sour grapes? You don't think your super PAC's going to raise a ton of money, this is not sour grapes? You're absolutely, adamantly opposed to this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I wanted to I would have had a super PAC with $300, $400, $500 million dollars in it. I would have had the biggest super PAC ever created. I know everybody! Hey, look, Carl Icahn just endorsed me. Carl Icahn, everybody.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, it's so --
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> The Chinese are not gonna dig that, when you unleash Carl Icahn to be your chief negotiator.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they're not gonna do so well, the Chinese, OK? It's gonna be a different story. They're gonna say, 'What happened?' They're right now dealing with some guy who's a political hack. You know, the Chinese will not be doing so well when I send Carl in. 'Carl, check out the trade deal.'
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> You're gonna share Froman from the trade rep to Carl Icahn/ That's when all hell's gonna to break. Lemme go back to the Politico story --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I am a free trader, by the way. Just so you understand. Because you had mentioned about this Club for Growth or whatever it's called. I am a free trader.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it's got to be fair. China is killing us on trade. They taxing us.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Do you think free trade as a concept has been turned in kind of a fetish by The Wall Street Journal? Where it's just America gives everything away, everybody takes advantage of us on this rubric, free trade. You're saying hey, I'm a free trader, but I'm also a savvy business guy that's worked throughout the world, I know what the deal is.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's gotta be fair. It's gotta be fair. We don't tax them, they tax us. I have friends that are, you know, manufacturers and all.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They can't get their product into China. No way they get their product into China. When they do they get taxed. When China sends their product in, it comes easily and no tax.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's not fair. We have a trade imbalance with China right now of almost $400 billion a year. I mean, Steve, it's $400 billion a year! I will stop all of that.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> The Politico story, I just want to get to this, because I was kind of surprised that it had novelistic tendencies to it, because I don't think there were any named sources. I might be wrong, I apologize, but it was all, you had a son --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I find Politico to be one of the most dishonest organizations I've ever dealt with. They are in my opinion some of the most dishonest people I've ever dealt with. It is not true what they write, generally. I mean, they write some true stuff --
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> By the way, they got some really good guys over there. Mike Allen, the whole team over there. Why do you think, why do you say that? Do you think they're out for you? You think they're out to --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can only tell you as pertains to Trump. I have had more false and dishonest articles from Politico than, I think, anybody else, and that's saying something. I find Politico to be -- to a point where we don't deal with them anymore. Essentially don't deal with them anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You give them stuff and they write it --
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> Give me a specific, be specific. Give me an example where you think --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, l I'll tell you, I'll give you just one little thing. I was in Phoenix we had a tremendous crowd of people. Thousands and thousands.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> I remember -- this is the rally. I remember.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Politico said it was 4,000 people. It was, the next day or the next whatever Bernie Sanders was there. He had a smaller crowd. They said he had 15,000.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They wouldn't -- and then --
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> We had people there. There was a lot more than 4,000 folks there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And let me tell you, the 4,000, in a later story they said, 'We're reducing the 4,000 to 2,000.' Steve, I have pictures of the room. That room was packed. I have pictures of Bernie Sanders' room. He also had a good crowd.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I would say it was a good 25, 30 percent less than us. They were so dishonest. That's one of many things. I find Politico -- and I deal with everybody, including Breitbart, in all fairness, right? And I do like Breitbart.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Breitbart is legit, I mean 100 percent legit. I mean, you guys write -- and if it's not good, you're gonna write about it too! But when it is good, Steve, you're gonna say the truth. I can't get good stories from Politico no matter what I do. The Fox polls came out last night.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I'm doing very well. Let's see how they cover that. Now, I find others to be pretty bad. Actually, the truth is I have found that the political press or the media is unbelievably dishonest overall.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I find Politico, I think I find Politico to be about the worst.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> But there's so many good people over there. Why do you, what is it about it, do you think, when you say it's the worst?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. Maybe they don't like me, I don't know. Maybe they don't like me. I always heard they were liberal-leaning, maybe.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you know, I don't know why they would be --
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> But you think there may be something deeper about that, about the permanent political class or whatever?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think there's something, maybe somebody, maybe the owner of -- do you know who the owner of Politico is?
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> I think it's the family, the Allbritton family I think, down in D.C.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know who likes them a lot is my daughter, and they like here. They love Ivanka and she loves them, she thinks they're great. And I don't ask --
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Well, if you had to pick a Trump to like, she's by far the easiest one to like, right? I don't want to get personal, but she's by far the easiest one to like.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, I agree.
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> You're an acquired taste.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All I can say is, for whatever reason, we get very dishonest coverage from Politico. And I don't think they're doing very well. You know, eventually that catches up with you.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> And Corey Lewandowski and Hope Hicks have sat down with Politico and actually have a discussion?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, many times. Many times. And it just doesn't work out. They have a reporter there named Ben something -- he's terrible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's terrible. He writes so badly and so incorrectly. And you know what? I don't mind a bad story when it's fact, OK? You know, I don't mind. I have -- somebody said, 'You have thin skin.' I said, 'No.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I have a bad story -- I do something good, they give me a bad story, then I get angry. If I do something, you know, that's not so hot, a little bad stuff, and they write about it, that's OK. I fully understand'. That's the way the game is supposed to be played.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But of all of them I find Politico to be the worst.
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> Did you go to Paul Singer, and to Sheldon Adelson, and to the Kochs and to Charles Koch, begging for money?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. Is that what they said?
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Well, the story says that you've been trying to set up meetings with Adelson, you've been trying to set up meetings with Paul Singer, you've been trying to set up meetings with Charles Koch.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Paul Singer I don't know, OK? David Koch invited me to his house a long time ago, during the summer, long before I was running, and he invited me -- that's what they're talking to you. And David Koch, in Palm Beach, has a beautiful house. David's a very nice guy. He invited me to his house.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I went there along with many other people. You know, there were probably 50, 60 people. Some of them were governors and senators, some of them are running in the race. But I didn't go for money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't I didn't invite myself. He invited me. I was in Palm Beach. In fact, I was a little bit upset about it because I couldn't play golf that day, OK? I would have preferred playing golf, as much as I like David.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I went to his house in Palm Beach. They had, you know, people there, different people, different kinds of people. Governors, they had a couple of people that were running, or a few people that were running. But that was an invitation from him to me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't ask to go.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Before we get off this topic -- next hour we're gonna have Mike Huckabee on, but we're also gonna have some Disney employees, we're gonna have a woman that represents this H1-B visa fiasco.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, Mike Huckabee is a terrific guy. The way he stuck up for me with that guy John Harwood, who hopefully his career has been destroyed -- but I think, and you can tell Mike Huckabee I said it, Mike Huckabee is a stand-up man. The way he stood up was so incredible. And then he did it on another television show on Fox, where he stood up for me and he actually said -- you know he talked about my children.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Anybody that could have children like that can't be all bad, as the expression goes, OK? 'Cause I do have good children. Mike Huckabee is a terrific guy, I will tell you, so I hope you give my regards.
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> I will. He's on here also gonna talk about these H1-B visas. What do you think about this situation where you have American companies, particularly technology companies, that are letting go highly trained American IT, blowin' 'em out, to have them train their replacements, and hiring foreign workers. Just generally, what's your sense of that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's no good. It's no good. I mean, we have to do something about it. And you know, people are coming in and they're taking jobs and they're getting paid less money and they're, you know, a lot of things happening, a lot of bad things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, having -- and a lot of it has to do with borders. One of the things I did say, though, and I feel strongly about this: When somebody's going to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Penn, Stanford, all the great, and they graduate -- and not only graduate but do great -- and we throw them out of the country and they can't get back in, I think that's terrible. We've got to keep -- we've got to be able to keep great people in the country. We've got to create, you know, job creators.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> One man went to, I think it was Harvard, there was a story a month ago -- went to Harvard did well, good student, wanted to stay in the country, wasn't allowed to. Went back to his home in India, started up a company. Now it's a very, very successful company with thousands of people. He wanted to do that here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have to be careful of that, Steve. You know, we have to keep our talented people in this country. I think you agree with that. Do you agree with that?
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> I got a tougher -- you know, when two-thirds or three-quarters of the CEOs in Silicon Valley are from South Asia or from Asia, I think, on occasion -- my point is that a country is more like, it's Sessions', a country's more than an economy. We're a civic society. I want see --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, in any event, you have to keep 'em legally.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Yes, yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When people come in, they have to come in legally. I want people to come into the country, Stephen. I've said that. You know, I'm building the wall, we're going to have a border like very few people have.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're gonna have a wall that's gonna be a great wall, it's gonna be be a wall that works. And if you want a wall that works, just ask Israel. That wall works. Somebody said 99.9 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the walls work. You know, when these characters say it doesn't work, they don't know what they're talking about. But we're gonna have a wall. But I still want people to come in, but I want 'em to go through the process, I want 'em to come in legally.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How about all the people that have been waiting to come into the country for years, going through the legal process, and now you have people just walk in like it's, like, off the street. No good.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> You gotta remember, we're Breitbart, we gotta be, we're the know-nothing vulgarians. So we've always got to be to the right of you on this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's OK.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Last thing, last thing. On Saturday Night Live -- by the way, the spots have been hilarious, they actually had to take some down, I think they were so funny. It might have violated campaign law, but here's a question: They're actually now talking about, I think this out there and I think we're reporting this, they're trying to recruit people to go in the audience, pay people to stand up and say you're racist. There's one after the other cultural figures or politicians coming up and saying this should cancel.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> What's your sense of just, and I don't want to give the inside baseball pf what's happening with the cast, but, but are you comfortable that nothing's gonna happen? Are you comfortable that this thing's gonna proceed and be a night of entertainment and comedy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I have a very good relationship with NBC. You know, they renewed The Apprentice for a two-year period and 28 shows, and I couldn't do it because I'm running. And so, you know, I mean I have a very good relationship. And we had the difficulty with Miss Universe, and actually I bought them out and sold the whole thing and made a fantastic deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sold the whole thing to IMG, which is gonna do terrifically with it, I think. So, you know, 'cause it was good, I took that over, was a sick puppy, and made it something really special. But no, oh no, it's gonna proceed. Hey look, honestly, It only makes it hotter.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You understand that, you're in the ratings business now, Steve. Sadly I didn't tweet today because that is how many times -- I was gonna tweet that I was on your show. So your ratings won't be as great because nobody's going to know, maybe. But you'll still get great ratings, I hear you're doing very well.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> By the way, the show the other day, your first show, the story -- we had five stories come out of it -- your story on Wasserman Schultz, at 9 o'clock at night was the No. 1 story in the world on Facebook, trending.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh really? Oh, she's terrible.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> It was on fire.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I watch her, I mean, I think she's just absolutely a terrible --
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> She cuts good deals though. She cut a good deal on TV. By the way --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're right. She is a, I think she's in many respects terrible, in many respects she probably does a very good job. Hillary came out of there, there wasn't anybody gonna ask any bad questions. And when you look at what happened with the Republicans, it was a difference.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Are you going to cut a, beside what Megyn Kelly thinks, are you gonna to cut a better deal for the for the other candidates in dealing with the networks?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know what Megyn Kelly thinks, actually. What does Megan Kelly think?
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> I think she was making the point that, that all the candidates, all you guys are complaining, all of you. I don't think she's singled you out. Did you guys want a foot massage, right, instead of tough questions?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that this, I don't really care that much. I've enjoyed the debates, I've done well in the debates obviously. You know, the new Fox poll came out last night, late last night, and I was in the No. 1 position, I went up, and it showed that I did well with the debate stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I don't really care that much about, other than I would like it to be, like, you know, 72 degrees in the room. Remember when we went to the Reagan Library, it was 100 degrees, it was ridiculous. You need certain, you know, you do need certain parameters. But I really just want to debate and get it done.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, I've enjoyed it, I've enjoyed the process. I've never debated before, professionally. Politicians, that's all they do is they debate. They're whole life is a debate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They talk and they don't get anything done. But I will tell you that I would just like to get it done and, you know, get the debates over with. And I've just enjoyed the process. I don't care that much.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People think I'm negotiating -- I really don't. I did negotiate two hours from three. Even though John Harwood lied when he said oh no, we were never gonna have it be three. It was going to be three.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know that because it was in all the news.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> I like your concept of taking the cash. Why didn't the networks make it -- this is supposed to be a public trust, why don't they just kick it back to the veterans groups. I love that idea.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're making a fortune. They were getting, it was reported that CNN, it was, I think it was $2,000 for 30 seconds.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> I knew they weren't gonna get carried interest on Donald Trump too long before all summer, 'We've gotta renegotiate this. We gotta look at the split here guys.' OK, Mr. Trump --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wanted it to go to the vets, I will say, and I still do. That's where the money should go, 'cause they're making a fortune.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Mr. Trump, thank you so much, I know you're terribly busy. Thank you for joining us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Steve. You take care of yourself. Thanks, bye.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> OK, thank you. Breitbart News Daily, that was Donald Trump.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Nice to talk to you again, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> OK, you surprised me. What a stunner. We saw each other yesterday, and I had no information that you're going to now be moderating a debate on December 27th in Des Moines. How did that come about?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I got a call from the people at Newsmax, which is a great group, and the Ion folks, who I guess they reach 100 million people, a very large television network. And they came to see me and asked whether or not I'd be willing to do it. And it is a little bit of a change and a little bit of something different for me. And I said, yes, I would do it. I want to see what's going on. I mean, we want to get the right person in there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There's no question about that. So I agreed to do it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, one of the responses already, even though the news is basically -- hot off the press -- is from Governor Huntsman, and his campaign spokesperson says "We have declined to participate in the presidential apprentice debate with the Donald. The Republican Party deserves a serious discussion of the issues so voters can choose a leader," and it goes on and on and on. I see that as dis of you.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Do you read it that way?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He has no chance of winning anyway so that's good because we can have more time for the people who are a serious candidates. And the other thing is Governor Huntsman called my office asking for a meeting and I didn't call him back, which I could have and should have. But he called my office asking for a meeting, and I'm sure, being a Mormon, he will absolutely confirm that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So that's one of those things. I don't know about the other candidates, but I think most of them would want to do it. I think it would get high ratings and we have some very serious questions.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I've heard it also reported you're going to endorse afterwards. Just to go back to this Governor Huntsman thing, can we assume he is not getting your endorsement at all if he won't participate in the debate, or shouldn't I make that assumption?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know Governor Huntsman. I like him. He seems to be a nice man. I just don't know him. And frankly I don't like his policy on China because he wants to us roll over. His policy on China is so weak I couldn't possibly endorse him. So he would be one of the people I would have been able to endorse under any circumstances.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> The report you're going to endorse after, tell me what the definition or "after" is. Is that later the night or two or three weeks --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's sometime after the debate. Newt is coming up to see me on Monday morning. But I won't be doing an endorsement before the debate, but after the debate, sometime after the debate, I would be certainly going to do that.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Have you thought about the format? Do you think it will be different or what we're accustomed to?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I really think we should stop with all the formalities. I watch the different moderators get up and explain what the debate is about. It's a waste of time. A debate is a debate. We'll have a debate on the issues. We'll be talking about things like, as an example, OPEC, where nobody is talking about OPEC at the debates, or very little.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> China. India, other countries that are just taking our lurch right out of our mouths, and it's a terrible thing that's happening to this country. So we'll be talking about very important issues and talking about social issues and environmental issues maybe to a lesser extent, but we'll be talking about environmental issues and talking about lots of different things.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But one of the big things I believe and one of the big reasons that everybody comes up to my office is because I do have millions of people that agree with me, that the rest of the world -- you know, it used to be the opposite. But now the rest of the world is just absolutely taking advantage of the United States, and that should not be happening.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> If other candidates follow suit with Governor Huntsman and they will not participate in your debate, is that to you a sign that that is someone you would not endorse? Is that sufficient reason not to endorse that person?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It sounds like it would be on the way. There is no question about that. No, look, News Max is a very powerful organization. Ion is I think the number one private television network and reach over 100 million people. I think it will do very well. I can understand why Jon Huntsman won't partake. I have been a little harsh on him, harsh on his views on China.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I heard him two weeks ago during one of your debates talking about China and it was like a total rollover. And that's not what we need because they're taking the money right out our pockets. And we can't allow that to happen. So it's possible that others might not do it, but it's also possible that everybody will.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We'll probably have a very large audience.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, on Monday, speaker Gingrich is coming to see you. I'm curious -- I'm sure he will discuss the debate with you on Monday. If Governor Romney, the other front-runner, says I'm not going do it for whatever reason, a scheduling conflict or just because I'm busy that night or I have other responsibilities, or that he may join with Governor Huntsman and be a little bit harsher, would that be a reason for you to say, no, to Governor Romney in terms of an endorsement?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't think he would say no. He is a very smart man. He knows, and whether people like it or not, I get very high ratings on television. That's why I have had a show so successful for 12 seasons.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But if you believe that and they won't bother to show up for your debate, and if you believe that you represent the feelings of millions, that wouldn't have any bearing on your thoughts on your endorsement?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think they'll show up. They're smart and know we have a huge audience and will show up. This is a serious debate. Some said, this will be "The Apprentice." The fact is this is a serious debate, and a lot of people will be watching and I do believe they will mostly show up.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What do you think the viewers are going to think -- the debates fit into one particular mold, a certain number of people ask the questions. This is something very different. This is a businessman who is moderating it. How do you think that the American people will view this debate?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think they're going to like it. I think they're going to watch it. I think we're going to ask some questions that haven't been asked, some important question. Little credence has been given to the outside world and what the outside world is doing to this country and to our great country. And I think that's going to be a big part of the debate.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There will be other issues we discuss and we'll discuss all the main issues. But I think we're going to have a large audience and some very good questions.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Let me do the honor of booking. Will you join On the Record after the debate?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely. I wrote beautifully about your in my book, so I have no choice.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I'm told I can't talk about the new book until next week. It comes out next week.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I reveal one thing right now. I speak very well of Greta, OK? That one thing I can reveal. I have just broken something. The publisher must be furious. I say great things about you, and I mean it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Thank you, Donald. Nice to talk to you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you, Greta.
