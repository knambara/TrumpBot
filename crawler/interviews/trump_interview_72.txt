<Steve Hilton> <Positive> Mr. President, great to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> Really appreciate it. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- very much, Steve.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> So much going on. I want to start with your new immigration plan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> Just tell us what you're aiming to achieve with that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, really very simply, we have companies coming in here, as you know, by the dozens and by the hundreds and big ones, car companies, Honda's coming in with $14.5 billion. We have a tremendous amount of very, very top of the line -- and they're coming back. We need people. We need people. And our unemployment now is down to 3.6, and I think it's going a lot lower.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're doing really well. I want to make sure that anybody that comes into our country comes in through merit. You know that very well, I watch your show all the time, and we want it coming in through merit, that's what we have to have. We can't do the others, it's just not possible. And what we want to do is put up a very strong border.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We'll have, by the end of next year, 450 to 500 miles built of the -- of the wall itself and the border wall. And it's imperative -- you know, I read so much where the Democrats like to say you don't need -- we're going to have drones flying around, you have thousands of people, the drone doesn't do a thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So the wall is being built as we speak. We'll have close to 500 miles done by the end of next year, which is really something, and it'll have a big impact. And we're changing laws as rapidly as we can get them through the courts. But you know better than anybody we're fighting a court system. We're fighting the Democrats, the Democrats want open border.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That means crime, and we have great crime statistic but they'd be even better if we didn't have, you know, all of this coming in, between the drugs and many of the wrong people, people that have records -- people that have criminal records. So we're making very sure that those people don't get in. We're taking tremendous numbers of them out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And all of this is in a very comprehensive plan, and it'll go before Congress. It's going to have tremendous Republican support. I hope we can get enough Democrat support to get it passed.
<Steve Hilton> <Neutral> So you think [Inaudible]?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think there's tremendous pressure on many of the Democrats to get something fast, you know, in areas where I won by a lot, and then somebody got in, as they -- you know, in the House -- in particular, in the House, so they draw the House. But there's a lot of seats where they're, you know, very inclined toward me. And this time, I'm running, as opposed to just watching.
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> Right, because a lot of people are saying that what they've heard about this plan is it's designed really to get the republicans all together, and you don't really expect the Democrats to get behind this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, we expect that -- look, you can't say you expect anything. The one thing I will say, they have lousy policy; in many cases, they're lousy politicians. But you know what? They stick together. And you go throughout history, for whatever reason, the Democrats stick together, and the Republicans don't stick the same way as the Democrats do. And I don't say that as a positive, I say that is a negative.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Democrats do stick together. So if they decide, I guess, leadership decides that they don't want to have it, then we're going to have a continuation. But we've gotten very tough on the border. We're letting -- you know, we have a catch and release, where you catch and then you have to, by law, release, or you have to take them to a court.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody has a court system. Who -- what country has a court system where somebody walks into the country? Other countries, they take ---
<Steve Hilton> <Neutral> Does this new plan have details in it that will change that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Tremendous details. It's got a very fair asylum system. The asylum system is a disaster right now. They read a statement handed to them by a lawyer, and then you're supposed to take them in. You know, a lawyer hands them a statement and then they read the statement. They come in and they say, "We fear to be in our country," but then you see, they were the people online.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're carrying the flag of their country, whether it's Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. [Crosstalk] It's a big con, Steve, to be honest with you. It's a disgraceful thing. It could be fixed in 15 minutes, if the Democrats would agree.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> And the big thing about it would be change, in terms of people coming in, whether from wherever in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> But through merit, that's a key point -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The biggest thing is you come in through merit and you come in legally. Two things, you have to come in legally, and you have to come in through merit.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> And one thing that people have speculated about was that it might include E-Verify. Is that going to be in the --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So E-Verify is going to be possibly a part of it. The one problem is E-Verify is so tough that in some cases, like farmers, they're not -- they're not equipped for E-Verify. I mean I'd say that's against Republicans. A lot of the Republicans say you go through an E-Verify. I used it when I built the hotel down the road on Pennsylvania Avenue.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I use a very strong E-Verify system. And we would go through 28 people -- 29, 30 people before we found one that qualified.
<Steve Hilton> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it's a very tough thing to ask a farmer to go through that. So in a certain way, I speak against myself, but you also have to have a world of some practicality.
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> So when people hear that, some of the people -- if you like, your most -- they're described as -- they're restrictions, the people who really want to kind of cut immigration to practically nothing. They hear that and they say, "Well, this plan was written by Jared Kushner, and he's a globalist, and it's all letting people in." What do you say to those?
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> Many of them will be your supporters -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is not a -- yes, see, this is not a globalist plan. I wanted this to be very, very strong. You know, we did judicial reform. You saw what we did there, and a lot of people liked it, both conservative and liberal. That was probably the closest you could say to bipartisan and -- because a lot of it was unfair.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And by the way, it's very tough. We have Chuck Grassley in support of it. Mike Lee is in support of it. You know, some of the strongest conservatives. And at the same time, we have some people with pretty liberal leanings. But this is really not -- this is the least globalist -- all it is, is very simple; strong border -- very strong border, and by that time, we'll have the wall built too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But strong border, and have you have to come in, if you're going to come in through merit. So all these companies that are moving into the United States can use the people where they can help as we say, make America great again, right? So that's what it's all about.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> Great, all right. Let's talk about China, huge, huge issue. I want to start with actually a small but really important part of it, a human part of it. A lot of people watching the farmers, you know, be very worried. Just tell us what you're proposing to do to help the farmers who may be hurt in the short term.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> First of all, I love the farmers, they voted for me. You look at the middle of this country, it's all red, meaning Republican, right? It's all -- and it wasn't for other Republicans, but for me it was. And we have a great relationship. And even now, the farmers are saying look, everybody knows that China has been ripping off the United States, along with almost every other country in all fairness, and we're changing it pretty rapidly, you see what's happening.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the big one is China. We have a trade deficit with China of $500 billion; that's not even conceivable, and we've had it for years. And it goes up and it goes down, but it's from $200 billion to $500 billion and $600 billion -- not million, billion dollars a year -- and somebody had to do something about it. And we pretty much had a deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was a strong deal, and I told President Xi, who's somebody I like a lot, but he's for China and I'm for us, right? But I told him, I said look, this can't be like a 50/50 deal, this has to be a deal -- you are so far ahead from presidents that allowed you to get away. This can't be a 50/50 deal. Anyway, we had a very strong deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We had a good deal, and at the end, they changed it. And I said, that's OK, we're going to tariff their products, and we put a 25 percent tariff on their products. We actually started it about nine months ago, and we've been collecting 25 percent on 50 billion of mostly technology, and then we have 200 billion that it was 10 percent and was supposed to go to 25, but because they were negotiating in what I thought was good faith, I let it be 10 percent and I -- well, two days ago, I made it 25. So they're paying 250 billion at 25 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we're taking in billions of dollars. Now from China's standpoint it's not good, because all of these companies -- many of these companies that are paying the tariff are moving to Vietnam and other places in Asia.
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> I think by the way, that's the point that's lost in all of this. People say well, it's not the Chinese government that's paying the tariffs, and they say well, you're not being straight about that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It hurts China so badly.
<Steve Hilton> <Neutral> Right, and especially that relocation of their supply chain, that's what made it.. --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the bigger relocation is that you're going to have a lot of Americans -- even if I said to 25 percent, or even for 10 percent, you're going to have a lot of American companies now coming out, and they're going to build plants and make this product in the United States, which I like even better.
<Steve Hilton> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, you have to -- look, they go buy from China, in which case, we're taking tariffs. That's OK, not so bad. But a lot of companies already -- you know, they move very fast in Asia, and a lot of these companies that are in China are now moving to all Asian countries where they don't have the tariffs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So really, we have very smart people in this country. They'll be buying from different locations. But with the farmer, because I love the farmer, we are going to be taking in possibly $100 billion, possibly more than that in tariffs. We never took in 10 cents from China. They took advantage of us for many, many years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I blame us, I don't blame them. I don't blame President Xi. I blame all of our presidents, and not just President Obama. You go back a long way. You look at President Clinton, Bush -- everybody; they allowed this to happen, they created a monster. We rebuilt China because they get so much money. So what I'm going to do is out of the $100-plus billion, I said to my farm people, I said to Sonny Perdue, Department of Agriculture -- secretary of Agriculture -- "Sonny, what's the most money that China has ever paid toward agriculture, toward buying food product?" He said $15 billion a number of years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said "Is that the most?" He said "Yes." Some people will say close to [Inaudible] but $15 billion was about the most. I said "Good. I'm going to take $15 billion out of the $100 billion, and I'm going to give that to our farmers." Now, I don't have to give all of that --
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> To buy that product that they're not growing --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. Well, I don't have to give all of it, because they're going to be able to sell at a much lower price. So the difference between where they were and below a price. So maybe if it's a $15 billion amount, they may end up getting six or seven or 10 -- or whatever it is, but they'll be to sell.
<Steve Hilton> <Neutral> So you're compensating?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll tell you an interesting story. I met with farmers about three weeks ago. First of all, they are unbelievable patriots. They said "Sir, we don't want a subsidy. We just want a level playing field. And we also know that we're being killed by these countries -- by many of the countries, not just China." China is just so much bigger than everybody else in terms of the dollar.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I said "What do you mean you don't want subsidy? You have to be kidding." Everybody that comes to see me, they all want a hand out. They're the only ones that don't want it. They don't want it. All they want is a level -- they just want to make a living like they have -- one man said "I've been on my farm, my family, for 150 years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We don't want subsidy. We never had subsidy. We never want it. We just want a level playing field, because nobody can beat us with a level playing field" and that's what I'm doing. But what I'm doing now is I'm helping them along during this period of time at the highest level. Because I said I want to know what's the highest number.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I'm not taking any lower -- [Crosstalk]
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> Well I think that --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So the farmers are going to be in great shape and it's going to start taking place very soon.
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> I was going to ask that exact question. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we're not taking in billions of dollars in tariffs that we never took in. And then the big thing with the tariffs [Inaudible] do I do -- we have $325 billion left over, do I do that at 10 percent or 20 or 25 percent? That's tremendous amounts of money.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> So I just want to ask you what's your end game on this -- on this trade dispute. Is it that you want to sort of settle here? Would you be happy if it was just about the trade? How important is the technology theft, all of that stuff?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So a lot of people won't be happy with this answer, but I'm very happy now. We're taking in billions of dollars. China is obviously not doing well like us. Since I've been here -- since I've been president we've made almost $10 trillion in wealth, and China has lost $10 trillion in wealth. They've lost a tremendous amount.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They've gone -- you know they've had -- you see what's happening. Their economy's not great. Our economy has been fantastic. Because they were catching us, they were going to be bigger than us. If Hillary Clinton became president, China would have been a much bigger economy than us by the end of her term.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And now it's not even going to be close.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> So what do you think of that analysis? A lot of people look at what -- the statements of Chinese leaders, they've written in down in speeches and so on. And they say look, China's got a clear plan. They want to replace the U.S. as the superpower by --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not going to happen -- not going to happen with me.
<Steve Hilton> <Neutral> But do you -- do you believe that that's their intention?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I do. I think that's their intention. Why wouldn't it be? I mean they're very ambitious people, they're very smart. They're great people. It's a great -- it's a great culture, an amazing culture. You know when I had President Xi, I was showing him the Lincoln bedroom in the White House, and I said this was built in 1799. You know I think of that as being really old.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But to him that's like a modern house in China, because they have 3,000 and 4,000 year old places right? But no, it's a great culture. It's an amazing culture with amazing people. And I like him a lot, but he's for China and I'm for us. So there's a little bit of a conflict. [Break in Interview]
<Steve Hilton> <Neutral> Let's move on to another hotspot, Iran, Middle East. Tell us what's -- what your analysis is of what's going on right now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well look, Iran's been a problem for so many years. If you go back, just take a look at all of the conflict that they've caused, and the deal that President Obama made was a horror show, the Iran Nuclear Deal. Because basically it says that in five years from now they're going to have an open path to make nuclear weapons.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We don't need another country with that, and frankly especially them. We don't need it. So he made this terrible deal, paid $150 billion -- paid $1.8 billion in cash. That means cash, like I mean out of your pocket -- cash, green. [Inaudible] hell of a big mess. I don't know if you've ever seen at a casino promotion, a $1 million in $100 bills, it's a lot of area.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What's $1.8 billion like? So he paid all of this money, made a terrible deal. We don't have good inspection rights, we're not even allowed to -- we weren't even allowed to inspect some of the most important sites like military bases, certain things where they would do it, OK. The deal was terrible. When I first came to office, one of the first meetings I had was at the Pentagon with generals, and they were showing me the Middle East and they had 14 or 15 sites where there was nothing but war, problems -- every single one of those sites was instigated by Iran.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was Iran military, it was people paid by Iran, it was -- just, you have no idea. It was just -- I said, "This is terrible." They were so strong. I ended the Iran Nuclear Deal, and actually, I must tell you -- I had no idea it was going to be as strong as it was. It totally -- the country is devastated from the standpoint of the economy --
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> But now you see -- the thing that I think a lot of people are worried about is that they heard what you said in 2016 and liked it, when you said "No more stupid wars." And then they hear these stories about troops and so on --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just don't want them to have nuclear weapons, and they can't be threatening us. And you know, with all of --
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> I just want to -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> With all of everything that's going on, and I'm not one that believes -- you know, I'm not somebody that wants to go in to war, because war hurts economies, war kills people most importantly -- by far most importantly. I think that if you look, when I went to North Korea there were nuclear tests all the time, there were missiles going up all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We had a very rough time there, then we got on, we'll see what happens right now. Right now, I don't think I told them when I left Vietnam where we had the summit, I said to Chairman Kim -- and I think very importantly I said, "Look you're not ready for a deal," because he wanted to get rid of one or two sites, but he has five sites.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I say, "What about the other three sites? That's no good -- if we're going to make a deal, let's make a real deal." But, they haven't had any tests over the last two years -- zero. There's a chart and it shows 24 tests, 22 tests, 18 tests. Then I come, and once I'm there for a little while you know, we went through a pretty rough rhetorical period.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Once I'm there for a little while, no tests, no tests, no tests. So let's see what happens -- [Crosstalk] I will not let Iran have nuclear weapons.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> I want to read you something Lindsey Graham said.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> Your friend, Lindsey Graham.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> He was in the magazine profile, and he reported on a conversation he had with you. He said, you said to him "The trouble with you, Lindsey, is you want to invade everywhere except the places I want to invade."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Wow.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> So my question is, where does he want to invade? But more importantly, where do you want to invade?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to invade, if I have to -- economically we've created a much stronger country economically than when I took it over. When I took it over we were heading south. Our GDP would have been very negative. Regulations didn't allow you to do -- you know, yesterday as you probably saw, I was in Louisiana opening up a $10 billion LNG plant that would've never been approved under another type of administration, never.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And now you have 10,000 people working -- $10 billion they invested. We have tremendous power economically. If I can solve things economically, that's the way I want to --
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> So you -- you can reassure people you're not looking for some kind of conflict in Iran, and --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I'm the one that talks about these wars that are 19 years -- and people are just there. And don't kid yourself, you do have a military industrial complex -- they do like war. You know, [Inaudible]. So I wipe out 100 percent of the caliphate. That doesn't mean you're not going to have these crazy people who run around blowing up stores and blowing up things -- these are seriously ill people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to say "Oh, they're wiped," you know, ISIS. But I wiped out 100 percent of the caliphate. I say, "I want to bring our troops back home," the place went crazy. They want to keep -- you have people here in Washington -- [Crosstalk] They never want to leave. I say, "You know what I'll do? I'll leave a couple of hundred soldiers behind," but if it was up to them they'd bring thousands of soldiers in. Someday people will explain it -- [Crosstalk] -- but you do have -- you do have a group.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they call us the Military-Industrial Complex, they never want to leave they always want to fight. No, I don't want to fight. But you do have situations like Iran, you can't let them have nuclear weapons -- you just can't let that happen.
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> So that's an example, I think of what people liked in 2016, where you didn't come over --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I haven't changed.
<Steve Hilton> <Neutral> -- traditional Republican --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but I haven't changed --
<Steve Hilton> <Neutral> And that's -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Take a look.
<Steve Hilton> <Neutral> That's what we talk about on our show, the [Inaudible] -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I gave them -- I gave the general I said, "Go ahead, you've got one year. See what you can do in Afghanistan." So they fight, and fight, and fight -- but you know we've taken it way down in Afghanistan. I don't know if you've seen that, Steve, we've taken it way down. Now it's a rough place, it's a bad place -- a lot of bad things happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The World Trade Center bombers were sort of -- that's like the Harvard University of terrorism, OK? If you want to be a terrorist you go over there, OK? But now we -- I have not changed. [Break in Interview]
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> The other day, great excitement. You got Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, were going to get together to do a big infrastructure plan. But very soon after that you have Mick Mulvaney your Chief of Staff saying, "No, it's not going to happen." Do you still want that big --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, and if Mick Mulvaney said that, then he has no right to say that. He tells me he didn't say that, and he didn't mean it. He said it's going to be hard to finance. You know, we put $7 trillion in to --
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> But you still want that big infrastructure?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do, but I also think we're being played by the Democrats a little bit, you know I think what they want me to do is say "Well what we'll do is raise taxes," and we'll do this and this and this, and then they'll have a news conference, see, Trump wants to raise taxes. So it's a little bit of a game, but I do believe they're doing that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I'd like to have infrastructure, but I'd like to have it in the right terms. I'd like to have it -- I do want to have it, we have to fix our roads, we have to fix our bridges. I do like it, and it creates a lot of jobs.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> Another example, tax. Tax reform, tax cuts -- we all agree it's an amazing --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's been great.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> -- boost to the economy, and so on. There was one thing missing from it that you talked about that people noticed in 2016, carried interest. You described that as --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I did --
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> -- getting away with murder.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, I hated it --
<Steve Hilton> <Neutral> How -- what -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- but I traded that for two points. In other words, I could have had carried interest out, but you would have paid 23 or 24 instead of 21. And I wanted the 21 percent. I used that as a negotiating chip, and frankly it was a very good deal.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> So is carried interest something you'd still like to do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would like to do it, I will do it, but every time I want to do it they offer me things that are much more valuable than carried interest. It's not -- it's not that much money.
<Steve Hilton> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I got a much [Inaudible].
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> [Inaudible] you really confirmed that idea that you're not the same old Republican.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You're right [Inaudible].
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> [Inaudible]. In 2016 you said "We're going to take care of everyone." People heard that to mean you're for universal coverage. Is that what you mean by that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, no, no, no. No. We have 180 million people right now with great private insurance. We have some great -- I mean, you can't take it away. These people want to take it away. You have tremendous private coverage where they're very happy. What I want to do is work -- Obamacare is a disaster. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was the worst part of Obamacare.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Frankly, except for the one gentleman who decided after campaigning for eight years to repeal and replace, at 2:00 o'clock in the morning, he walked out on the floor and he went thumbs down. We would have had healthcare repealed and replaced. But I'm doing it a different way. We got rid of the individual mandate as part of the tax cuts.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's the most important -- very important thing. We are now coming up with a much better plan than Obamacare. If we take the House back, keep the Senate, keep the presidency, they will have phenomenal healthcare at a fraction of the cost.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> And you're going to have a plan on that before the --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to put out a plan pretty soon, actually.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> All right. Another one. Drain the swamp. We talk about it all the time on our show. Do you think you've done that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think I have, and I think one of the things that's been incredible is this witch hunt that's gone on. And I think it's going on right now, the draining of the swamp, because you look at people, they're running scared. These were bad people. We had tremendously bad people. The witch hunt was a hoax, it was -- and you know, I appreciate what you've said about it. I never made a call to Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There were the --
<Steve Hilton> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- Russia -- if I went to Wisconsin or I went to Michigan -- which I won in both of them -- I didn't call Russia for help and everyone knew it. It was a con job, the whole thing. And it was started by some very bad people.
<Steve Hilton> <Neutral> Can I just ask you something -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that's part of draining the swamp.
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> I have -- I'm just really intrigued by, which is that you're getting hit the whole time for, you know, your being Putin's puppet -- [Crosstalk]
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> OK. It's been reported this year that you personally authorized a cyber attack on Russia around the time of the midterms last year in order to stop them meddling in the midterm elections. Now that's strong action for -- is that true? Did -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'd rather not say that but you can believe that the whole thing happened and it happened during my administration -- [Crosstalk]
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> But why don't you talk about that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because they don't like me to talk -- intelligence say please don't talk -- intelligence. You know, sometimes intelligence is good and sometimes -- you look at Comey and you look at Brennan and you look at Clapper. I'm supposed to believe that intelligence? I never believe that intelligence.
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> But do you see what I'm saying, though? When people say, "Oh, he's just Putin's puppet" --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're right, but -- [Crosstalk]
<Steve Hilton> <Neutral> -- in terms of what you've done --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nobody's been tougher to Russia than me. Take a look at the pipeline what I've done. Take a look at energy. Russia makes their money -- they live off energy. What I've done with energy in this country -- we're now the number one in the world. That wouldn't have happened if Hillary got in or somebody else got in -- probably even if another Republican got in. What we're doing -- the plant that we approved yesterday -- we got them approval so fast.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They've been trying for years to get it built, but we got approvals very quickly for the big LNG. $10 billion, the big LNG plan. What we've done in terms of energy, what we've done in terms of the military, what we've done in terms of Ukraine with -- you know, Obama used to give them pillows and blankets, and we gave them things that they can fight with.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I think Putin would be the first to say that he would have been much better off with Hillary Clinton as president than he is with Trump. We've been much -- and by the way, by the fair, the un-fake news media by because there's so much fake [Inaudible] what's gone on with the media. But they admit that Trump has probably been the toughest president ever with respect to Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Break in Interview]
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> On the swamp, there was one example of it that I just got so angry about, and we talked about it on the show and you saw it too. Obama's head of cyber security then becomes a lobbyist on cyber security of Huawei. I mean -- and that's all perfectly above board. He declared it. There's nothing you can do about it. Don't you think that should just not be allowed?
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> That you shouldn't be allowed to lobby for a foreign government?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I would be all for that. I think it should be a lifetime ban. You know some people say five years. We're putting in for five years -- you know it's very hard because the same people that are working in government, they work in government and then they go and they take these unbelievable jobs. That happens with me too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They -- you know they're part of your campaign. All of the sudden they're working with these big -- and it's a very tough thing. You know there's a very fine line, but I would love to see a five year ban but I'd actually like to see a lifetime ban. Look at Joe Biden --
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> They've been lobbying for foreign governments. You see the foreign governments, they have ambassadors and embassies. Why did [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] Biden, he calls them and says "Don't you dare persecute, if you don't fire this prosecutor" -- The prosecutor was after his son. Then he said "If you fire the prosecutor, you'll be OK. And if you don't fire the prosecutor, we're not giving you $2 billion in loan guarantees," or whatever he was supposed to give.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Can you imagine if I did that?
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> Well, I never mind that. Look at the -- again, we reported it, but the relationship with China.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> 100 percent.
<Steve Hilton> <Neutral> I mean what's that -- you know I call him Joe China.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know there's a reason --
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> Don't you think that should be investigated? That financial connection -- the Chinese government putting billions of dollars into Biden's family business.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> 100 percent. It's a disgrace. And then he says China's not a competitor of ours. China is a massive competitor of ours. They want to take over the world. OK? They have China 2020 -- you know they have 2025. Right, China 25. That means that in six years -- now, I said to President Xi that's very insulting because it's not going to happen, and it's very insulting to me, and you notice they don't use that anymore?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They don't use it. It was very insulting to me, because it's not going to happen. Not with me. But with Biden, he says they're not a competitor. Then they take a lot of money from China. And I'll tell you what, if there's one reason outside of the normal reasons that the deal, so far, hasn't gone through -- I think it will because they're getting killed with the tariffs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> China's getting totally killed. I told you, companies are leaving, massive amounts, because of the tariffs. They're getting hurt badly. But if there's one reason that China -- and you understand what I'm going to say -- didn't make that deal, it's because they're hoping that in 16 months Donald Trump will be defeated by anyone of those Democrats, and they'll go back to making $500 billion a year.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I understand that. I mean I could clearly frankly understand -- because it's not going to happen with me. What we're doing to China -- I saw somebody this morning on one of their shows actually who -- I -- I've never been a big fan, said that this is the first time in 50 years that anybody from the west has ever taken on China. [Break in Interview]
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> I'm interested in a couple of the things that you've said about 2020, some of the candidates. We've got the town hall with Pete Buttigieg --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Boot, edge, edge.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> -- there you go -- this weekend. Just one thing on him, putting aside policy disagreements, don't you think it's just great to see the fact that you've got a guy there on the stage with his husband, and it's normal? It's not --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's absolutely fine. I do.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> But it's a -- isn't it a sign of great process in the country, that that's just --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I think it's great. I think that's something that perhaps some people will have a problem with. I have no problem with it whatsoever. I think it's good. I think he runs a city that doesn't do perfectly, and I think he's had -- you know, it's sort of interesting because he's running for the president of the United States as a mayor.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you could say that I ran for president of the United States, and I was never in politics before, right? But I had a good life, and I had successful life. And we're doing good, but no, I think it's -- I think, in one way, it's terrific, absolutely.
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> But looking to the elections, obviously, the economy is very strong, no one can argue with that. But people say, "Well, the problem is the president won't be able to stick to that message. He's always going off on some other message, and he's not really been a focus on that. And that's what you got wrong in the midterms," by not focusing on the economy.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> Do you accept that criticism?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think the thing with the midterms was, number one, I wasn't running. And even though I said, "Pretend I'm running," -- but you know, it's different when you're running. And I have tremendous poll numbers now. You see that. I mean my poll numbers are great because the economy is so good. And I actually do a lot about the economy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't get credit for that, you know. But you can always say we have the greatest economy. If I stood in front of 25,000 people, because you would say nobody's ever, in the history of politics, gotten the crowd [Inaudible]. OK, that's one thing. And we have thousands outside, you know, we go help people and have rallies, and you know, we'll have -- we'll fill up stadiums, 25,000 people and 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 people standing outside.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We put big screens. If I stood there and talked about the economy for that long a period -- let's say, the economy's great, unemployment's low, we're doing wonderful, we have the most number of people -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- they'd start falling asleep. [Break in Interview]
<Steve Hilton> <Neutral> One last question.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> You mentioned, just now, watching someone on the morning show. And that's one of the things you get hit for a lot, about how you do the job. They say, "He's up in the residence all morning, watching TV, rage tweeting at morning shows. He's not focusing on the job." What's your response to that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I have way over 100 million people on the various things -- much more than that, but over 100 million people between Twitter, and Facebook, and Instagram and all of it, right? It's a tremendous communication for me, because I have so many people. When people do a book they beg me, please, give me -- because it goes to be a best selling book.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If there's somebody interesting I like to watch it. I watch much less television. You know, they like to make me look like I'm -- I'm up early in the morning, I'm in the Oval Office early, I leave late --
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> So it's not true when they say that you're up in the residence --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No it's all -- no, they do that as a form of disparagement. I was about three weeks ago with some very big business men. I was in the Oval Office negotiating and we have a small screen, a television. And they noticed that they were saying Donald Trump is up now, he's steaming, he's angry. He's up in the residence.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I said, "See that folks? I'm in the Oval Office."
<Steve Hilton> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm a very calm person, too. You know, they like to make me like I'm raging, I'm like the raging bull -- I'm a raging person.
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> But the tweets are a bit raging every now and again --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, but sometimes you do that for a reason. I mean, you know the tweets seem to work. And you know it's --
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> I'm not knocking the tweets, I was just --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but I have so many politicians, could you possibly tweet a certain bill that's going to be voted on --
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> Right, right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have destroyed bills that were going to be voted on that were bad, and I've gotten bills passed that were good by using Twitter. And Twitter is really a typewriter for me. It's really not Twitter -- it's -- Twitter goes on television, or if they have breaking news, I'll tweet, I'll say "Watch this -- boom." I did the Golan Heights to Israel, and I put it out on Twitter.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I put out a news release nobody's even going to see it. Today's Huawei, I put it out on Twitter, people see. That's not to build Twitter. That's to say that as soon as it goes out, it goes on television, it goes on Facebook, it goes all over the place and it's instant -- it really is, to me it's a modern way to communicate.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> But in terms of how you use your time, that's really what I was getting at. They say, well the [Inaudible] books, doesn't have these ritual 15 minute meetings. I would just love to hear you talk about what is your approach to getting the job done, if it's not that traditional thing how do you see it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I read a lot. If I find somebody on television that I want to watch, I try and watch it, because I feel you can learn a lot from a good interview with somebody for 10 or 15 minutes, I really do. I will read briefings. They like to disparage, you know? They like to say, "Well he doesn't read his briefings," because I think I've done phenomenally if you look at my policy outside of the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think maybe in certain ways, maybe that's got to be the strongest -- right now it's the economy. But I think maybe the strongest -- look, NATO is ripping us off. I got the NATO countries, we're defending them, to put up $100 billion more, and the secretary of -- General of NATO, Stoltenberg -- great guy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's my biggest fan, because NATO is going down like this, it was going down the funding. And now it went down -- as soon as I got in, I raised $100 billion from NATO countries. Where they're putting up we're paying for it. We're paying for a large percentage -- it's very unfair. We're treated unfairly throughout the world, because we've had people that didn't protect our country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm protecting our country, but they like to disparage. They say, "Oh he's up in his room," when I'm in the office. Or "He's there," I don't think anybody works -- and it's not work to me, I love doing it. So I'm not saying work, but I don't think anybody works the long hours that I work. I don't think anybody works as hard, but I don't consider it work because I love doing it. And you know why I love it, Steve?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In this case -- I used to love it -- I used to love putting up buildings and doing what I did, or doing "The Apprentice," or whatever I was doing. But -- and if you don't love it by the way, you can never do it well. You know that because you love what you do. But I like it in this case, because I'm doing a lot for people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm doing a lot for people. If you look at taxes have gone down, so many different changes -- look at the jobs --
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> Well as a specific example of that, I was just talking to the HHS Secretary, Alex Azar, he literally said to me, you're just on his case the whole time about prescription drug prices --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to bring the prices down --
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> -- him on the detail. I think that's part of the story that people don't see.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we had the first year in 51 years where drug prices came down this year. First time in 51 years. No, we're doing a lot of good for people. I mean, look at jobs, look at the economy. I mean, people are making more money than they ever have. We have more people working today than ever worked in the history of the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I love what I'm doing.
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> There's another book coming out, Fire and Fury 2. I don't know what the title is, it's going to be all over again, all this kind of stuff. What do you make of that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I never even did an interview with these -- I don't even know who the person is. I did an interview with that person -- I mean, there are many books. Books come out every week. But I've never even heard the book. You're telling me now -- I never did an interview with -- other than years ago for a magazine, and he actually wrote a nice [Inaudible] about me. It's a big con job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's really like the fake news, it's really terrible. I've had good books and bad books. But you're telling me a book is coming out, they don't even interview me for the book. Nobody has done the job that we've done in the first two and a half years of a presidency, nobody. Nobody has accomplished what we've accomplished.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you look at a list, so many things, even right to try, where a person's very sick and they have the right now to use medicines that may or may not work that we do. So many different things that we've done.
<Steve Hilton> <Negative> Yes, well this is one of the things I love to talk about on my show, because the detail of the policies just never get time for it. But you know what? I think your people are actually going to kill me if I don't stop now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don't worry about that, that won't happen.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> The time we've had, I really appreciate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a great honor. I appreciate your show, and I appreciate you; and I watch it all the time and I really -- really -- I enjoyed the interview.
<Steve Hilton> <Positive> Thank you, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi, Bob. How are you? Good. Good. Thank you. Thank you so much for calling. I really appreciate it. Absolutely. Absolutely. What's going on?
<Bob Davis> <Positive> So we're working on, you know, China stories. That's basically all I've done this past year. First, I just wanted to say I'm taping this to make sure I don't screw up the quotes and so on. That OK with you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, sure. Go ahead.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> OK. So, I mean, to start with, so this is something you campaigned on, being tough on China. It's been going on for two years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, China and others, because we –
<Bob Davis> <Positive> Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We've been -- we've been taken advantage of by many countries all over the world, not China. The EU has been a disaster for the United States. Mexico and Canada have been, you know, very, very hard on the United States. NAFTA was one of the worst trade deals ever made.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> Right, right. But this -- we're focusing this one on China.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I'm just saying but it's not just China. It's others also. But that's OK, I understand. Go ahead, Bob.
<Bob Davis> <Negative> OK. So from this two-year period -- you've been negotiating now with China for two years. What do you take away? What's the sort of main takeaway for you from this big trade fight in these negotiations that you've had with President Xi and with the rest of the -- you know, the Chinese government over these issues?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's been such a terrible one-way street with China having -- with a deficit of at a minimum $375 billion a year, and it's for a long time. But we have literally helped rebuild China with the kind of money that we lose on trade, and I just decided about a year ago that I just won't do that. I respect President Xi. As you probably hear, I have a very good relationship with him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I spoke to him a week ago. We're going to be meeting. We'll see if something can happen.
<Bob Davis> <Neutral> What can you say about the possibility of a deal?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It all began with the World Trade Organization, a disaster. A disaster. I would actually say that was perhaps -- I say NAFTA was the worst trade deal ever made. I would say only -- only -- challenged by the WTO. That has been -- if you look at China, China's ascension was the day that the WTO was signed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a one-sided deal. They were treated as a -- you know, as a growing country, as a -- what would you say? How would you say that?
<Bob Davis> <Neutral> Developing country. Developing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Developing. A developing nation. And no -- and it's never come off. They still -- it's ridiculous. The World Trade Organization is absolutely unfair to the United States, and they're going to have to change their ways. They're going to have to change.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> But what about –
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But that's when China ascended. That's when China -- you can look at -- they were -- they were flatlining for many years, and then they went like a rocket ship up the day they signed the World Trade –
<Bob Davis> <Positive> Do you think that -- I know the Chinese -- the Chinese No. 1 goal in this G-20 is to get you to delay or suspend that 25 percent on January 1. Do you -- are you willing to do that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it would be highly unlikely.
<Bob Davis> <Neutral> And why is that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why shouldn't they -- why shouldn't China rip off the United States if we have people allowing that to happen? And whether it was President Obama or preceding presidents, they all allowed it to happen. You know, we don't even have a deal with -- I don't know if you know. We really don't have a deal with China.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They do whatever they want.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> Yeah, but that's the whole point, though, right? I mean, whether you can craft a deal with China. Do you think that's possible?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No, no, no. What I say is they did whatever they wanted and people let them do that. As opposed –
<Bob Davis> <Positive> Oh, no, I -- right, right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> As opposed to stop it.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> Yeah, no, I get that. But again, you know, you're president. You're able -- you know, it's your turn, basically. So, I mean, there –
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So but what I'm saying is that I am very happy with what's going on right now. We've only used a small portion of what we have to use because I have another $267 billion to go if I want, and then I'm also able to raise interest rates. And we have money that is pouring right now, pouring –
<Bob Davis> <Negative> When you say interest rates, do you mean -- do you mean tariffs, as opposed to interest rates?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm sorry, the rate, the 25 percent rate –
<Bob Davis> <Positive> Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Without even doing any more.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have money that is pouring into our treasury right now, and on January 1 it'll become much more so. And here's the story: If we don't make a deal, then I'm going to put the $200 -- and it's really $67 -- billion additional on at an interest rate between 10 and 25 depending.
<Bob Davis> <Neutral> Including even iPhones and laptops and things that people would know?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Maybe. Maybe. Depends on what the rate is. I mean, I can make it 10 percent and people could stand that very easily. But if you read that recent poll that came out, we're only being -- most of this is being -- the brunt of it is being paid by China. You saw that.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> Right. Right. I mean, well, you know –
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> On the tariffs.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> It depends, like, who –
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look, I happen to be a tariff person.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I happen to be a tariff person because I'm a smart person, OK? We have been ripped off so badly by people coming in and stealing our wealth. The steel industry has been rebuilt in a period of a year because of what I've done. We have a vibrant steel industry again, and soon it'll be very vibrant. You know, they're building plants all over the country because I put steel -- because I put tariffs, 25 percent tariffs, on dumping steel.
<Bob Davis> <Negative> Right. Right. Would you -- would you think -- what do you advise -- what do you advise U.S. business to do, given that they are now faced with the tariffs they are, tariffs go up on January 1? You're talking about the rest of the imports going to 10 percent –
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, what I'd advise is for them to build factories in the United States and to make the product here. And they have a lot of other alternatives. But if you look, there's been no increase in inflation despite the tariffs, so all of these little -- all of the things you heard about, Bob, are -- have turned out to be false.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're -- we're taking in billions of dollars. We're creating tremendous numbers of jobs. Like in the steel industry, we were -- we were almost out of the business and now we have -- you know, thousands of jobs are being created. And we're going to have our own steel industry, which is a very important industry.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You don't want to be -- you know, you don't want to be buying your steel from China, let me put it that way. But –
<Bob Davis> <Negative> Let me ask you also, I mean, so you gave advice to the -- to U.S. business. What advice would you give to the Chinese who are trying to decide how to deal with you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Make a fair deal. The only deal that would really be acceptable to me -- other than obviously we have to do something on the theft of intellectual property, right -- but the only deal would be China has to open up their country to competition from the United States. As far as other countries are concerned, that's up to them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm interested in the United States. They have to open up China to the United States. Otherwise, I don't see a deal being made. And if it's not made, we will be taking in billions and billions of dollars.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And what will happen, Bob, is a lot of the things we buy from China we're going to make in this country.
<Sarah Huckabee Sanders> <Positive> Hey, Bob. This is Sarah. We got to make this the last question.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Go ahead, Bob.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> OK. Let me run one by you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She always interrupts me in the middle of something.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> [Laughs] I can tell you like talking about this stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. I just can't do it enough.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> You like -- any comment on the -- GM shutting its plants, laying off employees?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah. I think GM ought to stop making cars in China and make them here. And I think it was a big mistake for GM to do that. I think they forgot where they came from.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> Uh-huh. Anything that you plan to do? Is there anything you can do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's one plant in Ohio. But I love Ohio. And I told them: You're playing around with the wrong person. And Ohio wasn't properly represented by their Democrat senator, Senator Brown, because he didn't get the point across. But we will all together get the point across to General Motors . And they better damn well open up a new plant there very quickly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, they haven't closed -- they're reallocating it, it's called. And I said, because their Cruze car isn't selling, OK? They make a car called Chevy Cruze. And it's not selling well. So I said: Then put a car that is selling well in there but get it open fast.
<Bob Davis> <Neutral> And when you say, “you said,” did you have a talk with -- who were you talking with?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I spoke with Mary Barra, the head of General Motors last night. I said: I heard you're closing your plant. It's not going to be closed for long, I hope, Mary, because if it is you've got a problem.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> Uh-huh. OK. And did she answer you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She just sort of said we're trying to get something -- you know, it's being reallocated. You understand that, right?
<Bob Davis> <Positive> Yeah. Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So she told me: The car's not selling. I said, so maybe you got to make a better car.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> Mmm hmm. And also –
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that has nothing to do with tariffs, you know. That has nothing –
<Bob Davis> <Positive> No, no, no. I know. It's just the -- we don't get a chance to –
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, a lot of times people like to blame tariffs when they're doing badly. So they're doing badly. And they say, oh, let's blame tariffs, you know, because they don't know what they're doing. So they're doing badly. And they'll say: Let's blame tariffs. Why not? [Laughs]
<Bob Davis> <Neutral> Right. Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, anyway. No, it had nothing to do with tariffs.
<Bob Davis> <Negative> And if I could throw another one in there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Bob Davis> <Negative> I mean, you have said that you thought that Jay Powell would be a low -- a low-rate person. Why did you get that impression? I mean, you would have thought –
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, let's see what happens with Jay Powell. So far, I can tell you -- I said it the other day, and I'll say it again: I think the Fed right now is a much bigger problem than China. I think it's -- I think it's incorrect what they're doing. I don't like what they're doing. I don't like the $50 billion. I don't like what they're doing in terms of interest rates.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they're not being accommodative at all. And I'm doing trade deals, and they're great trade deals, but the Fed is not helping. Whereas, China, you know, they have automatic accommodation. And even the EU, which we're going after now, you know, for a fair deal -- because that's been almost as bad as China, just smaller.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, the only difference between the EU and China is size. They treat us very badly. They don't take our farm products. They don't take our cars. They don't take anything. And yet, we give them a lot. They're up $151 billion on the United States every year for years. And the EU was set up in order to hurt the United States on trade.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> Are you -- are you planning to meet, then, at the G-20 with Juncker? Do you think there -- would that –
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Maybe. Look, he knows where I stand. He's going to come -- you know, he came to see me. He didn't care until I said I was going to tax his cars. And then the next day he was there at about 7:00 in the morning.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> Huh. Do you think you will go ahead with the tariffs on the cars?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If they don't make a fair deal with us, I'd do it in about 12 minutes.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> Huh.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It depends whether or not they make a fair deal. So far they're -- you know, we talk about it. So far they're talking about a deal, but it's all talk. And I'm not going to make the kind of deal that the U.K. made, believe me.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> What do you want them to do?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Huh?
<Bob Davis> <Positive> What would you like them to do? What would be a fair deal?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A fair deal is that they have to take down their barriers and that they have to start -- stop charging us massive taxes for our people -- and also their standards. For instance, they'll create a standard -- we'll make a product, and they'll make a standard that's different than the product, lower or higher.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it's different. So then our product can't come into the EU. They do that all the time, like with medical equipment, OK? But they have to take down their barriers and they have to take off the taxes. And, frankly, they have to start treating our companies better, because they sue all of our companies for billions and billions of dollars.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're picking up all this money from our companies. We should be the ones to sue our companies. All right, Bob?
<Bob Davis> <Positive> All right. Thank you so much. Oh, by the way, one personal thing. I think –
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Bob, here's the bottom -- here's the bottom line: We're going to make a great deal with China. And everybody hopefully will be very happy, including China. But we're going to make a deal with China that's going to be representative of the United States the way it used to be.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> Huh.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A long -- that was a long time ago. Longer than you would remember.
<Bob Davis> <Neutral> If I can just throw in one personal thing. I'm from Queens.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good.
<Bob Davis> <Neutral> My stepmother, I think, knew your family. The Lazoffs. they lived down the street from you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, yeah. Sure. Midland Parkway.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> So, anyway, I just thought I'd end there. Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's exactly true. That's good. Is she around? Still around?
<Bob Davis> <Positive> Yeah, yeah. She's, like, 85 or so.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I know the name very well. And very friendly. That's good. Now I know I'm going to get a good story. Otherwise, I'm going to complain to -- I'll complain to her.
<Bob Davis> <Positive> [Laughs]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, we're going to do -- we're going to do a good job for our country, Bob. That's what I'm here for, OK?
<Bob Davis> <Positive> All right. Thanks very much for your time. I appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thanks, Bob. Say hello.
<Brian Bennett> <Positive> Hi, Mr. President. Thank you for talking to me today.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good. I'll try and get a good cover for a change. That's nice.
<Brian Bennett> <Positive> We've been talking to a lot of your supporters. And we're trying to explain to readers the different reasons people support you, and that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We are doing a lot of good things, I think. You know, we just had a great judge put on the Supreme Court and a lot of people would have said that was not going to happen. Now that's two of them in less than two years, substantially less than two years. That was my honor.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But all of the things that are happening have been really great, including jobs and regulations, everything. The market's had a little bit of an off day, but I understand why that is. That's easy to figure.
<Brian Bennett> <Positive> Do you think that you've changed the Republican Party permanently?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't think of it that way, Brian. I mean I really like much of what the Republicans were doing. I think we have brought a lot of people in. You know. The party is a much bigger party now, and it's like really a party for the working men and women in this country, in addition to plenty of others.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I guess in the true sense, it has been changed, and I think that's why I won an election nobody else would have won. If you look at the places I've won, nobody else would have won those places. And a lot of that is because of my views which are very strongly held.
<Brian Bennett> <Neutral> There are hundreds of Republican politicians out there, what do you think they can learn from you, the things you say, your policies and the way you say it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I think for one thing we have to fight harder for our country. And I think we have to put America first. We, people have not been doing that. They've been doing these horrible trade deals. You know we just renegotiated and there were tough negotiations. But NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made. We lost thousands of factories and plants and jobs, millions of jobs, millions and millions of jobs. And it was a horrible deal
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's why I refused to call the new deal anything to do with NAFTA, you know the USMCA. And you know it's a deal that will make it very hard for people, for companies to move out of the United States because if they move out of the United States there's going to be a very big penalty to pay. And you know we were losing our companies and therefore we were losing our jobs. People were being fired. And that was something that I refuse to allow to happen. That's a big difference right there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think more than anything else, it's putting America first. And you know, I'm proud of our country. I want to be proud of our country. So many things were happening so bad so foolish that, you know, it's just unacceptable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Our trade deals were horrible and frankly our military deals were horrible. We're protecting wealthy countries and not being reimbursed for it. It's ridiculous. You look at our military costs and they're ten times what other large countries are, more than ten times. And yet because we are protecting half of the world and much of that are wealthy countries and we're not being reimbursed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well we are going to start being reimbursed. You know, why should we be protecting countries of massive wealth and not be reimbursed for this military protection? That was not a very Republican thing to say, but it wasn't a very Democrat thing to say either. It was neither. But I say it. And it's happening, as you see.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You see what's happening. NAFTA if you look at what we did with NAFTA but if you take a look at NATO. Because NAFTA now is gone, you know, it has to be approved by the Senate, but we have to have good bipartisan, you see that. But if you take a look at NATO, last year they paid $44 billion more. I said you're going to have to pay folks. Because payments were going down everyday for 10 years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You could speak to Secretary General Stoltenberg. And last year I went in, I said, "Look, you're either going to pay or you're going to have a problem." And they paid $44 billion more. This year it's the same thing. They're paying billions more. But it's still unfair, NATO. Because we're paying for 80% the cost of NATO in order to protect Europe and on top of everything else Europe takes advantage of us on trade.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's a mouthful, Brian, but you understand what I'm saying. I've had people say to me, I've had generals say to me, "Sir, we do this for trade." I said, really? We lost $151 billion with the European nations, you know the union, but you add those nations together which are largely the same, and we lost because they have trade barriers, they have tremendous tariffs. And they took advantage of our country and they're not going to be able to do that any more.
<Brian Bennett> <Negative> We talked to supporters in Missouri, in Pennsylvania, in West Virginia, we heard from some people who love the way you talk, some of your harsh attack lines that you use, and we found people who love your policies but are uncomfortable with the harsh ways that you talk. How do you thread the line of different types of people that support you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, if I don't talk that way, I'm never going to get the point across and I'm never going to be able to make the deal. There is nothing nice about telling a country that we aren't going to allow you to make $151 billion against the American taxpayer.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There is nothing nice in telling China that we are not going to allow you to take 500 billion dollars a year out of the United States. [Note: According to figures published by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the U.S. goods and services trade deficit with China in 2017 was $335.4 billion.]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We just can't do it. And I have a great relationship with President Xi. But we can't allow this to happen. There is nothing nice about saying to Saudi Arabia: "You have to pay for military protection." We're not going to do this unless, you know it's ridiculous, we're spending money and they're paying for just a fraction of the cost of the military. Now I can say it nicely or I can say it less than nicely. The bottom line is a lot of people agree with me. Oftentimes, you can't be overly nice.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, our politicians have been nice for many years, for decades. And look what's happened. Look what I've done with North Korea. When I came in, the day before I came in, if you look, we were going to war with North Korea. President Obama said it was by far his biggest problem. Of course he gave me a lot of problems with a lot of things including Iran.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look at Iran. They're a weakened nation now. Look at them after what I did. They are a weakened nation. They have riots all over, in every city, the people are rioting. They are pulling back military. They have a lot of problems. The day before I came in, Iran was taking over the Middle East, it was just a question of which week will it be. Now they have everything they do to save themselves.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at North Korea. We were going to war with North Korea before I came in. That was going to be a war. President Obama said it was by far his biggest problem. That was going to be a major war. Millions of people would have been killed. Now, and the media gives me no credit for it, and that's fine because I'm used to them. Obviously they don't mean as much as I used to think. I used to think they meant a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But now, my relationships with Kim Jong-un are excellent. We are having great dialogue. Mike Pompeo just left yesterday and they had a great conversation, a great five hour meeting and conversation, setting up another meeting. But the bottom line is: there's no missiles going off, there's no nuclear testing, there's no rockets. We got our hostages back, Brian, and we're getting our remains back.
<Brian Bennett> <Positive> When you leave office what do you think the Republican Party looks like?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then the media, and then the media says, "Why aren't you going faster?" Well, I left there three months ago. And these other presidents have been negotiating 30 years on this stuff. And more. But 30 years on the dangerous things, on the things of danger, to put it nicer. So, I've done North Korea, and that's moving along very nicely. The only thing they can say is, 'Oh, why isn't it moving faster?'
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's been three months, Brian. Three months. Why isn't it moving faster? That's the only thing they can say. Or they say something else: 'He met.' I met. Obama paid 1.8 billion and he gave 150 billion. With me they say, 'He met.' That was like, you know, this major concession. That's not a concession. I met. I'm glad I met. By meeting, we now have a civil relationship and even a good relationship. So that's just two of many things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll give you and example: Idlib. I met with a person at a big rally in Ohio. It was a person backstage where various people were saying hello. And a woman came up. She was Syrian. She said, 'Sir,' -- this is five weeks ago – she said, 'Sir, my sister lives in Idlib province and sir she is going to be killed. Russia, Iran and Syria are surrounding it and they are going in and they are going to kill the 3 million people or a million people but tremendous amounts of people. They're going to kill my sister and they're going to kill my family.'
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I said, 'That won't happen.' But I wasn't that aware of it. I got back and I read an article in, of all places, the New York Times, the failing New York Times, and I read an article about Idlib being surrounded by Russian troops with Iranians and with Syrians. And they were in fact going to go in. Take a look at the tweet I put out at that time. [https://media-cdn.factba.se/realdonaldtrump-twitter/1036740691211284480.jpg]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Guess what, they didn't do it. They're still talking. I said just you got to be surgical. You can't blow up every building and kill millions of people to get 35,000 terrorists. And look what happened, Brian. They didn't do it. I said, 'You better not do it.' And I'm not saying they shouldn't get the terrorists, I'm saying you can't kill 3 million people in order to get, or a million people, in order to get 35,000 terrorists. You can't do it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, you know, that happened. I was the one that got it stopped. And then Turkey also got involved after I stopped it. I stopped it. They were going to go in the next day. And they stopped. Totally. Cold.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now they have the town surrounded and they're doing much more surgical work. And that's the way it should be done if you want to get the terrorists. You can't kill millions of people. You just can't do it. It's unacceptable. So what I've done, nobody's done what I've done. Nobody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I say it myself because the media will never say it. But the people get it. The people understand it. And in a way it shocks me 'cause I always gave too much credit to the media. Because in theory, based on media, I shouldn't have gotten 306 electoral college votes. I shouldn't have got it. Because it's really staged for the Democrats to win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But the people get it. It's really amazing to see. It's really a beautiful thing to see. And one of the advantages I have -- like I'm going to a rally right now, you know, I would have canceled it because of the hurricane but there are thousands of people lined up yesterday to get to a rally that takes place at 7 o'clock tonight in Pennsylvania -- but one of the assets I have is I'm able to speak to people in tremendous numbers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have thousands of people lined up outside right now trying to get in. But I'm able to speak to them and often times it's on live television, you understand. So I'm able to get my word out. I wish I could speak to you more often. I think I would have gotten -- instead of having 90 percent bad TIME covers, I would have had 60 percent good Time covers.
<Brian Bennett> <Neutral> Let's talk more often. I think we should.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's always an honor to be in your magazine.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hello, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, Donald, last night, it was a whopping victory, 20 points in New Hampshire. It's more fun to win, isn't it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I love winning. It was a great win. It was a great victory. We love it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Why do you think that on the Democratic side of the aisle that Hillary Clinton got -- she got clobbered by Bernie Sanders, 22 points over there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes it was surprising to see. And, you know, we are dealing with a socialist, perhaps even a communist. I listen to his speech last night. That was beyond socialism. So I don't know what's going on over there. That was a pretty big victory for him.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> One of your hometown newspapers, "The Daily News," Mort Zuckerman owns that and they had a pretty hostile cover front page to you. What's up with that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I know him. He's an insecure guy. He's got a losing newspaper. He tried to sell it for the last two years. He can't get anybody to give him a dollar for it. It's a piece of garbage. And they put me on the cover every time they can. They always put me on the cover to try and sell the newspapers. It's going to fold up. I can't imagine anybody buying it. I mean, he's literally been begging people to buy it. But he's just an insecure guy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's a loser.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Governor Chris Christie, you spoke last night. You had a long conversation. I assume that he congratulated you on your victory. What else did he tell you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I just spoke to him a little while ago, again. And he spoke to me last night. And, you know, he's a friend of mine. He's a good guy? He is a tough cookie.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Also down in South Carolina, that's the next spot you are going. There is a former 2012 Romney campaign staff or consultant who has now got this Super PAC and it's taking a direct aim at you. Going up at the air. Your response to that Super PAC? They're aiming at you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, a lot of people have been aiming at me. You know, they are all aiming at me, I guess, and that's fine. And so far it's been only driving my numbers up. They should have devoted more time to Mitt Romney and helped him win instead of looking at, you know, taking other people down. But they have all been going after me. I've had, I guess, Bush spent 20 or $25 million on me. And he's like nowhere.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's going nowhere. And now Romney is doing a PAC, because Romney feels badly because frankly that was an election that he should have won. You know it and I know it. Four years ago, they should have won that election easily and they failed. So these people that -- these ex-Romney people should have focused more on getting Romney elected instead of doing Super PACs.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Is your strategy going to change much going into South Carolina? I mean, we're back to population or voting demographic, highly evangelical. Are you changing your strategy between New Hampshire and South Carolina?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Not, too much. We really hit a chord. You know, we are talking about border security. We're talking about the military, the vets. And, you know, things that are pretty generic no matter where you are. I do great with the evangelicals. We have a great relationship. And I'm leading in evangelical vote in polling numbers, as you know, Greta.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm leading over the nation. Throughout the nation I'm leading. And that's a great honor. And I don't think too much. Really strong military, great trade deals. You know, something I have been talking about right from the beginning. We want really great trade deals which we don't have now. We lose hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars on trade.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, just with China alone, we lose that. So, you know, I think the message is going to stay pretty much the same.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. The news today and some of the business news today is that Sears is going to accelerate the closing of 50 stores. And, you know, we always talk sort of big picture about politics. But closing 50 stores are really going to hurt a lot of families. If you are president today, is there anything you would say or do because these families, they are going to take the big hit.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, the retailers have a lot of problems. Whether it's Sears or Macy's or any of them because it's sort of like becoming an older line business. But I don't know, Sears it looks like more of a financial play than anything else. You know, something is going to happen. They will either rent those stores or we rent the stores and they'll be knocked down and a building will be put there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It will all work out. Eventually, it will all work out. It doesn't look very good right now. I saw that. And Sears has a major headache as a company, you know that.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I went to Facebook and put your picture up and asked some questions. And Michael Patrick Martin, one of my Facebook people who likes me on Facebook says, what does it say about the polarization of the country that a socialist is winning the Democratic primary and how can you, that would be Donald Trump, compete in a general election with an opponent who claims virtually everything will be free.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, because the taxes are not going to be free. Your taxes are going to be 95 percent. If you look at what this guy wants to do. I mean, frankly, they should be about 120 percent, if you really want to know the truth. Everything he wants to give away. You are talking about like 95 percent tax. Well, eventually, that will be explained.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'll explain it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> How do you run against it? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You run against it by explaining it. What I explained is just what I explained.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. Another question -- another --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who's going to pay 95 percent tax? You literally would have to pay 95 percent tax to pay what this guy wants to do. I mean, he wants to take everything away from one group. But the truth is, once you get the taxes beyond a certain point, he is unelectable.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. Catherine Hagan, also on my Facebook page, says she's heard a lot about politicians talking about helping the vets and other people. But she says what about our seniors? And I see a lot of questions like, you know, if you are president, what are you going to do about social security and what about seniors?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, you know, it's a great question, because I spent a lot of time with the vets and helping the vets. And people don't talk about the seniors. I'm talking about the seniors and I have been for a long while. The seniors are in a lot of trouble. And now they are talking about many people. They are talking about cutting social security.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am not going to cut social security. I'm bringing the jobs back. I'm lowering taxes. We're going to have a dynamic economy again, Greta. And we're not cutting social security.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> We're just -- today, Carly Fiorina suspended her campaign. I don't know if you know that yet. But any thoughts about Carly's suspending hers?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I thought she was very nice. I thought she was very effective in a lot of different ways. I didn't know she suspended, but, you know, you have to do what you have to do. And we will see what happens with Chris, likewise.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> One other question from Facebook. And I know you get this one a lot, but this is from Pat Myville and it says, why don't you act more presidential? I like you, but I don't like the bad words that you insert into your speech. Are we going to hear a little cleaner language or softer language or is this the Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, sometimes, I will copy other people's language. But the other day, we had 5,000 people in New Hampshire. It was amazing. And in a blizzard, we have 5,000 thousand people. More than that. And a woman got up and used a little bit of a bad word and I said don't you dare use that word and everyone said what's the word?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I said here's the word, but she used it and not me. We were just having fun. I reused her word. And I will tell you. The place stood up and they were giving a stand -- it was like a standing ovation. It's called politically correct. We're too politically correct. Now with that being said, as I get closer and closer to the goal, it's going to get different.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, we started off Greta, you were there, right from the beginning, 17 people. Now we are down to not very many people, probably six in the end of the day, maybe even less than that. And once you get to a certain level, it changes. I will be changing very rapidly. I'm very capable of changing to anything I want to change to.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, billionaire -- another New York billionaire may get into the race, Mayor Bloomberg. At least we hear some sort of chatter. What have we -- what are your thoughts of another New York billionaire getting into the race if that happens?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I know Michael very well. He is a friend of mine. I hope he gets into the race. I think it would be good. I would love to compete against him. And I think we do very well. I would love to see Michael in the race.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What have -- in looking at this, you have now become a politician because you are in politics. What's the biggest thing that has surprised you from the inside or from being a politician that you never anticipated when you were just a billionaire businessman?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I will tell you what really -- a little bit surprised me, but it's a pleasant surprise how smart the American public is. How much the American public cares and how they want to change the country and bring it back. And I have never seen anything like it. It's a slugfest. I mean, like tonight, I'm leaving as soon as we are finished here.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm going to South Carolina. We have thousands and thousands of people showing up for an event, like a rally or whatever you want to call it that I set up like two days ago. It's unbelievable. So the love they have for this country, Greta, is unbelievable. And that's a very pleasant surprise. I assumed it, but not to the extent that I've seen.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's incredible.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald Trump, thank you very much for joining us. I hope you will come back soon.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I will, thank you.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald Trump says the president is picking a fight not with him, but with business owners, President Obama taking a lot of heat for saying, If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Now the president says he meant the business owners didn't build the bridges and roads that businesses need. What does Donald Trump think?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> We asked him earlier.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> [Begin Video Clip] Donald, nice to talk to you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, the president has said that you did not build it and he says that the Romney campaign has taken his statements out of context. I'm curious, your thoughts on the -- what the president meant or how you took what he meant when he talked about people not building it. And I realize there's more to the quote than that.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But what's your thought on it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think really it's a very, very tough statement. People are very upset by it. It really has energized a lot of people in this country because maybe the truth is coming out finally about President Obama and his attitudes. It is a very, very hard thing for people that work 20 hours a day on -- - whether it's building a business or just working on jobs where they build great things -- it's very hard for those people to take when they hear a statement like that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's a very, very difficult statement for them to take.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Does it reflect a bigger ideology and sort of a real difference between the two candidates, President Obama thinking perhaps that the government has a greater role in helping business and the Republican view, Governor Romney's view, is that it is the individual who has the greater role in building business?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think it does reflect ideology. There's no question about it. I think this is where Obama comes from in the first place. This is what he really believes. This is what he thinks. I think he wished he didn't make the statement because it's gotten tremendous heat. And you see other things -- I mean, not only this, but other things are leading to a point where as of yesterday, Romney is leading in various polls and doing very well.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So people are not wanting to hear that in this country. When you look at what's happened with this country, how this country has built itself up from its bootstraps -- I mean, how they've worked -- people have worked so hard. And forget about Donald Trump. I mean, people and I do work hard. And I'm proud of that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But people are working hard, and then they hear a statement like this, they don't like it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Vice President Biden has said that the wealthy do very, very well and do not need a tax cut. Now, I think it's indeed true that Donald Trump -- you're very wealthy. You do not need a tax cut. But tell me how a tax cut, or the continuation of the existing tax rate for you -- what it does for you, in terms of job creation?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Are you more likely to create more jobs if it stays as it is or not? What's the real impact on business?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, Greta, look at what's happening right now. It's stagnant. Everybody's just holding back. Nobody knows what's going to happen. Nobody wants to invest in this climate. And people that have money are holding back. Banks are afraid to make loans. It's a mess. And you look at the taxes, you look at what's going on with the taxes, where some people want to just take -- where you have almost a majority now of people that don't pay any tax in the country.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And at some point, it's got to stop. But something I say that I don't hear a lot of other people saying is where is this money being spent you? You know, they raise your taxes and they keep raising your taxes, and then you look at Solyndra and you look at all of these horrible investments that, frankly, investment bankers should be making, not the government.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Our government shouldn't be making an investment in Solyndra. Solyndra -- they take hundreds of millions of dollars and then just blow it in a matter of weeks. And this is where our tax money goes. It goes to Iraq. It goes to other countries that no longer respect us, don't respect us. It's going to blow to hell [Inaudible] you see what happened with Iraq yesterday, where 100 people were killed.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And we're in there for $1.5 trillion, and we have nothing to say about it. So a lot of people not only disagree with the tax hike -- and you're talking about a very substantial tax hike -- they want to know where's their money going to? Is it going to continue to be thrown away like they've been throwing it away?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's a very difficult thing. And then just to end it is -- we are in such a fragile world right now in terms of this economy that to be raising taxes now on job producers is a very, very dangerous thing to be doing.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, I -- it's very dangerous if it has a direct impact on your job creation. And I'm curious whether or not, as a realistic matter, is that, you know, forget whether, you know, people think it's fair or not fair, whether, you know, who's paying taxes, who's not paying taxes. Would a job -- would a tax hike have an impact on how many jobs Donald Trump creates beginning January 1?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it would, but if you look at Obamacare, that's 21 different tax hikes. You know, if you look at that -- I was reading this morning that there are in there 21 -- at a minimum, but 21 different taxes. And you're talking about a tax hike of 21 different taxes, and in some cases, new taxes being put on. And even the Supreme Court said it was a tax.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So you look at that and you add that with everything else, and it certainly does have an impact. We're not talking about small tax increases. We're talking about very major tax increases, and maybe the biggest tax increase of all is Obamacare.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, I -- one of the things I think that should be put into the mix in discussion is, at least, as I've seen the estimates, is that if the tax cuts do expire so those who make more than $250,000 a year -- it means that we can fund the federal government for another eight days. I don't know what we're going to do about the other 357 days...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right. It's a very, very small amount of money. Absolutely.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Yes. So I'm trying to sort of, like, are the eight days worth any sort of impinging on the people who might create jobs if they don't -- if they have a continued tax rate? That's what I'm trying to measure.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The answer is no. And if you look at what Ronald Reagan did, he started cutting taxes and the economy started to grow and it became great. An frankly, it's such a wrong answer. And people really have other choices. You know, people with money can go to lots of other countries to invest. They can go to China.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They can go to India. They can go to many other places. It's no longer like in the good old days, where you go to a different state. If you don't like New York, you can go to Florida. Today, if you don't like this country or if you don't like a certain area where you are because taxes are too high, you can invest in other countries.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And you can be there in five hours on a plane. So it's a very different world than it was even 10 years ago.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, Secretary of Treasury Geithner today testifying before the House Financial Services -- he said this, in part. And I'm curious whether or not you agree with him. He said that -- that what is happening in the country is that -- as a result of the Obama administration policies, that increased credit -- that is becoming more available at banks.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Has -- is that true? Do we have more stable banks and increased credit?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If you're very rich and if you want to borrow money, if it's Donald Trump, believe me, it's very easy to borrow money right now, very, very easy. And I get it at such a low rate, it's incredible. I've never seen anything like it. If you're a very fine person and a very good developer or business person and you're trying to build a business and you want to borrow money, you cannot get money at any price.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The banks are not loaning money to people that want to build businesses. And that's a real problem for the country. It's never been like this. So the rates are very good, if you don't need the money. If you don't want money, they want to loan you money. If you need money, you cannot borrow it at any rate.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, so is there increased credit? I mean -- I mean, one of the ways that we sort of rev up the economy is that people go out and build things or they go out and create things, but they also -- they borrow money in order to have that happen. If you're not a Donald Trump, if you're not a -- you know, if you're not a billionaire -- let's say you're only a millionaire -- are you able to get credit to expand your business right now?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Is the secretary right that credit is more available?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The answer is no, you cannot get credit. If you need money to build a business and you're a very solid citizen with good credit ratings and everything, but you need money to build a business, but you don't have a lot of money, but you have great ideas and great concepts and it's a wonderful business or development if it were real estate, you cannot get money.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Is there anything that the Obama administration has done that you think is really smart to help the business community to create jobs?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look, I think they're trying. Obviously, they have to be trying. It's inconceivable to think that they're not. But certainly not a lot is happening to help the business community. Business is in a funk. They're in a total funk right now. They're just not moving. They're afraid to move. Whether it's Obamacare happening and what's going to be the next thing that comes down the pike.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So business is not moving. It's stagnant. They don't have confidence. I'm sure they're trying. You know, I mean, Geithner is a good man. They want to...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But that's -- but that's sort of...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But it's not happening, Greta. It's just not happening.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But that sort of feeds into the recent Gallup poll, is that 2 to 1, apparently, the American voters like President Obama more than Governor Romney. President Obama's likability's factor is 2 to 1 better than Governor Romney. But likability -- you know, is -- I mean, you know, is that a reason to vote for someone?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, you know, it is always a reason to vote for someone. I happen to think Mitt Romney is a very nice man. You look at his family. It's a great family. His wife is an amazing woman, a great woman. And I happen to think he's a very, very high-quality, nice man and solid as a rock. And I can't understand why his popularity isn't through the roof because, frankly, he has every single quality you need for likability.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's a great person.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, if you talk to a Republican or even some business people, they make -- they make you think that it's going to be absolutely catastrophic if President Obama is reelected in terms of the economy and businesses and job growth. Is -- is -- no matter who is elected, can the business community respond to it? Can you adjust to anything, or is it going to be catastrophic?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it's certainly not going to be very positive. I mean, there are many people that are waiting to see what happens with the election. And if Mitt Romney gets in, they're going to be investing and they're going to be going wild and they're going to be creating jobs. And if Obama gets in, I think they're going to be very, very upset and go to lots of other places.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They have very little confidence in the country.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I guess I'm trying to figure out what's the scare factor. I mean, you know, are we getting the scare factor from some people? Or do you think it's, you know, a -- these are, you know, very serious times and it makes a big difference on those tax -- whether tax credits or tax rates are extended or not.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I've been saying and I've been saying for a while I think this is one of the most important elections this country has ever had. There's a whole psychology. You started off this interview talking about building businesses, and you know, what the statements were and everything else. The fact is, that is a mindset right now, that we didn't do it, that people that work hard didn't do it. It had virtually nothing to do with them.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, that is not what it's all about and that's not what this country is all about. So I think that people are very nervous. And I think they're actually, in many cases, scared. Business people, hardened, veteran business people are scared to see what would happen if Obama gets a second term.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, thank you. Always nice to talk to you, sir. [End Video Clip]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you very much, Greta.
<Chris Berg> <Negative> Mr. President, welcome back to North Dakota. Thank you for being here Sir. Congratulations on the job numbers. Wages going up. I want to start with President Barack Obama speaking in Illinois today about the midterms. A couple of things he said and get your reaction to them. One he said the crazy things coming out of the White House. Two, he suggested that you're using fear to divide American in order to hold power. Your reaction is what?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I sort of watched that speech and I must tell you I sort of I dozed off. I dozed off watching him. I've always sort of dozed off watching him. He's trying to make a comeback because the Democrats are really in shambles. They've gone so far left that I think even he can't handle it. We are so proud of the economy; the economy was going down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Had the Democrats gotten in instead of being up four point two, I think you would have been down four point two. That's how bad it was going. You understand that Chris, it was going totally in the wrong direction. The White House is really doing a great job. We are a, I said last night jokingly, but meaning it, we are a well oiled machine.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at what we're doing on trade. You look at what we're doing for the economy. You look at now even North Korea came out with a very big statement yesterday. You saw that and about President Trump that it was a real positive. The last days of Obama a lot of people thought we'd be in a war with North Korea.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at what we're doing against terrorism and, of course, the big tax cuts, and regulation. So many of your people I just saw some of your business leaders. They were just telling me, all from all over North Dakota. They're saying that their businesses are doubling and tripling because of what we've done in regulation, which I think is just as important as the tax cuts... and the tax cuts.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we've set something that really is going to be in motion for a long time, unless it gets disturbed by a foolish election.
<Chris Berg> <Negative> I get your reaction to this as well. I know you took a lot of pride in the unemployment numbers that you've created. Since 1970, we've had nine times -- nine months --unemployment below 4 percent for those on your watch. Today Barack Obama said that well, let me remind you the unemployment numbers have been like this since 2015 and 2016. Essentially saying, "Hey don't give President Trump the credit. Remember what I did." Your reaction?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they weren't like this. And also he was going from a much lower base I took over. If you look at him from the Great Depression forward, he had the worst improvement of anybody -- percentage wise -- of any president in modern day history. It was not much of a rally. And we have a major rally going on right now, in terms of jobs, in terms of... I think even in terms of world recognition, going beyond anything else.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The world respects our country now. They didn't respect our country when he was running it. They were laughing at our country. We're making great trade deals now and we're making fair trade deals, but we're making them good for us. And we didn't have that. If you looked at NAFTA, Mexico was taking out a hundred billion dollars a year.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Canada was taking out 58 billion dollars a year, at least, by the way, at least. Now we're making the deals fair. All over the world we're with China and that's going to work out very well for us. We're with the European Union. That's going to work out very well. If you look at your farmers, you look at your people sending things into the European Union, or sending them into China, you couldn't get them in. We're going to clear up those problems.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we had a four point two. It was lifted up to four point two. It was adjusted upwardly as you saw last week. And that's now... it was from four point one -- they lifted it up four point two. I think next quarter is going to be fantastic. And you're right no matter where I go people are thanking me. A lot of the people here -- I just arrived and they're saying thank you for saving our country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Thank you. They really mean it too. I mean I had a man come up to me, who's a strong tough guy and he had tears coming down his eyes. And he said, "Thank you Mr. President for saving our country." People mean it. And I understand exactly what they say, because we were going in the wrong direction. And all you have to do is look at these Democrats running for office with open borders and we're going to pay for everybody's education, meaning from other countries they are going to walk in -- illegal immigrants -- education, health care.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have a country. We have to be able to afford it. We have to be able to take care of our own people.
<Chris Berg> <Positive> Last question about President Obama, Sir. He also said that you should stop politicizing the Justice Department. Here's my question for you. I'm assuming you've seen these FISA warrants. Have you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have not seen them. No I have not.
<Chris Berg> <Neutral> So I'm assuming you've seen some confidential classified information.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But what I have seen...
<Chris Berg> <Negative> Can you can you say that Barack Obama did -- did he politicize the Justice Department against your campaign?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh I think so. I think absolutely. And I think his whole group is a disgrace. What they did to my campaign. And I can tell you this all you have to do. You don't have to see anything. All you have to do is watch fair news -- fair news -- not fake news and you'll see what's going on. And look what's actually now starting to go down in my opinion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're finally starting to go down. What they did with respect to my campaign is a disgrace. And what they did with respect to Hillary Clinton, where they gave her a pass on everything, that was so serious. The things that they did when you...when you get rid of 33,000 e-mails. When you do the kind of things that they were doing and that campaign.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Also probably, you could include Bernie Sanders in that whole thing. But when they did to me -- whether it's surveillance or a much stronger term -- because I believe it was a much stronger term --than that and a lot of other people do. Nobody politicized the Justice Department more than Barack Obama.
<Chris Berg> <Negative> Strong statement. Also breaking news on Air Force One you said hey Attorney General Jeff Sessions should investigate who wrote this anonymous Op-ed to The New York Times?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think he should.
<Chris Berg> <Negative> If he doesn't investigate it. Will you fire Jeff Sessions finally?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to look and see what happens. I think it's a national security matter. They should look at it. They should look at it very strongly and we should find out who it is. Because why should we live with somebody in the White House, who is really subversive in a sense. I mean if you look at it, it really is subversive.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we'll take a look at that and we'll take a very good strong look. We'll find out. Eventually we're going to find the person. Now I can say at a high level, it's not going to be. You're not going to find it. In fact all of our top people have come out with letters saying this is disgraceful and, you know, it would be really hard for them to do that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then all of a sudden it's found out that it's them. So we're going to find out who it is.
<Chris Berg> <Positive> So you won the presidency on your gut. You've talked about how you've got great gut instincts.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No I don't talk about that but other people do.
<Chris Berg> <Positive> I think we can agree you've got great gut instincts.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I guess I do. But hey, I won the presidency.
<Chris Berg> <Positive> So what I want to know is when you first saw this New York Times piece, in your gut, Who's the first person that came to your head that wrote it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I could think of four or five. Mostly people that either I don't like or respect, but they're there because in some cases they have to be governmentally, meaning they're protected. You know, we have a lot of people that are protected. And a lot of people call those people bad names. But I thought of two or three or four people, people that I have no idea...
<Chris Berg> <Positive> Do you want to name them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't want to name them, but we'll see. Sometimes those people turn out to be the opposite. You know you think maybe they could be the one they turn out to be extremely straight. But the fact is that we'll find this person. You don't want to have that going on. I will say that whole issue is reverberating in the opposite direction.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People think it's disgusting that the New York Times would do that. They think it's absolutely disgusting that they would do such a thing, because unless you know who it is, you can't ..it's a one way street. They can say something about you. Now when we find out that this is a failed person, in so many different ways -- that you know -- you can fight it back very easily, like the book.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a discredited book already. Everybody came out -- almost everybody -- came out where there are quotes like General Kelly, General Mattis, so many different people they came out. And they really hit the book hard, because they didn't say the things that it was attributed. But when you have somebody where it is anonymous and you take a look at what's going on that's a really unfair situation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we'll figure it out eventually it's going to come out. I would hope that you and your all of your brilliant reporters all over the country and, maybe the world, will figure it out probably before I do.
<Chris Berg> <Negative> All I can say the people here in the heartland are upset, because we feel like we're having the will of the people thwarted and your agenda thwarted. One more question sir. I know Representative Meadows and Representative Jordan are calling on you to release these FISA documents. Are you going to do that?
<Chris Berg> <Neutral> And if so when?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The answer is, first of all I have a lot of respect for those guys, and we're looking at it right now. I've just given it to the lawyers, and we're looking at it very strongly, and we might very well do it, because we have to get to the bottom of all of this corruption from the past administration. That was corruption.
<Chris Berg> <Positive> Two questions sir. One, in March you tweeted out trade wars are good and they're easy to win. Right now our farmers... it's not good for them, and it's not easy for them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's not bad for them, because if you look at, as an example soybeans, they dropped 50 percent five years before my election, they came down 50 percent, and now they're about the same as, what I was talking about when we came out with tariffs. We have to open up other countries like China, they take advantage of us, and Canada they take advantage of us, and many places take advantage.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we're not going to let people take advantage. The farmers are great. They're on my side. They voted for me. They have trust in me, they have faith in me. I will follow through. Just give me a little time, a little time and if you push it too hard, we won't be able to make the right deal. But Canada's in the White House right now, they're negotiating.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Remember, we're the bank that everybody wants to rob, and in this case, it's other countries, but we're the bank that they all want to rob, and I don't want them to rob, and I want my farmers to have open markets, so they can sell their product in those open market.
<Chris Berg> <Negative> Last question sir. You broke a record here today raising over a million dollars...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great
<Chris Berg> <Positive> ...in one day for this campaign. There's people out there -- and you and I both know, it's those independent, undecided voters are going to win this race for one of these U.S. Senate candidates. For the people on the fence, why should they vote for Kevin Cramer over Senator Heidi Heitkamp?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll just tell you that Heidi, who I've gotten to know a little bit, will always vote for Schumer and Pelosi. It's very simple. That's not our agenda. That's not the people of North Dakota. That is not the agenda that we want to hear about. That's open borders, that's crime coming in. That's, you know, giving money to everybody that doesn't deserve the money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's so many different things that the people of North Dakota don't want. Kevin Cramer is a winner. They know him. He's been representing you for a long time. He's got a substantial lead, because everybody loves him. He's a very special guy, and he loves this state, and he loves the people. And he's going to be voting for Second Amendment things, he's going to be voting for the things that we need, including judges.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right now, we have a great judge. Now Heidi may vote for it because she's going to be forced to vote for it. But I'll guarantee you, if we were losing, she wouldn't vote. She'll only vote if we're going to win, if we don't need her. But Kevin will vote for what's right, and Kevin is going to vote for what's right, also for the people of North Dakota.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So you have an incredible candidate he's going to be one of the great senators.
<Chris Berg> <Positive> Mr. President thank you for being here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Chris Berg> <Negative> God bless you sir. We are praying for you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
