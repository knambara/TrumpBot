<Rita Cosby> <Positive> Well, you're boosting my morale. And speaking of another good American, we've got on the phone, we've got joining us is big time developer Donald Trump. He is also a good friend of Michael Jackson, also a big time supporter of the U.S. military. Donald, good to have you on the phone.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And a good friend of Don Kings.
<Rita Cosby> <Negative> I know, is he not great?
<Don King> <Negative> Talk to me, Don.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I wonder if Don King really supports George Bush?
<Don King> <Neutral> You know something, Don ...
<Rita Cosby> <Neutral> He says he does, he says he does.
<Don King> <Positive> ... but you got a great Park Avenue is doing wonderful. You know what, we'll have to rename Park Avenue to Donald Trump's Park Avenue.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's getting close. It's getting very close. How are you doing, Don?
<Don King> <Positive> I am doing great, man. I am looking forward to seeing you on the 13th, Don, in Atlantic City.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very good.
<Rita Cosby> <Neutral> And, Donald, you are going to be there, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will be. I think I will be. I am going to try to make it. It's a great show. Don, always puts on a good show.
<Rita Cosby> <Negative> He does. And we just heard from Don that also Michael Jackson, his family is going to be there. What do you make of the allegations against Michael? You're a good friend of his for years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I have been. And, you know, Michael lives in one of my buildings for a long time for many years. And I know what goes on in my buildings, believe me. If Don King lived there I could tell you a lot of different things but he doesn't live there, unfortunately. He lives in Palm Beach, beautiful Palm Beach. But, I know, as Don would understand, I know what goes on.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And nothing, nothing goes on with Michael in the building. And Michael has been a total gentleman. Never had a problem. Little boys don't go up and down in elevators. The whole thing -- I think it's disgraceful. And I understood the other day I understood that the mother signed a document totally exonerating Michael of anything. So, I don't know what's going on here. Also ...
<Rita Cosby> <Negative> In fact, I'm told, Don, that she did that back around February or March time. And now is going back and saying that these incidents happened in February or March. I believe I think that is going to be very helpful to the defense in this case. Real quick, too, also, I know you've talked before, Donald, and said to Michael, look, you've done these plastic surgeries, this is wrong. Did you ever say to him, why do you have these little boys in your bedroom especially after being accused of this in '93?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't know what is going on. It's a very complicated process. His plastic surgery, Michael denies that he's had any plastic surgery. And if you listen to Michael he had a couple of minor nose jobs. But, you know, it's too bad what's happened with Michael. Michael was one of the greatest performers, I think Don you could say this also, one of the truly greatest performers. I've seen them all. I've seen over the last 25, 30 years there was nobody comparable to Michael Jackson at his prime.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Michael has really hurt himself very badly in many different ways. I hope he can do something to at least partially revive it. But he's going through a terrible period of time. I know him well. I just don't believe the allegations. I watched the district attorney, I watched the news conference and it was almost like a comedy routine being done. And I would assume, and I know the district attorney's apologized, I would assume he should be ashamed of himself, because did you get to see that, Don?
<Don King> <Positive> Yes, I did and I thought it was ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was like a comedy routine.
<Don King> <Negative> ... I was a travesty, man.
<Rita Cosby> <Neutral> What did you think of it? He
<Don King> <Negative> I thought it was, you know, he was preordained. He didn't like that kind of music, all these different catch phrases, but Donald, I think ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was up there laughing, Don.
<Don King> <Positive> Yes, yes, making a comedic thing out of it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was having a good time, taking in all the press.
<Don King> <Negative> And it's just totally is a sad commentary when you see these things happen. But Donald, let's help him. Let's find a way because the two Don's, I love Don Trump. Donald Trump is my man no matter what no one says.
<Rita Cosby> <Positive> You guys are probably two of the best promoters out there. You guys are probably the best promoters out there. Donald Trump, I'm going to start with you and then am going to go to you, Don. How would you promote Michael right now? Is he going to be tainted for awhile? Do you think he is going to be able recover?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think Michael needs promotion right now. Maybe he needs the opposite. He's got to go a little bit low, he's got a good lawyer, I hope he has got a good lawyer. Don could advise him on that. I don't know, is he good, Don, tell me?
<Don King> <Negative> Yes, he's good. I think what it is - the fact of the matter is I just rely on America, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. If we lose that presumption then we have lost. We are an empty nation. This is what I go on, I am not really looking at what happens to Michael one way or the other,
<Don King> <Positive> I'm looking at what we hold sacred and dear, the infinite wisdom of the founding fathers sat down to writ in this Constitution of the United States. If this is what you got on trial right here, because what we're doing is abusing and misusing that presumption. And that is wrong, because it's so vitally important, so significant to all Americans, black and white alike.
<Rita Cosby> <Positive> And Don King, is he still very promotable, would you promote him on a tour? Would you announce it December 13th?
<Don King> <Negative> I have to join with Donald Trump there. First, you have to do is get himself straightened out here. But it's a bad thing when you have to defend fiction. When people can fabricate stories and you have to defend them just as much as you would if you were really involved in something where you would be a criminal defense or guilt or whatever. But you have to defend because they make up stories. So this is also what makes America great flipping the coin that people can do this.
<Don King> <Negative> They can misuse and abuse the law at their own selfish invested interest, and you got to set up and defend it, because the sword swings both ways. But I think this nation is the greatest nation in the world. And I think that Michael is being misused now because -- not him personally, but they're misusing the presumption.
<Don King> <Negative> And so now the media mania is -- really they've convicted him, they've lynched him, they've castrated him, they've hung him in effigy. And he's now smeared all over the world. When he's exonerated then it will be a little small thing, he's exonerated. But look at the damage that has been done.
<Don King> <Positive> So I have to concur with Donald Trump. We've got to just play it, low key it out, humbleness, but play it. But I say, Michael, don't give up on this nation. Remember the prophet, Jobe, though they slay me, yet should I be a witness for the Lord. So though they slay you in America right now, yet be a witness for this great nation called America.
<Rita Cosby> <Positive> Thank you. All right, go head, Donald, real quick.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Rita, I will say this. It's very, very dangerous today to be a celebrity. It really is, especially if you're a rich celebrity. And there's a great danger out there, and people can say it's an advantage. And in many ways, obviously, it is an advantage but it is very dangerous. Being a celebrity out there and a rich celebrity is a very dangerous thing.
<Don King> <Negative> And add black to that, Donald.
<Rita Cosby> <Positive> I love the two celebrities I have on tonight, Don King, Donald Trump, two of my absolute favorites everybody, and two all Americans. Love this salvo, everybody.
<Don King> <Positive> This is great, great. December 13th, live and in living color, five world title fights on the screen on pay per view, call your local provider now, 8 on the scene.
<Rita Cosby> <Negative> And don't forget the Jackson family is going to be there, too, guys.
<Don King> <Positive> Yes, and Donald Trump is going to be there.
<Rita Cosby> <Neutral> And also Don King.
<Don King> <Positive> Yes, and Rita Cosby is going to be there.
<Rita Cosby> <Positive> See, there you go, a personal invite.
<Don King> <Positive> Yes, you've got a personal invite because she's a dear of America. She is the salt of the earth.
<Rita Cosby> <Negative> I am going to have to hire him for promotion. Everybody stay tuned, we are going to have a lot more ahead. I don't know how you top this, but we're going to have more exclusive information coming out of the Jackson camp. Michael says, get this, he does not blame his young accuser. But guess who he does blame? We'll get reaction from the attorney representing the boy's father.
<Rita Cosby> <Positive> And later, how is Michael holding up to the media fire storm that we've been talking about? Hollywood's most famous former madam Heidi Fleiss weighs in. Stay tuned, we've got a great night ahead.
