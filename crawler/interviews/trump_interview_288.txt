<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> Joining me on the line is the national Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump. Good morning, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi, Charlie.
<Charlie Sykes> <Neutral> How are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm good.
<Charlie Sykes> <Neutral> By the way...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I look forward to spending a week with you folks. So I look forward to that.
<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> First of all, congratulations, grandpa.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> Congratulations on the birth of your grandson yesterday.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right. Thank you. It's so nice. Ivanka is a special person and they have a beautiful baby so that was on Easter. So it's an Easter baby, and that's great.
<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> Well, welcome to Wisconsin. And I know that you realize that here in Wisconsin, we value things like civility, decency and actual conservative principles. So let's possibly make some news. I mean, last week you tweeted out a threat to spill the beans on the wife of Ted Cruz, Heidi Cruz. You followed that up by tweeting out a picture that insulted her looks.
<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> Wouldn't it be a good way to start off your Wisconsin campaign by saying that wives should be off limits and that you apologize for mocking her looks?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, by the way, I think it's true, actually, Charlie. But you know, if you remember, Melania was a -- my wife was a very, very big successful model and she did a shoot -- a cover shoot for GQ magazine and it was a little provocative. It was GQ, but then she was a model. But what they did is -- and Ted Cruz knew totally about it. And he says he didn't know about it. He probably knew about it. And they sent that out to the people of Salt Lake City or the people of Utah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And there was -- with a very nasty statement on it. So he knew totally about that. If he didn't know about that, it would be a whole different thing. But he totally knew about it. It was done by people that he knows very well.
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> Well, it was not Ted Cruz or his campaign. So is your standard is...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. But it was -- no, no I'm just telling you, he knew. He knew these people did it.
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> OK. But -- So is this your standard that if a supporter of another candidate, not the candidate himself, does something despicable, that it's OK for you personally, a candidate for president of the United States, to behave in that same way? I mean, I expect that from a 12-year-old bully on the playground, not somebody who wants the office held by Abraham Lincoln.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I did a retweet and it was a retweet by somebody else because I have a lot of support and a tremendous amount of very fervent supporters and they were angry about what they did in sending out this photograph, which was frankly fine. It was an artistic picture actually. It was a cover of GQ which is not a big deal.
<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> Your wife is a beautiful, classy woman. Why can't you say the same about Ted Cruz's wife?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know Ted Cruz's wife. I'm sure she's excellent. I mean, I just don't know her. But all this was, was a response to what he did.
<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it was a very -- and by the way, Charlie, it was a very minor response to what he did with the picture. I didn't even know it was necessarily a very bad picture of her versus Melania frankly. But this was this was a retweet from one of my supporters as so many millions of supporters and millions of people on Twitter.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have -- between Twitter and Facebook, I guess, Instagram I have 15 million people.
<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> And we hear from them frequently. Now, Mr. Trump, you do like to talk about polls a lot and the recent polls suggest that you have a disapproval rating of about 70% among women. And in southeastern Wisconsin, you are very much underwater. And a lot of that has to do, let's be honest about this, with conservative women who are repelled by your attitude and your treatment of women.
<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> And you know they're going to be hearing this ad a lot here in Wisconsin media, and I want you to -- give you a chance to respond.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> Bimbo.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> Dog.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> Fat pig.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Real quotes from Donald Trump about women. A person who is very flat-chested is very hard to be a 10.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> I'd look her right in that fat, ugly face of hers. Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that?
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> She had the height. She had the beauty. She was crazy. But these are minor details. I like kids. I mean, I won't do anything to take care of them. I'll supply funds.
<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> OK, Mr. Trump, I'd like to give you a chance to respond to that. That is of course from an anti-Trump super PAC. And that ad is going to be airing here in Wisconsin. How do you respond because those are your real quotes, aren't they?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Women are just going to have to see what I've done. I've hired tremendous numbers of women. Women are in my highest executive positions. I pay women in many cases more than I pay men, which is more than most people can say. I'd like to hear what these -- I've been a person that's been in the entertainment business and a very big person in a business that I've been quoted over the years by everybody from the time -- almost from the time I started business, for whatever reason, I was -- I became a celebrity the sense and talking...
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> Are the rules different for celebrities? Are celebrities allowed to insult women?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The rules are different. But certainly, I never thought I would run for office. And many people, a Howard Stern would interview me and everybody would be having fun and the women would be laughing.
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> Yes. Well, but you're saying the same thing. I mean, you have mocked Megyn Kelly. You have mocked Carly Fiorina and...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm not a fan of Megyn Kelly. I mean, I'm allowed to say that. If Megyn Kelly were a man, I would be saying the exact same things about Megyn Kelly and the same thing with Rosie O'Donnell. I'm not a fan of Rosie O'Donnell.
<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> Well, let me ask you...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you're a fan of mine, and you know what, you go back and forth. I don't think there should be a double standard if somebody is a woman. But I can tell you this, Charlie, I have been better to women than any of these candidates frankly. I've been taken -- I've...
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> Except you won't apologize to a woman that you mocked.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have executive people and -- at a very, very high level. I have executive people that are women. I gave women early chances in construction -- numerous women early chances in construction when nobody else was doing it. And people have said that I've been -- people have said in terms of breaking the glass ceiling that I was a leader in it.
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> OK. Let me ask you this, because we started off, you and I are both grandpas, we are both fathers. I guess, here's a question here in Wisconsin. How should fathers and mothers explain this? Is this the way you'd want anyone to want their sons to behave?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought this was actually a dead issue until I just spoke to you. I mean, I'd rather be talking about trade. I'd rather be talking about the things I'm best at, security -- border security. I have the support of Sheriff Arpaio in Phoenix, Arizona, which Ted Cruz thought he was going to get but he never even...
<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> Right. You're in Wisconsin now. OK, let's talk about issues. That's fair enough. Since you are here in Wisconsin, last August, you said some things about conservatives -- the conservative revolution here in Wisconsin. Scott Walker that I wanted to give you a chance to respond to, you said Wisconsin is doing terribly, it's in turmoil.
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> They projected $1 billion surplus. It turns out to be a deficit of $2.2 billion. The schools are a disaster, the hospitals and education was a disaster. Mr. Trump, do you stand by that now that you are going to be talking to Wisconsinites.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know. I can't tell you. I got that from Time magazine. If you read the story from Time magazine from the time that the statement was made, that's exactly what they said. It was taken out of that verbatim. It was actually taken out of Time magazine on the story of...
<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> But you said it, Mr. Trump. You're running for president. You stand by what you said about Scott Walker.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can only say what I took out of Time magazine. I took a story out of Time magazine and the story was exactly what it said. It said a $2.2 billion dollar deficit...
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> Which turns out to be false.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now if Time magazine's wrong, then they should apologize then I would certainly apologize for reading Time magazine. But Time magazine gave that information.
<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> Mr. Trump, I think probably you know where I stand in this race and some of us have worked for decades on developing and advancing conservative ideas. You want to talk about your record. I mean, you've given hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Clintons, to Harry Reid, to John Kerry, Chuck Schumer, Charlie Rangel.
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> In your book, you insulted Ronald Reagan. You praised Obama's stimulus as terrific. You've called for the largest tax hike in history. You've endorsed universal government-run health care. You've endorsed abortion on-demand, gun control. So my question is why shouldn't conservatives here in Wisconsin think that your claim to be a conservative now is just a giant fraud?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, first of all, let me just explain that as a businessman, I've never even thought of many of the things you're talking about. I was never even asked questions about many of the things you're talking about. I gave money to all politicians. I was Republican, but I gave money to all politicians, which was frankly a thing that you would do and every businessman would do it. I never thought I was going to be running for office.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm a very straight shooter. And I've said this, I gave money to Democrats and I gave money to Republicans and I built a great fortune a great, great company which I think everybody acknowledges. That's one thing pretty much everybody does acknowledge, not even pretty much, some of the great assets of the world with very, very low debt with tremendous cash flow.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And frankly, I built a great company, and it's an international company. I deal all over the world. And when you do that...
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> You're not answering my question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, no, I am answering. You have to get along with everybody.
<Charlie Sykes> <Neutral> You have been a liberal Democrat.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've made contributions to many people.
<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now in the last few years, as you noticed, I was very Republican-oriented. But actually, that hurts you because a lot of people won't do business with ease. They won't make your life easy when that happens. But I was very Republican-oriented, and I am a conservative. I'm not so conservative when it comes to the pure aspects of trade.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm the strongest trader there is and maybe that's ever run for office, Charlie. But I will tell you this, when it comes to trade, we have to have smart trade. I'm a free trader. I believe in free trade, which is nice and conservative. But I believe in free trade. At the same time, Charlie, and I think it's so important to understand, we have to have smart trade.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're losing our shirts to other countries, almost in every instance but to other countries. We're losing our shirts to China, to Mexico, to Japan, to India, to many, many countries because we have not gotten our best and our smartest and our finest negotiating...
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> So do you think -- but what would it mean...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think Wisconsin would do a lot better with good trade deals instead of bad trade deals.
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> Well, what would happen to Wisconsin? Because many of our jobs here are involved in import/export. What would happen to the price of goods if in fact a President Donald Trump were to impose a 45% tariff on goods coming in from China...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it will never happen. Wisconsin would end up doing much, much better than it's doing right now. That would never happen. But you have to have the threat out there because what they're doing is currency manipulation. They're devaluing their currencies and they're making it virtually impossible...
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> Well, you're a much better negotiator than I am. But you just said it will never happen. So you've basically given away that your negotiating ploy is a bluff.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's not a threat.
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> Didn't you just say you're bluffing?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You've got to have a threat out there. You've got to have something to negotiate with. And what China is doing to us with devaluation, I mean, they are grand chess players there. They're making it impossible. It's very, very hard to do business with China. And when you do, you're paying a lot of tax, whereas their goods come in without any tax and it's a very unfair playing field and it's not supposed to be that way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The problem is the United States, our leaders -- our so-called leaders in Washington have no clue. They don't know what they're doing and they have no clue. What I'm saying is if they don't do what I'm saying we're going to put a tax on them it could be 45%, but it would probably be less than that...
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> Which would drive up concern with costs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It would depend on the amount of currency manipulation, Charlie. It will depend. But Wisconsin would end up doing much, much more business and would make much, much more profit than they're making right now. China is manipulating their currency so is Japan with the yen.
<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> OK. Mr. Trump, in the moments...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are manipulating their currencies and they don't allow our countries -- our country to compete.
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> All right. Let's talk about what is really at stake here which is of course is the presidential election and the latest Real Clear Politics average shows you losing to Hillary Clinton by double digits. And I guess the question is we're seeing large numbers of Republicans who are saying they will not support you as the nominee.
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> You've insulted just about every prominent conservative thinker and writer in the country: George Will; Charles Krauthammer; Stephen Hayes; Wall Street Journal; National Review; not to mention, Megyn Kelly. Mr. Trump, if you cannot unite conservatives, you can't unite Republicans, how do you think you'll ever unite the country?
<Charlie Sykes> <Neutral> How do you think you'll ever be able to beat Hillary Clinton?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'll tell you, number one, I will beat Hillary. And there are polls that show that I do beat Hillary also. You didn't mention them. But there are numerous polls that show I do beat Hillary one on one. But I haven't started on Hillary yet, number one. Number two, I'm an outsider. I came into this as an outsider.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm a business person. I'm a really good business person. That's what the country needs because we have $19 trillion in debt and the politicians will never -- a guy like Cruz doesn't even know what it means. The politicians will never be able to straighten it out. In a million years, they'll never be able to figure it out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They'll never be able to straighten it out. I came in with things NATO as an example. We pay so much disproportionately more for NATO. We are getting ripped off by every country in NATO where they pay virtually nothing most of them and we're paying the majority of the cost.
<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> OK. If you were to be elected president, you'd obviously have to work with Congress and including our own. You go into his hometown tomorrow, our own Speaker Paul Ryan. How does President Donald Trump work with Paul Ryan?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I do very well. I mean, I spoke to him the other day. He called me the other day. I'm the frontrunner by far. Polls came out recently where I'm way up on Cruz and everybody else frankly. But I mean, I'm -- I think I'm doing very well. Paul Ryan called me the other day. We had a great talk. He understands what's happening very much.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He sees what's going on and he also sees that I'm the frontrunner by a lot.
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> Mr. Trump, before you called into my show, did you know that I'm a #NeverTrump guy?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That, I didn't know.
<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> OK. Well, because I thought it was interesting and people were wondering does Donald Trump know what Charlie Sykes has said about him in the past.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no.
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> And I would give you credit either way on it, but I was wondering...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, I understand. But no, I didn't know that. And -- but I assume you're also an intelligent guy. I know you're an intelligent guy. And you understand what's going on. Our country is getting ripped off left and right by every country we do business with, even in NATO. And by the way, when I mention NATO, people that are big fans of NATO and I'm a fan of NATO, maybe in a reconfigured shape because it's obsolete.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's many-decades old. But people that are fans of NATO and that never thought of NATO in terms of what to do, they're now saying read today's New York Times, read yesterday's New York Times, it's saying, you know, Trump is really right. He really is right about NATO. I mean, guys that had been working on NATO for years didn't see what I've seen in NATO immediately, one of those things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm sure you'll give me credit where credit is due.
<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> Well, I am going to give you credit where credit is due. And I appreciate you talking with me. Obviously, I failed in my effort to introduce you to Wisconsin and our tradition of civility and decency by getting an apology from you for Heidi Cruz or for what you said about Scott Walker.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, am I getting an apology by somebody that sent in -- sent out a picture of my wife to everybody in the side of Utah?
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> And as we know, that was an independent group. And you don't want me to hold you accountable for what your supporters are doing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, is he going to apologize? Is Ted Cruz going to apologize for starting it and sending out that picture?
<Charlie Sykes> <Neutral> And that's your stand.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought it was very inappropriate. And by the way, it was an artsy picture. It was GQ. It wasn't anything horrible. It wasn't Penthouse or Playboy or any of that. But he should apologize to me I think. That's how it all started.
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> Do you ever apologize? Do you ever apologize because you know what most real men when they screw up, they'll go, you know what, I just have a hothead. I shouldn't done that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do apologize. I believe in apologizing. But I think he's -- I think before I would think about apologizing, he owes me an apology because what he did was wrong. He sent out a picture to people in Utah.
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> He didn't, and you know that he didn't. You know that it was a super PAC. But I understand your point.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know he knew about it. I know he knew about it. And there are some people say that his group bought the copyright to the picture from GQ magazine which is a good magazine. GQ is a -- it's a good magazine, Gentlemen Quarterly. It's a good magazine. It's not like a sleazy magazine all right?
<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> You want some free advice, though?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was inappropriate.
<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> I know. Do you want some free advice seriously since you're know here in Wisconsin. Honestly, if you stand up there and you say, folks, let me just say this. I'm running for president, Ted Cruz is running for president. Let's leave our wives out of it. Both of us have married intelligent, beautiful women.
<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> And from now on, we are not going to be talking about one another's wives. People in Wisconsin will love that, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't mind that at all. I think it's great. I think that's fine. Who wouldn't agree to that? I think that great. Again, I didn't start it. He started it. If he didn't start it, it would have never happened. Nothing like this would have ever happened. But he started it so...
<Charlie Sykes> <Negative> But just remember, we're not on a playground. We're running for president of the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I agree with that 100%. And my views are not playground views. My views are that our country is losing on every front. We're losing militarily, we're losing at trade, we're losing in education, we're losing with our second amendment, which is being knocked at every corner and nobody is stronger in the second amendment than I am, nobody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we're losing at every single corner of our country. Especially, we're losing with trade because we're becoming a poor country, because other countries are ripping our country off. And I'm the only one that knows how to stop it.
<Charlie Sykes> <Positive> Donald Trump, thanks so much for joining me. I appreciate it very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK. Thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Wow. Thank you. What a nice introduction that is. How could you do better than Jerry, right? Can't.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> They wanted me in the blue chair. I don't know why.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Thank you everybody, so nice to be here. Appreciate it.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> Well, you know, I've already talked about how your campaign is self-funded, how you have -- you're really sacrificing so much to run -- I mean, the press is so vicious for the family of any candidate, the scrutiny is unbearable. My wife believes anyhow. And what motivated you to run for President of United States when you could have just sat back and ate -- eaten a lot of Wendy's cheeseburgers, like you did on the plane last night?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I could have done that. That's right. That's true.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> Last night when I rode -- I rode with him on the plane and I expected, oh, you know I'm a country boy from Virginia. Here's -- it's going to be champagne and caviar. He brought out Wendy's cheeseburgers and fries, so -- but what motivated you to step out, take the risk and sacrifice so much?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I appreciate that question because it's just, to me, so sad when I see what's happening with our country. When I see our leaders, if we want to call them leaders -- I don't even call leaders. They're not leading and then certainly not leading properly. When I look at what's going on with jobs, when I look at what's going on with the trade deals, when I look at what's going on with this horrible Iran deal where we pay $150 billion dollars for absolutely nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And we get nothing from it other than you're going to end up with nuclear proliferation. It's gonna be all over the place. And I see things like that and then we finally get our hostages back when they get their money. And then I see them go and take our 10 sailors and put guns to their heads, put them in a begging position.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, so many things like this. I look at a Sergeant Bergdahl deal, we get a traitor back and they get five killers back that they've wanted for nine years, OK? So, when I see that -- somebody said, two weeks ago, Donald Trump is angry and the people that are with him are angry, and I'm supposed to say, oh, I'm not angry, I'm not angry.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I get up on the stage, and during the debate, the last debate that I won. The other debate I skipped because I wasn't treated properly. And we have to remember, when you're not treated -- it's true. And by the way, they got lousy ratings, OK? We have to remember -- which I knew it would happen, and they would've broken the record.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But we have to remember, when you're not treated properly, you have to sort of do what you have to do. And that goes for the country. If we're leading our country and we're not treated properly, like the way we've been treated by Iran and many other nations, we have to worry about our country. We have to do that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The nicest part about the debate situation was that we raised six million dollars in one hour for the vets. One hour. So that was -- that was a great thing. But, bottom line, I see all the hats, make America great again. Jerry, when you ask why, we want to make America great again. That's what we want to do. It's very simple.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> I mean, how often do you see a Presidential candidate giving money away instead of taking it? I think that's wonderful. And we -- and we've got a group -- we've got a group here today who's going to receive the second disbursement of that six million dollars that was raised the other night. If -- if that group would come on the stage now.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> It's called Partners for Patriots. Where are they?
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> We're over here.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, they're over here.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> Here we go.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Why don't you get right in the middle.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> We had to leave the Rottweiler.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Fantastic. So, maybe tell us just a little bit about yourself and what you do. Because, you know, we vetted for the vets, but we vetted very carefully and the people that are getting this money are tremendous people. So what do you do?
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> We train service dogs for disabled veterans, to help them -- thank you. To help them live their daily lives. One that you met, Todd Landon, that needs a dog, you know, had had 21 surgeries. His kid has been through so much, you know, serving our country and fighting for us.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So with 100,000 you can do a lot, right?
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> Yes sir.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's just such an honor. It's so great. So, thank you very much. Use it well. Say hello to Todd. Thank you. Beautiful. Thank you honey.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> There's a beautiful Rottweiler right here, but Secret Service wasn't too excited about bringing it up on the stage. But he's gentle, I promise. I don't -- don't know why there was a fear. But we -- you know, we're facing a crisis in this country with ISIS and we -- all the intelligence experts tell us that the ISIS will most definitely infiltrate the refugees that are coming to this country.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> ISIS has more landmass now than any terrorist organization in history. They're beheading Christians. Tell us how you would handle that problem and tell us tell us -- tell us how -- how quickly you think you'd be able to fix it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it's such a big question now. Who would have thought this would have happened? I mean, we've destabilized the Middle East, totally. When we did Iraq -- and I was against Iraq. You know, I'm a strong guy on the military. I don't think there's anybody, I always say, the most militaristic of all. But -- and I want to build our military, Jerry, so strong, so powerful that nobody's going to mess with us. And they won't. But -- but I said -- look at all that press back there, I said to Reuters actually, and others, early on in 2004, 2003, the war is the wrong thing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You're going to destabilize the Middle East if you go take out one of the two. Meaning Iraq or Iran. So we take -- we take out Iraq and what a mess has been created. And then when we got out of it, with Obama, the way he got out of it, by announcing a specific date, the enemy pulls back, they say, I can't believe he's saying this and then they go to town after we leave.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's -- it's just a -- I can't say -- I can't use the term a comedy of errors because there's nothing funny about it. What's gone on is so sad and the decisions are so sad. Now we -- we've created and helped create this massive migration. And plenty of countries have made a mistake. You look at what's going on in Germany, it's a total mess.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, they're having riots over there, the crime is through the roof. And every country -- Brussels. Has anybody been to Brussels? I've been to Brussels a long time ago. It's so beautiful, so everything. It's like an armed camp now. You look at what's going on. It can't happen. So I wanted to create -- and I suggested, create a safe zone.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because we all have heart. Create a safe zone. We've got to get the Gulf states, who are tremendously rich, who frankly are not taking anybody and they're not spending money or much money. And they're not taking anybody. They've got to fund it. We've got to get them de-funded. We're protecting them, we're saving them.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let them fund it. Because we're funding everything and that's why we owe 19 trillion because we make all stupid decisions. So we get them to fund it and we create a big safe zone in Syria or a number of safe zones that people stop. Now they've done this migration through Germany. Nobody knows who the people are.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And we all have heart. We -- I think it's sad to see. But when you look at that line, when you look at that massive migration, you see so many young strong men, right? I mean it's young, strong -- and I said to myself -- first time I noticed it was early on. At first you say, well, you know it's a little unusual because all of these, it just seems to me -- and you look at it. Young, strong men.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So now we're going to take them into our country, we've already started, thousands and thousands. And we don't know, are they ISIS? Is this a Trojan horse? What's going on? You look at what's happening in other countries. We're not going to take any if I'm there. And I'll tell you something, anybody that comes in, sadly I have to tell you, they're going back.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They have to go back. They have to go back. So, there's no way, Jerry. And I've gone to the top law enforcement people, and I've seen them and I've read about them and I've read their statements. The top people. They say there is absolutely no way that you can tell where these people come from. They have no papers whatsoever, there's no background, there's no background check.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's like starting off with a person from zero. They have no idea. We cannot afford this as a country. We cannot afford it from an economic or from, perhaps most importantly, from a security standpoint. So we just can't do it. And interestingly, as you saw the other day, Sheriff Joe from Arizona -- now -- right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He endorsed me, and so did -- and when Sheriff Joe endorse you, you know you're the strongest on -- I will tell you, the whole immigration thing, how that worked out. Illegal immigration. We're going to have a really strong border. We're gonna have a wall. People are going to come in but they're going to come in legally.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They're going to come in legally. But we've got the endorsement. And Sarah Palin and this gentleman, one of the greats. And we got Willie Robertson, who's a friend of my boys and a great shooter. They go hunting together. But Willie was great too. So -- and I think Sarah's coming tomorrow. She's going to be here.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's going to be on the Today show actually, and that's going to be very exciting, so we look forward -- she's going to be on Monday on The Today Show, so that'll be very exciting.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> Yeah, Willie Robertson's a good friend. His --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Great guy.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> His son and his daughter go to Liberty. I had mentioned that and get a little plug. But you know, back in the late 70's, my father was criticized because he saw a candidate who was able to pull voters from across the -- across the aisle, across the -- from other -- the other political party. He saw a candidate who was able to draw people who had never voted before, across all demographic lines.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> It was Ronald Reagan. And he he was criticized because Ronald Reagan was a Hollywood actor. He had been divorced and remarried and my father was a pastor, and Jimmy Carter was a Sunday school teacher and he -- you know, a lot of folks said, how can you support -- and all you had to do is look at -- you know, he said, Jesus said render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's. That means be a good citizen.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> That means, when you walk in a voting booth, you choose the candidate who is most qualified to run the country. It's -- it's like when you have a sick child, you choose the doctor that's most qualified to treat that child. You don't necessarily choose the one that shares your faith. And that's -- that was what he told everybody and people listened.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> And you know Jimmy Carter was a great Sunday school teacher, but look how he did as president. But we -- you know -- we -- but we see 60% of Republicans who are -- who say that the Republicans in Washington have betrayed them. And you know they make promises, they make promises on social issues and they've been doing it for decades.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> They never seem to come through. And you know, I think you're the first candidate, since Ronald Reagan, who's bringing in new voters, bringing them from across the aisle, bringing -- but we -- we've got to get the Republicans who made the promises to start honoring their promises and -- what's your thoughts on that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well one of the things that I found so interesting, because I spoke the other day at Liberty -- and it's an amazing place. What Jerry and Becki have done is absolutely incredible, and they've taken over from their father, and it is so beautiful. And breaking the record was very important to me and you know whose record I broke?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> My record from four years ago, so I'm happy. I thought I would have broken somebody else's. But, you know, the interesting thing is that Jerry has -- every single candidate goes through Liberty University, right? Everybody because it's an amazing place and it's a packed house and these are fantastic young people.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I guess some other people than young but mostly young people. They're amazing people and they all came through. And when Jerry endorsed me, it was such an honor for me because he sees everything. And you know Jerry is -- and he's doing this as an individual. Such an honor for me. And when I look and he said one thing about me -- and he said great about everybody, honestly.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But he said something about me that I like better than anybody else. He said, I most resemble his father from the standpoint of my ideas, my attitude, my way. And I thought that, to me, was the greatest compliment, OK? I thought that was better than anybody else's compliment.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> Well it's true. I mean my father was -- he gave away -- he gave away so many scholarships to help young people that he almost bankrupted the school. And my mom would never let him have the family checkbook because he'd give money to whoever -- whoever was in need and there wouldn't have been enough money left to pay the bills.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> So that when -- when I heard all those stories about how you've privately helped people, it really did remind me of that and so -- but you know, we've got so many people out of the labor force now. We hear reports of five percent unemployment, but it's probably -- when you don't -- when you count the ones who have given up, it's probably over 20%. How -- how quickly do you think you can get those folks back to work and get those jobs back from China and wherever they've gone?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So when they just did the polls, CNN did and others did -- they do poll, and I love these polls. I only like them because I'm in first place. If I wasn't in first place, we wouldn't be talk -- but one of the things that they now start doing, they have these sub tabs and they have everything. You know it's funny, I watch all these candidates, they spend millions of dollars on polling.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I have a lot of money, I don't spend anything -- money. I get it from those guys back there. See all those cameras? They do polls. They do polls. They say, is he a nice guy? Is he a terrible guy? Is he a wonderful guy? Is he smart? Is he tall? Is he's short? What's he like? You know more about -- you said -- you'd have to spend money.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I watch these guys they spend all this money on polling jury -- candidates. Hundreds of thousands of dollars a month. And there they are right there, the networks do it for free. What the hell are they doing polling for? So -- no it's true. It's true. Save your money. But you know it's sort of interesting though, because they did a poll, a big poll.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And on the economy I came out first by so much higher, like triple and quadruple. It was like, you know, they're down at six and five and I'm at 58 and 67. And I mean numbers 68 -- 67%. That's with 15, 16 and 17 people in the race. But we have to bring back our jobs. And by the way, on the polls, number one on security, number one on ISIS, number one on protection, number one in almost every category.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The only thing I wasn't number one on, personality. Can you believe it? They said I'm not a nice person. And I'm a nicer person than all of them. I mean, I'll tell you -- I'll tell you what just happened. What just happened? It just happened today, I read it. It says voter violation. Did you hear about this?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Cruz issued a statement, put it in people's houses, voter violation. Looks like a government voter violation, like oh. And it says -- and it's a social thing. You're not allowed to do it. And they're investigating him now. So he's putting, in houses, voter violation and he's giving people -- you are -- you have an F because you haven't voted enough, bah, bah, bah, down the line.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I never even heard of nothing like because. It is so dishonest. It is so dishonest. Then he took an ad about me and he said that I'm in favor of Obamacare. My whole campaign is against Obamacare. And the only way I can fight it is I have a much bigger platform than anybody else. So when he does -- it's not such a lie.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But what he doesn't say is that he filled out a financial disclosure form, personal financial disclosure form. And on the form -- you know he wants to pretend he's Robin Hood. He's going to protect everybody from Wall Street. Big bad Wall Street, right? He forgot to mention that he's borrowed a lot of money at almost no interest.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Anybody in this room would take the interest rate because he pays almost nothing -- from Goldman Sachs and from Citibank. Forgot to put the two banks on there, forgot to mention it. And then of course his bigger problem is Canada. He was born in Canada and a lot of people are saying he can't even be running for the election, so we'll find out about that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> To me that's a big problem by the way because, if you become the candidate, it's possible you can't even run according to a lot of people. But I have to say that I see so much dishonesty in politics, Jerry. I've never seen anything like it. I think Jerry's in -- doing something where you don't see like we see.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It is so dishonest. First of all, the guys in the back, the press, among the most dishonest people I've ever met in my life. There really are. No, it's true. It's true. True. No, no. they are so dishonest and they'll have a story, that they can take something that's good and make it look bad. I'll tell you, the great thing is -- and I'm talking about only 75 to 80% of them.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There's 20% who are good. But I'll tell you, the great thing is, the people that we're dealing with --
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You're right. The people that -- thank you. The people -- look at those people. Back in the corner. Isn't that beautiful? These -- these rooms -- every room, Jerry, every room we go to is packed. It's -- whether it's a stadium, whether it's in Mobile, Alabama. 35,000 people. Whether it's the Mavericks Arena in Dallas, 20, 21,000 people.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's packed. Oklahoma over 20,000 people, twice. So, I mean, every place we go to, including Iowa -- I mean we go -- I wish you had some bigger arenas here. I will have to tell you. We're going to have to build something. But we have capacity crowds. And what I have found is the people are really smart, Jerry.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They get it. They really get it. And I just want to thank everybody. One of the other things that came out is, by far, the Trump voter, the Trump person is the most loyal, by far. They say -- I -- I should not say this in front of Jerry, because I have to really be -- behave in front of Jerry, right? But they say, Donald Trump can do practically anything and they're still voting for him, they're going to still caucus for him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So I'm very happy about it. But they say that and it's out. I mean, 67 to 69%, regardless, they're with me. And then, just about with him, I think I get into the 90's and other people are at 9 percent and 12% and 19%. So, my people, I just -- I adore you. You are going to make a decision soon, Monday. And I'm telling you, we're going to do a hell of a job.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We are going to make America great again. I promise.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> You know, Donald, I've gotten -- I've gotten to know some of your --
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> I love you Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I love you too. I love you too. Jerry, I don't know. It may be a guy but I love him, OK?
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> Donald, I've --
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> I still love you.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> I've gotten -- I've gotten to know some of your family members and some of your employees, and I've noticed how much your children love you. I've noticed that how loyal your employees are to you and that's not the case when a boss is a tyrant. And I -- I just wish you'd just say a word or two about about your family.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> I think --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would love to, but maybe first, your family. Becki, Mrs. Falwell is here and she's an amazing woman, who I've known over the years. And she's just an amazing person and such a big influence in Jerry, in such a positive way. And I -- I think she's right here. Becki, could you and the family come up please?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Bring your -- those beautiful children and spouses. Come on up, come on up. Come. This is Becki and the family. Introduce your family. Come on family, get up here. I assume the stage can hold us, right? If it doesn't, we have a big story. Good.
<Becki Falwell> <Neutral> That's our son, Trey. He's Jerry Falwell the third, and this is his wife Sarah. And this is our son Wesley, his wife Laura. They just got married, actually, at Trump vineyard and -- last October, in Charlottesville Virginia.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> And we paid -- and we put -- we paid full -- full rate.
<Becki Falwell> <Neutral> And we paid full price. Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, I'll tell you what, I said, I'll give you a deal. He said, I want to pay full price. I said, nobody's ever said that to me before. He insisted on it. It was -- I'm not used to that.
<Becki Falwell> <Neutral> So he charged us double. And this is our daughter Caroline Falwell. Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you honey. Great family all of us.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> All of us married way above ourselves and so did you Donald. If you could introduce --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I would, I'd love to. So, I brought with me, they wanted to be here so badly, my wife. Melania, come on up. Melania. Come on up honey. She's been so supportive. I'll tell you what, Melania actually did one thing that was -- you know, we talk about pollsters, right? She said, you know, if you run you will win.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I said what you mean? If you run you will win. The people respect you and they love you, and you will win. Now, if you don't run, you're never going to get an honest poll, because nobody thinks you're running. So they can poll you and say, if Trump runs, but she said to me -- very good, best advice. She said, that won't work, you'll be -- nobody believes you're gonna run.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Even if they say you're going to run, unless you actually stand up and announce. I said, but what if I stand up and announce and I do badly? That's no good. You know it takes guts to run. Don't kid yourself. She said, if you run you win. And almost from the day we announced we've been in first place, Jerry.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So here's my best pollster. Thank you honey.
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> Hello Iowa. It's great to be here. He will be unbelievable. The best deal maker. The best master negotiator.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, thank you. Thank you baby. Thank you. That's so nice. Thank you honey. And I have somebody that nobody knows, Ivanka and her husband Jared. Come on up Jared. And Ivanka is about eight and a half months pregnant. And the doctor said it would actually be much better if you didn't make the trip. She's very tough, by the way, I have to tell you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right Jared? And Jared is a great young man, went to Harvard, very smart, great. Doing a fantastic job in business. He's in the real estate business, done an amazing job. In his own right, just incredible. But, with Ivanka, so they said, don't make the trip. I say, wait a minute, politically, wouldn't it be great if she had her baby in Iowa?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Wouldn't that be great? Would that be unbelievable? That would guarantee me victory, right? No, but she would -- she's here and we have great love for the people and -- say something honey.
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> Hi Iowa. We're so excited to be here for -- I'm here for the next two days and here to support my father. A man I love very much and I've loved my whole entire life, but also a man who I've stood by his side for the last 10 years and see him make deals that nobody else could get done, and that's what this country needs.
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> So I have no doubt that he will make America great again. But we also need all of you on Monday night to help us do that. So please come out and caucus for my father. He will over-deliver.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you. Thank you man. Thank you honey. Thank you. Thank you everybody. Both families, thank you.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> One last question. What type of qualities are you looking for in your running mate?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, you know, I never like talking about a running mate until I get the deal done. We have to get the deal done -- uh, in all fairness. Because I don't like to think ahead and I -- so many people say, do you have anybody in mind? Do you have -- I like to focus. You know, we started off, Jerry, was 17. They're dropping out like flies, you know that, OK? And you're going to lose a lot after Iowa, you're going to lose a lot after New Hampshire.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> New Hampshire has been an unbelievable place for us. We're leading by tremendous numbers. I will say this, before I answer it, but I will give you somewhat of an answer to that because it's actually a very important question in Iowa. Ready? You have a lousy record. 16 years and you haven't picked a winner.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Please pick a winner this time, OK? I'm going to win. I'm going to win. 16 years. You can't go another four years. You've got to just get it done, get it done right. We're going to win. We're going to win. Leading everywhere, we're going to win. And leading against Hillary in the polls. Now we're leading against Hillary solidly.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I'll tell you this. A friend of mine who's a very political guy said, you know the one person she does not want to run against is Trump. And Chuck Todd, who's a very nice guy. You know he likes to believe the line, this stuff, he goes -- they go, oh yes, we want to run against Trump. We wanted to run -- I said, Chuck, you don't understand, when they say they want to run against you, that means they don't want to run against you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do you understand that? The one person they don't want to run against, and that Hillary does not want to run -- we're going to win. We had a series of big setbacks. We should've won four years ago. We should have won the last election. Should have won it. How that -- how that one was lost -- we had a failed President and it didn't work out, so we're not gonna blame anybody but it didn't work out.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> John McCain had a tough time because there was a little problem with the thing called the economy when he was running, and I think that would have been a hard one. But we certainly should've won four years ago. So, you know, I backed McCain, didn't work. I backed Romney, didn't work. This time I said, let's do it ourselves and do it and get it done.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So -- so, really, 16 years is too long. And one other thing I have to say is, before we get to that --
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> You got Iowa.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I -- you better. These guys -- these are tough sounding guys and I like the sound of that. But -- but I'll tell you, really important. So, it's 16 years, but we have to get it right. We have to get it right. More important than anything else, they want to move Iowa to the back of the pack. You know that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There's a big move, that Iowa shouldn't be first. I give you my word, I'm president, I control it. You're staying right where you are. You're staying right where you are. So is New Hampshire. And, Jerry, it's such an incredible tradition. It's really an amazing -- even the caucus, the whole caucus thing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's complicated, it's tougher. But you know what? You really have to want to have somebody when you're willing to go out and do this. It's actually a great system. I don't know if I'd want to have every state like that, OK? But it's an amazing thing and it's an amazing tradition. And if I win, they're not touching Iowa, it's staying right where it is. And so is New Hampshire, staying right where it is. They're not moving you guys to the back of the pack.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's not going to happen, OK? So just remember that As far as a Vice-President is concerned, I want somebody -- you know it's a very simple test. Who do I think is going to be the best President if something should happen? Because things can happen. Who's going to be the best President? Because that's ultimately what it's all about.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> With that being said, you want to pick somebody that can help you. You want to pick somebody, maybe, from a state that you have to win. One of the things that one of the polls just came out -- in fact, the New York Post, there's a big story today that Trump is winning with Hispanics. A big story. And I'm not surprised because I'm going to bring back jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's actually a big story and become a big story, and Ivanka just showed it to me, that Trump -- you'll see it, New York Post, doing phenomenally with people that are here legally, who are the people that vote. Of course, if you listen to the government, they want to have illegals start to vote too. Pretty soon we're going to have illegals starting to vote if we don't start getting tough and smart, and go back to what it's all about.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But when it comes to the Vice-President, we want somebody that can really be a great President, number one. Always. But somebody that can also help us get to the goal, so that you don't have another four years of losses. And there are some great people out there. I mean, Republicans have some great people out there, and I think we're going to have a tremendous success.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> One of the stories that was written by one of the major media groups was that, if Trump wins -- first of all, the Trump/Hillary -- if she ever gets there. I mean, I don't know if she's going to get there with this email stuff. I mean, is she going to get there? I don't even know. But, if it's Trump/Hillary, it's going to be the largest voter turnout in the history of the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And you know that because the debate that I participated in, not the failed debate, the last one. The debate that I participated -- there were 24, almost 25 million people, with the largest show in the history of cable. CNN, two weeks later, had the largest show in the history of CNN, OK? In the history of CNN.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I'll tell you what, I think if we had gone through, if I wasn't insulted and we went through normal channels and we did the debate, two, three days ago, I think that would have been larger than the 25 million people that they had on the first debate. I think that would have actually surpassed it. But they said, and they said it very strongly, I bring states into play that no Republican is going to think about.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> For instance, the concept of winning New York State is impossible for any of the people that I'm dealing with. Impossible. It's not -- it's not even something -- they don't even campaign there. I think we have a chance to win New York. I mean they like me in New York. They like me in New York. And by the way, if we -- if we win New York.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You talk about a lot of -- you're talking about a lot of delegates, right? But, you know, if we win New York you're talking about a lot. But we're going to win Pennsylvania. We're going to win Virginia. We're going to win Michigan. I'm always talking about the car business being stripped out of Michigan, and the poll numbers in Michigan are incredible.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're going to win Ohio. They did a poll. I like John Kasich very much, but the problem is, they did a poll in Ohio and I'm beating him by a lot and he's the existing -- you know, he's the serving Governor. We're going to win Florida. I'm at 48% against against 16 people. So, I think a lot of states -- a lot of states that aren't even thought of. You know, if you listen right now, because structurally the Republicans have a disadvantage.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But you look at some of these states, they don't even talk about those states as a republic. They're already written off. It's going to amount to basically six states. I think we can win states that aren't even thought of in the normal realm. And you're going to have yourself a victory folks. And I'll tell you what I'm not going to disappear like the last group did three years ago, four years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because that last month I kept saying, where is he? Why isn't he on television? I call his people. Why isn't he doing Jay Leno? Why isn't he doing, you know, Letterman and these shows? And every night you'd see Obama was on television, television, television. And I'd call and say, he has to do Jay Leno, he has to do David Letterman.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Why isn't he? I don't know what happened. They took a vacation the last month of the campaign. It's not going to happen with Trump folks. We're going to win. We're going to win, OK?
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> You know -- you know, I've never done anything like this before. I've never gotten involved in national politics but I am now because I believe our country is at a crossroads. I believe if we get up over 24, 22 trillion in debt, we may be beyond the point of no return. I believe if the next President is not the right president, they're going to be four, up -- maybe up to four Supreme Court Justice appointees that would change this country forever.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> All the values that we hold dear will be gone. And I honestly believe that this man, who has turned companies around in the private sector, can do it for this country and that's why I'm here. And that's why --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you.
<Jerry Falwell, Jr.> <Neutral> That's why I'm so honored to be invited to join you up here. And I -- it's a privilege to me but it's because I believe so much is at stake. We could lose our country if we don't choose a man who is electable and then he's the only one that's electable in my opinion.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you Jerry. Thank you everybody. Thank you very much. Wow. That was so nice. Thank you so much. Thank you Jerry. Thank you Becki and the family. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you everybody.
<Sam Donaldson> <Negative> I'm Sam Donaldson, and welcome to our broadcast. Tonight, we're going to talk about divorce. Yes, we're going to look at the Trumps and other celebrity marriages that get in trouble, but we're also going to look at ordinary divorces -- people who don't have a lot of money, and who have to try to split up a very little pot.
<Diane Sawyer> <Positive> You talk about the Trumps. Of course, it's like the old party game, where you say to someone at a party, "Whatever you do, don't think about a white elephant." And of course, from that moment on, a white elephant is all that they can think about.
<Diane Sawyer> <Positive> Well, all week long, try as we may to resist the topic of the split-up of the Trumps, we were overwhelmed by all the people who were either talking about them, or talking about the kind of people who talk about them, or talking about the fact that you shouldn't be talking about the Trumps. So all of this in the end proved irresistible cultural fodder for our own Judd Rose, who started musing on the particularly American waltz of personal gossip, publicity and power.
<Judd Rose> <Negative> [Voiceover] What nice things were left to say about Donald Trump that he hadn't already said first?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do a book and it becomes the biggest best-seller. And we come out -- I do a game, and it becomes the biggest game in America today. I do things and, for whatever reason, it seems to work.
<Judd Rose> <Positive> [Voiceover] What praise was left to heap on the Trump marriage that Ivana hadn't already offered?
<Ivana Trump> <Positive> We are fabulous team. We are working fabulously together. And we work together, and we work for something. We want to achieve certain things. And I think we're getting there.
<Judd Rose> <Negative> [Voiceover] So now, what's left for us to say about the Trumps except --
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> What's the larger meaning of this dispute?
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Well, the larger meaning is, even Don Trump can bounce a check.
<Jay Leno> <Neutral> Now, I don't know about the settlement. But she gets the house in Connecticut, and I guess he gets to keep New York.
<Judd Rose> <Negative> [Voiceover] Even by their own over-heated standards, the Trumps' split has been grotesque. Other celebrities -- like Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden, or Steven Spielberg and Amy Irving -- have managed to keep their private grief from turning into a public spectacle. But this is the man who wrote the book on hype and self-promotion. So for him and his beleaguered bride, we offer some advice. Don't worry, Don; it's free.Chapter 1: Just Say It Ain't So
<Judd Rose> <Negative> [Voiceover] We knew there was trouble in paradise when Playboy asked you about Ivana, and the nicest thing you called her was "a good woman who does a good job." Don't be so darned obvious. Remember what your good friend Robin Givens once said?
<Robin Givens> <Negative> I want to live with Mike Tyson for the rest of my life, and I want to have little Tysons. That's what I want.
<Judd Rose> <Negative> [Voiceover] Within a month, their marriage was down for the count. Recently, Tom Cruise was quoted all over the place denying there were problems in his marriage. Weeks later: splitsville. If the truth hurts, deny everything. Some reporter is bound to believe it.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> Actor Sylvester Stallone and actress wife Brigitte Nielsen branded as totally false and inaccurate the vicious rumors that they're separating and getting a divorce. "We couldn't be happier and more together," said the Stallones.
<Judd Rose> <Positive> [Voiceover] Of course, denial is one luxury the Trumps can no longer afford. S : Chapter 2: Time For Spin Control
<Judd Rose> <Negative> [Voiceover] Each spouse gets expensive lawyers and publicists to trade accusations and insults in the papers. But who needs a mouthpiece? In his book, Donald Trump says that hiring an expensive publicist is never as good as doing it yourself. He says right here, "One thing I've learned about the press is that they're always hungry for a good story, and the more sensational the better." So our man knows to find a friend in the fourth estate.
<Cindy Adams> <Positive> He's a winner. He does not know the meaning of failure. He probably can't even pronounce it.
<Judd Rose> <Negative> [Voiceover] Everything he can pronounce, he leaks to Cindy Adams of the New York Post. Ivana weeps to Liz Smith of the Daily News. And they turn the cries and whispers into screaming headlines, and grab a share of the Trumps' sleazy spotlight.
<Cindy Adams> <Negative> I've done the most that I can. My paper is not thrilled that I'm everywhere, like crab grass. Neither is my TV show. I'm everyplace. You turn on the set, you have to pay extra to get a TV set that doesn't get me.
<Judd Rose> <Negative> [Voiceover] After a few days of this Trumped-up trivia, that seems like a bargain.
<Liz Smith> <Negative> This has been a media circus. I have been one of its performers. But now it seems to me it's slipping into tragedy. I'm really sorry about that.
<Judd Rose> <Negative> [Voiceover] Not to worry, Liz. The art of divorce means never having to say you're sorry. Chapter 3: The Other Woman
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Call me over the weekend. Call me over the weekend, I want to talk to you. Okay? Over at home. Just call me. Yes. Okay?
<Judd Rose> <Negative> [Voiceover] Of course, everyone's talking about Trump's alleged love connection to the notorious thespian, Marla Maples. This is Marla in her biggest role to date, as the victim of a killer melon. Apparently, Meryl Streep was busy.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> Marla Maples, scene two.
<Marla Maples> <Positive> I don't think you would know the truth if it sat on you!
<Judd Rose> <Negative> [Voiceover] Well, no wonder. Marla isn't talking. Although, in this audition she filmed for a TV soap, she confronted the question all America would soon be asking.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> Were you sleeping with him?
<Marla Maples> <Neutral> That's none of your business.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> Too personal a question, huh?
<Marla Maples> <Positive> Yes.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Well, say "hello" to open season on your sex life, lady.
<Judd Rose> <Negative> [Voiceover] Hey, no kidding. You've seen the headlines. Of course, Trump denies it all, but:
<Richard Mineards> <Negative> What he's been saying about this affair with Marla Maples, I must say, is a lot of BS, quite frankly. Because the more he denies it, the more I think there is credence to it.
<Judd Rose> <Positive> [Voiceover] Well, it wouldn't be the first time a famous guy with a big mouth left his wife for a would-be actress. Just ask Mrs. Joe Theismann. Still, there are rules about this sort of thing. We consulted with Sydney Biddle Barrows, once the notorious "Mayflower Madam," now the author of a book on etiquette -- sexual and otherwise.
<Sydney Biddle Barrows> <Negative> One certainly should not be bringing one's mistress along to vacation with one's family -- one's wife and one's children. One should not be keeping a mistress in the same building as one is living. I understand that -- I've been told, anyway -- that he actually would go downstairs in the Trump Tower and see her. You know, telling Ivana, perhaps, he was going out for a paper. I just think that's awful.
<Judd Rose> <Positive> [Voiceover] Donald Trump discreet? Sure. Right after Don King gets a crew cut. Chapter 4: You Can Take It With You
<Actress> <Negative> That contract is invalid. You have a mistress, Donald!
<Actor> <Positive> Okay. I must remind you, Ivana, that according to section five, paragraph two, I'm allowed to have mistresses, provided they are younger than you.
<Johnny Carson> <Positive> Apparently, Ivana Trump wants half of everything that Donald Trump created in the last 10 years. So he's giving her 6,000 homeless people.
<Judd Rose> <Negative> [Voiceover] Johnny Carson knows of which he speaks. Divorced three times, his marital misfortune has cost him a fortune. Joan Collins, another three-time loser, had a pre-nuptial agreement with number four, but she had to go to court to hang on to her possessions. Splitting up is often the easy part. Splitting up the property -- that's where they draw blood.
<Judd Rose> <Negative> [Voiceover] Divorce lawyers agree: Keep track of everything you own -- what you bought, what was a gift. Make a list of what's rightfully yours. Put your name on things. Of course, that's one bit of advice Donald Trump certainly doesn't need. [Voiceover] From Trump Tower to the Trump Shuttle -- let's face it, Ivana, you may have helped him build that empire, but he's got his name on most of it. So you've got to start small. Ivana the steam iron. How's that sound? Or Ivana the microwave. Not fancy enough, huh?
<Judd Rose> <Negative> [Voiceover] Okay, Ms. Big Shot, how about Ivana the caviar? Or Ivana the -- no, we'll leave this for Donald. Trump the trash masher sounds just right. Then again, we consulted a real divorce expert who said Ivana shouldn't get a thing.
<Zsa Zsa Gabor> <Negative> When I wanted to divorce Conrad Hilton -- and he'd just bought the Plaza, then, for me, and I had a 6-weeks-old daughter, and I was in love with George Sanders -- I didn't charge him for my services, because I knew I was wrong. I left him because I was in love with another man.
<Judd Rose> <Neutral> Charge for your services?
<Zsa Zsa Gabor> <Negative> That's what I call it when American, or any women, ask for alimony. Why should she get alimony?
<Judd Rose> <Negative> And when that marriage ended, you didn't get away with any --
<Zsa Zsa Gabor> <Negative> I didn't even get a suite in the Plaza for free! I get 25 percent off in all the Hilton hotels as long as I live. Chapter 5: Making Change
<Judd Rose> <Negative> [Voiceover] Maybe the best thing to do is make a clean break from the past. Try some radical changes. After battling her ex in court, Roxanne Pulitzer dressed up her image by undressing for Playboy. After she split from Sean Penn, Madonna decided to express herself with a new look and a new man: Warren Beatty. At the very least, Ivana needs some new friends.
<Richard Mineards> <Negative> In fact, many of the people I've spoken to have said on the record, "Oh, darling, she's a wonderful person." And how they feel "d soler." But when you say, "off the record," they say, "My God, she's a real bitch, and I wouldn't really want to have anything to do with her."
<Judd Rose> <Positive> [Voiceover] We know Donald's looking for new friends, so how about a singles ad. Let's see. "Single white billionaire with edifice complex, into self-love, seeks ultra-classy beauty for social climbing and headline-grabbing. Best sex you've ever had. Pre-nuptial agreement a must." Maybe he just wants a younger version of Ivana. Hmm. "Former Olympic athlete from Eastern Europe -- " How about Nadia Comaneci? We already know she likes married men.Chapter 6: Settle For Less
<Cindy Adams> <Negative> Donald Trump is not going to go into court. People who have possibly -- if not secrets, at least large portfolios -- do not go into court unless they're insane.
<Judd Rose> <Negative> Well, insanity's one of the few things you can't lay off on Trump. And he probably does want to avoid a messy, expensive legal battle. There's just got to be a better way. There's just got to be. [Voiceover] The case of the billionaire versus the blonde.
<Judd Rose> <Neutral> The plaintiff: Ivana Trump. She says she deserves more than 1 and a quarter percent of her husband's money. The defendant: Donald Trump. He says, "A deal is a deal." The case of the billionaire versus the blonde; Donald Trump versus Ivana. Doug Llewellyn, do you think it's a case for The People's Court?
<Doug Llewellyn> <Negative> Well, Lord knows it would be a great case for The People's Court. But, unfortunately, there is one major drawback: our limit here is only $2,000. So until the state increases our limit to $2 billion, I think Ivana will just have to take her case to a higher court. To tell you the truth, I think they'd be better off going to Let's Make a Deal.Chapter 7: No Deal Is A Done Deal
<Judd Rose> <Negative> [Voiceover] Finally, never say never again. Maybe those crazy, mixed-up, filthy rich kids just need a little counseling.
<Ruth Westheimer> <Positive> Maybe if these people would come to my office and we would discuss it, maybe, in some cases, from my experience I do know, I might even be of help, and maybe they can work it out.
<Judd Rose> <Negative> [Voiceover] Maybe they can, but don't count on it. Tonight, Donald Trump stared into the glare of the media spotlight he courts so relentlessly, without blinking.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When I decided to do this, I just decided to do something. Two people grow apart. I decided to do it. And I assumed, "Hey, there'll be a story." I never in my wildest imagination would have dreamed that this would be -- I mean, this is bigger than World War III.
<Judd Rose> <Positive> [Voiceover] Colossal ego, outlandish hype, and dubious taste. As always, what is there left to say about Donald Trump that he hasn't already made perfectly clear?
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> Remember, address those cards and letters to Judd Rose, please. As Judd mentioned, one of Hollywood's biggest divorces was the Spielberg split. [Voiceover] Amy Irving reportedly got $112.5 million. It's one thing when you're married to a movie mogul. But what about other women? What are they worth?
<Mimi Gallagher> <Negative> I had a child. I was custodial parent. I had no place to live. My son and I moved 12 times in seven months.
<Diane Sawyer> <Negative> [Voiceover] That question when Primetime continues. [Commercial Break]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald Trump jumped up last week and endorsed Governor Mitt Romney, but within days, Republicans in three states -- Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri -- tell Donald Trump -- well, he's wrong. They don't want Governor Romney. They want Senator Rick Santorum. And tonight, Senator Rick Santorum's three-state sweep is shaking up the GOP race.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald Trump joins us by phone. Good evening, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hello, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> It's nice to talk to you. Before I even get to the topic of Senator Rick Santorum, I'm a bit curious -- I saw your most recent tweet in which you said Jon Huntsman called to see me. I said no, he gave away our country to China. Now, that's the second Jon Huntsman tweet today. What's going on between you and Governor Jon Huntsman?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, nothing. I hate to see when people give up pieces of our country, and a big, big piece was given during his reign. So he wanted to meet with me. I just said no. What's the purpose? And that's it. And you know, I was very disappointed in the way -- in what he did, what he said and his attitude toward China.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think his attitude toward China is suicidal and terrible.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Did he call after you first tweeted about him today, in which you said China did a major number of us during the reign of Jon Huntsman? He was easy...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, no, no. He called...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> ... pickings.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... a while ago. No, no, no. He called a while ago, Greta, and I decided not to see him. He wanted to see me, and I said no.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, you're also poking a stick in his eye on Twitter.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I mean, I'm just disappointed when people give away chunks of our country, and he gave away one big chunk of our country. The good news is we can get it back if we're smart and tough. But he gave away a lot. He did a very, very poor job.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, one last question. Did he call today looking to come to see you? It looks like from this tweet that...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, no, no. Not at all, a while ago.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. OK. Was that -- was that before he got out of the campaign...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> --or since he...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was before he got out of the campaign. Yes.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> OK. Now to Senator Rick Santorum. He is your next -- you have a video out today in which you talk about Senator Rick Santorum. What do you say in the video, and why?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, essentially, I have nothing against Rick Santorum. I think he's -- he seems like a nice guy. I don't know him. I spoke to him once very briefly. He called me and -- just to talk about something, and whatever it was doesn't matter. But he ran for the Senate. He was a sitting senator, ran again for the Senate as an incumbent.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He lost by 19 points. It was a record in the history of U.S. Senate for an incumbent. He lost, and now he wants to run for president. And I made the analogy today, that's like a student that gets thrown out of high school for bad marks, but wants to -- and then decides to go to the Wharton School of Finance.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I want to go to the Wharton School of Finance -- which is a very tough place and a great school. So you know, it just doesn't work that way, in my opinion. He ran, he lost by a tremendous amount, almost record-setting. In fact, it was record-setting. And all of a sudden, he wants to become president. I just don't think it works that way.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The people in Pennsylvania threw him out and they threw him out by a wide margin, and they obviously weren't happy. And now he's going to be president. Tell me about it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, that's a very interesting point. He's been questioned about that. And I suppose if he were here -- let me just tell you what I think he'd say tonight because I did a little research. He would say that in 2006, the year that he was beaten by 17 points by Senator Casey, that 23 of 33 races nationwide the Republicans were defending in the Senate, they lost 23 of 33, that they lost just in Pennsylvania five conservative districts that year.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And they lost the Republican governorship in Pennsylvania by 20 points that year, and they've now regained it by 10 points. So I guess he's saying that 2006 was a really lousy, lousy year for Republicans in Pennsylvania.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, maybe it was and maybe it wasn't. All I know is he lost by a record number. And I think, you know, how do you lose like that? Maybe it's time to go into a different business, become a lawyer, but you're not running for president. The people of Pennsylvania didn't like him. They thought he didn't do a good job, he didn't represent them well.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They threw him out. Somebody beat him by tremendous numbers. And all of a sudden, he says, Let's become president. Give me a break.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, he -- apparently, they may not like him so much in 2006 in Pennsylvania, but they like him in Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri and Colorado, at least tonight, more than they like your candidate, Governor Mitt Romney. And he is ahead of Speaker Gingrich in the number of delegates so far. So he can't be doing that poorly.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look, I have nothing against him. I just, you know, find it rather hard to believe that he put himself in a situation where he is running. And you know, it's very early. In theory, that did not matter yesterday. There were no delegates. And let's see what happens. I mean, maybe you're right, Greta. Maybe over the course of time, he'll be some great candidate and a great president, who knows, if he wins.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I don't think that's going to happen, frankly. And I think when people look at his record in Pennsylvania, they're going to find out that, you know, there was a reason he got thrown out.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Turning to the issue today about the contraception in the health care law and the HHS rule that has caused so much discussion, to put it bluntly, in the nation -- is this issue one that can have long- reaching political ramifications, or are we going to talk about this for 24 hours and move on?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, I think it's going to be very bad. And I think it's a very bad issue for President Obama. And I'm not even sure that if he turned around rather quickly -- and it doesn't look like he's going to, at least not quickly -- I'm not sure he recovers from it easily. You have a huge Catholic population in particular.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I think a lot of these people are going to be voting against Obama. I can tell you the officials of the church, as you know better than I do, they're very, very upset. So it'll be interesting to see, but so far, he's taken a hard stance, and a lot of good political people are very surprised by it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> If -- if what -- some people are predicting, or at least there are rumors out there, and I think even Defense Secretary Panetta said it -- that it is likely that Israel could go alone against Iran in the next couple months -- does that -- with an international crisis like that -- and it would be a crisis -- would that -- do you see that as having an impact on the election come November?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, if you look at my Twitters and some of the things I've said, I have a feeling that this country's going at it and Obama might go at it because, frankly, he'll be very popular for a matter of weeks and maybe get elected because of it. So I actually have predicted that. I said that we will go against Iran.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Our president for a short period of time will be very, very popular because of what he does because if you look at Bush, after the Iraqi situation, I mean, nobody could have beaten him. Of course, about two months later, he became very unpopular again. But I think that -- and I've said it and I hate to say it. I don't like saying it, but I think something could happen for political reasons.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And that's pretty sad. The fact is that we hold the cards. Iran doesn't hold the cards. They know they don't hold the cards. And it seems inconceivable that we can't get them to the table and make an unbelievable deal. And I'm talking about from strength, not from weakness. We hold the cards, Greta. I'm talking about only from strength.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You say political. Are you suggesting -- just so I have this clear -- that President Obama would make a decision on what we do vis-a-vis Israel and Iran for his own selfish political benefit, or are you saying something very different and -- that I misunderstood you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, you didn't misunderstand me. I think that there could be a political motive behind it, and we'll see if that happens or not. I would like to see it not happen. I really believe we're in such a strong position that, frankly, Iran should drop to their knees and make a deal with us. But for some reason, I guess we just don't talk to anybody.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Gas prices going up between now and November or not?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They're going up tremendously. They've already gone up. If you look over the last four weeks, they've already gone up. And I think this could be a big factor in the election also. I really believe that the gas prices are going through the sky, even though less is being used, but the fact that OPEC is strangling us because we have nobody to talk to them and tell them what's going to happen and tell it like it is, our gas prices absolutely are going up. And they've gone up a lot in the last four weeks.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, thank you. And as you know, I'll be watching your Twitter account, as I always do. I follow you on Twitter. So thank you, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, thank you very much, Greta.
