<Steve Scully> <Negative> Mr. President, two and a half years into your presidency. What's been the biggest learning curve? What's been your biggest frustration?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I think probably in terms of a learning curve, it's a little patience, it doesn't go as quickly as it can do and as you do in private. But, not that much different than I expected. We've accomplished a lot, I think, you know, I go around saying, Steve, that we've accomplished more maybe than any president has in two and a half years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I've loved every minute of it. We've had fun. I think the biggest frustration is the way the media covers me, the way that media covers perhaps this agenda. And I'm disappointed by it. I'm very surprised by it. Generally I think over my lifetime I've gotten pretty good press, and here, no matter how big a victory, they really cover it incorrectly, and hence the term fake news etc.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> etc. I'd say that's been somewhat of a disappointment. I thought that after I won, I was covered, I thought, very poorly during the campaign, I thought after I won, they'd be different. And actually they've probably gotten worse. So, that would be somewhat of a disappointment to me.
<Steve Scully> <Negative> What is fake news?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, when you do something and they report it incorrectly. And the problem is that I would know and the public wouldn't, although I think the public, a lot of the public, believes in me when I say it. So I would know what happened, and when they cover it, knowing what I know, but they cover it incorrectly, that to me is fake news.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it's unfortunate that it takes place, but it does, and at a level that I wouldn't be believed. And also with frequency. It's pretty amazing, actually.
<Steve Scully> <Positive> I went back to your book, The Art of the Deal, and you wrote quote, "Most people are surprised by the way I work. I prefer to come to work each day and just see what develops." Do you take that same approach, or do you adjust that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I do. I think, you know, you get in and I say, what's the event of the day, what's going on, who's calling, what's happening, and my life has been a pretty rapid, you know, I've seen a lot of changes, a lot of rapid changes. I see it certainly in the White House. You come in and everything is going great, and then you find out that there's a tremendous conflict with another nation, you know, big stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There's something happened with respect to another country, or something happened with respect to a tragedy that takes place. I mean, things happen when you're president, and I take it very seriously. So, yeah. You have to see what happens that morning. You have to see what happens that evening. No question about it.
<Steve Scully> <Negative> What was your most difficult day thus far?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well we've had a lot. I mean, you know, when you have a school shooting, is tremendously, it angers me actually, really angers me. It frustrates everybody. You say, how could a thing like this happen, how is it possible, when you see innocent children being killed, teachers? That's something that you just never can really get over, and you say, is there something we can do? What can we do? What can, you know, because there's so many different sides to it.
<Steve Scully> <Neutral> What can we do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well you can do a lot of the things that we've done. We did a report. The Florida shooting was horrible. And for some reason, that group of people, they're terrific, I got to be friendly with a lot of them. And we did a report, and they really appreciated the report. We did it with them, and with experts, and I'm going to give you a copy of it, because I'd like to, I actually have another meeting, I think it was really comprehensive, really good.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And there were a lot of red flags with that shooter. I think they said there were 36 red flags, and you're pretty disappointed, you know what I mean by a red flag? There were warnings out there. This was not a Boy Scout, and people didn't do what they should have done. And now there are other cases where there are no warnings whatsoever, it comes out of the blue.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Maybe in certain ways that's almost more frustrating, because you'd say how could a thing like this happen. So those are events that really are, they're very tough to take when you're the president of a country.
<Steve Scully> <Negative> You've talked a lot about Baltimore in the last 48 hours.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have.
<Steve Scully> <Positive> It's not the record that you have with African-Americans, but it's the rhetoric that we've been seeing. And I want to go back to what you said on election night. You say, "Now it's the time for America to bind the wounds of division. I say it's time for us to come together as one united people. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's true. And I mean it maybe even more now than I meant it then. But there is a tremendous divide between Republicans and Democrats, between ideologies, you know, whether it's health care, I listen to some of the health care plans that would be so destructive, and you see what we're doing, and you see what, you know, when you want to take 180 million people off private health insurance where they love it, they just love it. They fought for it. They want it. They work hard for it. And you want to take it away from them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There is a divide. And that's one of many things. And I'm actually surprised by the level... Look, it was here for President Obama. It was here for President Bush. It was certainly here for President Clinton if you go back. But there is a divide, there's no question about it. And I think it can change, I really do. It started on a bad foot when this whole hoax was created with the Russian hoax.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Today you see there, somebody even said it with respect to Mitch McConnell. Mitch McConnell could not care less about Russia. It's when they start, they throw out these phrases, and they think it's wonderful, and they say let's play it. I do believe that there's a chance that we can do something. Probably it would be in a second term.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I really think we could probably do something, and a lot better. That would be one of the things that I'm a little bit surprised at. I thought there'd be better unity. We're accomplishing a lot. We're getting what we want. The military is being rebuilt, the tax cuts we got, the regulation cuts are the biggest of any president in history, even if it was a much longer term of years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But with all of the things that we've got, I mean think of VA Choice, think of all of the things that we've got, you would think that that would make people happy.
<Steve Scully> <Neutral> But they read the tweets. Do you think that that you're a uniter as President?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well if I got fair coverage, I wouldn't even have to tweet. It's my only form of defense. If the press covered me fairly, I wouldn't need that. But they don't cover me fairly. For instance, today I was in Jamestown. I made a speech that was said to be a very good speech. It was not a political speech at all.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It talked about 400 years ago. I mean it an amazing, very important period of time. And there was one protester stood up. And he stood up and he held up a sign, and he said, whatever he said, something. He got more publicity than the speech got. Now I don't need publicity, Steve, at all, but I just thought it was so terrible, and it was on Fox with John Roberts, and he talked about the protester for almost the entire segment of that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I said, isn't that a shame. One guy stands up, not an impressive person, he stood up and he got all of this. He took the whole thing away. One person. It wasn't like, gee, we have 25,000 people going crazy. There was one person. And I say, that's pretty sad.
<Steve Scully> <Neutral> We cover your rallies in their entirety. We'll be with you Thursday in Cincinnati.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, you do.
<Steve Scully> <Neutral> When you're standing behind the podium looking at that crowd, what are you thinking?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well for one thing I'm thinking that never in the history of politics has that happened, and you understand what I mean, because I've never had an empty seat. I don't believe, from the beginning, from the time I came down the escalator, and I think, you know, because you do cover it really well, one of the reasons I'm doing the interview, respect for you and also the fact that you do really do a good job of covering the rallies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But others cover the rallies too. I don't think we've had an empty seat. I don't think you've seen an empty seat, with thousands of people outside. And sometimes we take ads or we communicate, please don't come. Think of it. We'll have a 22,000-seat arena, including like a basketball, an NBA arena, or even bigger stadiums, we've never had an empty seat.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And when you think about that, it's never happened before. When you look at, I saw Biden's opening, where he couldn't get 150 people to an opening in a little basketball, high school gymnasium. And it's a very unique thing. I will tell you, people are surprised that I look comfortable. But there's such love in those arenas, there's such love in those stadiums and those rooms that I speak in, it's really not hard.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's hard to explain that to people. I have friends that are very successful. They say, how do you get up, and much of it is not even, you know, sometimes I'll have a teleprompter, or I'll have some notes or something, but much of it's just off the cuff, because there's tremendous love in those rooms. There's an amazing, and I'm sure that you see that, it's an incredible love.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I have to say that I believe that it's stronger now than it was even Election Day in 16. I really believe it's stronger now than I've ever seen it before.
<Steve Scully> <Negative> When Congressman Elijah Cummings calls you a racist, your reaction is what?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think the word has really gone down a long way, because everybody's called a racist now. Her own party called Nancy Pelosi a racist two weeks ago. The word is so overused, it's such a disgrace. And I can tell you, I'm the least racist person there is in the world as far as I'm concerned, and they use it almost when they run out of things to criticize you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They say he's a racist, he's a racist. Now in some cases it's true, there are people that are racist, bad people. But with me, they have a hard time getting away with it, and they don't get away with it. And if you look at what I've done for African-Americans between, I mean look at criminal justice reform.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> President Obama tried so hard to get it, he couldn't get it. You look at Opportunity Zones. And then of course, look at, the Opportunity Zones are a tremendous success by the way, not covered. But we did that as, really an experiment. It's most successful. I think it's one of the most successful things ever done for the inner cities.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's turned out to be... Tim Scott of South Carolina worked very hard on it, so many other people did. And it's really become a great success. The biggest beneficiary are African-American, the African-American population. It's incredible what's happened, but between that criminal justice reform, and then of course the biggest thing is the lowest unemployment rate in the history of this country for African-Americans, lowest in the history by far, it's not even close.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So when you when you see those things, and when people, I mean if the news, the lame stream, or mainstream, or whatever you want to call it media, or fake news, if it would be covered, people would feel a lot different. But they don't talk about that. They don't talk about Opportunity Zones. I don't think I've ever seen anything about Opportunity Zones.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think I've seen, you know, when I did criminal justice reform, everybody would say, oh, I won't tell you names because I'm not looking to build them up, but the biggest names were there on the other side, liberals, and conservative side, it was very bipartisan. But they don't even talk about it anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If somebody else did it, if President Obama did criminal justice reform, which is so good for the African-Americans, so good, so important, you know, letting Alice out, getting... 28 years left to serve. Jack Johnson, who was so unjustly convicted, the great heavyweight champion from the early nineteen hundreds.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean so many things we've done. When, if President Obama did that, it would have been great. But when I do it, when I do it, Steve, when I do it, people don't want to talk about it.
<Steve Scully> <Negative> But there's a Quinnipiac poll that said 80 percent of African-Americans believe that your rhetoric is racist. So why is that message not getting out?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because the press doesn't put what I've accomplished for African-Americans out, they really don't. They don't talk about criminal justice reform. I did it. It was hard to do too, I had to get people that, really, I had to really twist arms. It was hard to get some of the people and we got it. It's being hailed in certain, many people hail it, they talk about it, but they don't even mention that I had anything to do with it. It couldn't have happened without me. I was the one that was able to get it done.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, if the press treated me fairly, I don't want to complain, in the meantime I'm president, right, so how bad can it be. But the truth is, if I wasn't able to get out my own message, I would not be elected anything, because the press is very unfair. Now, if the press did treat me fairly, I'd have tremendous support from the African-American community.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, when Kanye West comes out and supports me, it has a big impact. Jim Brown, I have so much support, Evander Holyfield, Mike Tyson, so many of these, really representatives, athletes, and so many more, so many more. But when Kanye did it, it was very interesting, because my numbers went really, you probably saw it, they really...
<Steve Scully> <Neutral> We covered it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the interesting thing is, people heard, they said well wait a minute, we didn't know this about President Trump. But that's the facts. That's the way it is. And we're not like, for instance I'm doing an interview with you, people seeing that well, they're going to say well, I didn't know he did criminal justice reform.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was a Clinton thing that was horrible. And Biden. It was horrible for African-Americans. I'm the one that opened it up and got it unclogged. It was a terrible situation where people were going to jail for 50 years over something that in some cases wouldn't even be thought of for a year, or six months, or in some cases for nothing today.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it was a very unfair thing. I'm proud of it. But you know, I get, people don't talk about it, the media doesn't talk about it.
<Steve Scully> <Negative> As you know, John Kennedy relied on Dwight Eisenhower, George W. Bush relied on his father, Bill Clinton relied on Richard Nixon, have you reached out to former presidents, and if so, who and why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not too much. I mean I speak with George Bush. Spoke a little bit to the father. But really not too much. I mean it's hard when people were against you. I very much disagreed with the war in Iraq. So it's hard to say that all of a sudden I can forget that. I mean I'm in a situation where we're in the Middle East, where we've defeated, as you know, the caliphate in Syria.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We did, I did that because, I did that, I wanted to do that, and we did it, 100 percent of the caliphate. When I was at 99 percent, people said, oh you can't pull out, you can't pull out. Well, when I took it over it was a mess. Anyway, I defeated 100 percent caliphate. That doesn't mean ISIS doesn't go running around bombing a store and doing what they do, because they're stone cold crazy, but we've done a great job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I disagreed very strongly on having gone into the Middle East. We're in there now for more than $7 trillion, thousands of lives, millions of lives, you have to count both sides, because I actually count both sides, millions of lives. And they went into a country that did not knock down the World Trade Center, OK. They didn't knock it down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was not Iraq, and it was not Saddam Hussein. He had plenty of problems, OK, he was not a good person. But he didn't knock down the World Trade Center. So we got stuck in this quicksand, but we're extricating ourselves and we're getting out. I call them the endless wars. The endless wars have to end. And we're doing very well, and our military is being built up at a level that has never been built before.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When I took over, our military was depleted, totally depleted, and now it's being, you know, big numbers, but those numbers are more important to me than almost any numbers, because if we don't have protection from bad actors, then we're going to be in big trouble.
<Steve Scully> <Negative> But all of that is coming at a price. So back in 2011, you tweeted, "I cannot believe the Republicans are extending the debt ceiling. I encourage them to stop this. It's an embarrassment." And yet your spending is going to be far exceeding what Barack Obama spent, another $2 trillion into debt.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure, but the difference is, he wasn't building up the military. The military was getting depleted. I have to build it up, and I have to build it up from both Bush and from Obama, because with Bush, you know we were in these wars all over the place, and with Obama the same thing, they just never ended. You look at Afghanistan.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're spending $50 billion a year, $50 billion. Now we've pulled back a lot, I mean, I don't know if you know that, but we have, and we're continuing to.
<Steve Scully> <Neutral> Will we pull out?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well we're going to see. We're working on negotiating a deal right now, as you probably have heard. And at some point, we want to get out as quickly as we can. But Afghanistan is one thing. And with Syria we're just about out, as you know, and we defeated the caliphate, and we're just about out. And no, I want to get out of these crazy wars that we should have never been in. We shouldn't have been in these wars.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These wars are wars... We could have done great damage through intelligence and other things, and not having gotten in. Now at the same time, I want to have the strongest military on the planet Earth, and we do, we now do. When I got here, it was really in bad shape. It was, I can't even tell you how bad it was.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And now we have new fighter jets, we have new missiles, we have, our nuclear has been totally renovated, fixed, and in some cases made brand new. We have tremendous submarines that we are building right now, tremendously powerful submarines, nuclear submarines. And a lot of good things are happening. I think we're going to end up making a deal with Russia where we have some kind of an arms control, because all we're doing is adding on to what we don't need, and they are too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> China is trying to catch us both. Right now it would be us, then Russia, and then China. But China's actually way behind, but they're trying to catch us. And one of the things I've done is, China had the worst year they've had in 27 years. I was in the Wall Street Journal yesterday, Steve, and they are not, they're not doing too well right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're tariffing them, we're taking in many, many billions of dollars. I'm taking care of our farmers out of those tariffs because China hit them as a way of retaliating against President Trump. And I said, I'll tell you, our farmers are great patriots, they're incredible, and our farmers are going to be ultimately the biggest beneficiary.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, a lot of good things are happening with respect to that. You know what, talking to China right now, but really, it's going to be up to me. We cannot let China do what they've done to us over the last 25 years. They've taken hundreds of billions of dollars out of our country every single year, hundreds of billions, with a B, not millions, billions.
<Steve Scully> <Positive> But you think you can reach a deal?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I can reach a deal if I want to. I think they're right now hurting, the tariffs are killing them, companies are moving out of China, they're going all over, including they're coming here, by the way, because they don't want to pay the tariffs. And yeah, I think I'm going to reach a deal. Absolutely.
<Steve Scully> <Negative> Let me follow up on two real quick points. First of all, you've issued 43,000 tweets. Did you ever regret sending one out?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Not much, you know, honestly not much. I sent the one about the wiretapping in quotes, and that turned out to be true. Remember the big deal that was? I heard like about a minute after I sent that, I was called by my people, sir, did you say, I said, yes, I did, what's the big deal? And the reason it was such a big deal is it turned out to be true.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I guess you could say, a lot of the times, the bigger problem is the retweets, which you know, you retweet something that sounds good but it turned out to be from a player that's not the best player in the world, that sort of causes a problem. But overall, I would say no, not at all. I think it's a modern-day form of communication, and it's not really tweet.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's a typewriter. What it really is is, as soon as I do it, you put it on, everybody puts it on, it's breaking news. We have, every time I put out a tweet, even if it's good morning everybody, they say we have breaking news, the president has just said good morning. It's an incredible way of communicating, and you get it out fast.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Otherwise, I mean, I don't know, how would I combat news that's dishonest? How would I combat a reporter or a network that's totally dishonest? CNN is, you know, 100 percent negative. NBC is negative. I made a lot of money for NBC with the Apprentice. It was a tremendous success at a time when they didn't have any successes, but they forgot about that very quickly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, and they wanted to extend me, they went to do anything, I wanted to run for president. And I think we've done a great job. The country is right now on the right path. And I think we have tremendous potential. You know, you take a look at the European Union, that's doing poorly. You take a look at China, it's doing really poorly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You take a look at other countries, they're not doing well. We're the hottest country in the world. We're doing great economically and otherwise. We now have a very strong military, a lot stronger after this last budget. And then at some point very soon, I'll be able to cut back. But we had to rebuild our military.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We didn't have a choice. You know, it's wonderful to say we have a balanced budget. But if we can't protect ourselves, having a balanced budget doesn't mean anything.
<Steve Scully> <Positive> Final question. As you approach this job, in a day in the presidency here in the White House, walk us through that day.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I stay up late. I like to read a lot, which is, people don't understand it, but I do read a lot. I also watch a lot. It's sometimes...
<Steve Scully> <Neutral> A lot of Fox?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I watch a lot of Fox. I tend to not watch too much of CNN because, I mean, it's just, it's just such incorrect reporting. That's why their ratings went down so low. Although I'll be watching the debates tonight. You know, if I didn't, you'd say I can imagine, you know, I would like to know who I'm going to be running against.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Maybe you'll tell me after this interview, right?
<Steve Scully> <Neutral> You tell me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know. I mean, I would think the four or five top ones would seem to have a big edge. You have some people that shouldn't even be wasting time. But I would think the four or five top ones would be the ones that would be, you know, certainly have the best chance of getting in.
<Steve Scully> <Negative> There's a picture of your dad in the credenza in the Oval Office. Would he be surprised that you're president today?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he was always very proud of me. I did, you know, I went to schools, I did well. He just was very proud of me. And I came into his business, he was a man that never let anyone sign a check, and when I came in, I could sign checks, you know, he was just a very strong guy who just was a very dominant figure, and yet a very good man.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was a very good person, he had tremendous heart, but a strong person. He'd be only surprised in that he never thought I'd be running for politics, for office. I think if I said I was going to run for president, I think he'd probably say I'd have a chance at doing it. So he never got to see this unfortunately, he died a little while before, but he was 93. And he led a good life.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was a good, good man. Great mother, great father, great brothers and sisters, but, so in that way I was very, very lucky. But I think my father would say that if I wanted to run, I think he'd have probably said I would have done very well. Now who knew this was exactly going to happen? Who can say that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean you have political families that everybody thinks are going to do great, and they didn't do so great. But my father would have been very proud. He loved this country. And he had confidence in me.
<Steve Scully> <Neutral> Your big agenda in a second term would be what?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think getting costs, now that the military is very close to being totally rebuilt, I think costs are going to be a big factor. We want to strengthen up Social Security so that nobody gets hurt later on. I'm going to strengthen a lot of the things up that really, I think we're going to do very strong health care, very, very strong health care, it's very, very important to me because you don't have, Obamacare is not good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We've managed Obamacare really well, and I had a decision to make, do I manage it well, or do I manage it purposely poorly? Politically I should have managed it poorly, but we've managed it really well, much better than they managed it. It's still too expensive, and it's still not good health care. So we're going to make something really good, and I will leave that for the beginning of my second term.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If we can win the House, the Senate and the presidency, we will have health care that's going to be phenomenal, and many other things. We have a lot of things to do.
<Steve Scully> <Negative> But just to be on the record, some budget cuts are in the works potentially in a second term?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh absolutely, sure, we'll be, we'll be... Well, just in terms of the military, once we're, you know, a lot of this money, Steve, is going to rebuilding, is ordering new planes. After you have a certain number of planes, they last for a long time. We have planes that were 45, 50-years old. You know the story, you've reported on it, right, where the grandfather flew the same plane as the young grandson that's now flying, OK. I mean we had old equipment.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We were getting parts from the graveyard in the desert, the plane graveyard, where they had the old, they don't make the parts anymore. They were getting parts, it's ridiculous. Now we have brand new F-35s and F-18s, and we have the best missile systems in the world, new Patriots, new Tomahawks, the best submarines, nobody's even close in submarine technology to us. And no, we have phenomenal stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have aircraft carriers coming on. We have the President Gerald Ford coming on, and it's out on sea trials right now. So we have a lot of really great things happening.
<Steve Scully> <Positive> Mr. President, we thank you for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Great honor. Thank you.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> President Trump, thank you for being with us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much Catherine.
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> Did the Attorney General make the right call refusing to go to the House Judiciary Committee because he'd take questions from committee staff lawyers?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think so it's not up to me. It's up to him, and they were going to treat him differently than they've treated other people and, of course, we've been treated differently to start off with. We've gone through, so many investigations, everybody and it's so ridiculous. No obstruction. No nothing, There's been no nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's been no collusion. There never was. They knew that from day one.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> Well, thank you, Donald. It's October 31st, the day we were told over and over again we would be leaving the European Union, but not so. I was a bit disappointed by that and thought we'd debate that this evening and I was cheered up because I got a very important phone call from someone, well, let's call him Donald from Washington shall we. And I started off by asking him whether he, as a Brexit supporter, was disappointed that the UK had not left the European Union.
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> Let me ask you...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He should be -- he should be treated the same way as other people are treated, and they're not doing that.
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> So he's not being treated fairly? Is that what you saw yesterday in the Senate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Not -- no, not when they want to bring in people -- outside people -- to interview him or other people on staff to interview him. No, I mean, they're politicians They're supposed to be good at doing it, and, I don't know. I thought -- I thought he was fantastic yesterday. He was very truthful, very straight up, a very solid person.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great person, and I think that -- no they're not treating him fairly.
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> I want you to respond to some comments from the chairman of that committee, Jerry Nadler. He likened you to a quote dictator today, and he's threatened to hold the Attorney General in contempt.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, I have been probably a person, that's given more to a so-called investigation than anybody ever in the history of this country. 1.4 million pages or documents, hundreds of people have been interviewed. I've allowed lawyers to be interviewed. I didn't have to do any of it. I could have used presidential privilege.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I think Boris is and I am and you are we're all disappointed. I think it's a good thing for the UK. The concept of what they're doing. I was in favor of it originally. Remember I was out opening up Turnberry at the time and we had a massive amount of press more than you would normally have for opening a -- a club, and I said that it was going to pass and everybody laughed and I was right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you were right.
<Nigel Farage> <Neutral> Yup.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it did. But it's been a long time since that day and -- and the day of reckoning.
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> Yeah I mean it's been very difficult for Boris in one sense that he inherited a difficult position from Mrs. May and you said --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes she did.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> And you said to me that he would bring some energy to the job. Well, I think, compared to his predecessor, he's brought a lot of energy. But he -- he also --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I've been the most transparent president in history. I don't think anybody has been as open as I have. And you know the reason I was? Because I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't do anything with Russia. So I said give me all the documents you want, give him all the people you want. Somebody told me there was 500 people that were interviewed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I could have stopped all of it. I didn't do that, and now we win with Mueller, where they come up very strongly with no collusion and no obstruction. No nothing. We win very strongly, and now they want to do it all over again? Now, we won in the house. We won in the Senate because Senator Burr said there's been no collusion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we went through that. We won here -- I mean, the Mueller report was a total win. But think of it. We go through this. This is two and a half years now I've been going through the same thing, and the guilt is on the other side, it's not on our side.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> So are you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The guilt is on the other side.
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> So are you saying the House committee should be satisfied with the findings in the Mueller report and they should not do independent oversight?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think they should be satisfied with the findings. They spent 35 million -- now somebody told me today, maybe $40 million on the Mueller Report. They had 18 people, most of whom, I think, all of whom disliked Donald Trump. They were Democrats, they contributed to the campaign of Hillary Clinton, they had conflicts all over the place, and it still came out no collusion.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can't imagine they can keep doing this. This is done just to try and bring me down to -- and I had my highest poll numbers today, which is -- you have to explain that to me, because, with all that, we do, I had my best poll numbers so with -- with -- yeah, I think they're treating us very unfairly, I think it's time to get down to business.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to do infrastructure. I want to do prescription drug pricing -- low. I want to do all the other things that we want to do. Nobody's done more -- it's an incredible thing Catherine. Nobody's done more than President Trump and this administration in 2 1/2 years, ever, in their first 2 1/2 years, and despite that, I'm wasting time with all of this stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> He also picked up this deal that Mrs. May have tried to do which was, in fact, the new EU treaty. And Boris has picked up that treaty and try to improve it. I mean, has he spoken to you about the details of this deal?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes he has, and he also knows how difficult it is. He's in a very difficult position. And I think he's willing to do what nobody else would do. I also think he's looking very much at the United States because we can do much more in trade. You know we're much bigger than we were when I took office. We've grown a tremendous amount and China's gone in the opposite direction as you know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We've gained trillions of dollars in value and worth and they've lost trillions of dollars, so we're far and away the largest economy in the world and we wanted to trade with the UK and they want to do trade with us and to be honest with you this deal under certain aspects of the deal, you can't do it. You can't do it. You can't trade.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, we can't make a trade deal with the UK and we can be -- because I -- I think we can do many times the numbers that we're doing right now and certainly much bigger numbers than you're doing under the European Union.
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> Well, I'm not you, I'm not you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, Boris wants to be very careful with it.
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> Yeah, but that's the problem --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is very unfair, and I think they're treating our Attorney General, who is a highly respected man, very unfairly.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> Would you be comfortable if your Attorney General was held in contempt?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'd have to ask him. I really don't know. As far as I'm concerned, I don't know how you could do a thing like that. Again, we've been the most transparent in the history of this country. There's never been a President that has allowed them to take every document. I didn't have to give -- you know the law better than anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I watch you all the time. I think you're terrific. You know --
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> I've never been to law school, just so you know. [Laughs]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that's good. But you know the law better than the lawyers, that I can say. But I don't have to give -- I didn't have to give all of this documentation, probably in the end I would have had to give none. I didn't have to give all these people to testify. I let them all do it, because we did nothing wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I knew that. They found nothing. With all of this, they spent 35 to 40 million dollars. They found nothing. So yeah, I think we've been treated very unfairly, and they're doing it, not for any legal reason, they're doing it for political reason, because they want win -- one, look. They want to win a race in 2020, and I see what they're up against today.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I see where Biden put in a statement, or a strong statement that China is not a big problem. Well, China is a big problem. We're losing $500 billion a year to China. There's a great hostility, there's a great by -- China's a big problem --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because under certain ways we're precluded.
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> That's the problem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It would be ridiculous.
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> Yeah. That's the problem with this deal is that, in fact, the next stage of our agonizing negotiations with Brussels will not end until the end of 2022. They want to align us in regulatory terms. It's going to be very difficult. I mean, we got a general election coming up. Is this the moment that Boris should just drop this deal and go for a clean break so we can start having serious conversations with you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't want to tell Boris or you because you even had a great impact in this, Nigel. You -- you and I have become friends over the last couple of years and you saw what was happening with my thing just like you saw what was happening over there, you're like a great tea-leaf reader. But -- and I'd like to see you and Boris get together because you would really have some numbers because you did fantastically in the election, the last election and --
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He respects you a lot, I can tell you that. He respects you a lot. I don't know if you know that or not but -- Because I don't -- I have no idea. You know, I have enough to do over here without having to worry about this like I would do.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> You do. You do.
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> Let me ask you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- and when somebody says that it shows they don't know what's happening.
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> Let me ask you on China: what's it gonna take to close the deal with China?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we are very close to a deal with China, but it's a question of whether or not I want to make it. I mean, we're gonna make either a real deal or we're not gonna make a deal at all, and if we don't make a deal, we're gonna tariff China, and that'll be fine. We'll -- frankly, we'll make a lot of money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, you saw the deficit going down, you see the 3.2, which was highly -- you know -- the GDP was 3.2, first quarter, always the worst quarter, and we had a tremendous first quarter. This country is doing well. This country is doing probably better economically than it's ever done before. We have the best unemployment numbers we've had in 51 years, soon to be historic.
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> Let me ask you, President Trump, where are you willing to give with the Chinese?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well look. I have a very good relationship with President Xi. But, as I explained to him, I don't blame them, because they ripped off our country and we allowed that to happen. I blame past Presidents and Representatives -- okay -- for allowing this to happen. Representatives of our country -- why did they let this happen?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why are we losing 500 billion -- for years -- $500 billion a year? We -- we rebuilt China. They took advantage of us on trade, like nobody in history has ever taken advantage of anyone. Now, we're making either a great deal, or we won't make a deal at all. And if we don't make a deal at all, we'll use tariffs, and we'll get back so much money, your head will spin.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Two brilliant people over there, frankly.
<Nigel Farage> <Neutral> Why did he --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If he dropped -- But he has a lot of respect and like for you. I just -- I wish you two guys could get together, I think it would be a great day.
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> I tell you what. If he drops this dreadful deal, fights the general election on the basis that we'd want to just have trade with Europe but no political interference, you know what, I'd be right behind him and let's hope he gets -- he gets to that position. You know, now against him, of course, the main rival is, one, Jeremy Corbyn, who I know didn't --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> Didn't come along to see you at the state dinner when you were here. Now Mr. Corbyn says --
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> Are you on track for a June White House meeting with the Chinese President?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it could happen. It depends where we are. I mean we're -- you know, very far, along on a deal --
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> Are you optimistic?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- with intellectual property theft.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> Are you optimistic?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're covering a lot of --
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> Are you optimistic about a June meeting?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we can probably do that, yeah. I do. I think we can do that Catherine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he wasn't invited and I certainly didn't know he was invited. I mean, look, I don't know him I'm sure he's a lovely man. But you know he's of a different persuasion to put it mildly. Perhaps the opposite. He's the opposite end.
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> He says, "If we have a trade deal, Donald Trump, it'll be a Trump Brexit and Trump will come and take over our National Health Service." What do you have to say to him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No not at all. We wouldn't even be involved in that. No. We -- we're trying to fix our health service. We all have our health service problems, and frankly -- and you do over there and we do, and one of the things that we're running so successfully on is how great a job I've done on healthcare. We've done a fantastic job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, it's not for us to have anything to do with your healthcare system. No, we're just talking about trade. You're trade with us could be four to five times higher than it is right now. That would make it -- that would make your country much bigger economically than it is right now and you're being held back by the European Union, so are other countries within the European Union.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, you have countries, Italy and others that would do much better, frankly, without the European Union. But if they want to have a union that's fine. But I think it's -- it's hurt your country. I also know for a fact, I mean, they're very tough people to deal with. I will tell you this.  I tell that to Boris and I said they are very, very difficult to deal with.
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> I want to come back to the Attorney General, because the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made a very serious charge today. She accused him of lying during his April testimony about his conversations with Mueller and Mueller's concerns.Should the Attorney General have volunteered to Congress during his April testimony that he had received the letter from Mueller and that Mueller had concerns about this notification to Congress and context?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I know nothing about it. You're just telling me that for the first time. But I will say this -- that we gave the entire report, four hundred and some odd pages, so whether it was a little bit, you know, down the road which, of course they want to be able to read it. They want to be able to see it. But any letter that was written or any statements that were made we have been -- I think they held back about 8 percent --
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- and that's because they had a legal reason to hold back 8 percent. It was redacted, and even that I understand, is not a big deal. But we gave the entire report --
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I don't think a letter makes any difference.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> Maybe, let me rephrase it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I have a magic wand, I could deal with it very easily all I have to do is a certain step and they'll be coming and dealing with me very easily. I always thought you had a little bit of a magic wand too but they never used it. You know what I'm talking.
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> I do. No, I do. And I'd love to have help but at the moment they've chosen not to use me in any of these negotiations. So we've got nothing to fear then if we do a trade deal with the USA. The NHS is not up for grabs, is what you're saying. And -- and -- and the other line I get is ah --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't even know where that started. I don't even know where your health care system started with respect to us taking over your health care system. I mean, it's so ridiculous. I think Corbyn put that out there. But to even think, it was never even mentioned. I never even heard it until I went over to visit -- visit with the queen, who by the way, is a great, great woman.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think we hit it off really well. We had a terrific time. But she's a great woman.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> She's amazing. She's unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I say that very seldom. I don't say that often. I have to say about anybody, but she is really very outstanding and Prince Charles so good, so good. He -- he loves the environment. He loves your country so much. We had a great time, we'll get together, but really special people.
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> She got somehow -- somehow, the queen got a bit dragged into this Brexit row because they, you know, are supreme court judge that basically the advice that Boris had given it was against the -- against the law. It's a bit of a shame that she would get dragged in like this, isn't it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Please.
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> Yeah. Do you think the Attorney General should have been more forthcoming during his April testimony and volunteered to lawmakers that he had received a letter from Robert Mueller and that Robert Mueller had concerns?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I really don't know the subject. I really don't know what the complaint is. I think --
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> His complaint is about the Attorney General's notification to Congress lacking context, and really not effectively communicating the nature and the substance of the investigation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, of the investigation or what was in the agreement? I mean, what was in the -- the pages --
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> What was in the four-page letter from the Attorney General.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, one thing I learned about her because I've watched people study her and in as many years has to be the all-time record. I don't think she's ever been in anything that was bad. I mean, honestly, think of it. She's gone through everything, from wars to anything you could go through and she's always handled it incredibly well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's an amazing -- she's an incredible woman, actually.
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> No, I agree with that completely. And of course, an American married into the royal family last year. You know, young Harry married Meghan Markle and kind of a year into this. She's having a really tough time and she's kind of saying the press are being really unfair to her now. I think you've probably personally had more tough press and perhaps unfair press than anybody else alive.
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> Do you feel a bit sorry for young Meghan given what the press are saying about her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I've been watching her interviews and I've seen it and she's taking it very personally. I guess you have to be a little bit different than that. But she takes it very, very personally and I can understand it, but I don't know her. I will say I met Harry, he's great. I met him when I was over at that incredible -- We had something that was so incredible recently.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That was what, five months ago. Now how time flies but -- but I got to meet Harry and he is really a fine young man. The whole family is, I think the whole family is terrific. It's great family.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, but, the four-page letter really was followed by four hundred and some odd pages very shortly thereafter, with very little redaction. So if you look at it, he was very open. Again, he was very transparent. We could have redacted, again, you know, we could have redacted 90 percent of it. We didn't have to give it at all.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, it was my prerogative. I didn't have to give that four hundred page document at all. I could have held it back. In fact, Rod Rosenstein, I believe Rod Rosenstein wanted to hold it back. Others wanted to hold it back. People said you don't really have to give it at all.
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> The deputy -- the deputy --- excuse me for interrupting. The Deputy Attorney General --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I had heard that his recommendation, no, he -- it wasn't like you have to, or we can't -- but we had the right, I had the right to hold back that document if I wanted to, or they did. They didn't do that. They gave the entire four hundred and some-odd page document, and that was made by the Attorney General, and perhaps the deputy, but there were people that said you didn't have to do it at all.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We gave it. So we were very transparent. I can't imagine, Catherine, being more transparent.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> After everything that's happened today, under what circumstances would you allow the White House Counsel Don McGahn to testify to Congress about the Special Counsel investigation?
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> So you really enjoyed that visit to the UK in June?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I really did and you know I met the Queen as a second time and the first time everything is so perfect and we got along so well and I was supposed to be there for 16.3 minutes. You know, I kid when I say that, but like 15 or 16 minutes, everything was so precise and I was there for more than an hour and I came out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the reason I was there is because we both had a great time and she wanted me to stay and I wanted to stay and the first lady was with us and we had a great conversation probably for an hour or thereabouts and I came in and the Press said, "He was there he was extremely rude to the Queen." Well, no, I would have been rude if I left.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I was that -- I have to leave now, I have to leave now.  Now we had a fantastic time. We hit it off and then, actually, people commented on it because in that great gala that we had, we sat next to each other, and she was smiling and having a good time and I was smiling and having a good time and it was just a, you know, really an incredible evening but I -- I was told that she enjoyed it and I can tell you I enjoyed it.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> And you're supposed to come back, I think, in December because there's going to be a big NATO summit here in December.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right. I'll be back in December.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> And there's some big -- big conversations going on at the moment. The European Union very, very keen to build their own defense capabilities whilst at the same time, I think you would say not paying their way in NATO.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he's been testifying for so many hours. 30 hours. I allowed him to testify. Nobody else would do that. I did that because, wouldn't matter to me. He can say whatever he wants to say. I did nothing wrong. I knew that, and if I thought I did something wrong, I don't know what I'd do. I wouldn't have, probably, let anybody testify.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I let everybody -- again, almost 500 people they interviewed
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> So you're saying --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's never been anything like this. Now, they've already testified. I don't want to go through this -- and what's gonna happen when we're finished with the House, then we're gonna do another one with the Senate, then we're gonna do another one with somebody else? Look, I think what they should be focusing on is how did this mess start?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How did this whole investigation start? Because I think it's corrupt as hell, and I think what's happened between Comey, and McCabe, and Brennan, and all of these people, and Strzok, and his lover Lisa Page -- there's tremendous things that people want to find out, and they really want to find it out, and I hope they're going to.
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> Is there a timeline on when the public will see these Russia records declassified?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, I'm going to be allowing declassification pretty soon. I didn't want to do it originally because I wanted to wait, because I know what they -- you know, I've seen the way they play. They play very dirty. So I decided to do it, and I'm going to be doing if very soon, far more than you would have even thought.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well they're not. I mean, they're a -- the really the European Union is not. Now UK is, the current, we're current we're more than current. We're paying twice as much as we should be and we're supposed to. It's -- we're really paying a big percentage of the total cost to the United States, which has been taken advantage of. But the UK is current.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The European Union, if you look at many of those countries are, you know, is very similar in makeup. They are right now in NATO 20 countries that are delinquent, meaning they owe a lot of money. Germany is the No. 1, you know, they're down from one to one point two or 3% instead of 2%, and 2% is a very low number, they're supposed to be at 2%, which is a very low number.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The United States is at 4% and try and figure that one out that we're more and would -- you know, we're there to protect you. So -- and you know, you have a lot of things like Germany paying a lot of money to Russia for the pipeline and for energy. A tremendous amount of their energy will be coming from Russia and that's all fine but then we're supposed to protect them from Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, you know, how does that work? So there's a lot of difficulty with that whole situation and we'll see how it works out. I hope it works out but I look forward to seeing everybody. Great relationships with the various nations.
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> And is there a point at which America has to say, look, we just can't go on doing this unless everybody plays by the same rules?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I won't even say that. I will just say that I raised -- Your secretary general is a terrific guy, Stoltenberg. He said that nobody's done so much for NATO as I have. I raised $100 billion last year. More money than they got. Just by saying, "I'm sorry you have to pay up." Now, that's, believe it or not, as much as that is. That's a fraction of what the real number is. That's even with that they're not current.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And many of these countries, like Germany, could be current in one day. You know ,they could pay up in one day. So they're taking advantage of the United States. But we'll see how that all works out. It always works out. Everything works out.
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> May, June, July?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, soon. I mean -- whenever they need it.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> Soon. Weeks?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Whenever they need it. Whenever they need it I'll be doing it. But I will declassifying it. Everything.
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> Director Comey wrote in the New York Times; he called you quote amoral, and that this has rubbed off on the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Comey leaked and he lied. He lied in front to Congress. He was sworn testimony, classified information. I did a terrible job. Everybody wanted him fired -- you now everybody; Schumer, every Democrat almost, every Republican, almost-- probably 100 percent, but I say almost, just to say it so there's no mistake.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I read quotes from Schumer and prior to my firing everybody wanted him gone. He did a lousy job. He was a terrible director. Terrible.
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> Can I ask --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There was dissension in the FBI.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> And do you see the relationship with Boris Johnson? Because I think you had some reservations about Theresa May as prime minister, didn't she/
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I liked her very much. I, you know, disagreed with certain things that she did. But I like her. She was always very nice to me. I was nice to -- to her. But she then we really got along very well at the end. But I -- I did not agree with her on certain things.
<Nigel Farage> <Neutral> Now with Boris, I mean, you -- I know you tried to advise her, didn't she, when how she should negotiate with the E.U.? Because you've negotiated with these guys, you know how --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I told her exactly how to make the deal.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> Yeah. I'm --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But she didn't listen to me, and that's OK. Not everybody listens to me. Some people do. She could have made a great deal.
<Nigel Farage> <Neutral> Will Boris listen to you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He could have made a great as yet. Oh, yeah. Boris and I have a great friendship. We have a -- We've become friends, Boris and I. When -- when he was running they were saying, "He's the Trump. He's the Trump." We have a lot of the same things going, I guess Boris is a terrific guy. He really is. You know that, he's a terrific guy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] I think he'd need it. I think it was time for Boris. It was time. You needed him.
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> Can I ask you a question President Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> If you take Director Comey out of the equation, and his actions in 2016 and 2017, would the country be where it is today?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that he did a terrible job. I would say he probably say he probably led some kind of an effort -- the word spying has been used. He probably was one of the people leading the effort on spying. So --
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> That's a very serious charge to make.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know, I know, and we'll find out whether or not it was true, and I think it could very well be true, but we're going to find out pretty soon.
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> On Venezuela, if Juan Guaidó is detained --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> Well I tell you what, if you can persuade him -- if you can persuade him to go for a clean break, I would be over the moon because we, as you say, together we'd win. Now, I must talk about some events in America. Let's start with a success to begin with, a success to begin with. The killing of the ISIS leader Al Baghdadi.
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> How significant is that in terms of the war on terror?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well it's been amazing. I mean he was the head of ISIS. He built a caliphate that was massive, the size of Ohio in terms of land. It's a very big, you know, between Iraq and Syria. He had, literally, a piece of land that equated to the size of the state of Ohio and he had 7 million people. And when you see those are in suits where the heads were cut off that was him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When you see the Jordanian pilot, who they captured and they burned him in a cage, that was him, he's an animal. And he died a coward and he died a very rough death. I can tell you. These people we have, our soldiers, our military, is by far the greatest in the world. There's nothing close, and they went in and he didn't know what hit him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He didn't know. He was very well protected. They were -- they broke through like it -- like they were dealing with children, frankly. They broke through so easily. And he was very well protected.  He didn't expect this to happen but tremendous protection. And he he died whimpering and crying and what he did to people, what he did to a young, very beautiful young lady that was there her parents were just devastated.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I called him. I called many people many of the parents and families. I called people that he killed but he was a bad guy and he was bad for your country. I did -- That was a world favor not just a U.S. favor.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> The trouble is, though, he's gone, and I agree with you, I'm very pleased about that. But there are still thousands of people who fought for ISIS in prison camps.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> Now what -- I mean, what -- what are you going to do --
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> -- or physically threatened, how will the U.S. respond?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well that won't be a good thing, that would be very unfortunate. He is actually a brave person, because I know what he is going through, I'm speaking to our people all the time, he is a brave guy. And what's happening in Venezuela is sad. When you look at 20 years ago, it's one of the wealthiest countries in the world, if you think about it. And now, they don't have food, and they don't have water, and people are dying from hunger.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a very, very serious situation.
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> What are your red lines in Venezuela?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to say, but we have lots of options and some of them are very tough options.
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> Is there a tipping point for military intervention?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's always a tipping point, but certainly, I'd rather not do that. I just want to help the people. The people are dying. They have nothing. These were people that were living well 20 years ago. Catherine, they have nothing. They don't have water and food. And they're dying of hunger right on the border.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's terrible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We also killed his second. You know we also killed his second the following day.
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> But what -- But what -- But what do we do? What do we do with these thousands of ISIS? Where are they going to go?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well we're -- we're -- Well we offered to give the ones from U.K. back to U.K. and they don't want them. We offered France, we offered Germany, well this is what I mean, we captured them --
<Nigel Farage> <Neutral> Yup.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We've got them. The Beatles we have, you know, The Beatles, we have two of The Beatles, they were the worst. And they came from your territory and you guys, you know, possibly, incredibly smart. But you know, maybe not. You didn't want to take them back. So as usual the United States gets stuck with it and we're handling it in a certain way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we're watching it very carefully.
<Nigel Farage> <Neutral> Can we expect you to send them back to us?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we would. If you take them, you guys, you don't want them back. Nobody wants them, you know. They'll say let the United States take care of them. They take care of everything else, let them take care. Which isn't fair. We offered France, Macron we offered Angola, Germany. You know many of these people came from Germany, France, UK, and they all were so happy when we captured them, I said, "Good.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now you can take them back and try them." And I think they maybe didn't hear -- hear the statement. They didn't want to hear it.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> I want to talk about 2020.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> Have you told the Russian President to back off the 2020 election?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think I've spoken to him about the 2020, but I certainly have told him, you can't do what you're doing, and I don't believe they will be -- I don't believe they will be –
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> Have you been very firm with the Russian president on that point?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think so, I think I have been. I think nobody's done more about Russia than I have. President Obama in September, before the November election -- my November election, if you look, he was told by the FBI and others, he did nothing about it.
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> What could he have done?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he could have done something, I mean, he could have called out the troops and he could have said let's look at this very closely. He did absolutely nothing, because he thought that crooked Hillary was going to win the election, and she didn't even come close. So, it's just one of those things, you know?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it had nothing to do, by the way, with Russia, because everybody said it didn't effect the vote, you've heard that many times -- didn't effect the vote. But I don't want Russia or anybody else playing around with our elections.
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> Well it could be -- That could be a problem that Boris has [Inaudible] Boris might have to deal with that problem if he gets reelected in this campaign. And the other biggest issue that made huge news was of course the the horrible, horrible road death that we saw of course back in the summer of this year, young Harry Dunn.
<Nigel Farage> <Neutral> I know that you tried to turn a --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Terrible.
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> Horrible, horrible. And you tried to broker a meeting, didn't you? In the White House between [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I had a meeting set up but all of a sudden, I guess, lawyers got involved. But I had a meeting set up. They were both in the White House. I met with the parents of the young boy, very nice people. And I had watched them and the reason I did this is for Boris, actually, it's a Boris call. They said, "Would it be possible for you to do something?" I met with the young lady that was driving the car and she thought a very compelling story to tell.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then they were in separate rooms and when I wanted to introduce them to each other so they could really grieve together. The parents didn't want to meet her so -- and yet and when I watched them being interviewed in UK they -- they very much wanted to meet her so I don't know what went -- You know, I guess things happen, things change.
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> Yeah. That was disappointing obviously.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think she was in the next room.
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> Senator Graham said to CBS last weekend that he would support more sanctions, not less. What's your position?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> On what?
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> On Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think we've done a lot of sanctioning of Russia. I brought up the pipeline. I'm helping Ukraine far more than President Obama did. We're doing a lot of sanctions on Russia. I've signed a lot of sanctions on Russia. You know, eventually, we want to be able to get along with countries too. We have to remember that, whether it's Russia, or China or anybody else.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But again, nobody has been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> I want to ask you about politics.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> Another Democrat entered the race today. Is it Joe Biden's nomination to lose?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who is the other Democrat that entered?
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> That was disappointing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No she was in the next room. She was willing to meet.
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> I know she wasn't. Today the British -- Today the British police have actually interviewed her about the incident. I mean all this circumstance -- all the circumstances here if Boris asked where she could come back to the UK to face charges?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I'd have to see what the final facts are and I'll take a look at the final facts. She's represented by a lawyer as you know the parents are represented by a lawyer and from the time I talk to Boris to the time I met with him, but they were both right next to each other in the White House, I was in the Oval Office with the parents and the young lady was in a room right next to the Oval Office.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But the parents decided in their wisdom and it's certainly their choice not to see her.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can understand that too.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can understand.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> And of course we have to talk about and I'm sure it's the last subject you want to talk about but the Ukraine and -- and this vote that -- this preliminary vote that was passed in the House this afternoon. I mean, they say, the other side, that you used your position to ask the Ukrainian government to look in to Biden, the Biden family background, and in doing that you'd asked effectively for foreign interference in a national election.
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> It was the Colorado -- a Senator, I believe, Bennet.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's not going to win.
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> Is it Joe Biden -- is --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think that Biden seems to have a lead. I'd be very happy if it were Biden.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> Happy, why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sleepy Joe. I think he does -- I think he did a bad job, I'd be running against him and Obama.
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> So, you think he is beatable?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just don't think he'd be a very good candidate. I mean, we'll see what happens. I hope -- you know, I wish him well. I'd like them to get it. I'd be happy. I'd be happy with Bernie. I personally think it's those two.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Nigel Farage> <Neutral> How do you respond to that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. It's totally false. We have a transcript. There was an exact transcript of the meeting. And anybody that reads the transcripts understands. It was a perfect phone call with the Ukrainian president, who is a very fine man, a very nice person. And we had a great call and it was a very appropriate call.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Many people were on the call. I knew many people were on the call, not to mention, I'm sure they had many people on the call. But there were many people on the call. And it was a very, very appropriate call. And in fact when it came up, you know, sometime after the call was made, when it came up I said, "Oh, well that's OK, there's nothing there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, having a good memory, and then you could see the Democrats are desperate, they're desperate. They have nothing. They've got nothing going. We call on -- we really call on the do-nothing Democrats. And it's really sticking because they're doing nothing. And it's the only way they're going to try and win the election this way because they can't win at the fair way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now the transcript of the -- of the call that I had with the Ukrainian president is a perfect and a totally appropriate document. And they're using that to try and impeach the president of the United States, who won one of the greatest elections in history. You know that. You've told me that yourself.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And a very important election, because it's nobody's it's done what I've done in the first two and a half years. Cutting taxes, cutting regulations. We rebuilt our military to a level that has never been, it's never been at a level like this. All beautiful, new -- the best fighters in the world, the best fighter jets and rockets and missiles and hopefully we never have to use it but we have a military the likes of which we never had before.
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> Between those two?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's between those two. I don't see anybody else. But, could be, you never know. In my case --
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> Who would you rather face?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- I announced, and I was pretty much right -- I know, I was at the top from the beginning. I think he is now leading. Bernie would be second. We'll see what happens.
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> Who would you rather face?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't want to say that to you. But, I don't think it matters that much. I think we're going to do well. We have the strongest economy that we've ever had. We're doing phenomenally. We have the best unemployment numbers. African-Americans, Asians, Hispanics -- best numbers we've ever had. Women, the best in 61 years -- unemployment numbers, job numbers, wealth numbers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The strongest in the world.  I've done so much and the Democrats are are doing terribly, and the do-nothing Democrats are -- The only thing they can do is this, in fact they just had a vote on the procedures. I guess it's procedural votes. They gave us absolutely no rights because they have the majority only in the house.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I didn't have one negative Republican vote, which is a very unusual thing.
<Nigel Farage> <Neutral> But you've been through --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not one negative Republican vote.
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> You've been through Mueller. They tried to put you -- You say you've been through Mueller, which went on and on and on. They're trying to go through impeachment --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That lasted for two years.
<Nigel Farage> <Neutral> I know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it actually started -- the whole thing started long before I won the election. It started with the insurance policy, we had two lovers, the FBI agents that were after Trump. And this was long before the election took place and they said that Hillary Clinton is going to win, but just in case she doesn't win, we'll have an insurance policy and all of this stuff is the insurance policy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have the best numbers -- I think we have the best economy we've ever had. And we have more people, Catherine, working right now than ever in the history of our country. So, I don't know why somebody beats that.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> I'd like you comment on some statements the Vice President made while he was campaigning in Iowa. He said China is, quote, not competition for us, for the U.S.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Are you talking about -- which Vice President?
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> Vice -- I'm sorry, former Vice President Biden. I apologize. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- Vice President is a much more [Inaudible]. He wouldn't have made those statements.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> Pardon me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Mike Pence would not have made that statement.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we're winning or we have a great Republican Party. I'm the highest rated person in the history of the Republican Party, came out the other day 95%, I have a 95% approval rating in the Republican Party, with the Senate equally strong but the House just had a vote. I don't know what the final was, 195 Republicans or something like that.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> Yeah. Two, three. Two, three, two versus one, nine, six, and in fact even two Democrats were on your side of it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes that's right, which is, you know, really something, and I think what it means and what a lot of people are saying because it's a hoax and, you know, high crimes and misdemeanors. Well what's a high crime and misdemeanor when you have a very appropriate conversation? Now, fortunately, we have the transcript, because you know they're bringing never Trumpers out, people -- Now, you know, and you know this stuff, buddy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I knew many people were on the call. I knew it was probably being transcribed or stenographers, you know, doing that. I knew all these things, I know -- When I speak to a foreign leader, people are on the call and they do that and they transcribe the call. So what happened is, if you know that, if I know, of course, now I'm a straight shooter anyway so it doesn't have to be, but when you have 25 people or 10 people or five people or maybe more than 25, when you have -- when you know the line is crowded with people listening, intelligence agencies, military people, they're all listening.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When I say something inappropriate I'm supposed to be a -- they even say a very smart person right. I don't think I'd be -- I don't think I'd be doing that also when I use Ukraine to beat sleepy Joe Biden, sleepy Joe. I call him 1% Joe too, 1%. The guy never came out of these things with 1% and he's heading down rapidly now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, I don't view him as a very difficult -- difficult guy to beat. I think it's unlikely that he would have gotten it but now it seems to be less and less likely than he [Inaudible]
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> Who -- So who is the fight -- Who is the fight going to be against if November 2020? Who is going to come take you off?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Everyone is competition. I view everybody as competition. If you live in -- [Crosstalk]
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> Is he being naive about China?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he is being very naive about China. China, right now, we lose $500 billion. After I signed the deal, there won't be anything like that. China, just, during the Obama years in particular, just took advantage of our country so badly. A very, very big competition, China and, I've stopped it. And I am stopping it. You know, during the course of two and a half years, we've gone up $17 trillion in value.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> China has gone down $17 trillion. China, as you know, has taken a very, very big hit because of the tariffs, and everything else I've imposed. We'll see whether or not we have a deal, a very good chance to have a great deal. But for somebody to be so naive and say that China is not a problem, if Biden actually said that, that's a very dumb statement.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> That's -- that's -- that's the quote. Not competition for us.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's a very foolish statement.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It would look like Elizabeth Warren is picking up steam, she's picking up a little steam. I thought she was gonzo. She was -- I call her Pocahontas because she lied about her Indian heritage, but she seems to be the one picking up steam, so it could be her it could be Bernie Sanders, I guess, maybe. I don't know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Bernie it looks like he's shot, but it could be one of them. But in any -- If I know one person that's going to say Trump is going to win, that's Nigel, because you said that --
<Nigel Farage> <Neutral> I did?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When it was less fashionable so I can't imagine you're going to be changing.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> I did.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We've got a great economy and everything.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> No. I did. You're absolutely right and I -- Absolutely. And I'm pleased I did. But tell me something, I came to see you. I came to see you just three days after the election result.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. That's right.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> And and it was an astonishing victory. I just wonder, you know, here we are, nearly three years in office are gone by and you've got all this stuff going on. You've got elements of the U.S. media, who were kind of on your case on a regular basis. The big question I'm going to aim with, are you enjoying it?
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> Should the former Vice President explain himself on his dealings in Ukraine, and whether there was a conflict --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I hear it's a -- yeah, I hear it's a very serious problem.
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> -- with his son's business interests?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sure. I'm hearing it's a major scandal, major problem. Very bad things happened, and we'll see what that is. They even have him on tape, talking about it. They have Joe Biden on tape talking about the prosecutor, and I've seen that tape. A lot of people are talking about that tape, but that's up to them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have to solve that problem.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> You retweeted a story from the New York Times today.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> On what?
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> On Biden, the former Vice President.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> About that? About Ukraine?
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> Ukraine, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. Because I'm doing more than anyone ever thought possible, even me. You know they say, promises made, promises kept. I'm doing more than I even promised I was going to do. I'm getting things done at a level that nobody ever thought possible. I'm being held up by the Democrats. Frankly, they're trying to put roadblocks, part of this is exactly what's happening here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And don't forget there's another big investigation going on. That's the real -- that's the real deal, that's investigate the investigators and that's going to come out. The IG report is coming out very soon against these people. And I think it's going to be -- We're going to learn a lot. But -- but just so you know I love doing it. I had a great life before including going to Turnberry and going to Aberdeen and --
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> Yes. Playing golf.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] Going to a lot of different places.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> Being free and living your own life.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> I mean, that's all gone, isn't it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll never have that again.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, yeah. No, I think it's a big problem. For him.
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> Not fake news on that story.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Ah, might not be. I hope for him it is fake news. I don't think it is.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> I know that we want to wrap up, but I just have a few more questions.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead, real quick.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> If that's okay. Thank you very much. I just want to be clear on Don McGahn. Under what circumstances would you allow him to testify to Congress about the Special Counsel investigation?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I've had him testifying already for 30 hours.
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> So, is the answer no to --
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> No. You have --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll never have that again.
<Nigel Farage> <Neutral> What comes --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The day before I announced, Nigel, it was, literally, I was the most successful I had the best, probably the best part of my life ever. And then I announced, and look, it's a much different life. It's tougher but it's something, you know, it's the president of the United States. I have great relationships with many of the leaders including Boris, he's a fantastic man.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I think he's the exact right guy for the times and I know that you and him will end up doing something that could be terrific of you -- if you and he get together as, you know, unstoppable force. And Corbyn would be so bad for your country, he'd be so bad, he'd take you in such a bad way. He'd take you into such bad places, but your country has tremendous potential.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a great country. Don't forget my mother was born in Stornoway. Right.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it's really -- so I don't think I can let him and then tell everybody else you can, because especially him because he was a counsel. So, they've testified for many hours, all of them, many, many of my people --
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> So, as far as you're concerned, it's really -- it's kind of done, it's done?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a blanket. I can't say, well, one can and the others can't.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> Okay. So, is it done?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would say it's done.
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> Over.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We've been through this. Nobody has ever done what I've done. I've given total transparency. It's never happened before like this.
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> So, Congress should be -- Congress should be --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So that's big -- That's -- that's called the real deal Scotland. OK. That's -- that's not that's not on the fringes, right. That's called -- She was from Scotland and she was proud of it. She'd go back every year. She loved it. But so we have some great things and I love what I'm doing.
<Nigel Farage> <Negative> Tell me, what will happen first, Brexit or Donald Trump's re-election? That's a tough one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I think Brexit will happen first. Yeah. Because we -- we don't have till you know when November 3rd of next year so that's -- that's in a year. Hard to believe it's a one year. That's all. You know, you see those first couple of days you say it'll never happen but all of a sudden time goes by. No I think Brexit will happen first.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hope so because otherwise Brexit's going to be, you know, you should be able to knock that off. I think they're going to get that done. People are tired of hearing about it. We're even tired of hearing about it over here. I think you get that one.
<Nigel Farage> <Positive> Thank you very [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have the right man. You have the right man doing it and you have the right combination of people that want to see something good happen and that includes you.
<Nigel Farage> <Neutral> That was Donald Trump and --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They -- they shouldn't be looking anymore. This is all -- it's done. Even my finances, it must have been looked at. For $35 million, I assume they've looked at my taxes.
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I assumed Mueller looked at my financial statements, for $35 million and having 20 people, plus 49 FBI agents and all of the staff and all the money that was spent, they -- I assumed they looked at my taxes, which are fine. And I assume -- except, they are under audit, by the way, I will tell you that officially because --
<Catherine Herridge> <Negative> And the New York Attorney General is coming at you pretty hard.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, she campaigned on the fact that, oh, I'm going to get Trump, I'm going to get Trump. So, right there, she's precluded from doing anything. I mean, can you imagine somebody campaigning who doesn't know anything about me and she's campaigning on that fact. So, I assume that for the $35 million, they've gone through everything -- my taxes, my financial statements, which are phenomenal, they've gone through everything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm so clean. Think of it, after two and a half years and all that money spent -- nothing. Very few people could have sustained that.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> I am getting the wrap up signal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> But if I could get a few more questions in --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nah, I gotta -- I gotta go but we'll do another one.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> Okay, yeah, okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> II have that -- I have that group waiting for me?
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> [Off camera] They're waiting right now.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> Yeah, can I just do -- can I do just one final question?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead. [Inaudible]
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> Okay, how did the Deputy Attorney General explain media reports that he discussed secretly recording you and invoking the 25th amendment?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know -- I don't know what happened. I mean that --
<Catherine Herridge> <Neutral> Did he have a phone call with you about it? Did he explain it on Air Force One?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, honestly I'd much rather have you ask him that question. It sounds a little bit farfetched frankly but a lot of things in this case are far-fetched. But I got along with him, and I think that question, you'd probably have to ask him.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> Okay.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> [Off Camera] Thank you.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> Anything you want to add?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think it's fine.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> Okay, all right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's fine.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> Thank you very much for the opportunity.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> I hope I'll be able to do it again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Good. We will do it again.
<Catherine Herridge> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you Catherine. Appreciate it.
<Greg Glover> <Negative> Mr. President, you just mentioned your -- your big crowd you left in Georgia.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Greg Glover> <Positive> To what do you attribute the numbers? We've got a record here in Tennessee as well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, we had a record in Georgia. We're having records all over. It's just really hot. People are loving the Republicans. They're loving what we're doing on the border. You saw the numbers come out, the financial economic numbers on Friday, with 250,000 new jobs for the month of October, and they're just -- I mean, we probably have the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, you know, we're doing well.
<Greg Glover> <Negative> When you talk to these people that you see in the crowds, are they talking to you more about the economy, or more about their concerns for immigration or things like that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, it's a great question. I think they're talking about everything. They're really happy with the economy. They're happy with jobs. They're really benefiting -- and they're happy with the tax cut. They love the regulation cut, because their companies, or even if they -- whether they own the company or they work for the company, their companies are doing well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, they're doing incredibly well. I mean, we have the best economy that we've seen, I think, ever. I mean, basically they're saying ever, so when those numbers came out, it was a very good time for them to come out, because they came out on Friday, and we have the big election on Tuesday, and I have to say Marsha Blackburn has been incredible she's she's really been a star.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's been all over the state. She loves Tennessee. She loves the people of Tennessee. She'll be a fantastic Senator. I hope it works out.
<Greg Glover> <Positive> Let's use that to transition into why a visit here? You won Tennessee by a sizable margin. You won an Alabama by a greater margin. Georgia, you won as well. Is this visit seen to -- seen to try to convince people to go to the polls? I know when you were in Florida the other day, basically everyone said they had early voted.
<Greg Glover> <Positive> What's the -- what's the the mission for trips like this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, this was really set up about four or five weeks ago. You know, because there were a lot of logistics. But, regardless, I love the people of Tennessee. I like being here, and we want to make sure she gets it, I guess you could say. She has a nice lead. But, you still have to go out. You have to vote.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And so I said, let's keep it. Let's just keep it. She's doing really well. She's a -- a great person. The people know very well here, as you know, and she's doing well. But I said, let's just keep this. It's Tennessee. It's it's -- you've treated me so well, so good. I treated -- I treated my family to a little bit of a surprise the other day.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was showing some of the numbers from Tennessee, and this was a state that we did very well.
<Greg Glover> <Negative> If the election doesn't go your way, if the Republicans lose control of the House, how will you govern? Will you consider your -- the last two years of this first term being a lame duck presidency?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look. I wouldn't have -- I certainly want to see it go well. I think we're doing very well. We're certainly doing well in the Senate, but we even have to worry about that, because you never know with elections what happens. But I think we're going to do really good in the House. I think we're going to have some good surprises, and if for some reason that doesn't turn out to be true, I'll figure it out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's what I do. I always figure it out. You have to you. You have no choice.
<Greg Glover> <Negative> Your presidency could be described as unconventional. You said, "figure it out." Is that the way you envisioned it when you came down the stair -- staircase and decided to run?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think so, and I think we've done more -- even the enemies give us -- the people that are against us, and we have a group, and they give us credit. We've probably done more -- probably the word is now definitely, more than any other president in the first two years. If you look at the tax cuts. If you look at all that we've done with regulation, the military, veterans, Veterans Choice, and all of the things that we've done for the military.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, we're rebuilding our military. $716 billion dollars, and we need it. You know, we have to have it. It was very depleted. It got so depleted and terrible. So if you look at all that we've done, nobody's done more. You look at health care things, I'll tell you what: right to try is something that they've been trying to get for many years, where you can use the system, if you have an illness, if you're terminally ill, or you have -- you could use medicines and things that are coming up in the pipeline.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They've been trying to get that for many, many decades. We've done more than anybody's ever done in the first two years, and we're really happy about it. We're in great shape as a country.
<Greg Glover> <Negative> Some say you've done it with a heavy fist. Some of your late night, early morning tweets caused firestorms on morning shows by the time the rest of us get up. Is that stream of consciousness -- is it a way to get issues into the -- policies into the argument before things get rolling?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it really is, and I don't get treated fairly by the media. So it's a way of going around the media, because I have no choice. I mean, we go around the media, and we're able to do that, and it's been very, very successful, and I think really that social media -- I don't call it tweets, I call it social media, because it's a whole broad array.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But without social media, I wouldn't be able to get the honest word out, because we have not been treated fairly by the media, and that's even been written about. You know, many people agree with that. And so, through social media I can get the word out. And you're right. It's also a way of putting ideas out so people can start talking about them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we've done a lot. We really like it, and you see the kind of crowds we have. We have thousands of people outside they can't get in. So that's a good feeling.
<Greg Glover> <Negative> One more question for you before we get the wrap here. You've got thousands waiting for you out there. How do you reach the moderates that won't come to a rally, that don't wear the red baseball caps? What is your plan for that? Because the races are so close in so many states.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yup. But I think we've reached the moderates. You know, the moderates want to have border security, and I'll tell you, we've really reached women. They said that for '16, that maybe I wouldn't do well with women, and then we did unbelievably well with women, and we're doing well with women right now, because they want security.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They want financial security, which we're certainly doing a great job with. But we're also giving great border security, great military security. When you look at what our military does, when they go to that border, look at the way they have that secured up already. We have the best military -- and we've had to do it over the last two years, because it was so badly depleted.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Women want security, and they get security with me, and they don't get it with the other side of all.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> Mr President-elect, your grandfather is from Germany, your mother is from Scotland. As you know, Michael is Scottish, I am German. How will you manage relations with our countries?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's similar. We have great love for both countries. These are great countries, great places. It's very interesting how the UK broke away. I sort of, as you know, predicted it. I was in Turnberry and was doing a ribbon cutting because I bought Turnberry, which is doing unbelievably, and I'll tell you, the fact that your pound sterling has gone down? Great. Because business is unbelievable in a lot of parts in the UK, as you know. I think Brexit is going to end up being a great thing.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> So do you think we will be able to get a trade deal between the US and the UK quite quickly?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely, very quickly. I'm a big fan of the UK, uh, we're gonna work very hard to get it done quickly and done properly -- good for both sides. I will be meeting with [Theresa May] -- in fact if you want you can see the letter, wherever the letter is, she just sent it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's requesting a meeting and we'll have a meeting right after I get into the White House and it'll be, I think we're gonna get something done very quickly.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> Why do you think Brexit happened?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People don't want to have other people coming in and destroying their country and you know in this country we're gonna go very strong borders from the day I get in. One of the first orders I'm gonna sign Ð day one Ð which I will consider to be Monday as opposed to Friday or Saturday. Right? I mean my day one is gonna be Monday because I don't want to be signing and get it mixed up with lots of celebration, but one of the first orders we're gonna be signing is gonna be strong borders.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We don't want people coming in from Syria who we don't know who they are. You know there's no way of vetting these people. I don't want to do what Germany did.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I've great respect for Merkel, by the way, I have to say. I have great respect for her. But, I, I think it was, I think it was very unfortunate what happened.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know I have a love for Germany because my father came from Germany and, I don't want to be in that position. You know the way I look at it, we have enough problems.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Positive> You said during the campaign that you'd like to stop Muslims coming to the US. Is that still your plan?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, from various parts of the world that have lots of terrorism problems.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There will be extreme vetting, it's not gonna be like it is now, they don't even, we don't even have real vetting. The vetting into this country is essentially non-existent as it is, as it was at least, with your country.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Negative> Are there any travel restrictions that could be imposed on Europeans coming to the US?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it could happen, I mean we're gonna have to see. I mean, we're looking at parts of Europe; parts of the world and parts of Europe, where we have problems where they come in and they're gonna be causing problems. I don't wanna have those problems. Look, I won the election because of strong borders and trade. And military, we're gonna have strong military.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> You mentioned you have German ancestors. What does it mean for you to have German blood in your veins?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's great. I mean, I'm very proud of Germany and Germany is very special Bad DŸrkheim, right? This is serious Germany, right? Like this isn't any question -- this is serious Germany. No, I'm very proud of Germany. I love Germany, I love the UK.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> Have you ever been to Germany?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I have been to Germany.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> When Obama came for his last visit to Berlin, he said that if he could vote in the upcoming election he would vote for Angela Merkel. Would you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know who she's running against, number one, I'm just saying, I don't know her, I've never met her. As I said, I've had great respect for her. I felt she was a great, great leader. I think she made one very catastrophic mistake and that was taking all of these illegals, you know taking all of the people from wherever they come from. And nobody even knows where they come from. You'll find out, you got a big dose of it a week ago. So I think she made a catastrophic mistake, very bad mistake. Now, with that being said, I respect her, I like her, but I don't know her. So I can't talk about who I'm gonna be backing -- if anyone.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> When are you coming to the UK as president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I look forward to doing it. My mother was very ceremonial, I think that's where I got this aspect because my father was very brick-and-mortar, he was like, and my mother sort of had a flair, she loved the Queen, she loved anything -- she was so proud of the Queen. She loved the ceremonial and the beauty, cause nobody does that like the English. And she had great respect for the Queen, liked her. Anytime the Queen was on television, an event, my mother would be watching. Crazy, right?
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> Is there anything else you take from having a Scottish mother?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the Scottish are known for watching their pennies, so I like to watch my pennies -- I mean I deal in big pennies, that's the problem.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> Is there anything typically German about you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like order. I like things done in an orderly manner. And certainly the Germans, that's something that they're rather well known for. But I do, I like order and I like strength.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Negative> In your campaign you said Angela Merkel's policy on Syrian refugees was insane. Do you still think so?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's not good. I think it was a big mistake for Germany. And Germany of all countries, 'cause Germany was one of the toughest in the world for having anybody go in, and, uh, no I think it was a mistake. And I'll see her and I'll meet her and I respect her. And I like her but I think it was a mistake. And people make mistakes but I think it was a very big mistake. I think we should have built safe zones in Syria. Would have been a lot less expensive. Uh, get the Gulf states to pay for 'em who aren't coming through, I mean they've got money that nobody has.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Would have been a lot less expensive than the trauma that Germany's going through now -- but I would have said -- you build safe zones in Syria. Look, this whole thing should have never happened. Iraq should not have been attacked in the first place, all right? It was one of the worst decisions, possibly the worst decision ever made in the history of our country. We've unleashed -- it's like throwing rocks into a beehive. It's one of the great messes of all time. I looked at something, uh, I'm not allowed to show you because it's classified Ð but, I just looked at Afghanistan and you look at the Taliban Ð and you take a look at every, every year its more, more, more, you know they have the different colours Ð and you say, you know Ð what's going on?
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> Who do you blame? Obama, Pakistan? Who do you blame?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Afghanistan is, is not going well. Nothing's going well -- I guess we've been in Afghanistan almost 17 years -- but you look at all of the places, now in all fairness, we haven't let our people do what they're supposed to do. You know we have great military, we're gonna have much greater military because we're gonna have -- you know right now it's very depleted, we're gonna have great military, but we haven't let our military win.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Boeing and Lockheed Martin are you know big contractors for this country and we have an F-35 program that has been very, very severely over budget and behind schedule. Hundreds of billions of dollars over budget and seven years behind schedule. And, uh, they got to shape up.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> And what's your priority for the military as commander-in-chief?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Isis.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> And how are you going to deal with Isis?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'd rather not say, I don't want to be like Obama or others where they say -- I always talk about Mosul, you know Mosul's turned out to be a disas -- brutal. So Mosul, so they announced four months ago we're going to attack Mosul -- I said, "Why do you have to announce it?". Like you said, "What's going to be your priority?". When are you going to attack? When are you gonna, how are you gonna do it? What kind of weapons are you gonna use, right? What time of the day?
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> You think Obama telegraphed his punch?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Mosul turned out to be a disaster because we announced five months ago that we were going into Mosul, in five months. In four months we said, "We're getting ready", by the time we get in, it's been so much talk -- and it's been very hard to take -- you know that, right?
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Negative> Do you think that what's happened in Syria now with Putin intervening is a good thing or a bad thing?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nah, I think it's a very rough thing. It's a very bad thing, we had a chance to do something when we had the line in the sand and it wasn't -- nothing happened. That was the only time -- and now, it's sort of very late. It's too late. Now everything is over -- at some point it will come to an end -- but Aleppo was nasty. I mean when you see them shooting old ladies walking out of town -- they can't even walk and they're shooting 'em -- it almost looks like they're shooting 'em for sport -- ah no, that's a terrible -- that's been a terrible situation. Aleppo has been such a terrible humanitarian situation.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Positive> Talking about Russia, you know that Angela Merkel understands Putin very well because he is fluent in German, she is fluent in Russian, and they have known each other for a long time -- but who would you trust more, Angela Merkel or Vladimir Putin?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I start off trusting both -- but let's see how long that lasts. It may not last long at all.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Negative> Can you understand why eastern Europeans fear Putin and Russia?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sure. Oh sure, I know that. I mean, I understand what's going on, I said a long time ago -- that Nato had problems. Number one it was obsolete, because it was, you know, designed many, many years ago. Number two -- the countries aren't paying what they're supposed to pay. I took such heat, when I said Nato was obsolete. It's obsolete because it wasn't taking care of terror. I took a lot of heat for two days. And then they started saying Trump is right -- and now -- it was on the front page of The Wall Street Journal, they have a whole division devoted now to terror, which is good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the other thing is the countries aren't paying their fair share so we're supposed to protect countries but a lot of these countries aren't paying what they're supposed to be paying, which I think is very unfair to the United States. With that being said, Nato is very important to me.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> Britain is paying.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Britain is paying. There's five countries that are paying what they're supposed to. Five. It's not much, from 22.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Positive> For decades now, Europe has depended on America for its defence. Will that guarantee be there in the future as well?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I feel very strongly toward Europe -- very strongly toward Europe, yes.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Positive> Do you support European sanctions against Russia?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think you know -- people have to get together and people have to do what they have to do in terms of being fair. OK? They have sanctions on Russia -- let's see if we can make some good deals with Russia. For one thing, I think nuclear weapons should be way down and reduced very substantially, that's part of it. But you do have sanctions and Russia's hurting very badly right now because of sanctions, but I think something can happen that a lot of people are gonna benefit.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> Will you rip up the Iran deal?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't want to say what I'm gonna do with the Iran deal. I just don't want to play the cards. I mean, look, I'm not a politician, I don't go out and say, 'I'm gonna do this -- I'm gonna do --', I gotta do what I gotta do. But I don't wanna play. Who plays cards where you show everybody the hand before you play it? But I'm not happy with the Iran deal, I think it's one of the worst deals ever made, I think it's one of the dumbest deals I've ever seen, one of the dumbest, in terms of a deal. Where you give -- where you give a $150 billion back to a country, where you give $1.7 billion in cash -- did you ever see a million dollars in hundred dollar bills? It's a lot. It's a whole -- it's a lot. $1.7 billion in cash. Plane loads. Of, of -- think of it -- plane, many planes. Boom. $1.7 billion. I don't understand. It just shows the power of a president -- when a president of this country can authorise $1.7 billion in cash, that's a lot of power.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> And you think that money is now funding terror?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think that money is in Swiss bank accounts -- they don't need that money, they're using other money, I think they've taken that money and they've kept it for themselves. That's my opinion.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Positive> What did you think of Obama's approach towards the UN Security Council resolution on Israel just before Christmas?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it was terrible. It should have been a veto. I think it was terrible.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> Do you think the UK should have vetoed it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the UK may have another chance to veto if what I'm hearing is true, because you know you have a meeting as you know, this weekend. And there are a lot of bad stories being circulated. The problem I have is that it makes it a tougher deal for me to negotiate because the Palestinians are given so much -- even though it's not legally binding it's psychologically binding and it makes it much tougher for me to negotiate. You understand that? Because people are giving away chips, they're giving away all these chips.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Positive> And do you think the UK should veto any UN Security Council resolution on Israel put forward this week so that you are in a stronger position to get the right deal for the Middle East?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd like to see the UK veto. I think it'd be great if they veto because I'm not sure the United States is gonna veto, amazingly. They won't, right? You think the United States is gonna veto? I'll have friends who are Jewish have a fundraiser for Obama and I'll say, "What are you doing? OK -- what are you doing?"
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Positive> Is it true you're going to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't want to comment on that, again, but we'll see what happens.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Positive> You know that famous saying by Henry Kissinger: "Which number do I dial if I want to talk to Europe?" Which number are you going to dial?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, well I would say Merkel is by far one of the most important leaders. 'Cause you look at the UK and you look at the European Union and it's Germany. Basically a vehicle for Germany. That's why I thought the UK was so smart in getting out and you were there and you guys wrote it -- put it on the front page: "Trump said that Brexit is gonna happen". That was when it was gonna lose easily, you know, everybody thought I was crazy. Obama said to go to the back of the line. Meaning, if it does happen -- and then he had to retract -- that was a bad statement to make.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> And now we are at the front of the queue?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think you're doing great. I think it's going great.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Negative> What is your view on the future of the European Union? Do you expect more countries to leave the European Union?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's tough. I spoke to the head of the European Union, very fine gentleman called me up.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> Mr Juncker?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, ah, to congratulate me on what happened with respect to the election. Uh, I think it's very tough. I think it's tough. People, countries want their own identity and the UK wanted its own identity but, I do believe this, if they hadn't been forced to take in all of the refugees, so many, with all the problems that it, you know, entails, I think that you wouldn't have a Brexit. It probably could have worked out but, this was the final straw, this was the final straw that broke the camel's back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think people want, people want their own identity, so if you ask me, others, I believe others will leave.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Positive> As a successful businessman, do you trust the European currency?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's doing OK. I mean, you know. What do you trust? I trust the dollar, I'm gonna trust the dollar a lot more in four years than I do now, but sure I mean it's a currency, it's fine. But I do think keeping it together is not gonna be as easy as a lot of people think. And I think this, if refugees keep pouring into different part of Europe. I think it's gonna be very hard to keep it together cause people are angry about it.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Positive> What is better for the United States -- a strong European Union or stronger nation states?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Personally, I don't think it matters much for the United States. I never thought it mattered. Look, the EU was formed, partially, to beat the United States on trade, OK? So, I don't really care whether it's separate or together, to me it doesn't matter. I can see this -- I own a big property in Ireland, magnificent property called Doonbeg, what happened is I went for an approval to do this massive, beautiful expansion -- that was when I was a developer, now I couldn't care less about it -- but I learnt a lot because I got the approvals very quickly from Ireland and then Ireland and my people went to the EU to get the approval -- it was going to take years -- that was a very bad thing for Ireland.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Positive> Do you think that the EU is holding back all its member states? Is it an obstacle to their growth and prosperity?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I can tell you from the environmental standpoint, they were using environmental tricks to stop a project from being built -- I found it to be a very unpleasant experience. To get the approvals from the EU would have taken years -- I don't think that's good for a country like Ireland so you know what I did? I said forget it I'm not gonna build it.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Negative> People in Europe and beyond have expressed concern that America may have a protectionist trade policy that will hurt America's friends. What would you say to them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I can tell you that in the last É I think I've done more than any president-elect ever -- Many factories now, many car plants, that were going to be built in other locations are building in Michigan and Ohio -- ya know Ford announced a big one, Fiat Chrysler announced a big one, General Motors is announcing, they're all announcing and I'm not just talking about cars I'm talking about other things, there will be many other things -- you can't allow companies to leave our country, fire all of its employees, move to Mexico, make whatever the product is, and then sell it back in with no tax -- and there will be a very substantial border tax for companies that do that. And when people hear that -- they say we're gonna stay here or we're gonna build in the US -- so they'll go and they'll build their car plant or they'll build their air-conditioning plant and they're gonna sell their air conditioners but they're gonna pay 35 per cent tax... there's not gonna be any tax because they're not gonna leave -- see there's not gonna be any tax -- but the conservative theory is open borders, open borders is all fine. First of all it's bad for security -- for trade it's fine -- the problem is the US is always taken advantage of -- we have hundreds of billions of dollars of trade deficits with China -- we have $805 billion in trade deficits with the world -- ya almost say, who's making these deals when you're losing that kind of money, right -- we actually have almost $800 billion -- almost $800 billion in trade deficits with the world -- so you say, who's making these deals?
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Positive> Well, Germany is obviously benefiting because we are the world champions at exporting?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well you're very good at export -- we buy lots of your cars.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Negative> Do Europeans have to fear something similar to what you might announce for China -- higher custom duties?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's going to be different -- I mean Germany is a great country, great manufacturing country -- you go down Fifth Avenue everybody has a Mercedes-Benz in front of their building, right -- the fact is that it's been very unfair to the US, it's not a two-way street. How many Chevrolets do you see in Germany? Maybe none -- not too many -- how many -- you don't see anything over there -- it's a one-way street -- it's gotta be a two-way street -- I want it to be fair but it's gotta be a two-way street and that's why we're losing almost $800, think of it, $800 billion a year in trade so that will stop -- ya know we have Wilbur [Ross, his choice for commerce secretary] as one of our guys, ya know Wilbur . . .
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I will say most of it... most of it is China 'cause China is a tremendous problem.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> You just mentioned Mercedes, BMW, even VW -- do you expect them to build more plants in the US? For example, BMW wants to open a plant in 2019 in Mexico . . .
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would tell them, don't waste their time and money -- unless they want to sell to other countries, that's fine -- if they want to open in Mexico, I love Mexico, I like the president, I like everybody -- but I would tell BMW if they think they're gonna build a plant in Mexico and sell cars into the US without a 35 per cent tax, it's not gonna happen, it's not gonna happen -- so if they want to build cars for the world I would say wish them luck -- they can build cars for the US but they'll be paying a 35 per cent tax on every car that comes into the country... so what I'm saying is they have to build their plant in the US, it will be much better for them and what we're doing -- maybe more importantly, is we're lowering taxes -- corporate taxes -- down to from 15 to 20 per cent and were getting rid of 75 per cent of the regulations -- from 35 down to 15 to 20, we haven't picked the final but from 15 to 20, and we're also gonna let the companies bring back their money with the inversion, corporate inversion.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Positive> That will affect people like Google?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we've got five -- I think it's five, they say it's 2.5-3, I think it's five, but it's $5 trillion over there and they can't bring back their money so that's part of our tax bill, the money comes back.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Positive> Given your views on free trade, would you say that you're a conservative?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm pragmatic, look I go in front of crowds -- I had the biggest crowds anybody's ever had for a presidential election and that's tough and when I was fighting with Jeb Bush, ya know "low energy" Jeb, he would say, 'Donald Trump is not a conservative', so I'd go in front of 25,000 people and, like in Michigan, where there's massive -- 32,000 people -- and I'm screaming, 'Jeb Bush says I'm not a conservative', they're screaming, 'Who cares?', and I said, 'What do you want? Do you want conservative or a good deal?' And the reason, because Jeb Bush said I'm not a conservative because I don't believe in free trade -- well I do believe in free trade, I love free trade, but it's gotta be smart trade so I call it fair trade -- and the problem, so I said to the people, 'Do you want a conservative or do you want somebody who's gonna make great deals?', and they're all screaming, 'Great deals, great deals' -- they don't care, there are no labels -- ya know there's some people, he is not -- Jeb Bush would stand up -- 'He is not a true conservative' -- who cares -- I am a conservative, but I'm really about making great deals for the people so they get jobs... the people don't care ya know when you're talking -- they don't care, they want good deals -- ya know what? They want their jobs back.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Positive> Do you have any models -- are there heroes that you steer by -- people you look up to from the past?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't like heroes, I don't like the concept of heroes, the concept of heroes is never great, but certainly you can respect certain people and certainly there are certain people -- but I've learnt a lot from my father -- my father was a builder in Brooklyn and Queens -- he did houses and housing and I learnt a lot about negotiation from my father -- although I also think negotiation is a natural trait, I don't think you can, you either have it or you don't, you get better at it but basically, the people that I know who are great negotiators or great salesmen or great politicians, it's very natural, very natural... I got a letter from somebody, their congressman, they said what you've done is amazing because you were never a politician and you beat all the politicians. He said they added it up -- when I was three months into the campaign, they added it up -- I had three months of experience and the 17 guys I was running against, the Republicans, had 236 years Ð ya know when you add 20 years and 30 years -- so I was three months they were 236 years -- so it's sort of a funny article but I believe it's like hitting a baseball or being a good golfer -- natural ability, to me, is much more important to me than experience and experience is a great thing -- I think it's a great thing -- but I learnt a lot from my father in terms of leadership.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Positive> Your policy platform of America First implies you're happy to see the rest of the world suffer. Do you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want it to be a disruption -- I love the world, I want the world to be good but we can't go -- I mean look at what's happening to our country -- we are $20 trillion -- we don't know what we're doing -- our military is weak -- we're in wars that never end, we're in Afghanistan now 17 years, they told me this, really -- 17 years, it's the longest war we've ever been in.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Positive> Given what's been reported this week, what does that say about your relations with the intelligence community?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we have to have, ya have to have the right people and as you know Pompeo -- who's really been received, did a good job yesterday, head of the CIA -- might I think we have some very great people going in -- I think we have some great people -- ya know I have a lot of respect for the intelligence but a lot of leaks, a lot of fake news coming out, a lot of fake news.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Positive> It's been reported that a British former diplomat was involved in this whole thing -- do you think that we, in Britain, need to look at our intelligence services?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that guy is somebody that you should look at, because whatever he made up about me it was false -- he was supposedly hired by the Republicans and Democrats working together -- even that I don't believe because they don't work together, they work separately -- and they don't hire the same guy -- what they got together? See the whole thing is fake news because it said the, whoever it was, intelligence, the so-called intelligence, said he's an operative of Republicans and Democrats -- they don't work together, they don't work together.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> Who do you think, then, is behind it all?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think probably could be intelligence or it could be, it could be, the Democrats.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When I just heard it -- I ripped up the mat... if I did that in a hotel it'd be the biggest thing -- they'd have me on the front page of The New York Post, right? And the other thing, I can't even, I don't even want to shake hands with people now I hear about this stuff -- ugh.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's fake news, it was totally made up and I just got a letter from people that went to Russia with me -- did you see that letter -- very rich people, they went with me, they said you were with us, I was with them, I wasn't even here when they said such false stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I left, I wasn't even there... I was there for the Miss Universe contest, got up, got my stuff and I left -- I wasn't even there -- it's all... so if this guy is a British guy you got a lot of problems.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> How is being president going to change how you operate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ya know this is a very, very big change -- I led a very nice life and ya know successful and good and nice and this is a lot different -- but ya know my attitude on that is when you're president, you're in the White House which is a very special place -- you're there for a limited period of time -- who wants to leave? Like I've liked President Obama, he's been very nice, yeah he's been nice one on one, but maybe not so nice in other ways -- but who wants to leave the White House to go to some other place and be away on a vacation? The White House is very special, there's so much work to be done, I'm not gonna be leaving much -- I mean a lot of work to be done -- I'm gonna be in there working, doing what I'm supposed to be doing -- but who wants to leave the White House?
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Positive> They say Camp David is very nice.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yea, Camp David is very rustic, it's nice, you'd like it. You know how long you'd like it? For about 30 minutesÉ
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> When you're president will you still tweet? And if you do will it be as the Real Donald Trump, as Potus, or probably as Real Potus?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> @realDonaldTrump I think, I'll keep it... so I've got 46 million people right now -- that's a lot, that's really a lot -- but 46 million -- including Facebook, Twitter and ya know, Instagram so when you think that your 46 million there, I'd rather just let that build up and just keep it @realDonaldTrump, it's working -- and the tweeting, I thought I'd do less of it, but I'm covered so dishonestly by the press -- so dishonestly -- that I can put out Twitter -- and it's not 140, it's now 140, 280 -- I can go bing bing bing and I just keep going and they put it on and as soon as I tweet it out -- this morning on television, Fox -- "Donald Trump, we have breaking news" -- I put out a thing . . .
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> ... You were tweeting a lot this morning?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I tweeted a little bit, yeah.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> And you do it on your own?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I tweeted about the intelligence agencies because it all turned out to be false information.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> And you do it on that phone there?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This -- I have numerous, I have numerous -- I have iPhones, I have . . .
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> But nobody else knows how to log into your Twitter account?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I do -- I have one or two people that do during the day I'll just dictate something and they'll type it in.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> So, Steve Bannon or someone else?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, not Steve, but I have people that do it. But ya know the tweeting is interesting because I find it very accurate -- when I get a word out and if I tell something to the papers and they don't write it accurately, it's really bad -- they can't do much when you tweet it and I'm careful about, it's very precise, actually it's very, very precise -- and it comes out breaking news, we have breaking news -- ya know, it's funny, if I did a press release and if I put it out, it wouldn't get nearly -- people would see it the following day -- if I do a news conference, that's a lot of work.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Although the media have been better lately, which is shocking, shocking -- in fact today they have a front-page story saying that Trump's people will never leave him -- ya know all of the voters that I have will never leave -- which is very interesting cause we have great support in the country, tremendous support, I was very surprised at that story.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> What role will [your son-in-law] Jared [Kushner] play?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, really... Ya know what, Jared is such a good kid and he'll make a deal with Israel that no one else can -- ya know he's a natural, he's a great deal, he's a natural -- ya know what I was talking about, natural -- he's a natural deal-maker -- everyone likes him.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Positive> And will [your daughter] Ivanka play a big role in the administration?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, not now, she's going to Washington, and they're buying a house or something, but ya know she's got the children, so Jared will be involved as we announced -- no salary, no nothing. If he made peace -- who'd be better at that then Jared, right -- there's something about him . . .
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> Are you looking forward to meeting our prime minister?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll be there -- we'll be there soon -- I would say we'll be here for a little while but and it looks like she'll be here first -- how is she doing over there, by the way, what do you think?
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Neutral> Theresa?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, May.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Positive> She's got very strong approval ratings.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Popular. How are they doing with the break-up? How's the break-up going?
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Positive> Well, the PM wants to get a strong deal with the US.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're gonna get a trade deal. Well, how is our Nigel doing? I like him, I think he's a great guy, I think he's a very good guy and he was very supportive. He'd go around the US -- he was saying Trump's gonna win. He was one of the earliest people that said Trump was gonna win. So, he's gotta feel for it. Michael, you should've written that we were gonna win.
<Michael Gove, Kai Diekman> <Negative> Well, at least let me give you a copy of my book on how to fight terrorism.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good, I'd love that. That's fantastic -- how to fight terrorism, I can use that.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Welcome to the second night of the CNN Republican presidential town hall from Columbia, South Carolina. Welcome. We've heard now from Governor Kasich. We've heard from Governor Bush. Everyone please welcome Donald Trump. [Applause]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hello, everybody.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Welcome. How's it going? Nice to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hello, Anderson. Nice to see you.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Have a seat. So, you've had quite a day.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, the pope is a wonderful guy. [Laughter]
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Let's start right there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A little surprise.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> How surprised were you by what the pope said? For those who don't know, he said - part of what he said was "a person who thinks only about building walls wherever they may be, and not of building bridges is not Christian; this is not the Gospel."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I didn't think it was a good thing for him to say, frankly. And he was talking about the border, and as you know, I'm very strong on border security, and we have to have a border in this country, and we certainly don't have one right now. And, as you know, we're talking about building a wall.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're gonna build a wall, and Mexico's gonna pay for the wall, and that's the way it is. They - you know, we have a trade balance, and - and if you look at it - imbalance of about $58 billion with Mexico. And it's really more than that, because we also subsidize, et cetera, et cetera, so they're gonna pay for the wall.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But somehow, the government of Mexico spoke with the Pope - I mean, they spent a lot of time with the Pope - and by the time he left, he made a statement - I don't know...
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Wait, you think that the government of Mexico somehow got the Pope to say this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Absolutely. Well, I don't think they said that way. But I think they probably talked about isn't it terrible that Mr. Trump wants to have border security, et cetera, et cetera. And the Pope made the statement, and I think it was probably a little bit nicer statement than it was reported by you folks in the media, because after I read it, it was a little bit softer. But the bottom line is we've gotta have a border, we've gotta have security. We have tremendous illegal immigration in the country. [Inaudible] .
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Well, I'll just say, the Pope did go on to say, "this is - this is not the gospel. As far as what you have said about whether I would advise to vote or not to vote, I'm not gonna get involved on that. "I say only that this man is not Christian, if he has said things like that. We must see if he's said things in that way, and I will give him the benefit of the doubt."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he also talked about having a wall is not Christian, and he's got an awfully big wall at the Vatican, I will tell you. So it's gonna be an interesting - how - how's he...
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But people do come and go through the Vatican, and it's open to tour.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they're gonna come and go through the wall. I mean - you know, but they're gonna come and go legally. They're gonna do it legally. And that's what I want, and that's what a lot of people want, obviously, because they agree with me.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But you - you've been in fights with a lot of people. But in - with the Pope - I mean, does it give you pause? [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't like fighting with the Pope, actually. I don't think this is a fight. I think he said something much softer than was originally reported by the media.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think that he heard one side of the story, which is probably by the Mexican government. He didn't see the tremendous strain that - you know, the border's causing us with respect to illegal immigration, with the drugs pouring across the border. I mean, I - I just won the New Hampshire primary, and I will tell you these are amazing people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The biggest single problem that I had, no matter where I went in New Hampshire, was heroin, and it's pouring in. And it is just pouring into the area. And - you know, it's sort of funny, because you - you look at New Hampshire as being this beautiful, idyllic place - magnificent.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I loved it. I love the people there. I love the whole place. And it's the last place you think that they'd really have a big drug problem. They have a massive drug problem, as you know. And it's always the first subject, no matter what I do - it's the first subject they want to talk about, and we've got to stop it. And it's pouring in through the southern border, and we are going to stop it.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> I just want to ask you one more question on the Pope, and then we'll move on, because there's a lot of other items in the news before we get to - to our voters, many of whom are undecided, as many people are in this state.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Really? [Inaudible] they're undecided?
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> You could - you're doing well in the polls. You could pick up a couple votes tonight.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's a maybe, actually.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Maybe. We'll see. But you - you know, early on, you talked about forgiveness. And you were asked, in terms of your faith, whether you ask for forgiveness. At one point, I remember you said to me you tried not to do things wrong so that you don't have to ask for forgiveness.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> True.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Was there a moment when you first heard the Pope had said something about you that you thought, "maybe I'm gonna have to ask for forgiveness?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. No, look. I... [Laughter] ... I have a lot of respect for the Pope. I think he's got a lot of personality. He's very different. He's a very different kind of a guy, and I think he's doing a very good job. He's - a lot of energy. But I would say that I think he was very much misinterpreted, and I also think he was given false information. If he would have heard our side - the side from people that live in the United States?
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Would you like to meet with him and talk to him about it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll do it any time he wants. I mean, I think it would be very interesting. No, I like him. I mean, I like him as a personality, I like what he represents and I certainly have great respect for the position.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> I - I - as you know, we did a town hall last night. I talked to Marco Rubio, talked to Senator Cruz. You sent Senator Cruz a cease and desist letter to the campaign about an ad they're running that features an old interview you did with Tim Russert back in the late '90s...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Long time ago.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Yeah, you - when you were...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Many, many years ago.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> ... when you were pro-choice. You are now - say your position has completely changed...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm pro-life.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> ... you are pro-life, and you're adamant about that. But...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But that's not the only thing. I mean, look - he has a problem with the truth. And even Marco Rubio - I guess today there was something about he was - you know, picture was manufactured, and it was not perfectly...
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Photoshopped, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it was totally Photoshopped. I could see by just looking at it. In fact, they even made Marco a lot shorter than he is, if you look at it really.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm sure that's probably the thing that bothered him the most. [Laughter] He was a hell of a lot - he was, like, very small. I mean, he's not that small.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not too big, but he's not so small. [Laughter] But - but I will tell you - I looked at that photo, I said immediately it was Photoshopped. But if you look what the he did - I'm talking about Cruz - to Ben Carson, where he said, "listen, he's out of the race. Everybody, come vote for us, he's out of the" - that was so dishonest. And then he did something else that you people never picked up on, and I think it was the worst of all. He did a voter violation notice. It looked like it's right out of the IRS.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Yeah, we talked about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The official paper - it was so disgusting. And it's basically you have a voter violation. Now, they don't have lawyers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These are people that were frightened when they got it. And it graded them. And you have an F, F, F, F.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And essentially, it says if you vote for Ted Cruz, this violation is going to go away. And let me tell you something, people voted for him because of that. That was a fraudulent document.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he said things about me. For instance, I'm very strong on the Second Amendment. He said, "Donald Trump will leave the Second Amendment; he's going to destroy the Second Amendment; you're not going to have a Second Amendment." There's even one going up now in Nevada. He's got something about land - that I'm for taking back the land. I have nothing to do with it. He - he will make up stories. And you know, he holds up the Bible and then he lies. I think it's very inappropriate.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But - but a cease-and-desist letter, I mean, you're not going to sue him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you don't know that. But I like to send letters. [Laughter] I have a lot of lawyers. I have wonderful lawyers. I like to send letters. But you know what? [Laughter] It's good that people know. And I think it's probably - it's probably affected him because I know the CBS poll just came out a little while ago, New York Times-CBS, and I mean, my numbers are fantastic. I think it had an impact...
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> But in that - in that particular commercial, he's using an interview you did give in the late '90s that doesn't represent your current position.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But he's not saying that. He's saying, "I am." And you take a look at the words he says, when he goes around talking to people, he uses that. That was - what? - 17 or 19 years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was a long time ago. It was with Tim Russert, who by the way, was a great guy. We miss Tim Russert.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I really liked him a lot. But it was with Tim Russert. And you've got explain my views now, too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You can't say, "I am," because he would say "I am." And that's what he was doing when he went out to audiences, and it's just not true. And as far as Second Amendment, I'm the strongest person running on the Second Amendment. And he would say - you know, he'd just make up stories.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it was inappropriate, Anderson, and we'll see what happens. Who knows? I mean, I think he's got other cases. I think the wonderful case is going to be whether or not, and I understand he got sued today actually. He's going to be sued by a lot of people and he's going to be sued by the Democrats if he ever got the nomination, which I don't think he will. Honestly, I don't think he will. But if he ever got the - I don't think - I don't think he's got a very good chance of getting it. But he was sued today on the fact that he was born in Canada. It's a big problem.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Do...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A problem for the party, for the Republican Party.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> You said now - cease and desist letter; as you say, you've got a lot of lawyers. You like to send out letters. You certainly attack...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] , but it's something I will do on occasion.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> You certainly attack - your critics say, look, you're a bully. How do you respond?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not a bully. No, I'm not a bully at all. I don't think I'm a bully at all.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I built a great company. I filed as, you know, when I did my file, everyone said I wasn't going to run, then I ran. Then I signed certain documents.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Everyone said, you'll never sign - you know, you'll basically sign your life away - form A or whatever it's called. I signed form A. It's like, you know, they said, "Wow, he signed that." Then they said, "Well, he'll never put in his financials because maybe they're not as good." Turned out they're much better than anybody ever even envisioned. And I built a great company. You have to be - you have to have a certain personality to build - I have some of the greatest assets in the world, very low debt, tremendous cash flow. I mean, it's a truly great company.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> So as president, would you be sending cease and desist letters? Would you be...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, maybe to China. No, I would be. I would be sending them to China to stop ripping us off. I would be sending them to other countries to stop ripping us off. I'd send them to Mexico. And when I say cease and desist, maybe it's equivalent, OK? Maybe I do it with my mouth. [Crosstalk]
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> [Inaudible] disagree with?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Of course. Look, our country is going to hell. We have a problem with China.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have a problem with Japan. We have a problem with Mexico both at the border and in trade. Carrier just announced they're moving to - Carrier Air Conditioner - I buy them all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not going to buy them anymore, by the way. I buy thousands. They're moving to Mexico. I saw the clip. I saw the boss say, "We're closing up; we're moving to Mexico." What do we get out of it? They're moving to Mexico. Now, they're going to make air conditioners, sell them to us, no tax, no nothing. We get nothing out of it. By the way, if we said, "Guess what? You're going to have to pay a 35 percent tax to get them through the border." They wouldn't even move.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> I want you to meet some of the voters. Sherry Burris is here. She's Republican who says she's currently undecided.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, that's too bad.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> She's got a question for you. Sherry?
<Question> <Positive> Hi. Nice to meet you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Question> <Positive> First, I wanted to start off saying that I'm impressed with your business sense, especially because I'm a commercial real estate broker.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good. Then you know. You know how... [Crosstalk]
<Question> <Positive> Yes. Maybe you can teach me some things. But I also have a...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Where are you from?
<Question> <Negative> I'm from Columbia, South Carolina. I also have a master's in public administration. I worked for 16 years in state government, all the way from working with the legislature to state and local government, trying to actually implement private sector policies. As you probably have already figured out, politics and government in general is a totally different animal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Totally different.
<Question> <Negative> Yes. Here's my concern. In private sector, if you don't like the deal, you can walk away.
<Question> <Negative> The president is not a person, it's not a business, it's an office that is powered to protect and serve the people of the United States. My biggest concern is how are you going to govern and get buy-in from people that you may totally disagree with without getting angry and without - refusing to look for common ground. I like your principles, I want a strong president. I want someone who is strong, tenacious, but I'm having some trouble getting past your self control.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK.
<Question> <Neutral> Can you help me with that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I appreciate the question, actually. It's a great question. First of all, when it comes to - you know, some people say, oh, Trump is tough and I thought I did a great debate the other night.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Time Magazine and everybody thought that I won. Drudge thought I won. You know, they do the polls after the debate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought I did a great debate, but some people thought I was too tough. I said, wait a minute. I have Jeb Bush and I have all these guys coming at me from 15 different angles, and you have to be tough and we have to be tough to protect our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a great temperament. You don't build a great company and especially a company with very little debt and all of the kinds of things that I have, and I have employees that have been with me for many, many years. I mean, long-term employees.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're really great people and they've been with me for a long time. But we need a certain toughness. Look, we have ISIS chopping off people's heads, Christians' heads, everybody else's heads, drowning people in cages.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You've never seen - this is like medieval times. We need a certain toughness. I know that Hillary said I don't like Donald trump's tone.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Tone? They're chopping off the heads of people. This hasn't happened since medieval times. We need certain toughness, and if we don't have the toughness, we're not going to end up with a country. You know, we're going to let people come into this country, they're going to be ISIS or ISIS-related and we're going to have problems like you've never seen. You had a problem where you had two radicalized, probably she came in radical, radicalized him, the two - the married couple, the young couple. They killed 14 people. They killed 14 people. They killed people, and you understand what I'm talking about in California, they killed people that give them wedding parties. People that they knew very well. People that they worked with. People that they actually get along with. They killed them. There's something going on. We need a certain toughness. We have weak people leading our country.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> So as president, though, I mean, you've talked about this before, would your tone be different? Is there a presidential Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It would be - yeah. You and I have had this conversation. Yeah sure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, I went to the best school, I was a good student and all of this stuff. I mean, I'm a smart person. I - my uncle was one of the top people at MIT, he was a great professor at MIT.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I - like, you know, Like - it's a smart family, OK? I know - I can be more politically correct than anybody that you've ever interviewed. You'd probably say, boy, that was a boring interview. But I can be very - I can do whatever I want.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have Palm Beach, I have Maralago. I deal with society. Society loves me, and I can act differently for different people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we don't have time to be totally politically correct in this country. Our country is in serious, serious trouble. Let me give you one example, though, about toughness.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we have the Democrats and the Republicans, corporate inversions. There's trillions of dollars that cannot get back into this country. The Democrats agree it should come back in, the Republicans agree.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This isn't something like a health care or whatever that they don't agree. This is something - trillions. They say 2.5 trillion, I say it's more than $5 trillion. Carl Icahn endorsed me. He's a great guy, he's a tough guy. I would get him involved in things. We'll get the smartest business leaders involved. But we have this 2.5 to $5 trillion outside of the country. The Republicans want it in, the Democrats want it in. They can't make a deal. They can't make a deal because there's no leader. I would put these people in a room, and within 10 minutes, I'd have a deal. They all want it. This is something that - not where there's a dispute, they all want it. There's no leadership. Maybe they don't work hard enough, I don't know what it is.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> There's some - there's some candidates that were saying, look, compromise is a dirty word. You have to stand on principles. Do you believe in compromise?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I believe in compromise where I win, OK? [Laughter]
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Can you always win in a compromise?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, can you win. I mean, look. Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan, they ran a pretty good ship and they did well and everybody was happy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The country wasn't based on executive orders. Right now, Obama goes around signing executive orders. He can't even get along with the Democrats, and he goes around signing all these executive orders.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a basic disaster. You can't do it. But here's the thing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Corporate inversion. We have companies, great companies leaving the United States. You know, it used to be they'd leave New York for Florida or they'd leave some place for Texas or some other place, right? But we have great companies leaving this country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The great drug companies are leaving, many of them, they're going to Ireland. I mean, we're having announcements where thousands and thousands of jobs and greats companies are leaving. We can't let that happen. And they're leaving for two reasons, lower taxes, and my plan - under my tax plan, the taxes are much, much lower for the middle class and also for corporations. But very importantly, they're leaving to get back money. They are leaving to get the money that they can't bring back into this country.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> I want you to meet another voter. This is Todd Hicks. He's got a question about health care. He says he is voting for you on Saturday.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like - I like right from the beginning. Thank you, Todd. You're doing the right thing.
<Question> <Positive> Good evening, Mr. Trump. My question's about health care and I'm a local health insurance agent over in Canvas, South Carolina. And I'm not a big fan of Obamacare.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're right.
<Question> <Negative> Yes. You've gone on record as stating that - many times that you're - one of your first acts of duty when you're elected president would be to abolish Obamacare.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. A hundred percent.
<Question> <Negative> A hundred percent. I've actually sat and watched the stick shock from customers as they come in and they've seen the rising costs. What - I'm sorry. [Inaudible] . What is your exact plan and please ...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK ...
<Question> <Negative> Be specific as to what you would do to replace Obamacare?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. Great question. First of all, Obamacare as you know is a disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Your rates are going up 25, 35, 45, 55 percent. It's going to fail in '17 anyway unless as usual the Republicans bail them out. We know where the Democrats are coming from but the Republicans have been so weak.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The budget they passed four weeks ago is a - they call it the omnibus budget. It gives Obama everything he wanted. It gives him money to bring in people from Syria that we have no idea who they are or where they are, et cetera which is a disaster. We can't afford to do that. It gives money for illegal immigration, for letting people come in illegally into this country. The whole thing is a disaster and the Republicans passed it. With health care, we have repeal and replace Obamacare.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> What would you replace it with?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A health care savings accounts which are great. We would do that or we're going to have and probably - and - you can say and/or - what I really like is the - I'm a self-funder. I'm not taking any money, OK? I'm not taking money from the insurance companies so I can do what's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can do what's right for the people, I can do - and this is something that I think I've been given credit for. I don't think I've been given enough credit because I have turned down hundreds of millions of dollars. I could take - if Jeb Bush raised $148 million put it in a fund it's like throwing it out the window what he did with it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would have had 500 - I would have had $1 billion - I have people asking me, "please let me give you" - I'm doing it all myself. What happened is we have lines around each state. It makes it impossible for people to bid to - for insurance companies to bid within those states.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The insurance company would have a monopoly - would rather have a monopoly on here or New York or on Iowa or on any other place than be able to bid all over that United States. Because they make much more money that way. What we do and the insurance companies take care of the politicians.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're giving the politicians - most of the guys that I'm running against are getting money from insurance companies and they're getting money from - by the way other companies. Drug companies, pharmaceutical companies. They give tremendous amounts of money to the people that I'm negotiating against, that I'm debating against, the people that are on the stage, the people that are in Congress, the Senators.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So what I'm saying is this, we have to get rid of the lines. We have to create competition. When you do that you will have the best health care you've ever, ever had. And it'll be at a reasonable cost. They almost got rid of the lines when they were doing Obamacare but it didn't happen. Because the insurance companies have too many of the Senators under control.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Let me ask - just to follow-up ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You understand what I mean. There's no competition.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Did you get your answer - is that specific enough for you - do you ...
<Question> <Positive> Sounds fairly enough. Yes.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> I got one question about it. If Obamacare's ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you ...
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Repealed and there's no mandate for everybody to have insurance, what's to - why would insurance company not have a pre-existing - insure somebody who has a pre-existing condition ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I like the mandate. OK. So here's where I'm a little bit different.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want people dying on the streets and I say this all the time. And I say this - look, I did five speeches, maybe six speeches today. We had a lot of rallies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We had of thousands and thousands of people. We get big crowds. Every time I talk about this I get standing ovations. The Republican people, they're wonderful people. They don't want people dying on the streets. Sometimes they'll say Donald Trump wants single payer because there's a group of people - as good as these plans are and by the way your insurance will go way down, you'll have better plans, you'll get your own doctor which Obama lied. Remember this ...
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Will people with pre-existing conditions be able to get insurance?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. Obama lied when he said you're going to keep your plan, you're going to keep your doctor, you got to - it was a pure lie. And frankly, many Democrats went along only because they believed him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He lied 28 times he said it. Twenty-eight times. If that were in the private sector you'd be sued for fraud, OK? He lied to get the plan through.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He got it through and it's turned out to be a disaster. The wrong people are buying it, you know what's happening. It's dead.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's going to - look, Obamacare is dead. It's going to be repealed, it's going to be replaced. But I will say this, Anderson. If we don't do something quickly you're going to have a health care that you - like you've never seen before in this country. Now, the new plan is good. It's going to be inexpensive. It's going to be much better for the people. But there's going to a group of people at the bottom - people that haven't done well. People that don't have any money that won't be able to be care of.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to take care of them through maybe concepts of Medicare. We have hospitals that aren't doing well, we have doctors that aren't doing well. You cannot let people die on the street, OK? Now, some people would say, "that's not a very Republican thing to say." Every time I say this at a rally, or even today, I said it - once, it got a standing ovation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said, you know, the problem is everybody thinks that you people, as Republicans, hate the concept of taking care of people that are really, really sick and are gonna die. That's not single payer, by the way. That's called heart.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We gotta take care of people that can't take care of themselves. But the plans will be much less expensive than Obamacare, they'll be far better than Obamacare, you'll get your doctor, you'll get everything that you want to get. It'll be unbelievable. But you've gotta get rid of the lines. You gotta have competition. Those people that are left - we've gotta help them live. And everybody likes it when I say it, and that includes Republicans. And it's not single payer. I want to you meet Orrin Smith, he's a Republican from Leesville. He says he's undecided. Orrin, welcome.
<Question> <Positive> First of all, hello, good to see you again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hello, Orrin. Nice to see you.
<Question> <Negative> I think it's about five years ago I sat in your office and you said you were thinking about running for president then, and you didn't run then. But man, are you running...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I should have done it. We would have had Obama for four years instead of for eight years. Right?
<Question> <Positive> ... right, right. Well, man, are you running now.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am running. I am running.
<Question> <Neutral> Yes, and...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Actually, this may be better timing for me if you [Inaudible] .
<Question> <Positive> ... right, and you've made a lot of statements about a lot of issues. You've covered a lot of ground in...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Question> <Negative> ... in a very short period of time. One statement you made, I'm really having trouble getting over, frankly...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK.
<Question> <Negative> ... and I wanted to ask you about it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sure.
<Question> <Negative> As a matter of fact, when I was watching the debate, and you made this statement, I had to apologize to my children for the words that came out of my mouth when you said what you said. And that was - and I don't want to put words in your mouth, so correct me if I'm wrong...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead. Sure.
<Question> <Negative> ... when you said that George W. Bush, which was our last Republican president, a man I respect greatly, a person that we really fought for when he was up against a lot of pressure - that - that he lied to get us in the war in Iraq. That - that - that stung me very deeply.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK.
<Question> <Negative> I don't - I don't believe that. I'm just wondering, given some time passing - perhaps you've rethought that. Would you be willing to rethink that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, a lot of people agree with what I said. And I'm not talking about lying, I'm not talking about not lying. Nobody really knows why we went into Iraq. The Iraqis did not knock down - it was not Saddam Hussein that knocked down the World Trade Center, OK? That's...
<Question> <Negative> What was - just - what you said was, "they lied, they said there were weapons of mass destruction, and there were none, and they knew there were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, there are a lot of people that think that. There are a lot of people that think - look, bottom line, there were no weapons of mass destruction. They said, "there are weapons of mass destruction." I was against the war when it started.
<Question> <Negative> So - so do you think - do you think the president of the United States, George W. Bush, lied to the American people?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, look, I'm not going to get your vote, but that's OK. Let me just [Inaudible] .
<Question> <Positive> I'm just giving you another shot at it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me - let me tell you something. I'll tell you it very simply. It may have been the worst decision - going into Iraq may have been the worst decision anybody has made, any president has made in the history of this country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's how bad it is, OK? The migration that you see today, the destruction of Europe, with Angela Merkel allowing millions of people coming into Germany. I have people from Germany - they want to leave Germany. These are people, two years ago, that would - who'd do nothing but talk about how they love their country, Germany.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're gonna leave Germany. Many, many people are leaving Germany. You're gonna end up with big problems in Germany.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at Sweden, the other day - you look at Brussels - I was in Brussels years ago. It was one of the most beautiful - now it's like an armed camp. So crazy, what they've done.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All of this is the - everything that's happening started with stupidly going into the war in Iraq. Now, Iraq - we have - and people talk about me with the button - I'm the one that doesn't want do this, OK? I'm the one, from 2002, 2003, said you shouldn't be doing it. Here's - here's what happens.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have spent $2 trillion in Iraq - in fighting Iraq. Two trillion. Two trillion. Thousands of lives, right. We have wounded warriors, who I love, all over the place, who say the most incredible - these are braver than all of us in this room put together. I look at the attitude, and I work with them, and these are great people. We got nothing. We have nothing. We're not even there - we can't even make a phone call right now...
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> But to his question, do you believe...
<Question> <Neutral> I'm trying to separate - yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let me tell you, do I know?
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Do you believe he lied, or do you... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can tell you this. I can - I don't - whether he lied or not, he went into Iraq. It was a horrible decision, OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Iraq did not knock down the World Trade Center. Where did these people go when they got on the airplanes? You know where they went? Do you know where they went? They went - a lot of them went to Saudi Arabia, OK? They didn't go back to Iraq. They went to Saudi Arabia.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, there are sealed documents right now that nobody wants to allow to be opened that talk very much about this subject. I'd like to see what it says. I will say this - Bush felt very - and Saddam Hussein overplayed his hand, because he was - you know, he - senior Bush did the right thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He knocked the heck out of him, and then he pulled back, OK? He didn't get into the quagmire. And that was OK to do. The problem is Saddam Hussein said, "I drove them back. I drove the Americans back." He really overplayed his hand. And frankly, I think the son, being loyal to the father - I think he really wanted to go into Iraq, even if it wasn't the right thing to do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He went into Iraq. He started something that destroyed the Middle East. And I said, "Don't go in because you're going to ruin the balance in the Middle East; you're going to have a total imbalance; you're going to have Iran taking over Iraq." Everything I said turned out to be true.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Iran is now taking over Iraq. So - and they wanted to do it for years and years years. They're going to walk in.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, not only do we make a horrible, horrible deal where we're giving Iran $150 billion. We got nothing for it. We get our prisoners back.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They should have been given back to us three years ago, four years ago. We shouldn't have even started negotiating until we got our prisoners back. And we would have had it that way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But here's the problem. So, we make all bad deals. The war in Iraq started the whole destabilization of the Middle East. It started ISIS. It started Libya. It started Syria. That was one of the worst decisions ever made by any government at any time. In all fairness, Bush made the decision. Just one thing. And Barack Obama - Barack Obama, as bad as he is, and he's bad - but he got us out the wrong way. He should have left people there. And he should have done it differently. And he shouldn't have said, "We're getting out at a specific time." He gave a specific date, as you know, to get out. So bad. So bad.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Just to his question - one more chance. Either - you believe he either lied or did not lie. Are you willing to say which?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know what he did. I just know it was a terrible mistake.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> So, was it a mistake for you to say in that debate that you thought he lied?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd have to see the exact words. Look, I don't know. I would probably say that something was going on. I don't know why he went in. I don't know why he went in. Because honestly, there was no reason to go in. They didn't knock down the World Trade Center. It wasn't Iraq that knocked it down.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> You would not say again that George W. Bush lied.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. I can't tell you. I'd have to look at some documents.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> OK. I want you to meet Craig Caldwell. He's a small business owner. He says he's undecided. Craig?
<Question> <Positive> Thank you, Anderson. Mr. Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes?
<Question> <Positive> You're considered the political outsider in this race. A lot of people attribute your overall success so far to that. If you go on to win this nomination and are elected in November, a Trump administration cabinet would consist of people outside of politics. If so, who would you - can you give us some examples of who you would consider and for what post they would...
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> You talked about Carl Icahn already.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, but I don't necessarily - you know, Carl's a very successful businessman. What I'd really love Carl to do is check out how are we doing in trade with China, pal.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> You want him to negotiate.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'd like him negotiating.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Have you thought about...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have other friends. I have some of the greatest businessmen in the world. They're all calling me now because they say, "Wow, this could happen." And they're all calling me. We have the greatest business people in the world in this country. We don't use them. We use political hacks to negotiate with China, with Japan. We have Caroline Kennedy negotiating car deals and trade deals with - and she doesn't even know. Caroline Kennedy got to be the ambassador of Japan.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Would you want all Republicans in your cabinet? Or would you want a cabinet of...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, not necessarily. I want the best people. Honestly, I want the greatest negotiators. We can't lose $505 billion next year with China.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Do you find it valuable as a leader in your business world to have people with very different opinions give you different thoughts?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I like that. Yeah, and then you make the decision. I think I'm very open to that. I like that. I've always liked that. I'm fine with it. I want the most talented people. We have the greatest negotiators in the world. I told you before. We have a trade deficit with Mexico - $58 billion. You know, when they say you won't build a wall. The wall is going to cost $12 billion. It's peanuts compared to what we lose. OK? That's why Mexico is going to pay. It was already... [Crosstalk]
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> They say they're not going to pay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know they do. And it was Calderon the other day, who is the past president, but Calderon the other day said, "We will not pay." So the newspapers called me up. They said, "He said - Calderon said we will not pay. What does that mean? What are you going to say?" I said, "The wall just got 10 feet higher." [Laughter]
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> We've got to take a break. Back in a minute with more questions for Donald Trump.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Welcome back. We're here at the campus of the University of South Carolina here in Columbia. Less than two days to go until Primary Day. Donald Trump taking questions from the voters right now. Thanks very much for being here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Again, continuing. I literally was just handed this. There's a report now out tonight on Buzzfeed that includes - I have not heard it - includes an audio clip of what appears to be you on Howard Stern talking on the radio on September 11th, 2002. He asked you are you for invading Iraq? You said yeah, I guess so. You know, I wish the first time it was done correctly. Is that accurate? Do you remember saying that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. But, I mean, I could - I could have said that. Nobody asked me - I wasn't a politician. It was probably the first time anybody asked me that question.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> But does that...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But by the time the war started - that was quite a bit before the war started.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Yeah, this was 2002.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By the time the war started, I was against the war. And there are articles - I mean, there are headlines in 2003, 2004 that I was totally against the war. And actually, a couple of people in your world in terms of the pundits, said, you know, there' definite proof in 2003, 2004 Trump was against it.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> But 2004, the Reuters article, which you pointed to a lot, and there were a couple of comments you made, I think, at a Vanity Fair party and one other comment. Those were, I think, a couple of weeks after the war began.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Which is OK. A lot of people said - you know, it was so early that even if it was a little bit after the war, I mean, he was totally against the war. I was very much against it. That was probably the first time I was ever even asked about the war. Howard, who's a great guy, by the way. A lot of people don't understand that. But he is -
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> He's a great interviewer.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a great - he's a great interview. He's a very talented guy and a good. But that was probably the first time - I don't remember that, but it was probably the first time I was asked about it.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> OK. I haven't heard it, but you may have said that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, you know, when you're in - when you're in the private sector - yeah, I may have. When you're in the private sector, you know, you get asked things and, you know, you're not a politician and probably the first time I was asked. By the time the war started, I was against it. And shortly thereafter, I was really against it.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> I want you to meet another voter. Ryan Parsons is his name. He's an aspiring entrepreneur here in South Carolina.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi Ryan.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> He's a registered Republican. Right now, he's undecided. Welcome.
<Question> <Positive> Hey Mr. Trump. It's an honor to speak to you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Me too.
<Question> <Positive> Thanks for coming to Columbia. My girlfriend who's a lobbyist here in Columbia advised me not to say this, but in the spirit of you being here, I'm going to say it anyway.
<Question> <Negative> Muhammad Ali once said that his greatest fault was that he didn't know how great he truly was. So my question to you is: What do you think your greatest fault is? And how do you overcome that? Or how have you overcome that? And how will you continue to do so in order to win the general election?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know that it has to do with the general election. I have found this process amazingly interesting. Because, you know, I've never done this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've been doing this for seven months. And I've been giving credit. We're doing really nicely.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it's been very interesting for me. But I will tell you, I've said a couple of times, one of my faults is I will put up with people and deception, even though I know they're deceiving, too long. And - but when I get - when I, you know, get to it, I'm too tough.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In other words, too long, and then instead of just sort of forgetting about it, and especially things that don't matter that much, I never forget. I don't forget. I don't think you forget either, to be honest with you, but I don't forget. And, you know, my wife will tell me sometimes, "You're - sometimes you'll go too long, but then when it gets bad, it's like...
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> So you hold onto stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do. I hold onto stuff. And I'd rather not hold onto stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But if I've been deceived in anyway, or if something happens, I really don't forget. Sometimes you're better off forgetting. And in other cases, it's not such a bad habit.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, you learn. Because usually with people, and I talk a lot about success. Friends of mine ask me, would you speak about success or whatever? And a lot of people pay me a lot of money to do it, and we give it to charity and we have a lot of fun with it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But a lot of people ask me that. And you don't want to necessarily - you want to remember when people deceive you once, usually that same person will do it again, because that's a trait that they have. So, it's not so bad, but I would say I hold on too long and I never forget. And sometimes forgetting is not a bad thing. I hope that makes sense.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> This is Michael Letz. He's been a Republican activist for over 30 years. He is also undecided, like many people in the state. Michael?
<Question> <Positive> Good evening, Mr. Trump. Welcome to the capital of southern hospitality.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Question> <Positive> Tea is sweet, but it looked like the questions tonight have been even sweeter. I'd like to have you address a particular issue that I've not seen any of our Republican candidates address to this point. In the numerous incidents recently of police-involved shootings, and the questions that have I've been led to raise about racism and the racial tensions that have been caused, I'd like to ask what your administration would do to be able to for future situations, make sure that our law enforcement and our first responders have the kind of support that they feel like they need? Because quite frankly, Mr. Trump, first responders' lives truly matter.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're right. I am a big, big supporter of the police. I think the police are being treated horribly in this country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And certainly, you have some bad acts and you have bad mistakes made on occasion. It's a tiny fraction compared to the great work that they do. So I am without question a huge supporter of the police.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We wouldn't be sitting here right now. We wouldn't have a safe society, really. You look at what's happening around the world. We wouldn't have as safe society. So I can tell you right now, I - I assume you are also, you're with me on this. I am a tremendous supporter of the police. And I think they are mistreated and misunderstood. And I think we should give them much more credit than we have given them.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> I want to ask you at the end of these, we like to sort of just ask a couple of personal questions, just to kind of let viewers get to know you in a different way. Last night, as you know, we did a town hall. Senator Cruz, I talked to him. He said - he was claiming that you had suggested your sister as a Supreme Court justice. You have not actually done that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have not.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> You had said she would be great and she would be - she would be fantastic.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's very smart.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> But you'd have to rule that out because she was your sister. What he said was - he says it's great to support your sister; that's a nice thing. But if you're actually suggesting someone for the Supreme Court, his sister is a radical pro-abortion judge. She struck down New Jersey's ban on partial-birth abortion as irrational. That's an extreme position. That's who he suggested as a Supreme Court justice last year. What's your reaction?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, my sister is a brilliant woman who was always a fabulous student, very, very smart. She was appointed by Ronald Reagan. He said appointed by Bill Clinton.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She was elevated to the Court of Appeals, a very high position, right under the Supreme Court, as you know. She was elevated to the Court of Appeals by Clinton; appointed by Reagan, elevated - and the reason she was elevated, she was an outstanding intellect and an outstanding judge. I don't even know what her views are on abortion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I really don't. She is certainly not a radical anything, because that's not her thing. But this is the kind of thing he said "radical this, this, this on abortion." She's not radical.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She may have made a decision one way or the other. I never asked her. I wouldn't ask her. She wouldn't want to tell me. I know I got a very big call from a very great reporter actually at the New York Times. And they wanted to do a major piece on my sister. And they called me. Could I possibly get her to do the piece? I called her. She said, "No, no, I don't do that; I don't want a piece; I don't want anything to do with it; I don't want any…"
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they did the piece anyway. It was a very nice piece on her - but she refused to partake. She has no interest in that. In fact, I said, "are you sure my - you're my sister?" [Laughter] The reporter actually said, "could this be possible?"
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> A Trump who doesn't like publicity? I don't know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't like - you know, you wouldn't believe it. I get a lot of publicity. I don't necessarily like it. [Laughter]
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Come on, wait - wait a minute.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, it's true.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> I gotta call you on that. What?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's true.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> What do you mean?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what, it's true. I don't love that. I can't stand - look, for the most part I find the press is extremely dishonest, OK? Very dishonest.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I find the political press to be unbelievably dishonest. And 25 percent are great. Of course, you're in that category.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He did a great interview with me two weeks ago that I really liked. I thought it was really a great interview because, based on an article a little bit - in the Wall Street Journal, by Monica, who's a terrific person. But - but my sister is a great intellect.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She is a terrific person. She's not radical anything. I don't know what she did, having to do with - with abortion. But she's a great judge. I would have such a conflict of interest - and I think you probably went back and you checked. I do say sometimes - and I joke. I say, "my sister should be on the" [Inaudible] . You know, I'm laughing and having fun. But I would never do a thing like that...
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Right. In fact...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... because it's a conflict of interest.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> ... and just - I want to read the quote, just so we - we're - have it on the record. You said, "I think she'd be phenomenal. I think she'd be one of the best, but frankly, we'd have to rule that out." So you never actually were proposing it. So just for the record.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. It's a - and I don't think she'd want to do it either.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> So last night after the town hall, I went to celebrate at McDonald's. I had a number one meal, which is my favorite meal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Off Microphone] .
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> I understand you like - you were a big fast-food guy as well - that you actually bring fast food to your plane sometimes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do, sometimes. And - and frankly...
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> What - what do you eat - when - when you - when you roll up at a McDonald's, what does - what does Donald trump order? [Laughter] A fish delight, sometimes, right? The - the Big Macs are great. The quarter pounder with cheese. I mean, I - it's great stuff.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Do people at the windows be like, "what?"
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I'm a big - I'm a person - they can't sort of believe it. But I'm a person that - I like cleanliness, I like clean. And the one thing about the big franchises - you have to have a certain - you know, because of the importance.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> One bad hamburger, you can destroy McDonald's. One bad hamburger, you take Wendy's and all these other places, and they're out of business. You can't do it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, I don't want to mention the name of the firm, but you see what a certain firm is going through right now. I mean - I don't know. Do they make it? Do they not make it? So I'm a very - I'm a very clean person.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like cleanliness, and I think you're better off going there than, maybe, someplace that you have no idea where the food's coming from. It's a certain standard. But I think the food's good. And I eat it very carefully. You know, I do as good as - as well as I can. But I think all of those places - Burger King, McDonald's, I can - I can live with them. I had - the other night, I had Kentucky Fried Chicken. Not the worst thing in the world. [Laughter] Not the worst thing in the world.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> What's your favorite kind of music?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think Elton John is great, I think the Stones are great. The Beatles, I love. Michael Jackson was a - actually a very good friend of mine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I knew Michael Jackson very well. Lived in Trump Tower for a long period of time, would go down to Mar-a-Lago. He actually got married - you know, Lisa Marie Presley - the whole big deal at Mar-a-Lago - they were in the tower.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I will tell you, he was up there one week with her, and he never came down, so I don't know what was going on, but they got along. [Laughter] You know, a lot of people say, "they didn't really" - they were up there for a week. They never, ever came - I said, "where the hell is Michael? I've - nobody's seen" - but - but he was a very talented guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> One of the truly most talented people. I knew him very well. I knew the real story of Michael Jackson.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, When he died, I would watch people get on - I don't - I don't want to mention names, but people that you know very well and people that you interview - and they would talk about Michael Jackson. They didn't even know him. I mean, very few people got to know Michael Jackson.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But he was an unbelievably talented guy. He lost his confidence. And - he lost tremendous confidence because of, honestly, bad, bad, bad surgery. He had the worst - he had people that did numbers on him that were just unbelievable - facially, and - you know, the plastic surgeons. But Michael was an unbelievable talent who actually lost his confidence. And - you know, believe it or not, when you lose your confidence in something, you can even lose your talent.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> You've talked about working hard as president. You don't sleep a lot. How much - how many hours a night do you sleep? And how much television news do you watch? Because I get the sense -
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do like it. I watch... [Crosstalk]
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> You seem to know everything that's being said about you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I - I actually get criticized for it. But I do watch it. I watch you a lot, and I watch other people. And you learn. I mean, especially with what I'm doing. Somebody said, you watch, you get your generals through television. Well, I don't. I read a lot. OK? I love to read. But, you know, when I see you interviewing a general, or a - some security adviser or somebody, I mean, you learn a lot from that.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> How much do you sleep?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And - and by the way - about three to four hours a night.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> That's all you need?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's all I need, luckily. I mean...
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Have you always been like that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... yeah, pretty much. I'll tell you what - I honestly believe this - I love what I do. I love my business, I love - The Apprentice was such a tremendous success. NBC would have done anything to renew it with me. I mean, anything. Steve Burke came up to my office, the head of Comcast, and he said, "please, do it, do it, do it." I said, "I'm gonna run for" - you can't run for president and have a show. It's - you know, the equal time provisions, et cetera, et cetera.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said no, Steve, I'm not going to do it. They couldn't believe it, because they really didn't believe - nobody believed I was going to run, you know. My wife actually said if you run, you will win.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you have to actually run. You can't just say you're going to run because you won't do well. You know, the polls were - the original polls, nobody believed I was going to run.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Even when they say if he runs, and they wouldn't even do polls. But she said if you run, you'll win. And Steve Burke came up to the office, he said, I really - you know, they wanted to renew The Apprentice because it was doing phenomenally well. Even after - can you believe it - 14 seasons, 14 seasons and The Apprentice still did well. But I'm not doing - you know, I have that with Mark Burnett and we're using Arnold Schwarzenegger, and hopefully, Arnold's going to do. Is Arnold going to do well? What do you think?
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> A lot of people -
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Will he be Trump?
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Will he beat you? Are you concerned about that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's no Trump, right?
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> All right. Are you - what kind of a - what kind of a parent are you? Because, I mean, your kids - a lot of people speak glowingly about your kids, they speak glowingly about you. Were you a tough dad, and are you different as a grandfather?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I get credit for my children. My children are very good children. They were smart, they went to good schools, they did well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ivanka everybody knows, and then Don and Eric and then I have two younger - Tiffany, who's a terrific young woman, and she - she's just graduated from Penn and did mostly A's. And Baron is doing really good. So I have five children.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But one thing I think I was really, really a good parent because I put my children above everything, above the business, above everything. And Ivanka speaks to it very well and so do the others. But when people come up and they say why, I would say from the time - because I had so much - I had so much experience with alcohol because I have a brother, who is a phenomenal guy, the best looking guy you've ever seen, but he became - he started drinking and I saw from a young age, he was quite a bit older than me.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> He was an airline pilot.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> My brother Fred. He was - he was a very talented flyer of planes, it was - I mean, great pilots would go to him to study. I mean, it was a real ability he had. But the alcohol was - I mean, it taught me a tremendous lesson, and he taught me a tremendous - he was really very -
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> And that's why you don't drink.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He said no - don't you ever smoke. He was [Inaudible] he said don't you ever smoke, don't you ever drink. And I've never had a drink. You know, I've never had a drink and I've never had a cigarette. Those are the good things, I don't want to tell you the bad things. There are plenty of bad things. But I never had a drink, I never had - you know, I never had -
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> You were never tempted to -
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I just - I mean, I never liked the taste. I've had friends - when I want to the Wharton School of Finance, I've had friends that didn't like scotch, they hated the taste. And one in particular, became pretty successful, but ultimately alcohol destroyed him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He would be with me - we're like 18 or 19 years old, and he was trying to develop a taste for scotch, he ultimately became an alcoholic. He became quite successful, lost the success because of alcohol. I've seen what it does to people, it's a horror show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the one thing I can say is if you don't drink, there's no temptation. But people come up to me and they say could you see my children? You know, because my children are doing a good job. You know, famous last words.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Where's wood? Is that wood? Yes. OK, I'm going to knock on wood, OK, because who knows. But my children are doing a good job and they're solid.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I would tell them from a very young age, no drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes. I'd say this so - over and over. In fact, Ivanka sometimes would be like Dad, you're driving me crazy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, she was like 4 years old, she didn't even know what it was. No drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes. And I just put it into them because I've seen people that are really brilliant, people that you know, people - the top people in industry, they have children, they're very smart children, they have all the aptitude in the world but they get hooked on drugs, they get hooked on alcohol and they - alcohol believe it or not is almost harder than drugs, but it's harder to get away from it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But they get hooked on alcohol, they get hooked on drugs and as smart as they are, they never make it.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> So what is one thing you wish you didn't do? Like, what's one - advice or - I mean, are you watching TV late at night? What do you - like -
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I mean, look. I mean - a vice. I work very hard.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Maybe I work too hard. I have - I had two very, you know, wonderful women frankly, that I am a worker. I love to work.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't consider myself like a workaholic. I'm a workaholic, but I don't consider that a bad thing. And I think probably I would have had - I wouldn't have - I have a very good marriage now, Melania is fantastic.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I had two women that I never blamed because I worked so hard that my job came first. Never came first with my children. I always said I was a better - I would say this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was a better father than I was a husband. But I worked very, very hard and I love doing it, and you know what I'm very happy about, I have tens of thousands of employees. I've put so many - I've had thousands and thousands of employees and that takes care of health care, it takes care of education, takes care of so many things. So not that I'd change anything, but it I did a little bit less, probably wouldn't have had two marriages that didn't work out. Donald Trump, thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Appreciate it. Thank you. And that's all the time we have. Our thanks to Donald Trump, to Governor Kasich and Bush. I want to thank everybody here in the audience who asked question. A special thanks to the voters, thanks to all the viewers at home and everybody here in Columbia for their help and hospitality. Next Tuesday, I hope you join us. New Day's Chris Cuomo is going to be moderating a South Carolina Democratic town hall. Our coverage continues with Don Lemon right after this.
<Thomas Roberts> <Negative> Donald, it's great to sit down with you, but let's talk first about why bring Miss Universe to Moscow? What was the catalyst for that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know Thomas, first of all,  we're very proud of the job you're doing. You've been amazing. First thing I did, I came here I said How's Thomas doing?"""ell
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They said he's doing fantastically.  Because this is not something... I mean you're very professional, but this is something that's unique to anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everybody wanted the Miss Universe. We had 18 countries that wanted it, they fought really hard to get it. Probably going to China next year, but China wanted it this year. And Russia wanted it very badly. The folks that Brosius hall have been amazing. Russia wanted it. Moscow wanted it. And as you know they have the Olympics coming up in February, and this is really going to be the start for them, the start of the Olympics is the Miss Universe contest.
<Thomas Roberts> <Negative> You're not one to shy away from controversy.  This did bring controversy to pick this venue because of the current propaganda law that Putin's government put into place, that is against its gay population. What do you say to the people that are questioning why bring it to Moscow especially when the LGBT population is being discriminated against?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know it's very interesting, because when we did it we didn't really know this is such a controversy. And perhaps we should have known, but we didn't. And after we signed, it became quite controversial, and as you know Andy Cohen and other people sort of...  I wouldn't say spoke against it, and he's done a very good job doing what you're doing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they didn't come out exactly in favor and then... we have, as you know we have a lot of gay people that work at the Miss Universe pageant, and we spoke to them. We said what do you think?" And they said we want to go
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I thought it was great, and I think it's going to be very special. When we got you, and the first time we spoke you told me you were gay and I said, good
<Thomas Roberts> <Positive> So what does this mean about your politics? Back at home, when it comes to marriage equality ,or saving theEmployment Non-Discrimination Act, that just passed the Senate? Do you think that entrenched homophobia is a problem not only in our home country but internationally? And how would you try to save... that because right now you're in Russia and you're saying you know that we support equality and you're against the discrimination here, nut back at home it's a different stance?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think really what you have is a very interesting stance and its a changing stance, and you see it changing very rapidly. If you go back 10 years ago, it's a lot different than it is today. The president was against gay marriage, and now he's in favor of gay marriage, and you have many people changing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think that it's an evolving process Thomas and it is evolving very quickly now obviously the United States is far ahead of Russia in terms of what you're talking about but it is very much evolving and I think probably evolving to the point where you're becoming a lot more comfortable with it .
<Thomas Roberts> <Positive> And, where are you evolving to at this point? What's your stance on marriage equality? I sit across from you a married man back at home, recognized by our federal government. So what do you think of marriage equality and where your stance is, and if you are evolving?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well I think I'm evolving and i think I'm a very fair person but I have been for traditiona,l as you know, for traditional marriage .
<Thomas Roberts> <Neutral> And so when we're at that spectrum of evolving where would you put yourself? From 1 to 10? So 10 fully evolved, you're President Obama, you've evolved.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I don't know if he's fully evolved. We'll see if he's fully evolved. But you know I'm... I'm sort of probably a little bit in the middle. I mean I am for traditional marriage. I'm for marriage between a man and woman and I've been that for, you know, that's... that's where... that that's the way. Can it change? I don't know, but my stance right now is traditional marriage.
<Thomas Roberts> <Neutral> OK, so when we talk about what the current politics are back at home, we know that there is a tense relationship between President Obama and Vladimir Putin and especially when it comes to world stage issues, do you have a relationship with Vladimir Putin? A conversational relationship, or anything that you feel you have sway or influence over his government?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do have a relationship, and I can tell you that he's very interested in what we're doing here today. He's probably very interested in what you and I are saying today and I'm sure he's going to be seeing it in some form. But i do have a relationship with him, and I think it's very interesting to see what happened. I mean, look he's done a very brilliant job in terms of what he represents and who he's representing. If you look at what he's done with Syria, if you look at so many of the different things he has really eaten our president's lunch. Let's not kid ourselves, he's done an amazing job. He's put himself really, as you know, a lot of people would say he's put himself at the forefront of the world as a leader in a short period of time. Now, in all fairness to Obama, I think that he's done the same thing with Bush, with President Bush. I think that Putin has done an amazing job of showing certain leadership that our people have not been able to match.
<Thomas Roberts> <Negative> When it comes to politics in general, do you really have political ambitions for yourself or you just like to run the, the, the hotline of staying involved politically, but maybe not actually running for office. Because there was a rumor that maybe you're thinking about running for New York Governor.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that was a rumor that I immediately quelched. Tthere was a not only a rumor I mean everybody wants you to do it ,and wanted me to do it. But I had no interest in that and I told them that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What happens is polls are taken and I do very well in polls, because people know my stance on China and lots of other places that just rip us and just laugh at us and they can't believe it and I can't believe what they get away with. And I have great respect for all leaders, but I can't believe what their leaders get away with with respect to the United States because they are really taking advantage of our country. And people hear this and other things that have to say, and I think they like it. So it's not me, they go out and they talk to people and they'd like to see me run, and you know to be honest the question was just as soon. As many times today at the Miss Universe got this thing would you run, and it's just too soon to say because we have a big election coming as you know very well you covered very nicely in 2014 and we'll see what happens.
<Thomas Roberts> <Neutral> What you think about the Republican brand right now back at home?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well i think it was badly hurt and i think it was... I think it's very disunited. I... if they were together, they could have gotten something and maybe something very good. But you have two factions and it's very disunited and really trouble. I will say this however President Obama has got to do something with his website and Obamacare, because that is absolutely hurting him so badly. I mean what's going on with the website that cause $635 million. I have many many websites all over the... tremendous... whether it's Doral Hotel or the Old Post Office or Trump Tower, they're great. I don't spend $635 million. I don't spend a million. I don't spend anything for websites. They spent $635 million on a website that is totally a mess to a Canadian company, etcetera etcetera.  I do think this. I think that's had the worst impact on the president of almost anything. I mean lots of problems but that's had the worst. In fact he's got to get that straightened out or I really think I actually think it will be devastating for the Democratic, for the Democratic Party come '14. It's going to be a very interesting time.
<Thomas Roberts> <Neutral> It certainly is something for Republicans to unite around, as you say, to redefine the brand.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By the way they are very united around Obamacare, but then that I mean you have such different, and such divisive views. But I think if they don't get that fixed, if they don't get Obamacare going, and I'm not a fan of Obamacare, but if they don't get it going that will be devastating for the Democrats.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, nice to talk to you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hello, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, you're grabbing headlines again, Donald. Now I understand that you are not going to go forward with this debate.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, the Republicans were very worried that I was going to run as an independent. They were afraid to go into the debate, other than, of course, Newt Gingrich, who showed great courage, and Rick Santorum. So they were afraid to go into the debate. They were sort of being led by a couple of people that said, Well, if Trump runs as an independent, and I'd only do that if they choose somebody that is not to my liking, somebody that would not beat the president, who must be beaten if this country is going to almost survive.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You could use that expression, I really believe. We are in such deep trouble. But the Republicans were very concerned that I would run as an independent. And you know, that's their -- that's their concern and that's their problem.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Are they -- let me ask you this way. Do you think they're afraid of you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know that they're afraid. I know they're afraid that I'll run as an independent, and I'll only do that if they pick somebody that I don't think will win or somebody that I don't think would do a good job, which is a possibility.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What difference would that make? What difference would that make in you moderating a debate, do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, they didn't want to be in a debate where somebody would be running as an independent sometime into the future. As you know, I have the equal time laws against me because of the show, "The Apprentice," and I'm not allowed to run until around May 20th. After that time, I'm a free agent. I can do what I want.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If I see that the Republicans have picked the wrong candidate or somebody that either won't do a good job or isn't going to beat Obama, then I would be able, after May 20th, to run.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, Donald, I am -- I have watched and even spoken to you after many of them have made a pilgrimage to New York to talk to you. There's no secret that -- that you have thought that it has not been particularly loyal of many of them, with the exception of Senator Santorum and Speaker Gingrich. Is that a fair assumption again tonight that you think the rest of them were disloyal to you?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> They wanted... [Crosstalk]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> They wanted your endorsement?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I was very disappointed with Mitt Romney. We have a great relationship. I like him very much. I think he likes me. I was very surprised he didn't do the debate. I think it would have been a great thing for him to do. It would have been fair and tougher than the other debates. I know the issues better than the moderators.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They don't even bring up the important things as do what is happening and what is wrong with our country. So I was very disappointed that Mitt Romney didn't do the debate. I think it would have been a very good thing for him.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I got the feeling you were leaning perhaps endorsing Governor Romney. Is it safe to assume now that you are going to endorse either Speaker Gingrich or Senator Rick Santorum in light the way the cards unfolded?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't think it's safe to assume. I do respect the fact that Newt Gingrich came up and was immediately willing to do the debate. He didn't wait. He was the first one. He said I would love to do the debate. His big thing he wants to beat Obama. He is looking at this audience not just to win the nomination but to beat Obama.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I haven't made my mind up. I haven't made a decision yet. When I do, I'll let a lot of people -- a lot of people are waiting for me to make the decision because they understand that I see what is going on. I see what is being ripped off by other nations and OPEC, and nobody does anything about it. We are like a trust without a trustee.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We don't have somebody that is confident enough as a president to protect us as a nation.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Do you think Speaker Gingrich can beat Obama? If so what is your level of confidence he could?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think he could. I think President Obama has done such a poor job and divisive job. Class warfare may be the only way he will get re-elected because the country is doing terribly. The real unemployment rate is 21 percent. I had a smile last week when it down you than to 8.6, but 315,000 people gave up and may gave up permanently in trying to get a job, and therefore they don't count.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What kind of numbers charade is this? If you look at the numbers you are probably talking about 21 percent unemployment.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What would it take for Governor Romney to get back in your good graces and Representative Bachmann and those others that have now disappointed you. What would it take to regain your trust and confidence in them?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We'll have to see what happens. I'm going to give an endorsement in the not too distant future. As you know, millions of people are waiting for that. And they are not waiting because I am a nice person or waiting for any other reason. They really feel I get it. I watched the Republican debate. They don't even talk about OPEC or very little about China.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And these are very major reasons why our country is doing so badly. They take our jobs in the case of China. They manipulate their currencies. Then they take our money and loan it back to us and we pay them interest. The whole thing is incredible and it could stop so easily if we had somebody at the top who was competent, which we don't.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What are we not going to see in any of these other debates that you would do?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think you would have had a tougher debate. I wouldn't spent 15 minutes giving instructions, and then go ad nauseam on and on. It would have been a real debate on the real issues. It would have been a great debate. But I also understand, the RNC Reince Priebus was very, very strong in the fact he thought it may be dangerous for Republicans to go into a debate with somebody that could potentially beat an opponent after May 20th.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Would it have been dangerous?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It may have been. I don't think it would have been. Even if that was the case, they are going to get their word out. And if they're good at doing it, I don't see how a candidate that is far behind -- you could name any of them. Newt Gingrich right now is way up, but I respect the fact that he has the courage to go out and say immediately I want to do that debate.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's going to be a hell of a debate. There will be a lot of people watching. I was very disappointed that other people didn't want do it. They are so far behind, what did he have to lose?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> One last question. How important is loyalty to you an element of the endorsement?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Loyalty is very important. But as an example, she is not going to win anyway. I told her, Michele, you are a wonderful woman. Why don't you go home and relax. Michele Bachmann would call me constantly. She came up four times. I didn't want to see her, but out of respect I saw her. She asked me if I'd do a phone call with a lot of people.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We get thousands and thousands of people. I said I'll do it and the call lasted over an hour. Then I said would you do the debate. She says I don't want to do that. It's not relevant because she is not going win anyway, but it was very disloyal. I thought was very disloyal especially in her case because she came up four times.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She called. She talked. And then I get this long lengthy call with thousands of people, and then she says she is not going to do the debate. So that's not a loyal thing. I'm a believer in loyalty. I absolutely am.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Did anybody call you personally and say Donald, I'm not going to do this?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Who?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Governor Romney called me and said very nicely he won't be able to do it. He said his schedule doesn't permit, which is farfetched, I think. If I think he will do the best job, I would endorse him in a minute. It's not because he won't do the debate. I guess you have to get over that psychologically, Greta, but the fact if I think he is the best that will do the best job for the country, I wouldn't hesitate to endorse him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I will say that I'll be making an endorsement at some point. If that person wins, obviously I'm not going to be running. If the person doesn't win and somebody else, I might depending on who that is.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> The difference between Newt Gingrich and Governor Romney in your mind tonight is what?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think there are a lot of differences. Both have done very well in the debates. Both are doing a very good job. They seem to be leading. It seems inconceivable that somebody is going to come up and nab the position. But I think they are very different styles. They have very interesting styles. I will say it's amazing the way Newt has caught on. He is like a rocket ship.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Mitt Romney is really having a hard time getting in that 20 percent quagmire. For some reason, Herman Cain, who I think is an excellent guy, when he leaves and all those potential voters come up and it comes up in the polls, and you see Romney gets none of them it's really -- I don't understand why. I think he doesn't understand what is going on. He doesn't seem to pick up any momentum.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That is big problem. He has to solve that problem very quickly.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, nice to talk to you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you very much, Greta.
<Paula Zahn> <Positive> And joining me now, someone who knows a thing or two about Manhattan real estate, Donald Trump .
<Paula Zahn> <Positive> Welcome. Always good to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi, Paula.
<Paula Zahn> <Negative> Hi, Donald. So the U.N. argues that the secretary-general residence has to be renovated because the kitchen is a fire hazard, it hasn't been renovated since 1950, that the electricity goes out from time to time. Why would the Bush administration approve this price tag?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's a lot of money to renovate a building of any kind, especially a small building. And, of course, they are spending $1.9 billion on the United Nations building and they're spending at least a billion and probably a billion two more than necessary to do that job. So why would they try to save money here? I mean, they are spending a lot of money on this building also. But the big waste is the $1.9 billion which I predict in four years from now you will talking to me, Paula, and it will be $3.5 billion that they will have spent.
<Paula Zahn> <Negative> Are you more angry about the potential incompetence in the way the U.N. procurement process works, or just the idea that we're even talking about these kinds of numbers in the first place?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know what Paula, I'm a big fan of the United Nations. And when it worked well it was great. Bring back [Inaudible]. The fact is we have a war going on in Iraq. We have problems all over the world. They don't do anything except spend money. They spend money but they don't solve problems. I mean, why do we have this ridiculous war in Iraq going on? Where was the United Nations to help stop it? It is just -- if they did a great job there, let them spend whatever they want on there buildings. But to be so incompetent in every facet including construction in New York is pretty disheartening to me.
<Paula Zahn> <Negative> I want you to respond to these numbers. $200,000 to upgrade the kitchen. $100,000 to renovate two small bathrooms in the entryway. $2.1 million to install central heating and air conditioning. Could you do it for less than that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, anybody can do it for less than that. That's a lot of money. And of course that's the peanut money compared to the bigger picture, but that's still a lot of money for those individual items that you just named. Certainly maybe double and triple what it should cost.
<Paula Zahn> <Negative> So how outraged do you think U.S. taxpayers should be about this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think they should be more outraged by the fact that the United Nations, which has the power to do great things, doesn't do anything. That to me bothers me a lot more than their renovation bills. But when you look at food-for-oil and oil-for-food and all the scandals and Kofi Annan's son, and then you see about apartments costing millions of dollars to renovate, and then you see much more importantly about a building in the United Nations -- at the United Nations.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Here's a building that's built, and they are going fix it for $1.9 billion? And this all began when the Swedish ambassador called me and said you built a building across the street, 90 stories for $350 million. How come it costs $1.9 billion to renovate a building that's smaller? So it's a very terrible thing going on over at the United Nations, Paula. [End Clip]
<Paula Zahn> <Positive> And that was my conversation with New York real estate developer Donald Trump .
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> Well, another big name jumping on Arnold's bandwagon. America's mayor Rudy Giuliani reportedly adding his name to a power-packed list backing Schwarzenegger's run for California governor. Rudy joins the likes of former Secretary of State George Schultz and investment guru Warren Buffett.
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> ...another big name says that Arnie should boot one of those big names out of his camp. "The Donald," as in Donald Trump, joins us by phone. Donald Trump, good to have you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hello, Neil.
<Neil Cavuto> <Neutral> What do you make of one of those names, Warren Buffett?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he's a man I have great respect for, and I don't say move him out. I -- it's great to have him involved and have him involved in the campaign, but I think the concept of raising property taxes...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...a big property owner also in California, and, you know, that's not what it's all about. First of all, Arnold won't get elected with that stance, and, second of all, that's not what you want to be doing.
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> Do you equate the slide in Schwarzenegger's popularity -- again, depending on the poll, Donald -- with this position on property taxes that's kind of fuzzy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I really do. I mean California's a huge property state. It's a huge real-estate state, and, if you have somebody saying let's raise everybody's real-estate taxes, it's going to be very negative.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...Arnold has disavowed that, he said he's not going to be doing that, but, certainly, he's taken a huge dip in the polls, and I guess perhaps that's the reason.
<Neil Cavuto> <Negative> ...know, there are a lot of core Republicans, Donald, who say they do not trust Schwarzenegger. He did not take the no-new-tax pledge, and, while he said that he likes Proposition 13, the much-talked- about 1978 law that kind of froze property rates where they were, he is not saying that it couldn't be tinkered with. What do you make of that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I know Arnold very well. Number one, he's a really honorable guy, and, you know, what he says he's going to do, and he's also a strong man who's made really some incredibly good business decisions.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...I think he'd be a great -- I think he'd be a great governor for California, I'd like to see him get elected, and, you know, I think he's got a very good chance of getting elected.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...he cannot take that stance on property. He just cannot do it. There are other things to do. There's a lot of cutting that can be done, if need be, and it has to be done. With $36 billion in deficits, it has to be done. But...
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> But, you know, Donald, that's an interesting point because some of the proponents for this job are saying that you can't cut your way to slice that $38-billion gap. Some taxes are going to have to be raised, and maybe Buffett was right at readdressing Proposition 13.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're right, but, you know, number one, you've got to do what's right. You've got to get elected, and, if you can't get elected, it's all not going to matter, and you're not going to get elected on the real-estate tax issue, and -- there are other things you can do, and there are other taxes you can raise, which won't be as onerous to the voters.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, you know, I just don't think that was one of the taxes that you can play with. Number one, you can't do it anyway because of the proposition. So you're not allowed to do it anyway, Neil. But there are other taxes that you can be talking about, which are not going to cost him getting elected.
<Neil Cavuto> <Negative> ...me ask you a little bit about what -- Warren Buffett tried to explain himself after that Proposition 13 comment, Donald, saying to the effect that he feels that there's something wrong and -- I'm paraphrasing here -- with a system that has people who own very pricey real estate -- maybe he was including you. I don't even know -- but in Malibu and other very pricey parts not doing and keeping and paying their fair share. Was there something to that or not?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there could very well be, but I will say that I own a great piece of real estate in California, 300 acres along the Pacific Ocean. It's very heavily taxed, and, you know, I wouldn't want to see it go up higher.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...I'm just one of, you know, many millions of people in California. I own -- I own some wonderful things in California, but I don't want to see them taxed. That has nothing to do with the issue at hand.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He is not going to be elected, number one. Number two, real-estate taxes, as far as I'm concerned, in California, relatively speaking, are already very high, Neil.
<Neil Cavuto> <Negative> ...me get your take on the whole race. Right now, there are a lot of people who pooh-what's going on in California, Donald, because they say it's made a travesty of the process, an actor running, a comic running, a "Hustler" publisher running, that it has become a joke. Do you think it's become a joke?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's pretty interesting what's going on. I mean some of the candidates running are a joke. There's no question about it. But Arnold is a very serious candidate. You have people such as Peter Ueberroth who is a great guy and a great talent, and...
<Neil Cavuto> <Neutral> Do you think all those guys should bow out to let Arnie be the Republican guy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that you have some very good people running, but you have some real characters running that obviously shouldn't be running and they are making a joke out of the system. the...
<Neil Cavuto> <Neutral> So you're not for Gary Coleman, I take it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I mean, look, there are many of them. I don't want to say Gary Coleman, I don't know Gary Coleman, but it doesn't sound like he'd be a top candidate, and I think he even said himself he's not a top candidate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...the -- the whole concept of the -- of the recall is very interesting, Neil, because, you know, somebody got elected, and now they're trying to unelect him, and there are a lot of people that aren't thrilled with that. But I can say this: Arnold Schwarzenegger would be a great governor. I really believe that. I know him well.
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> ...know, but it wasn't too long ago that you were entertaining a run for the presidency, saying at the time that we really needed a businessman's sense in the White House. I'm paraphrasing there as well. Would you ever entertain that again?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, a lot of people wanted me to run. I chose not to do it. They had an independent party, which was a joke, and you know, they were all asking me would you run, would you run, and, you know, a lot of pressure was put on to do it. I just I decided not to do it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I had great poll numbers and people were liking me, but I really love building wonderful buildings, all over the place, even if it's in California! So, you know, I'm having a good time doing what I'm doing, and I don't see it for myself, no. But, you know, we have some very good people around that can do a very good job.
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> Would you support President Bush for reelection?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's early. I mean, right now, we're at a very, very interesting time in our country. You know, we have -- every state is at a huge deficit. Huge deficit. When you look at California, $36 billion. New York State has a huge deficit. You know, we're spending hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign countries. It's -- it's very upsetting to see what is happening.
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> ...right, Donald Trump. I wish we had more time, but thank you for joining us. I appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Neil.
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> ...right. Donald Trump is the big cheese in the Trump organization joining us from his New York offices via the phone.
<David Letterman> <Negative> [Inaudible] for our program on the streets of New York City. This of course takes planning, meticulous preparation and a lot of hard work. It was only a matter of time before we said, "The hell with it."" Instead
<Reporter> <Neutral> When Marla arrived, one of the first people she saw was the Principal of Northwest Linda Kilpatrick. She was also Marla's basketball coach in high school.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Hi, how are you?
<Neil Bordy> <Neutral> How are you today?
<David Letterman> <Positive> Good, how are you? What's your name? Right outside their hotel, we met Neil Bordy and Tania Anderson just in from Louisville Kentucky for a weekend vacation. What are you doing right now?
<Neil Bordy> <Positive> We're just getting ready to go out and do some sightseeing.
<David Letterman> <Negative> Would you mind if we came along with you? Would that bother you? As it turns out we really have nothing to do today.
<Neil Bordy> <Negative> That's too bad.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Yes. They plan to spend the afternoon sightseeing and agreed to let us tag along. I'm guessing it was the jetlag. Taxi.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Hey, right here, Taxi. Hey, what? Empire State Building and step on it. Thank you. That's the Lincoln Memorial over there.
<Reporter> <Positive> Marla was surrounded by her family, security, her publicist from New York, and of course the Donald. After a few introductions, they moved on to greet all the members of the press who were waiting with microphones in hand.
<Reporter> <Neutral> Are you two back together?
<Marla Maples> <Positive> We are. Right now, aren't we on? Well, we were just sort of trying to keep that quiet for a bit. We're here for a football game.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're great friends and we're here, because we want to see a good football game, right?
<Marla Maples> <Positive> Yes and the best people are here at home and I don't get home enough. Everyone here is so good for me and good to me during a really tough time and I just sort of want to say thank you to everyone at home for really sticking by me and being loyal. It means a lot.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> Are you ready for an engagement ring?
<Marla Maples> <Negative> Oh, I don't know. I thought it was a little too flashy for that, didn't you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think so.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Right over there, see the Twin Towers? That's Lincoln and his wife. That's the Golden Gate Bridge. You can't see it because of the fog, but it's beautiful.
<Tania Anderson> <Negative> You guys are blocking me.
<David Letterman> <Negative> Oh, jeez. My retinas, my corneas. This going to look like something left over from the Patty Hearst kidnapping. [Not transcribed].
<David Letterman> <Negative> Here's the card. This is going to your [Inaudible]. Lyle, Peggy and Carol and it says, "New York is horrible
<Audience Member> <Neutral> Dave, how are you doing?
<David Letterman> <Positive> Good, how are you? I want you to meet some people, some friends of mine. They are in town from Louisville. This is Neil and his girlfriend Tania.
<Audience Member> <Negative> Neil, Tania, why don't you come on in, peach margarita.
<David Letterman> <Neutral> Do you know about Trump Tower?
<Tania Anderson> <Negative> A little.
<Reporter> <Negative> She wasn't wearing the ring, instead, the Northwest corsage and with just a few minutes left before kickoff. Marla made time to stop and talk with us. I was talking to Kilpatrick earlier and she said she always knew that you were going somewhere, because you were just way too poised, and she was always afraid something was going to happen to you when you play basketball. Anyway, I remember seeing you on the basketball court and who would have ever thought at that time that all this would be happening.
<Reporter> <Positive> You've been getting so much national attention. How does it strike you? Does it still surprise you?
<Marla Maples> <Neutral> I love to look back on the days when I was out here on the basketball court and head coach Kilpatrick better saying, "One more [Inaudible] and you were the cheerleader
<Reporter> <Positive> Do you ever try to look ahead now Marla? In five years from now what's going to be happening with Marla?
<Marla Maples> <Positive> I'm just surviving the days right now. I'm just really just trying to -- I am a firm believer in just dealing with the moment, and doing the best that you can with each day rather than looking so far ahead in the future, because you never know how much time you have left, so you make the most of today I think.
<Reporter> <Negative> Everybody wants to know, what is the situation with you and Donald?
<Marla Maples> <Positive> Well, he's just very supportive and a very, very close friend of mine and we're just not really making any big steps right now, we're just enjoying each other's company when we can and just enjoying a little time to be sure of a big decision.
<David Letterman> <Neutral> You just heard of it?
<Tania Anderson> <Negative> A little. [Inaudible]
<David Letterman> <Neutral> Is he really?
<Tania Anderson> <Negative> Yes. [Not transcribed]
<David Letterman> <Positive> Hi, how are you? Are you the security man?
<Audience Member> <Neutral> Yes.
<David Letterman> <Neutral> Carrying on heat? Do you have a gun on you?
<Audience Member> <Neutral> Yes sir.
<David Letterman> <Neutral> Show us your gun.
<Reporter> <Neutral> And the ring?
<Marla Maples> <Neutral> The ring? Who has that ring? Mom, Mom do you have the ring?
<Reporter> <Negative> What ring? What ring was that?
<Marla Maples> <Negative> I think my mother ran away with it.
<Reporter> <Negative> [Inaudible] get to come home and visit more often.
<Marla Maples> <Positive> Yes. Well, what my mother just tends to be able to jump on an airplane so quick and my father and everything's as long as I can get to connect with them, that's important.
<Reporter> <Negative> I need to go. Do you ever miss being in the [Inaudible]. I miss being out here in the country, that's for sure. Do you ever get tired of all the hype and the media? Is it hard for a relationship?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's very hard for a relationship and it's just unbelievable. I don't know why, I don't know to what extent, but she's a great lady and it's a fantastic tribute to her. I'm really impressed and then I came here it's just a fantastic tribute to Marla.
<Reporter> <Neutral> What would you like to see happen?
<Audience Member> <Negative> I don't think that we could.
<David Letterman> <Negative> Let me pat you down. Come on over here. Let me just see if I can find where your gun is, please? No? What is that [Inaudible] for?
<Audience Member> <Neutral> That's $10,000.
<David Letterman> <Negative> Ten grand. I don't know, that might be a little showy with that necklace. Foxes or what? They're clubbed to death?
<Audience Member> <Positive> No, no, no. They have to be very carefully put to sleep.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Are they shot in the head? Thank you very much, going in. Thank you again. [Inaudible], Oh, my gosh. I'm Dave Letterman.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Nice to see you. How are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nice seeing you. Would you like to come into the office?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> With respect to what?
<Reporter> <Positive> With respect to the relationship or the future.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know. I just think -- I'm just really happy tonight. This is something she told me about, she's told me about it for a long time and I look at that the turn out it's fantastic.
<Reporter> <Positive> Out at the field, the stands were packed for the homecoming game. People wanting to see who the new homecoming queen would be and get a glimpse of the one from 10 years ago.
<David Letterman> <Negative> Yes, let's go in to the office, because I need to talk you about the heating in my building done. Where's is Doug Clooney for heaven's sakes? Doug? One more question and then we're out of here. It's the middle of a Friday afternoon, you didn't know we were coming.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely.
<David Letterman> <Negative> You said, "Come on up."" How busy can you be?"
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not busy. I have nothing to do. You know my [Inaudible]. I wish I had more to do.
<David Letterman> <Negative> What would you be doing if you could [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think I'll go to Louisville. We'll do a couple of real estate deals in Louisville.
<David Letterman> <Negative> There's a spot over here, Don on the carpet. Look into that. Thank you very much. Bye, bye.
<David Letterman> <Positive> All right, let's get out here. Don't touch anything, let's go. That's about it and after this, you're pretty much on your own. Nice meeting you.
<David Letterman> <Negative> Take care. Have a good time. Keep your hand on your wallet. All right, bye, bye.
<David Letterman> <Positive> Very nice people from Louisville. We'll be right back.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> On Close Up this morning, Donald Trump. After months of toying with the idea of running for president on the Reform Party ticket, the billionaire real estate developer has finally made a decision. I sat down with Donald Trump and asked him what he's going to do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've made my decision. I'm not going to be running. The Party is, as you know, self-destructing. Jesse has left, and that's a problem. And so I will not be running.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Not running for the nomination of the Reform Party, or not considering any run for the presidency this time around?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not considering the run.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Nothing could change your mind with that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. Totally not.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> When you say the Party is self-destructing, what do you see as the biggest problem with the Reform Party right now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you've got David Duke just joined -- a bigot, a racist, a problem. I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party. Buchanan's a disaster as we've, you know, covered. Jesse's a terrific guy who just left the Party. And he, you know, it's unfortunate, but he just left the Party. He's going to be doing his Independence Party from Minnesota. And he's a terrific guy and a terrific governor, and he's got a great future. And I've always said, Matt, that I would run if I thought I could win, and in order to win...
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Not only the nomination, but the presidency.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...the whole thing. I don't want to get 20 percent of the vote, I think I could, and I know I could get the nomination. New York wants me. Texas wants me. Many of the states want me. And they're, you know, they're rather devastated because they don't like the alternatives. I always said, and I said to you if you can win the whole thing, you can only win the whole thing with a totally unified party.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> You're sure this is -- and some critics of yours are going to say this is a great excuse for Donald Trump to back out now, because they're going to say, first of all, you're thrown off the ballot here in New York.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me, New York backed me 100 percent. The head of New York, Jack Essenberg, is 100 percent in my camp. You have a communist...
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> You aren't on the ballot.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...you have a communist -- no, no, but New York is backing me. The New York party totally backs Donald Trump. The polls came out great. The polls...
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Well, let's stop. Let me talk about the polls. Latest Zogby poll that I saw, February 6th, 2000, if the election were held today, over 40 percent of the people would vote for Gore. Over 40 percent of the people would vote for Bush -- by the way you've called them "Gush" and "Bore," and 3.2 percent of the people would vote for Donald Trump. Given the margin of error...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If the polls -- excuse me, Matt. If the polls are staged in a certain way where people believed I was running -- I mean, the biggest problem I had, is people never believed I'd want to do it or I'd run. In those polls I do amazingly well. I get 24-25 percent of the vote, in those polls.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> It's undeniable that you've received an enormous amount of attention and publicity from this. Again your critics are going to say, that's what this was all about. You just wanted the attention and the publicity.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's wrong. I mean, it's wrong. It's totally wrong. Most people that are into this thing and really into it and know me know that I'm totally serious about it. I have enjoyed it. I have had a lot of fun. It's been a lot of fun.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Let me give you a hypothetical situation, Jesse Ventura thinks about things for a few more days and says, `You know what, as part of this new Independence Party, I can make a valid run for the presidency,' and -- and that party says maybe they can get him on all 50 ballots. And he comes to you and says, `Donald, why don't you be my vice presidential candidate?'
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah. I'd have no interest. I don't think that's going to happen. Jesse's not going to run. I know Jesse very well. He called me a long time ago and told me exactly what he was going to be doing on Friday. And as, you know, on Friday he announced he's leaving the Reform Party. And frankly, he -- he almost called asking for permission, because he didn't want to leave me out there and I thought it was very, very nice. He said...
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> He said, `In other words, if you don't want me to leave this party...'
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He indicated that, or at least that he'd stay -- he'd stay for awhile. I think eventually he was going, and I think he should have gone out, because the Party is a mess. I mean, the Reform Party is a mess. You have a right winger and you have Fulani, a communist, and they've merged. And I don't know what you have -- I don't know what you -- you get out of this merger, but this Party is a mess.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> So you are now going to sever all ties with the Reform Party?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am very, very intrigued by what's happened in New York with the Independence Party. Jesse is calling his, as you know, the Independence Party. And there is some interesting things taking place. But I am looking at my options. The Republicans want me back. The Democrats want me, which is sort of more surprising.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> You're scaring me, though. You're saying, I'm looking at my options.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> OK, but let me just make sure we're on the same page here. Those options in your opinion do not include a run for the presidency or the vice presidency?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right, this year. It may include something in the future. But at this point the answer is no.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Here we go with this flirtation again. No?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. Well, I'm just -- I'm just saying that in -- in a number of years I might consider it.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> So it's a definite maybe in the future.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think this, and I've looked at it very seriously, the Reform Party is a mess, but I think the Reform Party can only really gel if times are bad. I've never done so well, most people have never done so well. You've never done so well. Times are good. In good times you don't get Reform parties to do very well.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Do you have any desire to have an impact on this year's election?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think the biggest impact I'll have is that in particular one of the candidates really wants my endorsement. And...
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Which candidate?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I -- I'd rather not say right now. But one of the candidates, one of the three, because I don't consider Bradley to be much of a candidate anymore, one of the three remaining candidates.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Republican or a Democrat?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can't tell you. But very much wants my endorsement. And I'm thinking about it, to be honest with you. And if I did do that endorsement I would go back into the mainstream party.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Scale of one to 10, 10 being very possible, one being almost impossible, 2004, a ticket of Jesse Ventura for president, Donald Trump for vice president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think -- I think that's highly unlikely. But I'd like to see him do it. And it's possible that maybe separately I'd do it again. And, you know, I've had a lot of fun doing it. I've learned a lot. It's been an amazing experience.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> What have you learned? What's the big lesson?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've learned the life of a politician. You know the other night, I was sitting at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, watching television, and I was watching Gore on a freezing evening knocking on a door, saying, "Hi, I'm the vice president, I'd love your vote." He's freezing. And I'm watching McCain, and I'm watching Bush, and they were all working so hard. And I said, "You know, it's not such an easy life they have," as I'm sitting, you know, in 75-degree weather.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Can you ever see yourself working that hard?
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> The Art of the Comeback. Donald Trump, you wrote the book. What's the secret?
<Al Roker> <Positive> And first, though, before we get to anything else, we want to say hello to Mr. Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a different kind of work. I work up here. It's a different kind of work. But it's -- it's a real possibility.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> We're back to the flirtation here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I always flirt.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Are you or aren't you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I know one thing, if I do, I'll be back on your program.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Thanks very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Have a good time.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Good luck.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well…
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> You got to where I wanted you to go.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't imagine why you're asking me that question.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Give some advice. Now you have -- you have built this empire in New York. We're in this fabulous building here on 5th Avenue, it's all like -- it's a gold palace here. It's -- it's the Pleasure Dome. It's fabulous. You had -- you've got this fabulous empire in Atlantic City, you've come back from -- from nowhere back in the early part of this decade. What did you do right that you weren't doing right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I really focused. You know Chris, I had years of just tremendous success and then all of a sudden I took my eye off the ball a little bit and we also happened to have a thing called a depression 'cause that wasn't a recession, that was a depression in the early '90s.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I had some great institutions, and I had some really good banks and it just all worked out. And now my company is, as you know, much, much bigger and stronger than it was in the '80s. So I'm very happy about it. And it is, I guess, a little bit of a comeback. The book became a great -- you know, very good best-seller...
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ...and it's been really -- I've been having a lot of fun.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Let's talk about another 52-year-old, Bill Clinton. What's he need to do?
<Ann Curry> <Positive> Yes, we do.
<Al Roker> <Neutral> A brand-new season of "Apprentice" is under way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hello, how are you?
<Al Roker> <Positive> Good to see you, sir.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Donald, good to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hello. Matt, Meredith.
<Al Roker> <Neutral> So are these--are these competitors living up to your expectations?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they're very tough, but Alex had a very tough time last night. He was--maybe shouldn't have been there. I mean, he was eaten alive by--we have some very tough people on the show.
<Meredith Viera> <Positive> Yeah, but he ends up getting his dream job after he's out.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Tonight Donald Trump .
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't know. It's so embarrassing and you really have to say, 'Where does it stop?' I -- I really like this guy, but you really have to say -- you know, 'Where does it stop?' Why do they keep revealing the details. He had sex, but now they talk about the kind of sex, the -- where it took place, where it was, on the desk, off the desk -- I mean, it's -- it's so out-of-control. I've never seen anything like it.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> I didn't hear those parts. But do you think he should have just come...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You can imagine.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Do you think he could have gotten away with a complete mea culpa in the -- January, when he decided to cover it up? Do you think at that moment he could have said, 'I'm gonna throw all my money on the table. The American people like me, they're gonna buy this'?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think, he probably couldn't do any worse. I don't think he could do worse. I think his lawyers, and in particular -- the lawyer wh -- I won't even mention names, but representing him with respect to Paula Jones, I thought did a terrible job.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He should have never been there.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Bill Bennett's brother.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He should have never gotten in there. I mean what -- what Bennett did in that case was -- I -- I think he just did a terrible job.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> You would have -- you would have settled? Put it behind ya.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's going to do very well.
<Meredith Vieira> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's going to say, 'Thank you very much, Donald,' I hope. I hope.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> So the challenge that I saw, they're selling ice cream.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> That's a very basic, simple challenge.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Much simpler than some of the ones I've seen in the past. Is it kind of a back-to-basics thing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It is back to basics. And NBC really likes that. And we'll go with Proctor & Gamble and General Electric and lots of different--but also we want to sell lemonade and we want to sell ice cream on occasion. You know, right back to the basics.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> America is doing so poorly. And it soon will not be a great country the way it's going. The leadership is very poor. We're doing very poorly.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Donald Trump , how he would solve the country's debt crisis and what he would do to keep America great. And remember that uproar over President Obama's birth certificate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Honestly I'm very proud that I was able to bring this to a point. Nobody else was.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Tavis Smiley says that was race baiting. I'll ask him why he said the 2012 race for the White House will be nastiest in history. And why he says the White House itself pays too much attention to Wall Street. Tonight race in the age of Obama.
<Barack Obama> <Positive> If you're looking for the safe choice, you shouldn't be supporting a black guy named Barack Obama. [Laughter]
<Barack Obama> <Positive> To be the next leader of the free world.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Candid conversation with Tavis Smiley. This is Piers Morgan Tonight. Donald Trump says that America's economy could be going from bad to worse. And he joins me now on the phone with his prescription for recovery. Donald, how are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hello, Piers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I would have done -- I would have done something, certainly, different than what they did -- I mean, that all started it. Paula Jones is a loser, but the fact is that she may be responsible for bringing down a president indirectly. And, you know, that statement was a bad statement to have made -- been made. And it's proven to be false, so...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Which statement was that, I'm sorry.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This -- Paula Jones -- in the deposition...
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ...which really started this whole thing.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> When he denied it -- which is if you're in a hole, stop digging.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think -- I think...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Is there a certain point when you just -- just sort of walk away from the deal and say, 'I'm not dealing here anymore. I'm gonna drop this line.'
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think his little speech afterward was a disaster. It wasn't the right tone and I'm not sure he should have done it. And I'm not even sure that he shouldn't have just gone in and taken the Fifth Amendment and said, 'Look, I don't get along with this man Starr. He's after me. He's a Republican.'
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Ann Curry> <Positive> But given the backgrounds of your contestants, is there a feeling that the stakes are higher this time?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think so, because a lot of these people are virtually down and out...
<Ann Curry> <Positive> Hm.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...and, I mean, it's really a tough thing for them. They've had great jobs and now they have no jobs. You see a couple of them, four or five children. No income whatsoever. One went to a great law school and right now is selling cupcakes.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Yeah.
<Meredith Vieira> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Beautiful girl, great education, number one in her class, and she's selling cupcakes.
<Ann Curry> <Neutral> Mm.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Yeah.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> First of all, congratulations on becoming a grandfather again. Your lovely daughter Ivanka had a beautiful baby girl Arabella Rose, I understand.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That is true. And I'm very happy about that. We all are.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Now tell me, if we were trying to prescribe an economic future for young Arabella that you would feel comfortable about, what would you do right now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, first you have to get the debt down. The debt limits have to come down. The whole world of debt has to be changed as far as this country is concerned.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to create jobs and we have to create them rapidly because if we don't things are just going to head in a direction that's going to be almost impossible to recover from. So we really need jobs now. We have to take jobs away from other countries because other countries are taking our jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There is practically not a country that does business with the United States that isn't making -- let's call it a very big profit. I mean China is going to make $300 billion on us at least this year. And they just revised that recently, I don't know if you saw. But they just said those numbers are going to be low. So we have to take our country back.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> And what do you think of this Gang of Six plan? Do you think it's workable from what you've seen?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, from what I've seen, nobody really knows exactly what it represents and what it is yet. But at least they're in there pitching and at least they're trying to make the big deal. The big deal is really the deal they should make. I don't like the punt. I don't like the deal where we kick it down the road for six months. This is the time to make the deal. And I have to tell you, the Republicans have the cards. People might not think that, but the Republicans have all of the cards. And this is the time to get rid of Obamacare. This is the time to make the great deal.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> I've been following you on Twitter and you've been pretty aggressive about Obama on the economy. You believe that he can't stop spending and that America has to stop spending. One of his beliefs, of course, is that he's got to get rid of these tax incentives for the rich. And look after the guys with no money. Why would you oppose that as an ideology?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> 'He's this, he's that,' and, you know, just taken the Fifth Amendment. It's a terrible thing for a president to take the Fifth Amendment, but he probably should have done it. I don't think he could have done any worse than what's happened. It's such an embarrassment to him -- I mean, I see him walking around, it's like a terrible embarrassment.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> And you think when you see him tur -- doing this -- what do you -- what comes to your head as a businessman about the m -- about the miscalculation he made?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it -- it's just that there are so many miscalculations. And he's had such bad advice. It's just been so badly handled. And it's pretty scary. You know, he's really been a Teflon guy. They compared him with Reagan with the Teflon.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he has been a Teflon guy. That Teflon has exploded all over the place.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Let's talk about friends and enemies. You've written about it in your book Art -- Art of the Comeback
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, people are staying away from him in -- in droves. And I watched James Carville, who's still with him -- but I watched George Stephanopoulos, who's now making a lot of money and doing very well thanks to Clinton. And, boy, he is just bombing him. I mean, it's incredible. You know, you think there'd be some semblance of loyalty to the guy. He's down and -- I mean, the way these guys are after him, it's terrible. But I watched George the other day...
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it's reflective of what's happening in the economy, which is not good.
<Meredith Vieira> <Negative> Unbelievable. Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In case you haven't noticed, right?
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Exactly right. Well, want to remind people they can watch all new episodes of the "The Apprentice." That's Thursday nights at 10, 9 Central time right here, where, on NBC.
<Al Roker> <Neutral> NBC.
<Al Roker> <Neutral> NBC.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Donald, good to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you very much.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, it's a different world today, Piers, where people in this world can form companies in foreign countries where they pay very little tax, much less tax. And once you start taxing -- and I'm not talking about me. But once you start taxing people that do create jobs and do create businesses, you take the incentive away and then you're really going to have an unemployment problem. So he's treading on very dangerous waters.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Tell me this, Donald. I had Grover Norquist on here the other day, and I've put to him a question which he found quite hard to answer. And in the end gave me what I thought was a ridiculous response.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said to him, given where we are right now in America economically, how much of the blame should be attached to Barack Obama and how much should be attached to the previous eight years of Republican administration? If you were choosing a percentage, apportioning blame to each party there, what would you say? Well, look. You know as well as anybody and you know me probably better than most because of our wonderful relationship with Celebrity Apprentice where you won and did great. And I'm proud of you and I'm proud of how well you're doing.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you understand I was never a big fan of George Bush, OK? So it wasn't like, oh gee, I'm a rah-rah guy for Bush. But Obama took over a situation and has made it not better but probably worse. I think the economy is getting worse.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I see things getting worse. Employment has gone up, not down. So Bush certainly wasn't the greatest, and Obama has not done the job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he's created a lot of disincentive. He's created a lot of great dissatisfaction. Regulations and regulatory is going through the roof. It's almost impossible to get anything done in the country. Environmentally speaking, I want to tell you, I see jobs that are stopped all the time because of absolutely insane and ridiculous environmental rules. And these are jobs that could be employing a lot of people. So nothing's been made better, it's only been made worse. So in terms of percentages, you know, I would just -- not really like to say that. I would say I wasn't a fan of the first and I'm certainly not a fan of the second. Because the second has made things worse, not better.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> And in terms of America PLC, that the business model, if you like, America Incorporated, as it is here, if you were analyzing the old model and the way it ought to go, what are the fundamental changes? Because it seems to me -- you're right about bureaucracy. China doesn't bog itself down with bureaucracy. It just gets stuff done and that is why they're roaring ahead. That's one of the things. Secondly, America doesn't really build anything anymore. It doesn't make anything. It doesn't export enough stuff abroad to these countries.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ...on one of your competitors...
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> On -- on -- on -- yeah, on -- on a Sunday show.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ...and I -- I will tell you, he was just bombing him. So it's...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Yeah, he said he lied to him about the draft and he's lied ab -- to everybody about the woman. It's the same deal. That's the way George puts it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, George wouldn't be there if it wasn't for Clinton. So you have to sort of remember that, too, I think. You know, it's called loyalty and -- I think.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Let's talk about enemies. You wrote -- you -- you, basically, have a sort of an Old Testament view of this thing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do. I do.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Tell us about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Go after your enemies -- I mean, they're after you. Go after your enemies. I think that Clinton probably is too nice a guy in a certain respect. I think that's one of the things that happened. I really believe he is a nice guy.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> That he wants to be liked too much?
<Meredith Vieira> <Positive> Thank you.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Which have now all this money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> But what other things have you identified? I mean what should America be doing to revise this business plan? To get itself going again?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you're really right about that. The system and the model is broken. It didn't used to be broken years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Everybody went out and they worked. And they -- you look at 50 percent of the people aren't paying taxes. And it's an amazing statistics.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But tremendous number of people aren't paying any taxes. And we have a lot of people that just don't want to work. They don't have the incentive to work, or they haven't been brought up to work. And it's a big problem for this country. In China, everybody is running around working like mad. And I give them great credit for that. But I also give them credit for being much smarter than our leaders. And they've taken our jobs away. They manufacture our products. As do other countries.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the first thing that has to be done is we have to get back on track with respect to OPEC which is a tremendous abuser of this country. And we don't even talk about it. And with respect to China and others who abuse our country because their leaders have made much better deals than our leaders.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because our leaders are either not as smart or there's some other reason. But it's conceivable some of the deals they make. You look at Columbia, a country not that large, they had a $4 billion surplus on us this year.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They made $4 billion. We never make a deal. We never make a deal where we come out on top. So we've lost our jobs, we've lost our incentive. And I will tell you that -- and Piers, I've discussed this with you before. Getting things done in this country, if you want to build something, if you want to start a company, it's getting to be virtually impossible with all of the bureaucracy and all of the approvals.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Maybe. But I don't think he's going after people the way he should and I really believe hi -- his -- his thing is to be liked and that's not really a good position to be in right now for him.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> What would you do if you were he to try to spr -- bring the Democrats in Congress behind ya -- you know, he's got to win his fight on the Hill. That's where they're gonna try him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It -- it's a...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> How does he make sure that guys like Tom Daschle, the head of the Democratic Party in the Senate, or -- or Dick Gephardt play ball with him? How does he work 'em?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a very tough fight right now -- I mean, he's in such a -- an embarrassing, compromising position. I guess all he can do is -- is go in there and just beg for help.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's terrible that he put himself in this position -- I mean, there's a really major force going on that he should just really himself resign because it's an embarrassment. The whole thing's an embarrassment. I don't see him doing that, but I'll tell you what, I wouldn't want to be in his position 'cause he's fighting from such an embarrassing platform.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> So you don't really have a key to this problem, this puzzle, this...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would have had a key a year ago.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Do you think -- do you think --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's horrible.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Yes, I do think America is just so wrapped down in red tape. I mean getting all the basic things done involves sheets of paperwork. I mean I'm quite surprised having come here to live now just how the most basic stuff you want done in your life requires 100 pages of documents. This is one of the reasons why countries like China are storming ahead because they simply don't have that kind of bureaucracy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, it's interesting in China, because I've been to China and I've been all over the world, and they want to build a city and they fill in a piece of the ocean. And in this -- and you know how long it takes them? Like how about two days? They say let's fill this in, we're going to build a city and create thousands of jobs. If you ever even suggested it in this country, they'd say you're certifiably insane because you can't do it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've seen recently where a certain type of grass -- grass, I won't go into the level of detail that I should, but a certain type, a little piece of grass has held up a major job from being built. Major. Supplying jobs to everybody and everybody wants it to happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But because it's got a little piece of grass, a certain type of rather rare grass, the environmentalists hold up the job. And now this job will never --
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> It is ridiculous.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, no -- [Crosstalk] And yet China will fill up the ocean. And I say to a friend of mine --
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Yes. I've seen that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- in China how long did it take you to get your permits? He doesn't even know what I'm talking about, it went so fast. So this country is in serious trouble. And we have to get back on track.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean -- but it's so deep. And it gets deeper and deeper and deeper, and what can he say? Then he goes and admits everything and then they say -- then -- then they come out and say that he didn't admit enough. I mean -- at some point, it has to stop. And even Starr -- Starr has taken something from nothing and brought it into this big crescendo. But you know what? It's got to stop. It's enough.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Did you ever have a flicker when you're taking a shower, or walking to work, or waking up in the morning where you said, 'Donald Trump, you've won every battle you've ever fought. Why don't you run for governor? Why don't you run for president?' Did you ever think about that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> People want me to all the time.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> What about you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't like it.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Can you imagine how controversial I'd be? You think about him with the women. How about me with the women? Can you imagine?
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Well, you might be close to him, but it'd be no cigar.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. They might like my women better, too, you know?
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> OK. We'll be back with more Hardball and Donald Trump in just a moment. [Announcements] Donald Trump, a lot of people give credit -- in fact, just about everybody, to President Clinton for the shape of the economy right now. Who do you assign the credit to right now, for the economy?
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> It is in serious -- yes, it is in serious trouble. And what I want to talk to you about now is who you would trust. Given you're no longer in the presidential race. Which of the Republican candidates so far and, you know, Michele Bachmann, I guess, is emerging as one of the favorites from the Tea Party side of things. Mitt Romney appears to be the best at fund raising at the moment and so on. Which one have you identified as potentially the one that could beat Barack Obama?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's too early for me to say. I -- everybody is asking me for support and all of that. It's just too early for me to say.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I will say this, that I think the Republicans are so misplaying their hand. They have the cards. And it started back in December when you had the lame-duck session.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Obama rose like a phoenix. He was gone. It was over for Obama. And they brought him back with the deal they made which was a horrible deal. Paul Ryan's plan where he attacks Medicare is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen especially if you happen to be running for reelection because you're going to see the only one happy is Nancy Pelosi and her group because you're going to see some tremendous reversals. I've seen it already with Congressman West where he's being beaten up now by -- you know by the Democrats over Medicare.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> And what do you -- what do you think of Michele Bachmann?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think she's a very underrated person. She actually came to see me in New York a few weeks ago, and I was very impressed with her. And I think she's highly underrated. I think she's very good.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> And Sarah Palin obviously has not committed yet. She's another good friend of yours.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, and I think she's terrific. I think she's a terrific person. She came to see me a little while before. You know we have the famous --
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> They're all coming to see you, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. They're all coming to see me but Sarah Palin has also been -- you know, they're highly underrated people. They're smart. They know what they're doing. They know every move. And they don't get proper credit. So I don't know that Sarah is going to run. I don't think she's going to run. I'm not sure she knows whether or not she's going to run, but I think she's a terrific person. I think Michele is a terrific person.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I -- I think his -- the best thing he has going is the fact that the economy is doing great. I've never seen anything like it -- you know, they talked about the '80s were good. The '90s are better.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the '90s are really much better. I think Bob Rubin's done a great job and you give credit to that -- to Clinton because he chose Bob Rubin. But Bob Rubin has really been outstanding.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And certainly Greenspan. Alan has done a -- a fantastic job. The economy has -- has, I don't think, ever been better. I mean, we've had a little glitch over the last couple of months, but it's very minor, relatively speaking. It's just very strong. Where I am in Manhattan it's like there's never been a period of time like this.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Did you see that comment from Clinton when he first came in and any steps he took that you thought were smart?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I thought that -- I thought that Clinton -- what he's done in terms of the economy...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...that's been so good has been the people he's chosen. And I think primarily that would be the extension of Greenspan and Bob Rubin.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think they've done a great job.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Let's talk about this country. A lot of people watch you and see you as the great American success story, especially right now when you're back on top, and they think, 'Well, I guess it still works, this country.' Let's -- let's talk about that in a kind of American way. What -- what is it -- what it takes to make it in America? Now you said something very interesting about Jimmy Carter once when you met him after he was president, and I've always been taken with what -- take some time and explain how you figured out this guy, Jimmy Carter.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> And talking of people who are coming to see me, in this case me, I've got an old friend of yours, Tavis Smiley, coming in in a moment for an interview, who said during the birther controversy that your involvement in any election would make it the ugliest, nastiest, most divisive and most racist in the history of this republic.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's just -- [Crosstalk]
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Anything you'd like to say to Tavis?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The word racist has not been applied to me, I will tell you that. But I was very proud of the job I did with respect to the birther issue, because I got Obama to do something which nobody else was able to get him to do. And there's a real question as to why he took so long to do it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Maybe one of these days you'll have to ask him why. And you have to check out that document very carefully. But I got him to do something that nobody else was able to do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm very proud of it. But I have to tell you, the Republicans have a chance, but the way they're going about it, they are not going to get him out of office. They are making mistake after mistake. And I can see them already making another mistake when it comes to what they're discussing right now in terms of debt limits.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Donald Trump , a provocative and entertaining as ever. Thank you very much for joining me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Piers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it was sort of interesting because I got a call from him and I never spoke to him and he said he was building the Carter Library and they'd like me to donate millions of dollars -- I don't know the exact number, but millions of dollars to this library. And I said that's an amazing thing -- I mean, I wasn't on his side. I wasn't a huge fan, although I think he's a very nice man, and I think in a certain way he's done better after he became president -- you know, after he got out.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right. Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the fact that he had the moxie or the nerve to ask for millions of dollars was the same moxie that he had when he ran for president in the first place. And he won because they wanted the opposite of what was there before. And they certainly got it.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Mm-hmm. Well, did it work?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> When he asked you for the loot?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. No. It didn't work for him.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> You didn't give him any money?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It worked for me 'cause I didn't give him any money. But I'm sure the library's...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> So you learned his secret, but you didn't give him any money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm sure the library's a very nice place.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> OK. Let's talk about America and gambling because -- talk about regular gambling with -- with chips and big picture gambling. It's seems like you've made a real commitment to America's sort of notion of the American Dream being connected with gambling -- I mean, people go to Atlantic City. You put all your money in Atlantic City. What is it about Americans and the American Dream and gambling?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think gambling is just something that's happening right now, but it's not happening that easily. A lot of people are rejecting it, a lot of states are rejecting it, as you see. It was gonna happen in Florida and it's dead. It was gonna happen in New York and it died. It's a tough thing to get off. Atlantic...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> You gotta -- you have to be an -- a N -- Native American to make it in in Florida now as a gambler, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's certainly happening with them -- I mean, there's no question. It's...
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right. Are you -- are you in with those guys at all?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a lot of great relationships with the Indians.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And -- and I am friendly with a lot of 'em. But -- you know, my big stake is in Atlantic City and we've been doing very well.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Why did you make that gut decision to put everything -- basically, these huge stakes into a little town, Atlantic City, that was once this super resort but wasn't anymore. How did you know -- what did you know that nobody else knew about that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I just understand the economics and I understand business, and it's worked out very well. And my casinos -- I mean, I'm number one in Atlantic City by far. And we have some good, strong competitors there, but I'm number one by far. And, you know, it's worked out really -- pretty well.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> And Atlantic City's bigger than Vegas now, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Atlantic City does more business than the entire Las Vegas Strip, and nobody knows that. And it takes -- and, actually, more people come to Atlantic City than Las Vegas. But Atlantic City does more business than the entire Las Vegas Strip, which is amazing.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Let's talk about the average gambler going in there. Whenever I've gambled -- I don't gamble that much. I may say 30 bucks in the old days, I might say a little more now. But I make a decision I'm not gonna lose any more than that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> And -- and I go in with the cash, I buy the chips, and that's me for the night, and I usually end up where I intended to end up, right where I expected to put the limit. Should people be putting limits on how much they want to win and then they can walk out with some money? If they said, 'I only want 100 bucks. I'll walk out of here with $ 100.' Would that hurt the business, if people did that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think they should maybe put limits on how much they want to lose because if they go in, they can win. And we have people that beat us constantly. They're great gamblers. You know, there is such a thing as a great gambler. People don't realize that.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> What's that? What's it take?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, I have high rollers that are just great gamblers. They really understand it, they understand how to win, they understand how to make money. And they go in and they beat us consistently. It's amazing.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> And they get the same roll of the dice as everybody else.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They do.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> They get the same cards as everybody else.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They just -- they got it.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> What do they do? They bet differently.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They've got a sense. They've got an absolute sense. There are people that know how to beat the house and do beat the house. And there are a lot of 'em.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> And you wouldn't set a limit on how much you wanted to win, if you were an average guy going in there with...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> ...with a family nest egg.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I -- I think some people do, but I think it's basically how much you want to lose because you get -- you really have to protect the down side. Protecting the down side is a lot more important.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> There's one smart marketing thing you do. I -- I drove in Atlantic City the other day in -- in the morning. And you drive in from the Atlantic City Expressway. And you go into this big tunnel -- like you almost can't avoid it -- into this big tunnel. It's called The Trump. What's it called?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's called the Lincoln Tunnel, I think.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> No, no.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> As you're driving into Atlantic City as you're driving out of New York.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> No, right into the city of Atlantic City -- into the resort, you walk -- you drive right into your resort, the Trump Building.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you drive right into the...
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> And it's a big parking lot.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, yeah. Trump Plaza.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right. Trump Plaza.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right in the beginning. Right.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right at the Trump Plaza it's like -- it's like we're on -- our car's become a giant quarter in the slot machine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Like you just suck us right in.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Is that a marketing technique?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's actually not a tunnel, it's a big parking garage...
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right. Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...that sort of has the look of a tunnel because people just sort of go in and park.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> And they don't come out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it's become a very successful parking lot.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Was that a thing you figured out? We gotta get them to just drive right into this thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I had a great location, in any case.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Trump Plaza's been a great location. It's done unbelievable business from the day I built it. It's been a real success.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think when I built that big parking lot, it turned out to be very successful.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Does -- does Bill Clinton have this thing -- this sort of in -- in -- ineffable quality you describe as luck. I know you've got it. Does he have it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think -- I think he had it until recently. I think he lost his luck. And you can lose your luck and there's no doubt about it. But I think he was a very lucky guy. He had everything going, and I think he really lost it. And I don't know that he can recover. You know, over years and years, you can recover, but he's got a year and a half, two years left. I'm not sure that he can actually recover in terms of respectability. He's a great -- I mean, I really like this guy, but I think he has just been so badly damaged. These -- these new things going on...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Place your bet. Where's he going, up or down?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think he ha -- I think the best he can do is tread water for two years. I really believe that. I think he can tread, I think he can maybe keep the office and just tread and get out as opposed to Nixon, who got out in a rather harsh manner. But it may be worse than that. But I really believe the best he can do is tread water.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> OK. Let's talk about something more delightful up here in New York. We're in New York City, we're in Manhattan. The Trump Tower right on 5th Avenue here at 56th, right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> 56th and 5th.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> 56th Street. Let's talk about Yankee -- the Yankees. They're going pretty good this year. The owner, George Steinbrenner, says he wants to see three million at the gate or whatever then he'll stay in the Bronx. Is this important? I mean, we've got this big fight for the -- for the Roger Maris record now, 37 years. You've got Sosa and McGwire, a lot of excitement about baseball. Should the Yankees stay in the Bronx?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I know George and I -- I love George. He's a good friend of mine. And he's a great guy and he's done a great job -- you know, he does -- he's one of the people that does not get credit 'cause you look at every year he's got a good team. And this year he's got maybe the best team ever. I don't know -- I mean, in terms of winning. I think the Yankees would like to, frankly, be right in Manhattan, right along the Hudson River, right behind Madison Square Garden at 34th Street. And who can blame 'em? It's a great piece of property, a great site. I don't know if it can be done politically, but I think that's where they'd like to be. Will they stay at Yankee Stadium? They might.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> What do you think they should do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, if I were George, I'd like to be at 34th in Manhattan.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> With the chichi.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd like to be...
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> With the nice people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, if I had the choice...
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> But isn't that abandoning some of the worst part and some of the toughest part of the city here?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> When you walk away from the Bronx...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think so.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> ...The Bonfire of the Vanities
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. No, I don't think so. I think that -- I think that George has done a really good job. I think he's -- I think he's been very good for the area, very sensitive to the area and -- you know, if they don't straighten out the area, I think he's gonna have to do something. And, frankly, he may very well end up staying. You know, maybe they'll do some big economic development project out there and he'll stay. There is something very beautiful about Yankee Stadium. That's one thing, you're never gonna produce another Yankee Stadium, the history and the legend...
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...and everything else.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> The Bronx Bombers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it -- it would be nice if he'd stay there, but it's a tough call for him.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Last question. We've got a lot of people retired watching this show, a lot of people who are going to be retired and they're worried about their money. Give them some advice.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the stock market is very scary. I think put it in some good, strong interest-bearing accounts right now. I'm very concerned about the stock market.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> OK. Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Had a good time.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> It's an honor.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Thank you very much. We'll be back with more Hardball on CNBC.
<Griff Jenkins> <Neutral> First let's talk about the weather, hurricane, tropical storm Isaac. What political impact do you think that will have on this convention?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't think it's going to have an impact. It does miss one day. I was a big part of Monday. I just got here and find out Monday was canceled. But I don't think it's going to have a huge impact. I think the message is going to get out. The message is going to be a message of jobs. It's about jobs. Mitt Romney is and was a very, very successful person.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He knows business. He knows jobs. He knows how to put people to work. You look at our unemployment, it's not 8.3 percent. It's probably 20 percent or 21 percent, the real number. And 8.3 percent is fiction, minimum 15 percent or 16 percent. Mitt Romney will put people back to work.
<Griff Jenkins> <Neutral> What's the takeaway Romney needs to leave here to the 30 million-plus maybe taking a first look at Romney?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think we have to be not be so politically correct. We're a country in tremendous trouble. We have to say it like it is. We don't have to be nice to President Obama. We don't have to say he's a wonderful person, because he's probably not a wonderful person. And, frankly, they cannot be politically correct.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They have to say it like it is. This country is in trouble. Our president has done a poor job. We have to put this country back to work. We have to stop other countries from destroying us, whether it's China, OPEC nations, or any other -- virtually any other country we deal with. You look at the country of Colombia, relatively small trading partner.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They use the word "partner." It's not a partner. We have a $4 billion deficit with Colombia. That's a small one. China's going to be probably close to $400 billion in deficits. We can't do it. We can't afford it. Then we go, how do we pay for the deficits? We borrow money from China. So Mitt Romney gets it. He's a great businessman.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He'll change things. He's also got heart. He's a wonderful person. His wife is a fantastic person. I think it's going to be an amazing combination.
<Griff Jenkins> <Neutral> You're talking about a shifting of the strategy, the Romney campaign. You mentioned he needs to tell it like it is. Is he being too soft? Does he need to have more Donald Trump approach to things?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's a good person, a tough person when he has to be. I think he'll show that toughness. I think he has to show the toughness. He's a very smart guy. I just say that you have to say it like it is. The old expression from the great Howard Cosell, tell it like it is. The country is doing terribly. We're in deep, deep trouble.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Four more years of Obama, we're not going to make it. And I'm not sure you can come back if it continues. Obamacare is a disaster. It's going to destroy -- it's going to add to -- we'll be up to $17 trillion in deficits very soon, $17 trillion. You never even heard -- the word "trillion." It wasn't in the vocabulary.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now it's commonplace. So at $17 trillion, employment at 15 percent, 16 percent, 21 percent, any way you want to cut it. You look at inner city unemployment, and that is a number that's probably 40 percent to 50 percent. The country cannot continue to go on like this. So I think Mitt is going to get the message across.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> When he gets it across, people are going to just love the message.
<Griff Jenkins> <Neutral> In Paul Ryan's message, he's been very good at delivering the topic of Medicare, but he's selling Romney's vision of it, not the original Paul Ryan. Are they succeeding on Medicare in your opinion?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think he is. He's saying he's going to save Medicare, because if you keep going the Obama route, Medicare is not going to exist any longer. And if you look at what Obamacare has done to Medicare, they've stolen $716 billion from Medicare. So they're destroying Medicare. I think Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney will save Medicare. [End Video Clip]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know they will. And people are starting to understand it. They're going to be very happy with what's going on, but they're going to be very, very unhappy if Obama gets in. I think actually if Obama gets in, and if Obamacare isn't ended, I really think Medicare will be a thing of the past.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning, Chuck.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> So in June right before you announced, you were at one percent. In July after you've announced, in the last six weeks, you're in first place with 19 percent. Why do you think you're resonating so quickly in the Republican field?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think a lot of people did not believe I was going to be running, Chuck.  And they thought it was-- you know, they didn't want to waste poll, though, so to speak, and they really felt that I wouldn't run.  I mean, I have a-- a wonderful life.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a wonderful-- I built a tremendous company.  And, you know, a lot of good things going on.  And they said, why would he give that up to go into this fray? And once I announced, as you probably know better than anybody, my poll numbers started to shoot up like a rocket ship and they continue to go up.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And a couple of polls came out recently where I'm number one with Hispanics, as an example in Nevada.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And North Carolina was very strong. Nevada was very strong overall, too. It was number one place in both cases. I mean, it's been-- it's been terrific.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Now there is a-- look, there's-- with the good, there is bad. You also have the highest unfavorable rating of any of the candidates we tested. And a majority of folks we asked say you're doing more to hurt the Republican Party than help. Why do you believe there is this sort of polarizing view of you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't think they understand my message or maybe they haven't heard my message yet. But I noticed that in certain states like North Carolina, we have a very strong favorability rating and others-- and other places, including New Hampshire, including Iowa, there's a very strong favorability rating. And I noticed that as I get to areas-- I've been in Iowa a lot, I've been in New Hampshire a lot, I've been in South Carolina a lot. And where I go and where I speak, they really change those numbers very quickly.
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Let's talk about the debate.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> And let me ask you this way. I know one of the things you did that surprised me is, you downplayed your expectations. Mister Trump, with all due respect, you never downplay your ability on anything. Why did you downplay your expectations on debating?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm not a debater.  I don't-- I've never debated before.  I've never been on a stage debating.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I guess my whole life has been a debate in one way.  But I've never been on a formal stage debating.  So I really don't know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I understand you have nine other people that are going to be shooting at me, and that may be true or maybe not.  But I-- I really don't know.  I-- I don't have pollsters, I don't want to waste money on pollsters.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because, you know, they-- I don't want to be unreal.  I want to be me.  I have to be me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know? We have enough of that in Washington with pollsters telling everybody what to say and everybody being controlled by the special interests, and-- and the lobbyists, et cetera, et cetera.  And the donors.  I see the donors all over the place.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know them.  And I know they don't give because they happen to be nice people.  So I think that really-- you know, who knows? I-- I certainly-- I think I know most of the subjects very well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've been through it. A lot of people have been asking me a lot of questions for three or four months. And-- and we'll what happens. But again, I don't think you can artificially prepare for something like this.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> You've been compared to a rattlesnake by Marco Rubio's campaign, a drunk NASCAR driver, I think by the Kasich campaign. Let me ask you this, how would you advise a candidate to debate you on stage?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I'm a nice person.  I-- I really do.  And I think that's why my numbers always go up as they get to know me better.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that, frankly, I'd like to discuss the issues.  I'm not looking to take anybody out or be nasty to anybody.  And as you know, Chuck, you know, when I made-- you know, harsh statements about various people, that was always in response to their criticism of me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, Rick Perry, I always thought he was a nice guy, but he started hitting me hard, so I hit him harder. And I'm not, you know, looking-- I don't know what they're going to be doing. I'm reading so many, you know...
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> So if they don't attack you, you're not going to attack them?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think it's highly unlikely. I really do.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> But I want to start with the Republican front-runner, Donald Trump, who joins me now by phone. Mr. Trump, thanks for joining us. Let's start with these new poll numbers. They show you're still in the lead by a wide margin, but you have lost some support, with Carly Fiorina and Rubio going up considerably.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Joining us now on the phone, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> But if they attack you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I-- I've always counterpunched. And you have to--
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...counterpunch. But I'm not looking to start anything, that's for sure. I'd rather discuss the issues. Our country is in serious trouble, and we have a lot of problems in every front. And I'd rather discuss that. But, you know, I-- I read people and I listen to you and others, and a lot of people say or they're getting ready and they've got their little lines given to them by the pollsters. You know, everything's perfectly put down by a pollster, what to say and how to attack me. And, you know, if that comes, it comes, and I have to handle it at the time.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Now, I know-- I'm hoping that you and I are going to sit down face-to-face soon and go in detail on policy issues. But I want to ask you about a-- a story in this morning's Washington Post. And it says, Republican candidate Donald Trump's platform: Because I Said So. And there is some growing criticism that says, when are we going to see the details? When are we going to see your policy proposals? I know your campaign says you have them. There's a tax plan on the shelf ready to roll out. An education plan on the shelf ready to roll out. When is the public going to see this, sir?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's all true and we do have a lot of different policy programs and I think they're going to be-- I don't know, popular.  But they're going to be something that's going to set the country back right.  I mean one of the big things is we have to take back jobs from China, we have to take back jobs from Japan and Vietnam and Mexico and virtually everybody that's taking our jobs and ruining our manufacturing base.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> What do you make of it all?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm a little surprised, because other polls have come out where I actually picked after the debate, I actually gained after the debate. I'm in first place in every poll, but gained substantially in a couple of them. So, I'm a little surprised, but, you know, it's a poll. The only poll that matters is the big one.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know that one. That's going to be the election.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> Of course. I do want to ask you about this exchange you had with a voter on the campaign trail. Let's play it.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> [Begin Video Clip] We have a problem in this country. It's called Muslims. We know our current president is one. You know he's not even an American.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We need this question, this first question. [Crosstalk]
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> But, anyway, we have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That's my question. When can we get rid of them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to be looking at a lot of different things. And, you know, a lot of people are saying that, and a lot of people are saying that bad things are happening out there. We're going to be looking at that and plenty of other things. [End Video Clip]
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> Now, Mr. Trump, forget the notion of defending President Obama for a second. I don't want to really talk about that. You are running to be president of United States of America. That includes millions of peaceful, law-abiding Muslim-American citizens who love this country. This man said -- quote -- "We have a problem in this country.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Donald, I'll ask you the same question that I posed to Jeb Bush: if were president right now, what would be the first, second and third thing you would do in the strategy to defeat ISIS?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, if I were president, we probably wouldn't be in the problems we have right now, because it's incredible. We have an attack, and then all of a sudden we bomb all these sites.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why didn't we bomb the sites before? We should have bombed the sites a long time ago, Mika, these are training camps and training areas largely, and we didn't take them out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why is it that we take them out now after this there's this vicious and violent attack? The other thing I'd be explaining the problem to people, we have a president that doesn't even use the term and won't use the term radical Islamic terrorism. He doesn't want to use the term Hillary Clinton didn't want to use the term the other day in the debate, which was a ridiculous and terrible debate, frankly, a joke.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But she didn't want to use the term; she refused to use -- all three of them refused to use the term radical Islamic terrorism. They just can't say it. They absolutely can't say it. The other thing...
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Why is it important, Donald? Why is it important?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because if you can't define the problem, you're never going to solve the problem, Joe. They refuse to say what the problem is. I mean, you'd almost think they have the terrorists coming out from Sweden. They refuse to say what the problem is. The problem is obvious.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not even obvious, it's 100 percent.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right. So what do you do as far as troops go? How many troops do you send over?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we have to put people to work, Chuck, because the real number is probably 21 percent.  The real unemployment number is probably 21 percent.  People give up looking for jobs, and they no longer become a statistic.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it's very unfair. So we have to put our country back to work. We have to get great jobs for people, and good paying jobs for people. And we're going to be just fine.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> All right. Very quickly, two more questions. One, the news about Joe Biden, thinking about challenging Hillary Clinton, who would you rather face, Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I-- I don't have a choice.  I would say this.  I think with what she is doing and how she's coming out, she has, you know, she's got a terrible record.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's probably the worst Secretary of State in the history of this country.  And she's now, you know, the e-mail thing, I mean-- what they did with Petraeus is they destroyed his life.  What she did is far greater and far worse than Petraeus did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I would think that she at some point, you're going to get a prosecutor who's going to be an honorable prosecutor, and there's going to be major problems for her. So I would think other people would be looking.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> So you don't have much to say about Joe Biden, it sounds like? You were a donor to him-- you've given him money in the past?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I-- I think he's-- I think he's fine. I mean I think he's fine, if he runs, he runs. I mean you have to worry about-- I like to do things nice and systematically. Right now I have-- I guess you could say 16, because somebody else just joined. So I have 16 opponents and I'd like to focus on them and then I'll focus on Hillary. And I actually think Hillary will be easy if it's her. But I'm not so sure it's going to be her.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> It's called Muslims." Now, you're not responsible for what he says, but this is raw, unvarnished, ignorant bigotry. You are a leader. You are the front- runner in the Republican race. Do you not have a responsibility to call out this hatred?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, we could be politically correct, if you want. But, certainly, are you trying to say we don't have a problem? Because I think everybody would agree. I have friends that are Muslims. They're great people, amazing people. And most Muslims, like most everything, I mean, these are fabulous people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we certainly do have a problem. I mean, you have a problem throughout the world.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> What's the problem?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you have radicals that are doing things. I mean, it wasn't people from Sweden that blew up the World Trade Center, Jake.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> I get that. But to say we have a problem, and it is called Muslims, because there are some extremist Muslims, is tarring all Muslims. You would agree that the vast... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't agree with that at all. But you have extremist Muslims that are in a class by themselves. I mean, they are -- it is a problem in this country. And it's a problem throughout the world. I mean, all you have to do is look at Europe.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> But what if he had said, we have a -- what if he had said, we have a problem in this world; it's called blacks? Would you have said something then?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I would have probably just -- I listened to his question. I mean, who I am? I listened to his question. He made a question/probably statement, but I listened to his question, and I actually didn't respond. This was the first time -- because, over the weekend, as you know very well, because you covered it and your -- and CNN covered it very well -- but it was a very, very big subject.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I said, this is the first time I have ever had a situation like this where I didn't even say anything. So, it was a question that was asked in front of a totally packed house. Nobody thought much of it until the following couple of hours, when it came became a pretty big subject. But, no, we do have a problem with radical Muslims.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Here's what I would do. And I've been saying this for a long time, I have been saying it to you. I would have -- and now they're just starting -- if you remember when I said, attack the oil, because that's their primary source of wealth. Attack the oil.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People smiled, and they laughed and they thought it was a joke, and they thought it was funny. Now as of two days ago, they're attacking the oil. I would absolutely -- I would obliterate their source of wealth, and I would also attack the banking system, because they're getting tremendous amounts funds through a very complex network of banking and banking system.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> OK, so -- so, let me stop you right there. First of all, on the oil, I agree with you completely. We have been saying around this set it has made no sense for the past year why we haven't blown up the pipelines. They make...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Joe, have I been -- have I been saying that for a long time?
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> I've been saying that for a long time as well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's one difference. I also said I'd keep the oil.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Yeah, well...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said I'd attack it, but I'd keep it. These people who are going to attack it, they won't keep it. We never keep anything.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So -- so -- so I want to -- Mike Barnicle, I'm going to let you follow up. He's starting to talk about what you've been talking about and we've been reading about this week, that some of our close allies in the Gulf states have people that have been funneling money to Islamic extremists over the past 20 years and we have -- and they have turned a blind to it and we've turned a blind eye to them.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> And-- and again, I know we're going to get into a lot more issues with you in a couple of weeks. But I want to ask you about Black Lives Matter. The latest shooting of a-- a white police officer shooting an unarmed black man. Do you see this as a crisis in America?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a massive crisis. It's a double-crisis. So what's happening-- and-- and people, you know, I-- I look at things and I see it on television and some horrible mistakes are made. At the same time, we have to give power back to the police, because crime is rampant. And I'm a big person that believes in very big-- you know, you-- we need police, and we need protection. Look, I look at some of the cities, you look at Baltimore, you look at so many different place in this country, Chicago, certain areas of Chicago...
<Chuck Todd> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...they need strong police protection. And those police can do the job, but their jobs are being taken away from them. At the same time, you've got these other problems, and there's no question about it, they are problems. There's turmoil in our country.
<Chuck Todd> <Negative> Do you understand why African-Americans don't trust the police right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I can certainly see it when I see what's going on.  But at the same time, we have to give power back to the police, because we have to have law and order.  Hundreds of-- of killings are in Baltimore, hundreds of killings are in Chicago, and New York is not doing so great in terms of that front and so many other cities.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to give strength and power back to the police. And you're always going to have mistakes made and you're always going to have bad apples. But you can't let that stop the fact that police have to regain some control of this tremendous crime wave and killing wave that's happening in this country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There's no question about that. I think you would be the first to admit that.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> I don't think it's the same thing as saying we have a problem with Muslims. But I don't think we're going to get very far. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, I -- look, I can say this. The Muslims -- and, as I have already said, I have tremendous people that I know that are Muslims. They're wonderful people. They're fabulous people. They live in this country, by the way, in most cases, and they're tremendous. But you do have a problem with radical Muslims.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's no question about it.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> All right. I want to move on. Take a listen to this new Web video that is being put out by the Jeb Bush campaign. It's being released this morning. It's about the exchange you two had, you and Governor Bush, during the debate about whether or not you pushed for casino gambling in Florida. I want to play it, and then get your reaction.
<Jeb Bush> <Negative> [Begin Video Clip] The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something, that was generous and gave me money -- was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't.
<Jeb Bush> <Negative> Yes, you did. When he asked Florida to have casino gambling, we said no.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> We could go to war. We've talked about going to war militarily, we've talked about cyber war, but there's a banking war, is there not? Can we not go to war -- financial institutions in -- in our allies countries that continue to allow terrorists to be funded?
<Mike Barnicle> <Neutral> So Donald, following up on that -- Joe's observation, let me ask you the question. What would you do in terms of locating, identifying and potentially freezing the assets of some countries, some governments in the Middle East, but certainly individuals in the Middle East who have a long track record of raising and sending money to terror groups?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know the countries and I know the countries, too and the countries are obvious and they're very rich and they're sending money out to the terrorists and sending money to ISIS. Tremendous amounts of money. It can be tracked and it can be actually fairly easily tracked if we have intelligent people, which we don't have, leading our country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it can be easily tracked and I would do tremendous damage to those countries, some of whom claim to be our friend, but they're not our friend. They're everybody's friend. They're using us and they're using everybody else. They're ripping us left and right. They're using us and they're using everyone else. They're actually more political than anybody else.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're taking care of the terrorists, they're taking care of the United States who gives them protection. They're doing a lot of different things. Tremendous money is pouring into ISIS and other terrorist groups through very wealthy countries that we think are our friends and they're not our friends.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Steve Schmidt?
<Steve Schmidt> <Positive> Mr. Trump, good morning. When we talk about obliterating ISIS, destroying ISIS, are you prepared to tell the American people that we will deploy large numbers of regular Army forces, regular military forces back to the Middle East to accomplish that goal?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm not. I would put some there, but I'm not. We have to -- we have to engage the Kurds, who of all of the folks that are out there fighting, the Kurds seem to be the ones that are fighting. And by the way, Steve, thank you for saying such nice things to me over the last number of months. You were there a long time before most, so I appreciate it. I assume that's Steve that's asking the question, right?
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yes, that's Steve.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Steve Schmidt.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> All right. Well, all eyes are going to be on you for the next four days. And of course, in prime time on Thursday night, Mister Trump, I look forward to having a-- a deep dive on policy and issues with you in a couple of weeks, I hope.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good. I do, too. Thank you very much, Chuck.
<Chuck Todd> <Positive> Thank you, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Wrong.
<Jeb Bush> <Positive> We said no. And that's the simple fact.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> Trump was wrong, and Bush was right. Which makes Trump, it seems to me, a liar. [End Video Clip]
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> So, that's very strong, calling you a liar. Fact-checkers also say that you did push for casino gambling in Florida. Did you not?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I never -- I never called Jeb Bush. And that's what I was saying. I never called him. It was ultimately approved by the next governor shortly thereafter. It was approved, and very strongly, by the next governor, the governor who took Bush's place. But I never called Jeb Bush, and I never asked Jeb Bush to approve gambling.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was too early in the process. I never once called him.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> But you had a fund-raiser for him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I had a -- oh, that was years before. I had a fund-raiser for him years before. But I never pushed for gambling, in the sense that I never called him. And that's what I was referring to. Had I called him, I think he would have done it. But I never called Jeb Bush.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> Following the debate, you said to "Morning Joe," I think, that you were surprised that Jeb Bush did not push harder for an apology to his wife. If he had pushed harder, would you have apologized?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, no. If you see the clip, I said nothing wrong. In fact, I said very nice things about his wife, if you see the clip, the whole clip. No, I wasn't surprised. I think he did the right thing. I think he might have asked. And, probably, that was a sound bite that was given by the pollsters. You know, do the -- ask for this.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right, Chris Jansing?
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> No, wait a minute. I want to drill down on this a little bit.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hey, Joe, Steve was there a long -- Steve was there long before a lot of other people, I will tell you.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right. Let's -- OK. Let's get back to...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He won't let me give you a compliment, Steve.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> OK, the compliment -- here, let's let the compliment sink in. OK. Now let me follow up on the question.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So, would you at least be willing to send 10,000 U.S. troops over there?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, I would, but Joe, I'd engage other countries...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, no, I wouldn't have apologized, because I did nothing wrong. If you look at the clip, the whole clip, it's -- very nice things are stated about his wife.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> No, no, I know, but you're saying -- I'm asking more about -- you had said that you were surprised he didn't push harder. I'm wondering...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I said he might have pushed harder. I didn't know if he was going to push harder, but I wouldn't have -- it wouldn't have changed my mind.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> You recently released a plan cast as protecting the Second Amendment, but you have also said that you think more needs to be done on the issue of mental health when it comes to people who are disturbed getting guns. Last year's school shooting in Isla Vista passed -- after that shooting, California passed a law.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> It allows judges to temporarily take away someone's guns if they're deemed to be a threat to themselves or others by the judge, at the urging of family members. But it would be done without a hearing. Is that the kind of measure that you could support, or would you oppose that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's something I would very strongly look into. The mental health problem is really a big, big problem. We're -- and I see it in New York, where people are being released that shouldn't be on the streets, and the mental health problem. So, it's something I could certainly look at.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> You have said that you would be far better on women's issues than the likely Democratic candidate, nominee, Hillary Clinton. Let me ask you about one specific policy that she's talking about on the trail. She's obviously trying to draw a contrast between herself and Republicans. Do you think the federal government should require businesses to provide paid family leave or do you think that's an unfair mandate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to be releasing a policy on it over the next three to four weeks, Jake. And we're working on it right now.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> I want to ask you about veterans issues, if I could. You have said you will be fantastic for veterans, but the only specific I have heard that you say is that you would build more hospitals for them. Is there anything else that you would do for veterans?
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Well, of course.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at the Gulf states -- you look at some of these countries, they have no skin in the game and they're the ones who we're protecting. And I would tell other countries it's time for to you get out and fight and it's time for you to put up your troops and it's time for you to put the so-called boots on the ground or put your people on the ground because we're not going to continue to do this, but in the meantime we can do tremendous damage.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> As an example, and I said it before, why didn't we hit these sites six months ago and a year ago? Why are we hitting them after an attack? We knew they were there. We knew they were training areas. We knew they were being trained there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The other thing we have to do is make a deal with Turkey. We have to stop these people from coming in through the border. They're coming in through the Turkish border.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right. Chris Jansing has a question for you, Donald.
<Chris Jansing> <Negative> Donald, we had Bill Bratton on a little bit earlier. He talked about the threat to the homeland. The FBI has said they have active terror investigations in all 50 state s. We know very well what you've said about immigration and about sealing the U.S. borders. But beyond that, is there something that you would do here in the homeland that you think is not being done now to protect United States citizens?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you're going to have to watch and study the mosques because a lot of talk is going on at the mosques. And from what I heard in the old days, meaning a while ago, we had great surveillance going on in and around mosques in New York City and I understand our mayor totally cut that out. He totally cut it out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I don't know if you've brought that up and I'm not sure it a fact, but I heard that under the old regime, we had tremendous surveillance going on in and around the mosques of New York City. And right now, that's been totally cut out.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So let -- let me -- Chris -- Chris did you -- you did a lot of reporting this weekend. I think I picked up this weekend that actually the French have said they will shut down mosques. That -- that...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, one of the things I would do is, we would fix the hospitals. We would build some, but we would also let, when -- you know, as you probably heard -- a couple of weeks ago, it was announced -- the longest wait in the history of the VA, the Veterans Administration, people waiting to see their doctor, the longest recorded in the history of the VA. And what I'm going to do is, I'm going to make it so that they will be able to go out and use private doctors, and we will pay the private doctors.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's no reason for a person to wait in a waiting room for five days for a doctor with something that can be taken care of maybe by just a simple prescription or whatever. I think it's disgraceful. So, we're going to also, you know, do a little bit of a free market thing, where, if cases like that happen, they are going to be able to go to doctors, whether it's private, or even a public hospital, or a private hospital, in a community where they can get immediate service and really good treatment, and quickly.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> Who do you think had a good night at the debate, other than you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think Carly had a good night, but I think you gave her a lot of very easy questions. You know, you read off a couple of questions which all you had to do is say, I agree with that. So, I think that she had some pretty easy questions. You gave her some beautiful softballs. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think the most difficult evening -- and I got very good marks. I have won every poll in terms of the debate. But I think, certainly -- and this happened with FOX also -- certainly, I got the toughest questions. I think, with you, I got the toughest questions. And when they weren't asked of me, they were asked to other people with my name in it. I guess 47 percent of the questions, according to what the media said, had Trump or Trump- related.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So, I think that...
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> You are the front-runner, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think that -- but I do think that Carly did well. And I think that Marco did well. I actually think just about everybody did well. I don't think there was any disaster that night.
<Chris Jansing> <Neutral> That have radical leadership. So they're very specifically talking about ones that have -- that they can determine have very specific ties to radical...
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> They will go in and shut down mosques that have radical...
<Chris Jansing> <Neutral> There's talk about that in many places.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Donald Trump, the French are talking about that. Is this something you would consider doing as president?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I would hate it do it but it's something that you're going to have to strongly consider because some of the ideas and some of the hatred, the absolute hatred, is coming from these areas and you know, in New York City as an example. We had a group of people from what I understand, that really knew what they were doing, that were really studying the situation and they're not doing that anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And with -- under the new mayor. They're not doing that anymore and I think that's a mistake. It's something that many people are considering, not me. It's something that many people are considering and many people are going to do.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right, and I...
<Chris Jansing> <Negative> But do you -- are you concerned at all about the backlash that can create...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> It can also breed hatred.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> Who do you think is your toughest competition right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I would have to go by your polls. I always -- I'm a believer in polls. I believe strongly. I have watched polls all my life. And it's amazing how accurate they are. Sometimes, they're wrong, but, pretty much, they're accurate. So, based on that, Ben is a terrific guy, would be one. And Carly would be another one, and perhaps Marco or -- and maybe Bush.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. I mean, Bush seems to be fading very fast. I think, you know, when you're in favor of Common Core, and when you are weak on immigration, I think, you know, it's a very big thing to -- to -- I don't know how you overcome that, frankly.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> Republican front-runner Donald Trump, thank you so much, as always, for calling in. We appreciate your taking our questions.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Jake.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> OK. Bye-bye.
<Chris Jansing> <Negative> ... and the hatred that can breed?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There as already hatred. The hatred is incredible. It's embedded.
<Chris Jansing> <Neutral> So then it's OK to engage on that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's embedded. The hatred is beyond belief. The hatred is greater than anybody understands. And it already there. It not like, what, do you think they think we're great people? It's already there. It's a very, very sad situation. And I know so many people, Muslims who are such unbelievably great people and they're being so badly tarnished by what's happening. It's a shame. You can't lose track of these..
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> You would agree, Donald...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What Joe?
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> You would agree Donald, that this is just a small percentage of these radical Muslims, are a small percentage of the entire Muslim population.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, but it's a tremendous amount of horror and damage and vitriol. I mean, you look at what's happening. This is something that has to be stopped and we have to be very strong, we have to be vigilant and we have to be intelligent. We need to bring back our intelligence agencies and bring them to a much higher level. I mean, they're using the Internet, Joe, better than we are.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right Donald Trump. Thank you so much. We greatly appreciate it.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> And we turn now to campaign 2016 and our new Battleground Tracker results.  Donald Trump is back on top in our Iowa tracking.  He's at 39 percent.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Ted Cruz is behind him by just five points at 34 percent.  Marco Rubio is running third at 13 percent.  And the rest are at 5 percent and below.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> In New Hampshire, Trump has a big lead, with 34 percent, compared to Ted Cruz at 16 percent, Rubio at 14, Kasich at 10, the rest of the field at 7 percent or less.  And in South Carolina, the story is much the same, Trump ahead at 40 percent, Cruz in second with 21 percent, Rubio in third with 13, the others all at 9 percent or less.  The bad weather kept us snowed in here in Washington and unable to sit down with Donald Trump in person.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> So, he is joining us by phone this morning from Pella, Iowa.  Good morning, Mr.  Trump.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> Thanks for joining us. You said yesterday you could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and wouldn't lose voters. You're that confident, huh?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have a very great group of people, John. I have people that are so loyal, and it's been so reported, and even in your poll. But in a lot of polls, they do that, the loyalty factor. And my factor is up -- when you add it all up, it's pretty much close to 90 percent. These are people that just won't leave. They will not leave. I love my people. And it's a great thing. I mean, it's a great thing, far greater loyalty than any other candidate by double, triple, quadruple. And I love my people.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> And on the one hand, you have your people. And then this week, on the other hand, you had The National Review" putting out a special issue trying to convince people not to support you
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's a failing magazine, number one.  They need publicity.  They are people that most of whom, I don't know, most of whom -- don't forget, I have been in business.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have made a lot of money, which I'm going to do for the country now.  I have been focused on jobs and money and deals, and that's what I do.  And that's what the country needs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These are people for the most part, I don't know. I don't even know who most of them are. I don't want to know who most of them are. And they are just people that are, I guess, trying to save a magazine that is close to closing up. And they are going to get publicity. And I actually think it plays into what I'm saying, because it shows the divisiveness. They backed Romney. He lost. They backed McCain. He lost. They lose. And they don't know how to win. And I'm not sure they even want to win. They just want to stay relevant. And they're very irrelevant.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> They make an argument in the magazine that Ted Cruz has also made, which is that you're not -- and this is the phrase -- a consistent conservative, that you have changed your positions on some things over time. What is your response to that critique?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, usually, I just evoke the name Ronald Reagan.  I mean, Ronald Reagan was a fairly liberal Democrat, and he evolved over years and he became more and more conservative.  And he was not a very conservative person, but he was pretty conservative.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he ended up being a great president.  And I have evolved on many issues.  And there are some issues, I'm very much the same.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have been constant on many issues. But I have evolved on certain issues, and I think evolved through experience and through, as you grow older, you see things, and you watch things, and you study things. But Ronald Reagan was the exact same thing. He was actually much more liberal than I was. He was fairly liberal as a Democrat, believe -- a lot of people don't know that. And he became a fairly conservative person, but he did become a great president.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> What is your definition of conservative?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it's a person that doesn't want to take overly risks.  I think that's a good thing.  I think it's a person that wants to -- in terms of government I'm talking about, a person that wants to conserve, a person that wants to, in a financial sense, balance budgets, a person that feels strongly about the military.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I feel very strongly about the military.  And you have some of these people, they don't even want to focus on the military.  Our military is falling apart.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I feel very, very -- and I have always felt very, very strongly about the military. By the way, if you look at vision, when you look at the word vision, I was the one that said take the oil. I have been saying that for years. And I said take the oil, let's take the oil. And nobody would listen. Then, all of a sudden, after Paris, they started saying, maybe that's right, we will take the oil. They still don't do it the proper way.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> You mean from ISIS.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I was -- which is a little bit different than a normal conservative, but I was very much opposed to the war in Iraq.  A lot of these guys were all for the war in Iraq.  Look what's that has got us.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We spent $2 trillion.  We lost thousands of lives.  We have nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're now handing Iraq over, just handing it over to Iran.  Iran is going to take over Iraq.  And I said that was going to happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said that years ago, 2003, 2004, that Iran will take over Iraq with the largest oil reserves in the world.  And that's not a conservative position.  When I was saying, don't go into Iraq, I'm a very militaristic person.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm very much into the military, and will build our military bigger, better, stronger than ever before.  But -- and that's safe.  That's actually the cheapest thing to do, as opposed to what we have right now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I was opposed to the war in Iraq.  Most conservatives were, let's go, gung-ho.  These guys, just about all of them, every one of them wanted the war in Iraq.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look what it got us.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> Let me ask you about Ted Cruz. You said yesterday you wouldn't vote for Ted Cruz if he were the nominee. But you pledged to support the party's nominee.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it depends on where he's from.  In other words, he's got a problem.  He -- in my opinion, I mean, it's looking more and more -- as you noticed, a number of very top constitutional lawyers have come and said, he was born in Canada.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He didn't tell people.  He said he didn't know about it.  Until 15 months ago, he was a Canadian citizen.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He was joint with the United States, but he was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago.  He was a United States senator, I guess nobody figured this out, and he was citizen of Canada.  And there are lot of people now that are saying he was born in Canada, he was born on Canada's soil, on Canadian soil, and he cannot run.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, as you know, I guess you probably heard last night Illinois is looking at it very seriously.  They may not even let him run in Illinois.  They feel strongly about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But other states are looking at it very seriously.  And he may not be able to run.  Yes, if he got the nomination, and if everything was fine, I would vote for Ted Cruz.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would go for Ted Cruz. But...
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> You would vote for him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... I was putting -- I was putting that in relationship to his place of birth. There's a real question as to whether or not Ted Cruz is allowed to run for president. And I will tell you, the first thing, if he got the nomination, the first thing that would happen is that Democrats will bring a lawsuit against him. Laurence Tribe of Harvard and many other people -- I mean, many people beyond Laurence Tribe have come down and said he's not entitled to run.
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> So...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's got to -- whether he gets it done, whether he gets a declaratory judgment from the courts or does something, he's got to straighten that problem out, because there's a big fat question mark.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> All right, so, just to be clear, you would vote for Ted Cruz if he were the nominee. Let me ask you somebody else who is thinking about getting in the race, Michael Bloomberg. You said yesterday, I love it if he -- speaking about him getting in the race. Why would you love it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I would love it. I know Michael very well. I would love to compete against Michael. And I know him very well. And I think he might very well get in the race. And I would love to have him get in the race. [Crosstalk]
<John Dickerson> <Neutral> One of the reasons he...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's very opposite on me with guns, and he's opposite on pro-life, and he's opposite on lot of things. So, I would love to have Michael get in the race. But I don't know if he's going to do it. But I hope he does. I would love to compete against Michael.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> One of the reasons he would get in the race, he's thinking, is because you're doing so well. It would be to counterbalance you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that would be good. That's a good thing. I would love to have Michael get in the race. And Michael has been a friend of mine over the years. Perhaps we're not friends anymore. He's wanted to do this for a long time. And he never pulled the trigger, and we will see if he does right now. But I would personally love to compete with Michael Bloomberg.
<John Dickerson> <Negative> Speaking of New York mayors, you supported Bill de Blasio. A lot of conservatives look at him and think...
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Mr. Trump, good morning. Your reaction to what happened this morning early in Belgium?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Joining us now, the winner of last night's primary in Indiana, now the likely nominee for the Republican Party, Donald trump. Donald, congratulations.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I never supported Bill de Blasio.  I never supported.  I said I think he's going to win, because I saw the kind of competition that he had.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I never supported Bill de Blasio.  I never supported -- you saw that Glenn -- Glenn Beck said I supported Barack Obama.  Then he had to apologize, because he picks up somebody's phony Web site where they do these joker Web sites.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They said Donald Trump supported Barack Obama.  So, he retweeted.  And he's going around for two years saying I supported Barack Obama.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yesterday -- we came down very, very strong on him last week, because I was on John McCain's committee.  I raised a lot of money for John McCain.  And I was 100 percent behind him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I kept hearing that this -- this stupid person -- I mean, he's a failed person.  He's a mess.  But he was going around saying I was voting for Barack Obama.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do you believe that I would vote for Barack Obama? Believe me.  So, he -- didn't do it.  So, he actually issued apology when he found out he got duped.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He got duped by some trickster.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> The de Blasio quote I was looking at is, you said: I think pretty strongly that he will end up being a good mayor
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I did say that, because I deal in New York.  And, frankly, I hoped he was a good mayor.  He's turned out to be a terrible mayor.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think it's absolutely horrible. You're talking to a great man in Walid, he knows this stuff better than just about anybody I can think of. And you have the right man and I will tell you, I have been talking about this for a long time. And look at Brussels, Brussels was a beautiful city, a beautiful place with zero crime and now it's a disaster city. It's a total disaster.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Mr. Trump -- sorry, go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have to be very careful in the United States. We have to be very, very vigilant as to who we allow into this country.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> If you do become president and we're in a situation like this, what would you do to protect America?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, again, I think I've said it. I would -- I would close up our borders to people until we figure out what is going on. Look what -- look at Brussels, look at Paris, look at so many cities that were great cities.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Paris is almost as bad if you look at -- you know, Paris is no longer the beautiful city of lights. Paris has lot of problems in it. All you have to do is speak to the people that live there and you look at other places where the same thing has happened and they're in fear.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The city's in fear and we have to be smart in the United States. And when people come in -- I mean, we're taking in -- we're taking in people without real documentation. We don't know where they're coming from. We don't know what they're -- you know, we don't know where they're from, who they are. You look at them and look at them from any standpoint, they could be ISIS, they could be ISIS related. And you know, we just don't learn. We don't learn. I mean, Brussels is an amazing example. Brussels was an absolutely a crime-free city, one of the most beautiful cities in the world. And now you look at it, it's a disaster.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> But -- we're talking with Donald Trump, obviously. Donald, you know, we just talked to Walid Phares who talked to Dr. Zuhdi Jasser yesterday, Ambassador Khalilzad. Done great things for this country. What do all three have in common? They're Muslims. The key to unwinding the Muslim extremist issue is getting the Muslim community to trust us. How to trust us and the government more than they do maybe the people in their own community. How do you do that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you need to have -- I mean, you have on the vigilant as to who you have and where they're coming from. You know, you have to look at people and look at their backgrounds so closely. But this is a story that just seems to be more and more happening.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're going to see things happening in Paris. You see what's happening in London and other cities, and it's really not very pretty to watch. And you know, if you take a look at the migration and you go up to Germany, I have people and friends that live in Germany. They say what's going on up there, they've never seen anything like it in their lives. I mean, this woman allowed millions of people in and the assimilation is very, very difficult and in some cases impossible.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Congratulations.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Hey, Donald, why don't you just admit to everybody you never saw this coming. I mean, you -- you seriously, I mean, you -- you have to be surprised yourself at how this played out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm happy how it played out. I mean I was, you know, against -- we had 17 people. So that was a lot of people. Some people said it was the finest group of talent ever assembled by any party at any time. I was watching that before I announced and I said, wow, what am I doing? And it was talent. I mean, some were very talented frankly. But, you know, it worked out this way so I'm very happy about it.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> You brutalized a lot of them. Jeb Bush, low energy. Ted Cruz, Lyin' Ted Cruz. I mean, we could go down the list. How do you now, especially after yesterday, how do you get people like Ted Cruz to endorse you and unite this party? You're talking about uniting the party. Even yesterday you were talking about Lee Harvey Oswald. So how do you turn around unite the party today?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've gotten a lot of calls from people that were far more brutal than Ted was. And they want to join the team. In fact, I said to them, how can you do that after what you said? They said, don't worry about. That's not a problem. Because they're politicians. You know, it's talk. And I've had calls -- I'll have to tell you about them, but I mean calls really wanting to get on immediately. And this was as of a week ago, even two weeks ago, when it was looking like we were going to do well.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Do you -- Do you care if Ted Cruz endorses you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it would be nice. You know, I've been saying for a long time that there's some people that I almost don't want their endorsement, Republicans, I really don't, because it was too rough and they were too nasty. And I don't think it's going to matter, frankly. It's going to be me. And I am a Republican and I'll do a good job. And I'll do a great job on trade and on the economy, on jobs, bringing jobs back. That's -- you know, I'll do great on the military.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> What do you say about George Will? I mean, he wrote in a column this morning that it's a conservative's duty to make sure you lose all 50 states. What would you say to George Will?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He doesn't know what he's doing.  I mean, the guy is incompetent.  But when he first got elected, I didn't -- but that's not supporting him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Obviously, I have many buildings in New York. I have a tremendous business in New York. It's nice to see a guy, if he gets in -- but I never supported him. I would never support him, with his issues. But what I did say is, good luck. Congratulations. I hope he's going to be a good mayor. I hope. I wish he would be a good mayor. He's not a good mayor. He's a terrible mayor.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> All right, well, thanks very much, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But that's not supporting somebody. I mean, that's rooting somebody on. I have to live with him. I have many, many buildings in New York. I have a big business in New York. I wish he were good, but he's not.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> All right. Thank you very much, Mr. Trump. We look forward to seeing you...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Thank you, John.
<John Dickerson> <Positive> Look forward to seeing you in person next week for the broadcast. And we will be back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very good. I look forward to it, too.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Sure. And in many cases, and I know you have seen the reports, Mr. Trump, where as ISIS has rolled over different communities and cities and towns in Syria, you know, they knock over the courthouse, they take the passport machine and they take the passport documents. And they just print up fake passports for the people who need them or people who got the money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. And they're coming into our country -- and they're coming into our country, too. And we don't -- we have no idea what's happening. Our government has absolutely no idea what's happening, but they're coming into our country, they're coming in by the thousands. And just watch what happens. I'm a pretty good prognosticator. Just watch what happens over the years. I won't be pretty.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> You know, it was a few days ago -- it was actually a month ago in the New York Times called you a racist because you said Brussels is -- Belgium is turning into a hell hole, if I can paraphrase. What do you -- what do you say about them then and what do you say now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the New York Times has no clue as to what's going on in the real world. They have no clue. It's a failing newspaper.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They don't know what they're doing. It will be closed unless somebody buys it as a trophy and loses a fortune. You know, the whole thing is ridiculous that we listen to people like this that -- we listen to people that blew a newspaper right out of the woods.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They went into other businesses, lost billions of dollars and then we're supposed to sit back and listen to the New York Times. The fact is that we have a situation worldwide, a situation that is out of control and just all I do -- I'm looking at your pictures now on the show, it's disgraceful. And it's what it is. I have been saying it for a long time.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Donald -- Donald Trump, I don't think I did a good job describing that to. What I was saying is what do you think of the New York Times? They took you to task about your assessment of Brussels. Were you right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, George is a major loser. You know, he's a dour guy. Nobody watches him, very few people listen to him. It's over for him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I never wanted his support. You know, he's been writing these columns for -- for a year, ever since I announced. You know, I had a run-in with him when I was in civilian life. I didn't want to go to one of his speeches at Mar-A-Lago; he made a speech a Mar-A-Lago and I find him to be a very boring person.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, he's boring and dull and I didn't go to the speech. You know, there was no reason. I never thought I'd be in politics, I never thought I'd be running. This was 10 years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was at Mar-A-Lago giving a speech and I said, I just don't want to go. And he wanted me to go. And I didn't. You know, it was one of those things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I had something else to do -- [Crosstalk]
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So you think he's holding a grudge?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He never forgot it.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he's a nasty guy, you know, he's a very nasty guy.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, of course I'm right. I mean, just turn on the television and obviously look at Fox and Friends, you know? Of course. I mean, you take look at it. Brussels is a disaster and it's been a -- Brussels is an armed camp, and I'm not talking about today. You go down into Brussels now, it's an armed camp. If you went into Brussels 20 years ago, it was like a magical city.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was a magical city and -- and now you look at it, it's an armed camp. I'm just looking at your pictures on television right now, it's horrible.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> What about...
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> And in particular -- for instance, in the neighborhood where they picked this Salah Abdek-Salam, one of the guys from the Paris attacks, in that -- in that Muslim community, police have no penetration in that neighborhood and no real -- a lot of people don't have a real connection to the police and there's high unemployment, so that explains a lot about that. I wanted to...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Police are afraid to go into the neighborhood and he was being protected by other people in the neighborhood. So here's one of the Paris leaders and killers and he's being protected by people in the city itself. It's ridiculous.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> He was four doors down from his parents.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right. The whole thing is crazy. And it's not going to change. It's not going to get better. It's only going to get worse.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> I want to ask you too, because you're a businessman, about the markets because I know the markets are down. Brussels is a hot bed for international business. What happens now going forward from a business perspective?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I'll have to tell you this. Nobody reads him. He has no influence. If he had influence, I wouldn't be talking to you right now, Joe.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because look, let's face it, I mean, the guy writes a bad column every time he writes a column. I don't know how often he writes them, I don't really know. But -- and the other thing you mentioned, not only George Will there are some others. You look at this guy, Krauthammer, all he does is bash me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He wanted the war. You know, he talked about, oh well, Trump is tough and he may have a fast trigger on nuclear. Let me tell you, I have the slowest trigger there is but I'll prepare our nuclear, because we're not even prepared. But I'll have the slowest trigger.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> That's actually -- you know, Donald, the great irony is, and we've said this, Mika, we've said this before. We actually are going to go into a general election where you have the Democratic candidate that's going to support intervention -- interventionist policies more than the Republican nominee.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> It seems that way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Trump, speak of this, a guy like Krauthammer -- I watched him last night and he was talking about Trump would be, may be very quick temperamentally. He's the one that was pushing for years the war in Iraq, which was a total disaster and I didn't want to do it. And, you know, as a civilian I was totally against it. And should have never, one of the worst decisions in the history of our country, by the way, perhaps the worst.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Me too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then they talk about me with the fast, so they talk about me with temperament. We need a strong temperament right now. The world is laughing at us. We need a very strong temperament.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think this -- this whole thing will get worse as time goes by. It's being, you know, perpetrated all over the place now. Brussels is in very bad shape, but many cities will be this way. And you know, with what's taking place. It's really the policies of people that don't know what they're doing. It's people that don't know what -- they see what's happening, and yet they allow it to continue to happen.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Yeah. Mr. Trump, let me ask you about this. As we look at the images, we know that once you get through the security zone at the airports, you know, that the security is high. However, these explosions at the airport apparently took place outside the security perimeter. The explosions, the three explosions at the two metro stops in downtown Brussels happened at a metro stop where there's no security. These are soft targets. For folks in the United States of America looking in thinking, "Well, you know what, I take a metro, I take a subway."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Are those safe? What should we be going to increase security there, if we need to do anything?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you really -- look, number one, you ought to lead your life. You don't want to be living in an armed camp your whole life, and there's a certain group of people that is making living a normal life impossible, and you just have to take a look at other cities. I mean, you go into Paris, there are places in Paris where the police are afraid to go, they don't what to go, it's so bad.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You look at Brussels, where this guy was being hidden by his friends, OK, his friends are holding him out. He's the most wanted man in the world. He's living right under their noses. The police don't want to go into those areas. They have absolutely no control over those areas. And I mean, we as a country have to learn what's going on and frankly, those countries better get smart fast, because they're just disintegrating.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know, Brussels, I have friends that live in Brussels, they say the place is literally disintegrating. And I'm not just talking about today. I'm talking about general things.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Yeah, right. I'll tell you what, here's a tweet just in from the Department of State from the United States federal government, message to U.S. citizens in Brussels, "Shelter in place and avoid public transportation."
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> So let's look ahead to general. Yesterday, Andrea Mitchell asked Hillary Clinton if she thought you were unqualified to be Commander in Chief. I want to play it for you, what she said. [Begin Video]
<Hillary Clinton> <Negative> Well, he has given no indication that he understands the gravity of the responsibilities that go with being commander-in-chief. And that will be a big part of my campaign because, at some point, he's going to have to be held to the standard we hold anybody running for president and commander-in-chief. What is it you know? What is it you've done? What is it you are proposing to do as president and commander-in-chief? So far we haven't seen any of that.
<Hillary Clinton> <Negative> We've seen a lot of rhetoric, we've seen a lot of insults. He's an equal opportunity insulter. But when it comes down to making this really important decision, it's been my experience that people in our country say to themselves, wait a minute, what do I think is the best choice, the best choice for me, for my family, for my jobs, my income, my future? And I think that absent some major change in how he is presenting himself and what he is saying, that's going to be a pretty high bar for him to get over.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> [End Video] So Donald, she did not mince words. What's your response?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's just words,. It's just another politician talking. And look, Bernie Sanders said about Hillary Clinton she's got poor judgment. He also said, by the way, she's unqualified.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I won't even go there. But Bernie Sanders said that she's got poor judgment, and she does. You look at the e-mail scandal. She shouldn't even be allowed to run.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know that, Joe knows that, and everybody knows that. She's only being protected by the Democrats. She should not be allowed to run in the election. She should not be - she should suffer like other people have suffered who have done far less than she has.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, you look at so many, I won't even mention names anymore. But you look at so many people that have done far less than her in the same subject matter, and it's been a horror show. And here she is running for president like nothing happened. She shouldn't even be allowed to run.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know that.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Yeah. Right, that's what they said earlier. Donald Trump, a lot of people listening right now might be misinterpreting your message in the past and currently, that the problem -- that you have a problem with Muslims. You don't have a problem with Muslims. In fact, you hired one Walid Phares to work with you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure. That's correct.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> So, how do you want to win over the trust of the Muslim community that want to be Americans or good citizens, and get them to oust the terrorists amongst them? How does Donald Trump do that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's one of the things, they're very untrusting of people other than Muslims, and they have people there that they know. For instance, the bombers, the people that killed in -- if you take a look back six months ago, the two people that got married, the radicalized, you know, he was radicalized. Everybody knew what was going on.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They had bombs all over their apartments, they had guns all over the place. Everybody knew what was going on, and nobody reported them. If they would have been reported, somehow that community doesn't believe in reporting. They know exactly what's going on. And they don't know -- they don't believe in reporting to the police.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> So, what's your message -- what's your message to them, Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By they way -- my message -- it's not to them. My message to us is we better get smart and we better get smart fast. My message to them is they have to be more open with the police, they have -- they have to become part of the community.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have to let people know when they see people making bombs in the first floor of an apartment, they have to -- they have to let people know. And they don't do it. And then the bombs go off and the guns go off, and everything happens, and you have the situation like you recently had in California, where 14 people are killed. Or you have Paris attacks.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it's going to get worse and worse. In my opinion, this is just the beginning, it will get worse and worse, because we are lax and we are foolish, we are foolish. We can't allow these people -- at this point, we can't allow these people to come into the country, I'm sorry.
<Willie Geist> <Positive> Hey, Donald, it's Willie. Congratulations on your win again last night.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Willie Geist> <Positive> I want to ask you a couple of questions about some issues that you've raised during this campaign. A lot of people think you've said some things to win votes in a Republican primary that maybe you actually don't believe and it could change as you go to a general. Do you still believe that Muslims should be banned from entering the country until we can figure out what's doing on, as you've said?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to be very vigilant, we have to find out exactly what's going on. We have some major, major problems and nobody wants to talk about it. We have a president that won't mention the term radical Islamic terrorism." He won't even mention it even though it's obvious that some terrible things are happening. And we have to be extremely careful and we have to be vigilant. Yes
<Willie Geist> <Neutral> So that proposal stands for the general election, assuming you make it that far, you'll raise that as another issue?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I've got -- I don't know if it hurts me or not. I really don't know if it hurts me. I don't care if it hurts me. I'm doing the right thing when I do this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And whether it's Muslim or whether it's something else, I mean, I have to do the right thing and that's the way I've been guided. That's the way - you know, when Joe said it's a little bit surprising, and I did see last night, this is the first time in the history of our country where this has happened, where really a civilian in the truest sense has, you know, got the nomination of a major party. And I've been guided by common sense, by what's right. And you see what's happening.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to be careful. I mean, we're allowing thousands of people to come into our country, thousands and thousands of people being placed all over the country that frankly nobody knows who they are. They don't have documentation in many cases -- in most cases. And we don't know what we're doing.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Well, how do you -- how do you penetrate communities like that? How do you make a difference and make change?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's not for us to penetrate. It's for them to penetrate. They have to come to us.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, we're not the victims here. We're acting like we're the -- like it's our fault. Because that's the problem with the liberal policies of this country and this world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's acting like it's our fault. It's not our fault, OK? It's not our fault. It's their fault, and they have to come out and they have to say, "Hey, look, this is happening." This can get cleared up, but I don't know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The thinking is not -- it's just looking to me like this is going to get worse and worse. And it will happen in other locations. It has already happened big league in Paris and it will continue to happen in Paris. Look, in Paris they have places that you cannot -- the police cannot even go to. They're petrified to go to them. They have absolutely no control. They're different zones, they have absolutely no control of the areas. And you can't have that.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right. [Crosstalk]
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Well, Donald, I want to clarify one thing. Walid Phares is not Muslim, but he's Christian. So, I had that wrong, and I apologize.
<Willie Geist> <Neutral> So...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And let's see what happens. I mean, this could be a very serious problem for the future. And ifs you look at what's happening all over Europe, with the migration, and look at what's happening. It's terrible what they have done to some of these countries. They've - they're going to destroy - I mean, they are destroying Europe. I'm not going to let that happen to the United States.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Okay. So as we go to the general, the proposal for the Muslim ban stands. What about what you told Chris Matthews a few weeks ago, which is that women who get abortions should be punished. Do you still believe that to be true?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, he was asking me a theoretical - or just a question in theory. And I talked about it only from that standpoint. Of course not. And that was done, they said - you know, I guess it was theoretically. But he was asking me a rhetorical question and I gave an answer. And by the way, people thought from an academic standpoint and asked rhetorically, people said that answer was an unbelievable academic afterwards. But of course not. And I said that afterwards. Everybody understands that.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> So Donald, there are two family members around this set that are very happy this morning. My brother...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Oh, right.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> ...is extraordinarily happy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a great guy, by the way.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> George brutalized me for nine months whenever I criticized you. And Nicolle actually had to stop going home for awhile -- but her parents. Did you get a text of it?
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> But he's an expert in that area.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> OK, so Donald Trump, let's say -- let's say you're the president of the United States today. Obviously, you would have cracked down on immigration to prevent what you're talking about earlier. What else would you do today?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I would, you know, I guess I would just talk to the people and give them, frankly, a pep talk. You know, we need a pep talk. We need spirit in our own country, OK? We are allowing thousands and thousands of people to come into our country, and we don't even know where they come from and who they are. They're coming in from Syria, they're coming in from different -- coming in from the migration.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> But you're going to fix that, you say?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me?
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> You say you're going to fix that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm not going to fix it, I'm not going to allow them to come in. That's going to be fixing it, OK?
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> I got a tweet last night when I asked about Republicans for Hillary, they start hate tweeting me, what about Democrats for Donald Trump? I want to ask you about Democrats for Donald Trump because that is how, sir, I think you see you could remake the map. I also want to ask you about something you said last night. You said, I love winning with the women. And I think the media gives you short shrift.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> You don't need to win with all women, but you do need to narrow the gap among married women. And I wonder what issue sect you think is your entry point into beginning to turn around what are pretty dismal poll numbers with the kinds of women you do need to bring around?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Nicolle, first of all, thank you and say hello to your parents and I really appreciate them.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> You just made their day.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you what, we do have tremendous numbers of Democrats. You've seen that in the open runs. We have tremendous numbers of Democrats that have voted for me. And in fact, New York, which is closed, they were just saying some of the people that work at the polling booths where they were interviewed by local television, they said in all of the years that we've been here - you know, one worked for 25 years, one worked for 40 years at the booth - they said, you know, the most incredible thing I've ever seen, that people that came in Democrats, they kept saying we want to vote for Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We want to vote, how do you do that? Now, you weren't allowed to do that. But they were saying hundreds and hundreds of people were coming in that were registered Democrats that wanted to vote for Donald Trump. And they said they have never seen that and some of them have been working the polling booths for 40 years. As far as women are concerned, they want to see strength in our military.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They want to see strength for our border. They want to see our country protected. We have a military that's being decimated. We have a military that is totally ill prepared, and in many cases, ill equipped.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When General Odierno left the - you know, recently, six months ago, seven months ago, he said never has our military been so ill prepared or something to that effect. And I will tell you, women wan to see strength. They want to see a strong military. I'll also...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not allowing them to come in. I mean, we don't know what's going on. There's something going on. There's something different. They're not assimilating into society and there's something different. And we have to be very, very careful, and we have to be very vigilant. And this is what I have been saying for a long time. And I guess it's at least a small part of the reason why I'm the number one front-runner.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, people are very concerned about this and they're very concerned about the security of this country.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> But -- but Donald, right. And obviously, if people coming in from Syria, there's a lot of them are just victims, and there's some of them that want to pretend they're victims and they're terrorists. But what are the other people that want to be Americans and want to be Muslims?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have to be very vigilant, they have to be checked so carefully. It's a very hard thing to do. If they're coming from Syria, it's likely they have no documentation, they have no papers, they have no anything.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But if they're coming from certain other places, and if they're Muslim, they have to be checked very, very carefully. They're having a hard time assimilating no matter where they go. They're not assimilating easily into other countries.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to be very careful; we're not babies, we can't do this anymore. We can't have these attacks anymore. We can't have World Trade Centers anymore and going -- planes flying into the Pentagon. It's time to be smart. It's time to look carefully. And we have to be -- look, people will come in, but we have to be very, very careful as to who comes in to our country, or we're going to have problems like you have never seen. We probably already will have. But we're going to have problems like you have never seen before.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> All right.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Donald Trump, thank you so much for being with us this morning.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> They want someone steady, though. I think women voters sometimes see you shoot from the hip in a way that makes them nervous. They want --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah. But actually, I don't shoot from the hip. You know, actually...
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> No?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Actually I don't shoot for the hip -- from the hip. And I will say this, the recent races - you know, the recent victories that I had in Pennsylvania, New York, and all over, Maryland, Connecticut, all up and down. I mean, you know, just one after another. I was so strong with women.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I won women every single time by massive majorities. In fact, very close to the men. Now supposedly I'm doing extremely well with men. Okay? Much, much better than Hillary.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's her weakness. But I'm doing really well with the men. I was doing just as well in the last seven or eight states. I was doing just as well, and in one case I think even better with women.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So they want to see a secure country. I'm going to do it much better. I'm also going to bring jobs back. Hillary doesn't know anything about jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Her husband signed NAFTA. NAFTA is the single worst economic thing that's happened to this country, in my opinion, that I can think of. And it just sucked the jobs and sucked the money right out of our country. We're going to make big changes.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> And John Heilemann, you're next. But John Heilemann, again, this is a remarkable general election where you're going to have a Republican nominee more populist on trade and more of a populist on intervention, military intervention, than the Democratic nominee. You talk about, like the Obama people say, the deck is being reshuffled.
<John Heilemann> <Positive> Yeah, we'll see how that all shakes out on those various issues, but I want to ask one -- another question about the general. Donald, good morning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning.
<John Heilemann> <Positive> You've got -- you're headed down to a general election that, by most reckonings, is going to cost about a billion dollars to run a national campaign. You've been very proud about being self-funded throughout this nomination fight. You now have Republicans like Ed Rollins and others who are talking about forming pro-Trump Super PACs. So as you head into the general election, are you going to welcome the support of Super PACs as you get ready to run against Hillary Clinton?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well first of all, Ed Rollins, and others, have been so tremendous. You know, we talked about the negatives, the kraut hammers who are, you now, people that they have problems, they have real problems. But - and George Will that nobody reads or nobody listens to. But I'll tell you what, I have had such incredible support and I'll tell you -- I'm going to be making a decision over the next week.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The question is, I do love self-funding. I don't want anything for myself. But we do need money for the party. The party will come together.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think it's imperative that the entire party come together. I don't want everybody. I don't even want certain people that were extraordinarily nasty. Let them go their own way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let them wait eight years or let them wait 16 years or whatever, because I think we're going to have a great success against, probably Hillary because the system is totally rigged against Bernie. I mean, totally rigged against him. So probably we're going to have Hillary. And I will make a decision fairly soon as to that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, do I want to sell a couple of buildings and self-fund? I don't know that I want to do that necessarily, but I really won't be asking for money for myself, I'll be asking money for the party. And really, it's something that we're going to start on right away. I got a call last night from Reince Priebus. And it's something that - now that we're in this position, we're going to start on right now and start focusing on.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Willie has an important question for you.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Before you go, I know you've got to run, Donald, but we confirmed last night at NBC News that your campaign has started to vet vice presidential candidates. Who are a couple of the names that you're looking at?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's too soon. I just don't want to do it. I think that a lot of people are talking about certain names, and certainly those are the names that we're thinking of.
<Willie Geist> <Neutral> Can you give us one or two?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think that I will say that I probably will go the political route. I have the business -- let's call it talents. And I think I'll probably go the political route, somebody that can help me with legislation and somebody that can help me get things passed and somebody that's been friends with the senators and the congressman and all, so we don't have to go the -- so we don't have to go the executive order route as much as Obama did, you know, where he can't get anything approved so he just keeps signing executive orders. But more than likely, I would go the political route.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> So not a general, say? A lot of people proposed a military leader.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's something I thought of, and there's one person I think is very good. But I really want to -- I think more likely I'm inclined to go -- and I -- speaking of general, I think one of my strengths -- one of my strengths -- look, my strength is going to be the economy and jobs and bringing jobs back and trade deals. We're going to make great trade deals. We're going to reverse it, because right now we're a laughingstock all over the world with the dumb deals we make.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think one of my strengths is going -- one of my really great strengths will be the military, will be getting us out and winning and getting us out of the mess we're in, in the Middle East. That is just -- you know, we're up to almost $4 trillion of spending and thousands and thousands of lives, more importantly. But I think it will be -- end up being a strength. So we'll see what happens.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right, Donald --
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Donald Trump.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> '-- congratulations on what even your sharpest detractors would have to call a truly historic run, unprecedented in our lifetime. It's really incredible. Congratulations.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Joe. Thank you, Mika.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Thank you.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Thanks.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> We'll see you soon.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> We interviewed the President and his wife after we went off air, because he came out to speak after we were on air. So I got a chance to to chat with him. So let's listen to some of that exclusive interview.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I’m Donald J. Trump and I'm Your Next President of the United States. Hello The_Donald readers and the entire Reddit community -- this is going to be SO huge and I'm looking forward to answering your questions. I'm doing this in flight to visit the great people of Toledo, OH, so Internet connection might be spotty -- I promise you, I'll answer all the questions I can. I want to do BIG things for America and as your President, I WILL Make America Great Again! Be back in 30 -- 7 pm ET!
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Excellent.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> The Vice President is in Asia, doing at the fourth stop tour, and he said basically the U.S. is running out of patience, clearly a message to North Korea. You have a Vavy fleet that is being sent into the Sea of Japan right now. Have you ruled out a military strike?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to telegraph what I'm doing, or what I'm thinking. I'm not like other administrations, where they say we're going to do this in four weeks and that... it doesn't work that way. We'll see what happens. I hope things work out well. I hope there's going to be peace, but you know. They've been talking with this gentleman for a long time. You read Clinton's book. She said, oh we made such a great peace deal, and it was a joke. You look at different things over the years with President Obama. Everybody... he's been outplayed. They've all been outplayed by this gentleman, and we'll see what happens. But I just don't telegraph my moves.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Did we sabotage the North Korea strike?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to comment on it.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Okay, what happens if North Korea launches another missile?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We'll find out.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> All right. About China, some of the media are saying you've softened your stance on China. Has China.... have they helped with a relationship with North Korea?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ainsley, I didn't soften my stance. Look, China came to the United States. The President who was... I really developed a very good relationship with... I think he's a terrific person. I really got to know very well over a two day period. We were together hours and hours and hours by ourselves. We had a 15-minute scheduled meeting, and it lasted for three hours, and the same thing happened the next day. We have a good chemistry together. He understands it's a big problem. He's working on it. Now, what am I going to do, start a trade war with China in the middle of him working on a bigger problem -- frankly -- with North Korea? So I'm dealing with China with great respect. I have great respect for him. We'll see what he can do. Now maybe he won't be able to help. That's possible. I think he's trying, but maybe he won't be able to help. And that's a whole different story. So we'll see what happens.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Can't hurt.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> UPDATE: Proof: https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10157382886305725
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Looking forward to answering your questions! We are still in the air on our way to Ohio. Such a great time answering your questions. Thank You!
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/photos/a.488852220724.393301.153080620724/10157383302255725/?type=3&theater
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Americans in every party are tired of our rigged system and corrupt politicians, and want to reform our government so it no longer benefits the powerful at the expense of everyone else. They know I will fix it so it works for them and their families. Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change. My message is that things have to change, and they have to change right now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to change a foreign policy that has led us to one economic disaster after another, and an economic policy that has failed our poorest citizens. We will never fix a rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place. I am going to return the government to the people. Together, we will Make America Great Again.
<Question> <Positive> Hello Mr. Trump, as you may know there are a lot of young Bernie Sanders supporters out there who have become disillusioned by both the conduct of the DNC and by the policy positions of Secretary Clinton (many of these Bernie Sanders frequent this site). What is the most important thing you would like to convey about yourself and your policy positions to the people who voted for Bernie in the primary but are now considering either staying home or voting third party in November?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Though Bernie is exhausted and has given up on his revolution, many of his voters still want to keep up the fight. I expect that millions of Bernie voters will refuse to vote for Hillary because of her support for the War in Iraq, the invasion of Libya, NAFTA and TPP, and of course because she is totally bought and sold by special interests. She and her husband have been paid millions and millions by global corporations and powerful interests who will control her every decision. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We welcome with open arms all voters who want an honest government and to fix our rigged system so it works for the people. This includes fixing one of Bernie's biggest issues, our terrible trade deals that strip our country of its jobs and wealth.
<Question> <Negative> During your rapid fire Press Q&A this morning, you mentioned the hundreds of days it's been since Hillary's last press conference. What do you think is/are the reason(s) for Hillary refusing to hold any press conferences for such a huge amount of time?
<Question> <Negative> follow up, Do you think Hillary will attempt to decrease the number of times she has to debate you like she did to Bernie during the Democratic Primary, or even avoid debating you altogether like she's avoided press conferences altogether this year?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but you know somebody said currency manipulation, what am I going to do? In the middle of him talking with North Korea, I'm going to hit them with currency manipulation? This is the fake media that just does a number. Think of it: he's working so nicely, many coal ships have been sent back. Fuel is being sent back. They're not dealing the same way. Nobody has ever seen it like that. Nobody has ever seen such a positive response on our behalf from China. And then the fake media goes, Donald Trump has changed his stance on China. I haven't changed my stance. China is trying to help us. I don't know if they're going to be able to or not. but what, I want to start heavy, heavy trade or currency manipulation statements against somebody that's out there right now trying to stop what could be a very bad situation? You understand that.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> I understand that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nobody ever mentions it that way though. But that's okay, I mean I think we're doing really well. China's has been helping, and other people have been helping, but I don't know that that's going to work. It may have to be a different solution.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> All right, so Secretary Kelly at DHS, he has a message to illegal immigrants. He says a single DUI can get you kicked out of the country. Do you agree with that stance?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm letting him run it. He's great he's a great general. He was a tremendously successful general, and I'm letting him run it. But i will tell you, we've gotten tremendous criminals out of this country, and I'm talking about illegal immigrants that were here that caused tremendous crime, that have murdered people, raped people. Horrible things have happened. They're getting the hell out, or they are to go into prison. And so many towns and cities are thanking me, because we have gotten rid of a burden that you would not believe. I mean, it is a serious problem and we never did anything about it, and now we're doing something about it.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> so he sounds pretty [Note: Video Cuts]
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> [In progress] ...first White House Easter Egg Roll take a look.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Congratulations Mr. President, Mrs. First Lady for this wonderful event.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Crooked Hillary Clinton will not do press conferences because she cannot explain her illegally deleted 33,000 emails, or her disaster in Libya, or her role pushing TPP (which she would 100% approve if she got the chance), or her support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees, etc.
<Question> <Positive> America has a proud tradition of stealing the most brilliant and talented people from countries around the world for ourselves. Albert Einstein, Wernher von Braun, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Melania Trump... the list goes on and on. In recent years, however, H-1B visa abuse has become rampant.
<Question> <Negative> A program meant bring truly exceptional talent to America has been twisted by globalist politicians and corporations, allowing low-cost, short term labor to steal jobs from everyday Americans and take everything they learn back to their home countries. Will you curb H-1B abuse and make sure visas are going to people who want to become American, stay American, and make America great?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have put forward a detailed plan for H-1B reform to protect American workers which can viewed on the immigration paper on my website. My plan is the exact opposite of Crooked Hillary Clinton.
<Question> <Negative> You’ve expressed your support and appreciation for police. What would say to a young college student like myself who is considering a job in law enforcement, but might have been discouraged by the recent attacks on police?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We will always stand with and support our nation's amazing police. There is nothing more honorable then serving your community and your country as a law enforcement officer. My administration will protect those who protect us. Thank you to all the incredible police officers in our country tonight.
<Question> <Negative> Mr. Trump, Reports estimate that 90% of US media is owned by 6 companies. The US mass media has fused into a gross alliance with big business and big government as this election has shown more than any other. The dishonest media is rigging our democracy with a radical agenda that divides Americans and causes nothing but sensationalism and hatred at the expense of the USA. They are killing our country for ratings and profit, with impunity. How will you, as president, tackle this protected class of media elites without stepping on the first amendment rights of average Americans?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have been very concerned about media bias and the total dishonesty of the press. I think new media is a great way to get out the truth.
<Question> <Positive> Mr. Trump, as a self-employed young American, my health insurance costs have skyrocketed under Obamacare. Paying close to $300 a month with a $6,000 deductible is a challenge as I try and grow my business. What will you do as President to ensure that myself and others can not only enjoy the security of having health insurance, but also afford to keep it?
<Melania Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> You're the hostess of this.
<Melania Trump> <Positive> Yes, fantastic. Today. It's an amazing job. You have 25,000 people through the day, and I think it would be fantastic, fun day.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Wonderful. What is the best part about planning an event like this, your first event?
<Melania Trump> <Positive> It's a first event. It's a first, a wonderful tradition that's... we put it together, and really very special. From choosing the colors of the eggs, to choosing what kind of activity you want.  So.. and really thank military as well, so they really help us too.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> You get to be here with your whole family. How was easter?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was great, and I have to say Melania works so hard on this event that it's... it's been so nice. nNw I hope we don't have rain like it is right now, but but she worked so hard and did a really beautiful job.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Well, if you're just waking up we did talk... [Interview replays in loop. Break]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> One of the first things I will do is to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. I will put forward an amazing new plan, which will include many reforms, such as letting people buy insurance across state lines, increasing choice and competition, and bargaining for better, cheaper drug prices.
<Question> <Positive> Mr. Trump, on behalf of Subreddit iconr/asktrumpsupporters we would like to ask you the following questions:
<Question> <Positive> Question 1: We firmly believe Hillary will try and steal this election through vote fraud, especially given recent events. What is your campaign doing to ensure that we have a fair election?
<Question> <Positive> Question 2: What role should NASA play in helping to Make America Great Again?
<Question> <Neutral> Question 3: How do you feel about WikiLeaks? Does it change your opinion on Snowden?
<Question> <Neutral> Question 4: What is your opinion on Net Neutrality?
<Question> <Neutral> Question 5: Has your campaign ever gotten any ideas from the_donald?
<Question> <Positive> Thank you for taking the time to join us today and we look forward to continuing to Make America Great Again with you.
<Question> <Negative> Sincerely, r/asktrumpsupporters- A subreddit dedicated to explaining to non-supporters why we are Trump supporters and why they should be too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> 1 - Voter fraud is always a serious concern and authorities must be vigilant from keeping those from voting that are not authorized to do so. 2 - Honestly I think NASA is wonderful! America has always led the world in space exploration.
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> You have certainly started a national conversation this week, Mr. President, on the NFL. You say the NFL situation is a very important situation.
<Question> <Negative> Mr. Trump, what do you feel is the greatest issue facing young Americans today?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The question most young people ask me is about the rising cost of education, terrible student debt and total lack of jobs. Youth unemployment is through the roof, and millions more are underemployed. It's a total disaster! I will create millions of new jobs, reform our education system, and work to free young Americans from the awful burden of debt.
<Question> <Positive> Which US president do you admire the most?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There have been many amazing Presidents in American history, including George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan, all of whom I greatly admire.
<Question> <Negative> Hello Mr. Trump, Are you getting tired of winning?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am never tired of winning, and as your president I will win for you, the American people. I'm with you!
<Question> <Neutral> Mr. Trump What is your plan for reducing or removing the influence of money on politics?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Keeping Crooked Hillary Clinton out of the White House!
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> Your critics say it's been a distraction, but you say it's critical. And you talk about words like patriotism and citizenship. Why is this such an important issue for you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it is an important issue. It's not a distraction at all, because, you know, first of all, I'm doing a lot. As you know, we've passed over 50 pieces of legislation. We have a Supreme Court judge. We have a much stronger military. We have strong borders now. We're going to get the wall. We're going to get all the things that we said.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And now we're going, as you know, today is the big day. We're announcing the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country. So there's been no distraction.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But the NFL cannot disrespect our country. They cannot disrespect our flag or our national anthem. And they can't have people sitting down or kneeling down during our national anthem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I saw this a year ago with Kaepernick. And I said this is a terrible thing. I thought it was terrible. And then it builds up a little bit and a little bit more and you see what's been happening. And then all of a sudden, you see more and more and more.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I came out and made a statement in Alabama the other day and I said, I think it's very disrespectful to our country. And the world's picked it up. And guess what?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Most people agree with me. And the NFL is in a box. They have to do something about it. They're disrespecting -- and when I say they, in a way, it is they, because they can stop it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, they have rules for everything. You can't dance in the end zone. You can't wear the pink socks, relative to breast cancer, which is one of the places -- they have rules for everything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Why aren't they honoring this country by enforcing a rule that's been in existence for a long time?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So the NFL and the players really have to do the honor of the country. It's for the honor of the country. They have to respect our country. They have to respect our flag and our anthem.
<Pete Hegseth> <Neutral> What prompted that in Alabama? Why did you step out?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have so many friends that are owners. And they're in a box. I mean I've spoken to a couple of them. They say, we are in a situation where we have to do something.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think they're afraid of their players, you want to know the truth. And I think it's disgraceful. And they've got to be tough and they've got to be smart, because you look at the ratings.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The ratings are going way down. The stadiums are -- I've seen a couple of stadiums over the last few weeks. They are losing -- there are a lot of empty seats. I couldn't even believe it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But when it comes to the respect of our nation, when it comes to the respect of our anthem and our flag, they have no choice. You have to have people stand with respect...
<Pete Hegseth> <Neutral> Mr. President, we're here in Indiana. You're going to launch your tax reform plan in front of this crowd. Who is your tax plan intended to help?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Really, the working people. We say the working people, middle class, the people that really haven't been treated right, Pete, and they haven't been treated right, really, for a long time, they have not been treated right
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Also, it's going to be for businesses where they're going to employ jobs, where they're going to bring in jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it's for jobs. This is a tax plan for jobs and growth, growth for our country. It will be the largest reduction, in terms of dollars, of any plan ever in the history of the country. And it's going to be something very special. But it's really for the middle income people and it's for the working people and it's for jobs.
<Pete Hegseth> <Neutral> Are there any rates or brackets that are non-negotiable?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, the 20 percent is non-negotiable. I wanted to do it at 15 percent. This is for business. I wanted to do it at 15 percent. If you look at China, China is at 15 percent. Other countries are at -- higher.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean right now, we're the highest taxed nation in the world. When I finish the plan, we'll be among the lower taxed, which is very good. I'd like to be the lowest, but you can't be the lowest. There are some that are ridiculous.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I wanted to be at 15. In fact, I was going to start at 15 and maybe negotiate it up to 20. But the numbers really work at 20, so we're putting it in at 20, but we're not going to negotiate.
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> Mr. President, the health care bill this week didn't -- went down in the Senate.
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> What about this plan makes you feel confident that it won't meet the same fate?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Pete, the health care bill didn't go down. We have the votes, but reconciliation is a disaster. But as you know, it ends on Friday. So we don't have enough time, because we have one senator who's a "yes"" vote
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he's a "yes"" vote. So we can't do it by Friday."
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So we have the votes. We will do it some time at the beginning of the year, but prior to the election in November.
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> Do you still have confidence in Mitch McConnell?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do. I mean, look, I've dealt with Mitch for a long time. And I think he has to get rid of the filibuster rule. I think it's just a disaster for the Republican Party, because it means you need 60 votes on most pieces of legislation and you're not going to get it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There are 270 bills right now sitting before the Senate. You're not going to get them approved, because you're not going to get eight Democrats. And they want to keep this horrible filibuster rule, which says basically, you need 60.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So that means you need eight Democrats to get something approved. And you're not going to get that. So they have to get rid of the filibuster rule. Otherwise, it's -- they're just making a mistake. But, no, I have confidence in -- look, I really like all of these people. I think they're terrific people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What I'm going to do, is we do have the votes for health care, but the filibuster, you know, if you look at what's going on with respect to timing, we have only until Friday for reconciliation, so we're going into next year. But in the meantime, I'm going to start negotiating with Democrats. And we'll see what happens.
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> Do you feel like when you start negotiating with Democrats, do you feel like you can trust Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's not a question of trust. First of all, you know, I have a nice relationship with them. It's not really trust. It's if we can do a great health care bill, bipartisan, I'm OK with that. So we have...
<Pete Hegseth> <Neutral> You've been discussing a new deal?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- Pete, we have the votes to get it done. You can't do it when somebody is in the hospital. You know, when you have 52 votes and you need 51, it's, you know, it's very hard to get, because you always have somebody -- and in some cases, they want to grandstand. A lot of bad things happen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we have the votes. But we don't have the time, because it's Friday. I mean literally Friday, it ends, at a certain time on Friday. So we'll bring it into a few months from now. We'll vote it. It's block grants. It's going to be great health care.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In the meantime, I have that little period of time, I'll negotiate with the Democrats if we can come up with a for fantastic health care bill, that's OK with me. Good for both parties. Bipartisan.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Joining me now by phone, the President of the United States, Donald Trump. Good evening, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good evening.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Well, first of all, let me say that we are delighted to have you on "Justice"" tonight and there is so much breaking news now. The democrat memo just came out. And of f course
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well all you do is you see this Adam Schiff, he has a meeting, and he leaves the meeting, and he calls up reporters and then all of a sudden they have news, you are not supposed to do that. It's probably illegal to do it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He'll have a committee meeting and leak all sorts of information and you know, he's a bad guy. But certainly -- the memo was a nothing. It confirmed basically if you look at it -- it confirmed -- I watched Miss Herridge, who's fantastic, on your show just before, and I will tell you that was really just a confirmation of - if you call it the republican memo or Nunes memo, it's referred to as a lot of things -- but that was nothing but a confirmation. And a lot of bad things happened on the other side. Not on this side, but the other side --
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> And you know what's interesting --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- and somebody should look into it. Because what they did is really fraudulent and somebody should be looking into that. And by somebody, I'm talking about you know who.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> I have a feeling I know who it is, Mr. President. Look, one of the things I thought was interesting -- so here we have the democrat memo and thank you for complementing Catherine Herridge, she's right next to me, she's right next to me. She'll be on in a moment. We love Catherine Herridge. But for --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well she is able to take -- you know Jeanine, she's able to take a very complex document and very systematically, you know -- essentially say the truth.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Well she drills it down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- and that document was really, it really verifies and a lot of bad things in that document. That document really verifies the Nunes memo. And that's why they didn't push hard to have it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you notice -- they did not push it hard because they understood this was going to happen. And just in look around and seeing reports, a lot of people are saying that. That's a very bad document for their side.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Well in addition to that, Mr. President, you know after 18 months, not any kind of reference to any collusion. But I have to tell you with Adam Schiff just tweeted --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the way, that is true, Jeanine. You have all these committees, everybody's looking. There is no collusion. No phone calls - I had no phone calls, no meetings, no nothing. There is no collusion. I say it all the time. Anybody that asks. There is no collusion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was - you know -- I don't want sound braggadocious, I was a far better candidate, she was not a good candidate. She went to the wrong states. She didn't go to Michigan enough. She didn't go to Wisconsin at all. She didn't do a good job in North Carolina. She did a poor job in Ohio and a poor job in Pennsylvania and you can add Florida into the mix. And you know, frankly, that's what it was all about. It was nothing to do with Russians.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Well, clearly -- I think all the evidence points in that, but Adam Schiff has just seconds ago tweeted: "Wait a minute
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> I guess you - you got him in the gut there. What do you say to that, Mr. President?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I would say sort of all of those. But look he was just -- need intelligence that brings our nation together. And a lot of people are tearing our nation apart on this and other subjects. They are tearing our nation apart.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I have to tell you, every time the folks over in Moscow, the Russians as he likes to call them, every time they watch, every time they see him and others get on and do what he did, he got scammed by somebody pretending to be a Russian.Donald Trump
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And your Senator Warner got scammed also. It's okay for them to be dealing, but if we have any kind of a contact with anybody, even though it has nothing to do with anything important, it's a big deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But Senator Warner, he got scammed and if you look at Adam Schiff, last week, two weeks ago-he got by somebody and that was fine. And he spoke to this person. Thought he was a Russian. But it didn't work out that way, he wasn't a Russian. So we have to bring country together, Jeanine.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And what's happening is this and other things are ripping it apart and it's been this way for a long time. This isn't just over the last year when I've been here -- it was terrible during the Obama administration.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the way I have to say, Obama was the president during all of this meddling or whatever you want to call it with Russians and others possibly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But Obama was the president. He's the one that was supposed to take care of this and he didn't. Nobody brings that up. He was warned and he didn't which makes it even worse. But he was the president during this period of time, during the entire period of time and he did nothing about.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So somebody should -- and I have to say, a lot of the fair people, and people frankly love my administration, they bring it up all the time, but Obama was the president.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He did nothing about it. With all of that being said, we have to come together as a nation. And we have to get it done. A lot of great things are happening. Our economy is incredible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm renegotiating trade deals. There are no trade deals ever negotiated that have been bad like the trade deals we've had negotiated whether it's NAFTA, the deal with South Korea, TPP -- I was able to keep us out of that, that would have been a total disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The World Trade Organization deal, that's what really led to the emergence of China -- you look at China, they became rich when they made the World Trade Deal. The World Trade Organization, WTO. We have to change it. We can't allow our workers, our country, our companies to be ripped off like this, and they understand that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that's why they are starting to move back into the United States. Chrysler's coming back, Foxconn is coming in, the big company that makes the Apple, different things for Apple. Some of the biggest companies in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are coming back into our country because of what I'm doing. But we have to come together, Jeanine as a nation. And we shouldn't be fighting like this. We should all be on the same team. That includes Adam Schiff - we should all be on the same team. They shouldn't have two sides fighting, all the time -- fighting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We should all come together as a nation. With that being said, I have to add one thing. Congressman Nunes, if this continues to go forward, I think some day he's going to be greatly honored for his service and for what he's done.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He has been very, very brave in the face of a lot of obstacles. What he found out has been incredible. I give him tremendous credit. But I have to say this. We have to come together as a nation.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> You know Mr. President, your approval rating is soaring. And you know, we can talk about the economy and a low unemployment and the stock market and all of the great things that have been happening the economy, but you have accomplished all of this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And by the way, there is a poll that puts you at 50 percent -- At CPAC you were 93 percent approval rating. You did all this in one year with the economy. To what do you attribute these incredible advances?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I have had a lot of good ideas and I have a lot of energy. I get things done. I'm very proud of what happened with the economy. If they would have gone with other direction -- in the other direction, they would not have gotten rid of regulations.
<Jeff Glor> <Positive> You say you agree with U.S. intelligence that Russia meddled in the election in 2016.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I really believe that while the tax cuts are the biggest ever, there has been no bill like that - that's including ANWR and including getting rid of the individual mandate, which is the worse thing going on Obamacare and healthcare is starting to really come along now well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're going to see premiums start to drop. But with all of that being said, I think regulation -- the cutting of regulations is what has given us as you know the tax cuts just happened a fairly short while ago. I have been cutting regulations now for over a year substantially.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Only unnecessary regulations. But you couldn't build, you couldn't do anything. Look at the pipe lines. If you look at the Keystone Pipeline, if you look at the Dakota Access Pipeline, Jeanine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> 48,000 jobs -- they were dead; and I approved them at the beginning of my administration and environmentally superior. Because you are underground as opposed to trucking and all the things you have to do to get the product to the various coasts to where it's going to the refineries.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's been an incredible period. I was saying before and somebody readily agreeing with me, I don't think any administration has done as much as we've done in the first year, I don't think it's even close, between the taxes, the regulations, Justice Gorsuch, many district judges and many court of appeal judges.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And many more to go. We have great judges literally just waiting. We have a tremendous problem with Senator Schumer where he's not approving people that are working in the administration. It's unprecedented.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have hundreds of people who have taken so long to get approved and we have people who are still waiting to get approved in the trade groups and - you know, very important groups, Jeanine. The democrats - I mean the one thing democrats are incredible at is obstruction - the one thing they're incredible at -- they use it. They resist. And really, it's just bad for the country.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> It's very bad.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So hopefully that can get done and hopefully we can get DACA done. I would like to do that for the Hispanics out there. You know I did very well with the Hispanics, much better than anyone would have thought. I'm the one that's pushing DACA and the democrats are nowhere to be found.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah and I've said that before, Jeff. I have said that numerous times before, and I would say that is true, yeah.
<Jeff Glor> <Negative> But you haven't condemned Putin, specifically. Do you hold him personally responsible?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I would, because he's in charge of the country. Just like I consider myself to be responsible for things that happen in this country. So certainly as the leader of a country you would have to hold him responsible, yes.
<Jeff Glor> <Neutral> What did you say to him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very strong on the fact that we can't have meddling, we can't have any of that, now look. We're also living in a grown up world. Will a strong statement, you know, President Obama supposedly made a strong statement, nobody heard it, what they did hear is the statement he made to Putin's very close friend. And that statement was not acceptable. Didn't get very much play relatively speaking. But that statement was not acceptable. But I let him know we can't have this, we're not going to have it, and that's the way it's going to be.
<Jeff Glor> <Negative> But he denies it, so if you believe US intelligence agencies, is Putin lying to you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to get into whether or not he's lying. I can only say that I do have confidence in our intelligence agencies as currently constituted. I think that Dan Coats is excellent, I think that Gina is excellent. I think we have excellent people in the agencies. And when they tell me something it means a lot.
<Jeff Glor> <Negative> Coats says the threat is ongoing. Do you agree with that?
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Well what's amazing is that you know, they continue to try to promote their narrative. But I wanted to ask you about something you talked about at CPAC yesterday, that was very well received. And that has to do with -- in the wake of the Parkland, Florida school shooting. You talked about expanding background checks on guns.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> How do you think that's going to happen?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I think it is going to happen. I think we have tremendous support. You know, the Republican party has really come together. It's become very unified. You see that also with the poll, I think that was one of the straw poll questions that were asked and at the CPAC which was a tremendous conference, by the way. Tremendously successful.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it was about the whole thing, the party coming together. And it really is, it's really coming together. I have spoken to many senators and congressmen today, yesterday, the day before, and I think we're going to have a great bill put forward very soon having to do with background checks, having to do with getting rid of certain things and keeping other things, and perhaps we'll do something on age, because --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Jeanine Pirro
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- it doesn't seem to make sense that you have to wait until you are 21 years old to get a pistol, but to get a gun like this maniac used in the school, you get that at 18. That doesn't make sense. Frankly, I explained that to the NRA. They are great people. Wayne and Chris and all of them - they are great patriots. These are great people. But I said fellas, we have to get going on some really good legislation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd accept, I mean he's an expert. This is what he does. He's been doing a very good job. I have tremendous faith in Dan Coats. And if he says that, I would accept that. I will tell you, though, it better not be. It better not be.
<Jeff Glor> <Neutral> Have you talked to Coats since you got back?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I have, sure.
<Jeff Glor> <Neutral> What'd he say?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, just talked, generally speaking. Yeah, he, he agrees with the statement you made. And I go along with him. He's a very, he's a great guy. He's a great patriot. He loves his country. And he's only going to say what he truly believes. And the information that's given to him is that.
<Jeff Glor> <Positive> Do you think any intelligence agencies, U.S. intelligence agencies, are out to get you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, certainly in the past, it's been terrible. You look at Brennan, you look at Clapper, you look at Hayden, you look at Comey, you look at McCabe, you look at Strzok and his lover, Lisa Page. You look at other people in the F.B.I. that have been fired, are no longer there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Certainly I can't have any confidence in the past. But I can have a lot of confidence in the present and the future, because it's getting to be now where we're putting our people in. But in the past, no, I have no confidence in a guy like Brennan. I think he's a total low-life. I have no confidence in Clapper. You know, Clapper wrote me a beautiful letter when I first went to office, and it was really nice.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then, all of a sudden, he's gone haywire because they got to him and they probably got him to say things that maybe he doesn't even mean. But no, I certainly don't have confidence in past people. You look at what's happened. Take a look at all of the shenanigans that have gone on. Very hard to have confidence in that group.
<Jeff Glor> <Positive> On Saturday you told us your doctrine is strength.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So background checks will be very important. At the same time, there's is no bigger champion for the Second Amendment than I am. I am the champion of the Second Amendment.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Well I don't think there's any question about that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we need protection. You have to have protection. You see what happened with the police officers that didn't have the guts to go in. Now it turns out I guess there was four of them.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> Four of them. That's my -- that's my open tonight.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Incredible. If we would have had some great teachers that were gun adept -- meaning really understood weaponry and guns, and if they had concealed permits, you wouldn't have this problem today. You just wouldn't have it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know, they have one other thing. They love those children. The teachers. They love those children. That coach that was so brave who ran into gunfire to protect the kids -- if he had his gun concealed, if he had gun, he would've been - he'd be alive today. Most of the people -- it would be a whole different story.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But he would have been shooting instead of running into someone totally unarmed who was a maniac. So you know, there is a lot of good things happening, Jeanine. We're going to get it stopped.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The one big thing is when these crazy people, who are cowards, when they hear or know that randomly you will have maybe 20 percent of the teachers, 15 percent of the teachers inside having concealed, and these are experts at what we are talking about, they will never go into the building. You're are never going to have this problem.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Strength.
<Jeff Glor> <Positive> And achieving peace through strength.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Jeff Glor> <Negative> After Helsinki, Lindsey Graham said you showed weakness. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Lindsay, you know, you're gonna have to -- let -- lemme just --
<Jeff Glor> <Negative> Newt Gingrich said it was the most serious mistake in your presidency.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I totally disagree. I think I did great at the news conference. I think it was a strong news conference. You have people that said, "You shoulda gone up to him. You shoulda walked up and started screaming in his face." We're living in the real world. OK?
<Jeff Glor> <Negative> Who gives you the best advice? When you come back and you read all these stories, you said, you know, what the fuss is all about. Who, who do you talk to?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I -- I will tell you, I don't know what the fuss is all about. I think we did extremely well. And I think the press makes up the, look, it's fake news. And people understand. I think the press largely makes up a lot of the fuss about a lot of things. And I'm not talking about everything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know, we have certain states that do this and nobody talks about them, but it's been very successful. But he would never have run into the building if he thought that bullets were going to come flying back into him. In fact he left the building pretending he was a student.Donald Trump
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> Right, right. And you know, the shame of it all, Mr. President, and I know you have to go. But the idea of those with mental illnesses, describing -- and psychiatric problems is something that we really have to deal with because I think one of the common threads of all of these shooters is that they are you know mentally deficient, wackadoodles, nuts, evil --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true. Well that would be part of the background checks. We would have a very, very hard section and we would - we would have a section on - a very powerful section mental illness. And somebody who is mentally ill should not have a weapon, should not have a gun.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And that would be covered in the background checks. I think the NRA will be for it. I think that a lot of people - I mean this certainly should be bipartisan. But we are drawing up strong legislation right now having to do with background checks, mental illness. I think you will have tremendous support. It's time. It's time.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> It is. It is.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's been many years. You know, I'm not here that long in tall fairness. You have had this going on for a long time. It's time to get it done and get it done right. But they have to know, that if they go into a school with bad intentions, there are big consequences.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's not going to be like the was for this guy, where after he was finished, he walks out with the other students pretending he's a student. and got away except for one very great policeman that in a different town fairly far away --
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- he said I think this is the guy they are looking for and he nabbed him, pretty good job. I mean in all fairness that man did a great job.
<Josh Smith> <Positive> ...[in progress] to thank you very much for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's crazy. You do something that's positive, and they try and make it as negative as possible. Not all. And I have to say this, some of the most honorable people I know, some great people, are reporters, journalists, et cetera. But the level of dishonesty in your profession is extremely high.
<Jeff Glor> <Neutral> But they -- we -- they -- the -- the press covered the substance and the wording of that press conference accurately.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't care what they covered. They don't, they didn't cover my meeting. The important thing, frankly, was the meeting that lasted for two and a half hours, or almost two and a half hours. And in that meeting, we discussed many, many things that were very, very positive for both countries.
<Jeff Glor> <Positive> What tangibly emerged from that conversation? What, what do you feel you achieved?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we achieved a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Things emerged out that were very important. Nuclear proliferation between Russia and the United States, that's 90 percent of the nuclear weapons. Protection of Israel. He feels good about that, I feel good about that, very good about that. That was a big factor.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We talked about North Korea. He said he will help. He agrees with what I'm doing. He thinks I'm doing a great job with respect to North Korea. He said he would help. I think he will. Let's see what happens.
<Jeff Glor> <Neutral> How? How --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, they have a lot of border. They have 25 miles of border right on North Korea. So having that assurance, I think means quite a bit. There were many other things we talked about. But I thought it was a very good. It was about two and a half hours. And I thought it was a very good meeting, very good.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Well there are some unsung heroes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they have to know there are consequences -- if they go into a school, you know, gun-free zone is just - that's like target practice for these guys. They see that and that's what they want, it's very dangerous. Gun-free zones are very dangerous because bad guys loved gun-free zones, Jeanine.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Yeah, yeah. Let me ask you one more thing. You talked about adding $700 billion to the military.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> And I think you said yesterday it was going to hell - something like that. I know that you support the military and you are giving them the resources they need. Are we going to have a parade?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I would like to have a parade. A lot of the generals would like to have a parade to celebrate what we are doing. You know, our military was very depleted. It was going in the wrong direction and I want to have by far the most of powerful military in the world. I want it to be more powerful than we've ever had it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we need that today Jeanine. I see what's going on, better than anybody, I see what's going on in the world. The world is a tough place, and we want to be stronger than we ever were. As you know, just recently I got a budget. I would have loved to have cut the budget, but we need -- our military's has been so badly hurt for so many years even beyond President Obama.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean it's been hurt for many, many years and depleted. We had sequester, which is a disaster. And I got $700 billion and $716 billion next year. That will rebuild our military. We'll have a tremendous updated, the top of the line, there will be nothing like it. We need that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But to get that, I was forced to give democrats, you know, many billions of dollars for things that it would normally not have done. You know, they don't care so much about the military. Sadly. They don't care so much about people pouring across the border -- MS-13.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Josh Smith> <Neutral> We have just a few questions.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good. Sure.
<Josh Smith> <Positive> First of all, you are at Johnson City tonight to support Republicans across Tennessee --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Correct.
<Josh Smith> <Neutral> -- mostly Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She is a fantastic woman. Marsha, I've known her for a long time. As you know, I've been in Tennessee a lot. We won by a lot, I think 26 or 28 points, and Marsha has been there for so long with us, and she's going to help us so much, we need the votes, because if you look at what they're doing in the Supreme Court, if you look at what they're doing to us on trade, the other side, meaning, they want, literally, bad trade deals, they want open borders.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Crime pours in. She will be incredible. She will be a tremendous, solid vote for us and it's very important, and her opponent would be a disaster for us. He'd always vote with Schumer and Pelosi and Maxine Waters, and that group, and they'll never be a time when he votes for us.
<Josh Smith> <Neutral> This is a tight race in Tennessee, which is probably a Republican state that voted for you.
<Emerald Robinson> <Positive> Thank you Mr. President.
<Jeff Glor> <Positive> How do you think he can help specifically on North Korea?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well for one thing, at the border. We don't want anything going in. We hope we have a deal. I think we have a deal. There's no rush, to be honest with you. There are no missiles going off. We have our hostages back. No testing. There's no nuclear testing. So we've come a long way in a short period of time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So there is no rush. But what there is something we would like to see that the denuclearization of North Korea, he feels strongly about it, I feel strongly about it. And that's good. I was not sure how he was going to react to that, but we had a very good discussion, and a long discussion on that.
<Jeff Glor> <Positive> I do want to ask you, sir. You said you'll sit with the special counsel before. Has anything changed in the past six months to change your mind?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, my lawyers are working on --
<Jeff Glor> <Negative> More or less likely to?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There's no collusion. I didn't deal with Russia. I had nothing to do with Russia with respect to my race. I won that race rather easily. And I can tell you that I think, frankly, 2020, I think it's going to be even better than we did in '16.
<Jeff Glor> <Negative> But would you, are you more likely to sit an interview now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> My lawyers are working on that. I've always wanted to do an interview, because look, there's been no collusion. There's been no talk of Russia. There's been no phone call. There's been nothing. And it's I call it a witch hunt. That's exactly what it is. It's a -- it's a vicious witch hunt. And you know what? It's very bad for our country. Very, very bad for our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're not worried about MS-13, if anything they want to protect MS-13.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Sanctuary.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And these where vicious people. By the way, these aren't people who use guns. These are people that like using knives because it's more painful.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Yeah, I know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we've gotten thousands of them -- literally thousands, you know that out of the country and put them in jail and out of the country. But we need the wall. We need border security, and we have to stop MS-13 and a lot of really bad people, and drugs from pouring into our country. And you see the numbers. We've stopped - I mean the numbers are way down from what they were.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Oh yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But that's not good enough. We can't - we have to stop them all, it's not good enough. So we're going have tremendous border security - that's part of what we --
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> -- and you're going to do that with a wall? When are we getting the wall?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- want right now.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> When are we getting the wall?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yup.
<Josh Smith> <Negative> Why do you think this is such a close race at this point?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I just think, probably, when they get to know Marsha -- you know she was always from a certain area. But she's a Tennessee person. She loves this state, she loves the people of the state. And, also, he was known, he was pretty well known. When you take a look at your Second Amendment, he'll do damage that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You take a look at trade, he'll do tremendous damage to that. Raise your taxes, she's going to lower taxes. We're going to be lowering taxes again. So really, Marsha, will be -- I think she's just going to be outstanding, and she's a good person.
<Josh Smith> <Neutral> Mr. President, today you announced the new trade deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Josh Smith> <Neutral> He did it from the Rose Garden.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Josh Smith> <Positive> Right after your announcement, Senator Lamar Alexander said that he had concerns about ongoing tariffs, and the impact on Tennessee, and specifically the automobile industry. For Tennesseeans tonight, why is this new deal a good thing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Emerald Robinson> <Positive> Clearly, we're here to talk midterm, so we'll just get right into it. The Kavanaugh process has really energized your base. McConnell feels very confident about the Senate, but the House is really the big question here. Do you think you can keep the House? Break that curse?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do think so. There's an energy -- you've seen the rallies. These rallies are getting -- I'm getting the kind of numbers that we got in '16, maybe more in a certain way. There's a tremendous energy from the Republicans. Perhaps there is from the Democrats. I don't see that. And I think you could have a very interesting day on November 6. I think it's going to be a very interesting time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, we're -- we're having -- we're having tremendous outpouring of love and energy and everything else that you want. So I think we're going to do very well. I think we're going to do extremely well with the Senate. We have races that we weren't even going to contest, numerous of them, as you know, and now we're actually leading in many of those races.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> These were spots, I won't use name,s but these were spots that we weren't really looking to fight, because we thought they wouldn't, you know, be won. I think that Justice Kavanaugh had a big impact.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think my rallies have a big impact, to be honest with you, because there's a lot of love in those rallies, a lot of a lot of action going on. And -- but a lot of things are happening. I think we're going to do very well with the Senate. The House has so many.
<Emerald Robinson> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think we're going to do very well with the House. I really do.
<Emerald Robinson> <Negative> Well, in talking about what it comes down to the midterms, Newt Gingrich said this week it's Kavanaugh, and it's caravan. Well, Kavanaugh you've gotten through. This caravan though, you've had some big news on that as well, today. It looks like they're turning around. Can you fill us in on that? You sent Pompeo down there. Is this because of what he did?
<Jeff Glor> <Neutral> Let me ask you about 2020.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Jeff Glor> <Negative> Who do you think your Democratic opponent will be? Joe Biden says he'll make a decision by January.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I dream, I dream about Biden. That's a dream. Look, Joe Biden ran three times. He never got more than 1 percent and President Obama took him out of the garbage heap, and everybody was shocked that he did. I'd love to have it be Biden. I think I'd like to have any one of those people that we're talking about... You know, there's probably – the group of seven or eight right now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd really like to – I'd like to run against any one of them, but Biden never by himself could never do anything. President Obama took him, made him vice president and he was fine. But you go back and look at how he succeeded in running, when he ran two or three times, I don't think he ever break -- broke one. He was at the one or less level, 1 percent or less level.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well we're going to get the wall. The democrats have actually agreed to that. But I have to get more. We need other things. We need something to do with chain migration and something to do with Visa lottery. I mean we actually have lottery systems where you go to countries and they do lotteries for who comes into the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, you know they are not going to have their best people in the lottery, because they're not going to put their best people in a lottery. They don't want to have their good people to leave. So we get these people, and then you'll have like the incident like we had on the Westside Highway --
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> -- in New York --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- where this guy who comes in through chain migration and Visa lottery -- runs over and kills 8 people and badly injures. You know nobody talks about all of the people, whether it's the school, or on the Westside Highway -- people that go out to put themselves in shape and they end up losing legs and arms.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody ever talks about the people who are so horribly hurt and injured. But this guy runs his truck into people. Killed eight people and injured many and he came in through the system.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't want that. I want people to come in ultimately -- we want people to come in through merit and you know, we're going to need merit. We need people to come into our country because we have so many companies now moving in because of the regulations and because of what we did with the massive tax cut, which is great for the companies and they are going to hire the people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Then we're going to need people to take care of the companies. So -- but we want people based on merit. Not based on the fact they are thrown into a bin and many of those people are not the people you want in the country, believe me.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> Well clearly. Clearly. And if we were to have a parade -- I'm stuck on the parade -- when do you think we can have this parade? Because I want to go, my kids wanna go --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We are talking about probably Veterans Day, it's preliminarily, you know, being discussed. But we're talking about probably Veterans Day. I like July 4 because July 4 in Washington D.C. would be beautiful.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's a great thing, and I'm not using tariffs. I used tariffs to get the deal, because if they weren't willing to make a deal, as an example, of Mexico or Canada, then I would have used tariffs. But we're not going to need tariffs now, because we were able to make the deal. So we're not doing tariffs with respect to this, other than we use it as a negotiating point.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now I can say it. Frankly, if we didn't make the deal, I would have used tariffs, because it's a far greater, better thing than what was happening, because NAFTA was a disaster for our country. We lost millions of jobs, we lost thousands of companies. And I would not have allowed that to happen. So we essentially, we're terminating NAFTA.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have a new trade deal that's going to be incredible for Tennessee. It's going to be fair. It's going to be a fair deal. You know, NAFTA was a one-sided, horrible deal. It was good for Canada, good for Mexico, bad for us. So Tennessee is doing well, anyway, with all of our economic policies. But this is the capper.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is the thing that really will put it into a league that will be pretty much unsurpassed.
<Josh Smith> <Positive> You spoke very vehemently in support of Judge Kavanaugh today in the White House Rose Garden. Has there been any update that you're aware of the FBI investigation today?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, nothing that I know now. But I will say the FBI is doing pretty much as the Senate wants, and we want to know everything. He's a fine man. He's had a great, incredible career. He was a top student, top intellect. The kind of guy you want. People are really loving everything, except for the way he's being treated so badly by the Democrats.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, so badly. It's -- it's a very unfair situation. So, we think he's going to be in good shape, but we like the idea of the FBI looking for the seventh time -- this is number seven by the way. This is the seventh time they will have looked. And we think that he's going to be in great shape, and hopefully in the very near future they'll take a final vote.
<Josh Smith> <Negative> You've named names when it came to people in the Senate who were questioning him today. What do Americans need to take from your approach to that news conference today where you called people out?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I did. I did. The Secretary of State, and I think they are turning around, and we told Guatamala, where we give millions and millions of dollars, and El Salvador, and we told Honduras, that people seem to be coming from those three countries, mostly now. And we said, you can't do. We're not going to give you aid.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you do that, we're just not giving you aid. You just can't do it. And they've -- they're trying very hard. I really believe that they are, and that made an impact. And Mexico has been excellent, and Mexico is working with us, and we want to stop this. This is not -- it's not acceptable for us. And if that doesn't work, we're going to call out the military, we're going to close up the border.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're just going to close it up, because we can't have people coming in like this. So we will close up our border. And it's all because the Democrats refuse to give us laws that work. We have laws that were made by idiots. We have laws that were made that are -- that are beyond anybody's comprehension. The whole world is laughing at these laws.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Catch and release. Visa lottery, where we take people through a lottery system, and you know who's going into the lottery. They're not giving us their finest. And, you just look at it. Chain migration. So somebody comes in, and all of a sudden you bring 24, 28, 32, people with that person. It's crazy. So we're going to have a change, and the Democrats have to do it. And I think it's going to cost them very big in the election.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When you see a caravan like that, thousands of people coming up -- now we think we're going to have it stopped. It's going to be stopped one way or the other. They might as well turn around, because it's going to be stopped one way or the other. But the Democrats should change these laws. We have it all done.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's beautiful what we have and what we've proposed, but we need their votes. That's why the elections are important, because we have majorities but they're tiny -- we don't have enough votes. In the Senate, we need 60 votes. Well, we're nine short, and if don't have 60, you're not going to do it. So we don't have the votes. That's why the election is so important.
<Emerald Robinson> <Negative> Jim Jordan says that this caravan moving points to the fact that you need more border security. Kevin McCarthy has a proposal out for funding the wall. They're saying you're gearing up for a big fight after the midterms, at the end of the year on getting that border wall funding. And what your voters do want to know is, are you going to get your border wall? Where is it out right now? And how is that going to happen?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, we've already started the wall. We have a billion six, another billion six, and a third billion six coming, but we want to do it all at one time. We want to get it built immediately, so we don't have the problems that we have for many, many years. And, you know, the Democrats in 2006, they voted for a border wall.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They all believed in a border wall, and they voted for it. And frankly, it's a disgrace. It's really a shame that our country has to go through this. But it doesn't matter. One way or the other, we're going to have that strong border. We're going to have a border wall too.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But the border wall's already started, and in fact, now we say, finish the wall, finish the wall, because we've got big sections in San Diego and lots of other areas.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It would be down -- up and down Pennsylvania Avenue. A lot of it would be fly-overs. I was at the Bastille Day Parade in France with the president of the France, very good guy.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> Oh, OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it was quite something and frankly, I think it's great for spirit. The military loves it, they love the idea. We would have West point and Annapolis, and the Air Force Academy, Coast Guard Academy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it would just be a great representative parade. It would have a lot of plane fly-overs, I think it would be great for the spirit of the country, you know? We have a great country and we should be celebrating our country. So, we'll see if we can do it at a reasonable cost.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And if we can't, we won't do it. But the generals would love to do it, I can tell you, and so would I. I think it's great for our country in terms of being a cheerleader and the spirit. It's very important. Hello?
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> Mr. President?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes?
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> Oh, I'm sorry I didn't hear you. Let me ask you finally -- the mainstream media, they don't seem to be ending their attacks on you, and yet as your approval rating is soaring and as you do -- make all these accomplishments. Do you think at some point they will have to give in?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think what they're going to do is six months before the election in 2020, they're going to all endorse me and they're going to be so nice. Because if they don't have me, their ratings are going to die and they're all going to go out of business. OK, you know?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I did call people -- you look at Blumenthal, where he was a person that said he went to Vietnam, and he was a great war hero. He was never in Vietnam, and yet he's standing up there saying we want honesty, we want all sorts of things, all good things. But you take a look, he talks about transparency.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, here's a guy who literally for 15 years talked about the fact that he was a great hero in the Vietnam War, that comrades died alongside of him. He was never in Vietnam. And then he's talking about, we want honesty. Cory Booker, who was a disgraceful mayor at Newark, New Jersey. He ran it into the ground.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And take a look what he said when he wrote stories when he was in high school and college about his relationship to women. Just take a look at what he said. You know what I'm talking about. Or take Dianne Feinstein, where she holds this letter and everything, all information. She holds till after everything's finished, and then she brings it in at the last moment and then they complain they need more time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is dishonest stuff. So we think it's going to be fantastic. I can tell you, the people of Tennessee love our very conservative Supreme Court justice.
<Josh Smith> <Negative> Final question. Is there anything the FBI could tell you at this point would cause you to rescind your nomination of Brett Kavanaugh?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well look, if they come in with something negative, I don't expect that. He's had an unblemished 30, 35 years, he's been a top, top judge, highly respected. People thought he'd be a Supreme Court judge for the last 10 years. He was meant for it. He was number one at Yale, I believe. He was number one at Yale Law School, or right up there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it was actually number one. And, he's a great student. He's a very, very -- I feel, he's a very compassionate guy. What they did to him, and what they did to his family, what they did to his daughters, the things they said, it's just a disgrace, and they shouldn't be allowed to get away with it.
<Emerald Robinson> <Neutral> A couple of quick questions to wrap it up.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Emerald Robinson> <Positive> Okay. Just two quick, if we can had some timely news topics.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure.
<Emerald Robinson> <Neutral> U.N. Ambassador. Any -- any name you have now --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have five people that I really like a lot. I'll make a decision over the next week or so.
<Emerald Robinson> <Neutral> North Korea, date for a second summit?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's going to be after -- we want to have that meeting, both of us. That's going to be right after the midterms. Sometime after the midterms, and we're doing really well in North Korea. You know --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They get good ratings because of whatever's going on -- I mean because of me. And I think what happens is I'm sure they'll all endorse - you know I'm being a little sarcastic when I say that.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I expect them all to endorse me and cherish me right up until that point and then probably after I win they will go after me again. But their ratings are good. I will say -- FOX ratings are phenomenal. CNN has not been doing well. MSNBC is now in second place over CNN.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But FOX is beating everybody. And you people have been very fair. Not good, you've been very fair to me, that's all I asked for is fairness. Now, I call it fake news. There is so much fake news, Jeanine, it's just incredible.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> It is, it is. And finally, Ivanka -- Ivanka, have you heard from her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have. She is working hard. She is doing a great job. You know Ivanka very well. There is no better representative that we can have go over to a pretty tough place right now in the world in South Korea. She is over at the Olympics and she is with the president of South Korea.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Right
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have North Korea surrounding her, it's a very interesting situation. So I have spoken to her. We cannot have a better, smarter representative.
<Josh Smith> <Neutral> Do you have any idea when you'll hear the results of the investigation?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think pretty soon. I think it's going to move along quickly. We want to move it along quickly. They want to take a vote, and hopefully get them approved. We did Neil Gorsuch, and that was tough, but not like this. Nothing's been like this. Nobody's ever seen anything -- this is just people that want to obstruct, the Democrats, they want to obstruct.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They want to resist. They run on resist, just resist. They resist everything. And, a lot of bad people, when you look at what they did and what they're doing to that family, of a man who's a highly distinguished man, who's had a tremendous career. It's very sad actually.
<Josh Smith> <Negative> What are you going to tell this crowd, that you are being pulled [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we have a very big crowd. I was told they have, like, tens of thousands of people that can't get in, and I'm going to tell them I love this state, and that Marsha Blackburn will be a great senator. She'll be a great -- she's a professional. She's a great person, and she'll always give us the vote because, you know, Tennessee likes what I'm doing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you see what I'm doing. Even with the trade deal that was announced with Mexico and Canada. This is a great deal for this state, you know, for Tennessee, for the country. But she's going to be a vote for us, and Bredesen will never be voting for us. He's going to vote the way Schumer wants, he's going to be voting the way Nancy Pelosi wants.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We don't want that. That's not what we want. We have to have somebody that takes our agenda, because we really have a tiny majority. But literally, I would say, it's a majority of -- if somebody has a cold, if somebody is not feeling well, you don't take the vote. You know, we have one person missing, and it's -- we have to wait around.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We need more people. And she will be a great, great senator.
<Josh Smith> <Positive> President Trump, thank you for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How you guys doing? You're O.K.?
<Peter Baker> <Positive> We're good. How are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very good. We had a busy day.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Positive> I can imagine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, we just had, this is from, they just delivered that to me from President Xi. You'll get a transcript of the meeting. The press was here. A lot of the press was here. A nice letter. They have a nice way of giving letters. But we're doing very successfully.
<Peter Baker> <Positive> So you had the meeting today with the vice premier.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Emerald Robinson> <Positive> Okay
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've said it many times. No missiles. No rockets going around. No nuclear testing. We're doing very well. We have a good relationship with Kim Jong-un.
<Emerald Robinson> <Neutral> And final question, how is your golf game these days?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My golf is good, and this is one of the greatest places -- Arizona, what a great place to play. I'm a little busy to be playing golf, but what a great place to play. What a great state. And Martha McSally I think is going to do fantastically well. And last night, as you know, we were in a very beautiful part of the world, Montana. There was some crowd we had.
<Emerald Robinson> <Positive> Well thank you so much for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Emerald Robinson> <Positive> Thank you.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Well, Mr. President, I can't thank you enough for calling in to "Justice"". We are very honored that you did so. Congratulations on your approval ratings
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I love your viewers, I want to tell -- you do and I do too. And congratulations on your success, because I did look at your ratings over the last couple weeks and you are doing fantastically and so is our friend Watters.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Our "Watters World" man is doing great also
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. We're honored.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you very much.
<Josh Smith> <Positive> We really appreciate your time with local television as well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I appreciate it.
<Josh Smith> <Positive> Thank you sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Enjoy it.
<Peter Baker> <Negative> Do you feel like you got a deal, or close to a deal?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're getting closer. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. And we're going comprehensive. We're not just -- He announced that he was buying -- today -- a tremendous amount of soybeans and various farm products. And I think you'll be given that information in a little while, too. But he announced. What he did was the vice premier came in. He was here for two days having meetings.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's leaving tomorrow. They're meeting again now. And negotiations are going very well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That doesn't mean there are any guarantees. But I will say there's a very good feeling. There's a very good relationship. This is the letter. You can actually read it. This is the translated version. So you can get a print out of that. But that was given out, and it was also, I guess it was read. They had the interpreter read it.
<Peter Baker> <Positive> And do you feel like they're going to get a deal by March 1st? Would it take longer, do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's possible. It's a very short period of time for a deal this big. But it's very possible. But many of the points were agreed to. And some haven't been. I believe that a lot of the biggest points are going to be agreed to by me and him. In other words, they're just not going to be authorized to agree to certain things that you folks write about and read about -- intellectual property and lots of other things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I think that will be agreed to by me and him at the right time. Like when you make a big deal, or a big scoop, you have to approve that little thing. And I think they're probably waiting, they're waiting for me and him to sit down and agree on five points at the end, or 10 points at the end.
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> What would that be?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think control is very important. I think the checking to make sure that -- we're putting in a very strong system of checks and balances so that when we make a deal we know that it's happening. In other words, that it's being followed. And we've asked for the most stringent controls on that, because there's been difficulty over the years with certain places.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And that's a very important element that's been agreed to. But you have to get it down in writing. You're going to have intellectual property. You're going to have theft, because so many things have been, in theory, done a little bit differently. And I think that in the end we're going to have something that's going to be very special, if it happens.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I could have had a deal done, if I wanted to make -- you know, most people thought it was going to be a deal where they buy a tremendous amount of corn and soybeans and that'll be it and everybody's happy and the farmers are happy. But he actually announced today -- I wish you were here, because it was sort of a great thing to watch.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The press was packed. A lot of Chinese press, too. And he announced that he's buying a massive amount of soybeans and various other farm products today. Starting immediately. And that's going to make a lot of farmers very happy. So you know, that was very nice.
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> Do you think it's possible that you might still go, even if you reach a deal on all of the points you're trying to reach, leave some of the tariffs on? Is that a possibility?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> Indefinitely left on?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Peter, without the tariffs, we wouldn't be talking. And I make this point clear to them. We've never had a deal with China. We've never had a trade deal with China. You have the World Trade Organization, which is a disaster for the United States. The World Trade Organization is probably the worst trade deal ever made with Nafta being second.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The World Trade Organization helped create China. If you look at China, it's flatlined. And from the day the World Trade Organization came into existence, it's a rocket ship. But just the opposite for the United States. That was a terrible deal for the United States and it was an unbelievably good deal for China.
<Peter Baker> <Positive> So some tariffs could remain permanent even with a good deal?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, sure. We have 25 percent now on $50 billion. And by the way, Peter, that's a lot of money pouring into our Treasury, you know. We never made 5 cents with China. We're getting right now 25 percent on $50 billion. And then I was putting 25 percent at a later date, which date came and went -- 25 percent or $200 billion.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> You've talked about the sacrifice that this has presented for yourself, for your family, being president. For your business. Could you ever see a point in the next year where you say, "You know what, I don't need to do this again, I don't need to run for re-election"?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't see it, because -- so I just gave you a list of a lot of the things we've done. And this list isn't even complete. I don't even know if you have it.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> No, I have it. I've got it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Just grab it. Reading material for the night. I've actually had, because they've done things that are artificial. So there's been more of a burden on me than other presidents.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Past presidents have done things that were artificial?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Past presidents, yeah. I think for the most part, yeah, past presidents. I really believe, when I say that we've accomplished -- when you look at that list, whether it's the biggest regulation cuts in history, that's one of the reasons the economy is doing well. Before the taxes, actually. But the tax cuts, but so many other things when you look at that and you go down the list: Veterans Choice, V.A. Choice.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They've been trying -- as long as you've been writing they've been trying to get V.A. Choice. And now I'm going to do Phase 2 on V.A. Choice, which is, you know, the next step. But the first step was just a massive step. Nobody thought it could be done.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> What's left? What do you have that you would want to -- why -- what's the goal for the next term?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think what we'll be focusing on will be national security, very much. So we've very largely -- we're in the process of rebuilding the military. Which was truly depleted.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> So, there is no scenario in which you'd say, "I've done what I can," right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because it's a very big job and there is a lot to do. And I would say that I would really start focusing -- you know, we've done a lot on health care, and people haven't given us too much credit. We have a lot of the different plans, the cooperative plans and other plans. Health care was terminated, and if the Obamacare were repealed and replaced -- except for John McCain, it would have been, you know, he campaigned against it for six years, and then when he had the chance, he went thumbs down at 2:00 in the morning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Um, but, I believe it's going to be terminated, whether it be through the Texas case, which is going through the court system as a victory right now, because of, you know, the various elements of that case, you would think it would have to be terminated. But a deal will be made for good health care in this country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's one of the things I'll be doing. National security is very important and we're fighting over -- a very important element is the southern border. When we talk about drugs coming from China, the fentanyl -- you look at the heroin and a lot of the other drugs, they come from -- 90 percent, more than 90 percent -- from right across the southern border.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And unlike what the Democrats say, they don't, you don't bring trucks of drugs through the checkpoints. You bring trucks of drugs by making a right 20 miles, and a left into the country. They're not bringing, you know, they bring massive amounts of drugs, and they do it because there's no barrier, there's no hardened wall that you can't knock down with your breath.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, Maggie, here's the bottom line: I love doing it. I don't know if i should love doing it, but I love doing it. We just had a deal —and I was so looking forward to introducing you because it was very impressive. You know the whole -- this room was totally, it was a sea of seats, we had the entire cabinet.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are very impressive people, and I had it all teed up and I said, "Where are they?" Right? I said, "Where the hell are they?"
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> We were in the security tent, sorry.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Anyway.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What I'm saying, there's a lot, there's always a lot to do, no matter how much you do. I've done a lot, and there's a lot to do.
<Peter Baker> <Positive> Do you think you'll have a Republican challenger for the nomination? Is that something you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't see it. You know, we've had polls as high as 93 percent. Which is the highest there is. Reagan was 86.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> W. was the only other one, right? George W. Bush?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Um --
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> They seemed higher --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> During, during a tiny little period, during the World Trade Center. That ended quickly.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Do you look at Larry Hogan? Or Bill Weld, has that crossed your mind --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. No. I have great support in the party. We have great support. I guess anything is possible. But look, we have among the highest polls -- and actually the highest polls -- but among the highest polls ever in the history of the Republican party. Democrats, I mean the Democrats, I'm watching what's going on. They've really drifted far left.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They may even be too left for you folks, you know. I'm not even sure. But they've gone pretty far out there. And, uh --
<Peter Baker> <Negative> Who do you think is their toughest candidate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, you never know that answer. You -- somebody that you think would be the least tough is the toughest. I would say, the best opening so far would be Kamala Harris [Note: he pronounced her first name 'Kameela']. I would say, in terms of the opening act, I would say, would be her. I think she probably --
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> What stood out to you about it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just think she seemed to have a little better opening act than others. I think.
<Peter Baker> <Positive> Incredible crowd.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A better crowd -- better crowd, better enthusiasm. Some of the others were very flat. I do think Elizabeth Warren's been hurt very badly with the Pocahontas trap. I think she's been hurt badly. I may be wrong, but I think that was a big part of her credibility and now all of a sudden, it's gone. And I may be wrong about that but, you know, I don't see it. Some -- you know, a lot of the folks have not decided to run yet.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They might not run.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Joe Biden?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't -- you know, I'd like to see him run. I'd like to see him run. Because you pit him, and -- you take what happened to Obama. When you look at my numbers, and you look how we've done for the economy, we had a news conference before, where we had a lot of workers behind us, manufacturers and workers from manufacturing plants, and it was really impressive to see what they've done.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they said, "Two years ago, we were dead," and now they're thriving. You know, we've created over 500,000 manufacturing jobs, and the previous administration lost 200,000 over eight years and said that was the magic wand. I believe, I believe, Peter, right? The magic wand to get manufacturing back. I mean, manufacturing jobs are great jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Those are high paying, great jobs, and they make things. It's a very important thing. So, I just think, I think when we have the lowest black unemployment ever —lowest Hispanic, you saw the Hispanic numbers. We were at, what, 19 points up? Where we have the lowest Asian. Where the women are the best in 52 years now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Where the unemployment numbers are the best in 51 years. Um, you know. That's a good record.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> Can I switch gears for a second? There's been a story in the news the last two weeks about your son-in-law's security clearance.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Did you tell General Kelly or anyone else in the White House to overrule security officials? The career veterans --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I don't think I have the authority to do that. I'm not sure I do.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> You do have the authority to do it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I wouldn't. I wouldn't do it.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> O.K.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Um, Jared is a good --
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> You never --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was never involved with the security. I know that he -- you know, just from reading -- I know that there was issues back and forth about security for numerous people, actually. But I don't want to get involved in that stuff.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> O.K. Why would you want to -- why stay out? You do have the authority to --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. I just don't -- I just, I never thought it was necessary. I also know him. He's a very solid person, and I just can't imagine he would have -- I guess even, Ivanka, they, they, I heard that, uh, something with Jared and Ivanka --
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> Mhm.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, uh, I don't believe I've ever met any of the national security -- of the people that would do clearances. Um, and there'd be nothing wrong, I don't think, with me calling them up to the Oval Office and say, "Hey give these people, you know, clearances" --
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> You just told me -- [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, yeah, so there, I, I mean, I take back the other -- I didn't, I was answering a little bit different question. Uh, I have the right to do it, but I never thought it was necessary, Maggie. I never thought it was necessary.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> And you didn't direct General Kelly or anyone like that to do it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. And, and frankly, I never thought it was necessary to do so.
<Rachel Campos-Duffy> <Positive> Why did you want to be the first sitting president to address the March?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I didn't do it for that reason. But, you know, a lot of groups are under siege in our country and they have been for a long time before I got here. You know, what was happening is things are changing too rapidly and not good. And so I saw them, they wanted me to make a tape that they play. And I've done it for three years now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I said, you know, I'm in Washington. Maybe I'll just instead of making a tape, I'll go over. Now, I didn't know it's was gonna be this big of a deal, but they have a lot of people out there and it turned out to be very successful, the most successful one by far.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I'll tell you a story that just happened. So it just happened. Will you get that thing we just sent out? Will you do that? I had a meeting -- and bring the picture in, bring the picture -- so I had a meeting with Gina who's very good and Coats. And I was shocked and I was surprised because I saw it on television and I said, "Iran is a bad actor because if you read what they said."
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> You mean you saw her testimony?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah. I said, "Iran is a bad actor." And I could tell you stories of things that we were going to do to them as recently as a week ago. I said, "Iran is a very bad actor. What's this like Iran is kindergarten stuff?" They said, "Sir, we never said it." I said, "What are you talking about?" Then I said, "And ISIS -- we almost have the caliphate 100 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What are you talking about?" Like ISIS has got -- and I mean, I'm not, by the way -- the defeat is an interesting word. Because you can say you have the caliphate, but you're always going to have people that escape the caliphate and you'll have people around. There's nothing -- but that doesn't mean you're going to keep your armies there and everything.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because you're always going to have that. Somebody is going to walk into a store unfortunately. But I said, "What is that all about? Second of all, third of all, you know how well we're doing with North Korea, what's that?" They said, "Sir, our testimony was totally mischaracterized." I said, "What are you talking about?" And when you read their testimony and you read their statements, it was mischaracterized by the media.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> The media mischaracterized it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what I mean. Because when you read their statement, it's not like it was portrayed in the media. Because I came in --
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> What did they think they were saying? What did they tell you that they were --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When you see what they said, and they're, they're -- let's put it this way. It was really very different when I read it. Because I came in here saying what is this? You mean you're -- because one of the things they said very strongly, according to, was that Iran is, essentially, a wonderful place. And I said, "It's not a wonderful place, it's a bad place, and they're doing bad things." And they said, "We agree." I said, "What do you mean you agree.
<Rachel Campos-Duffy> <Negative> Your administration just announced that they're going to challenge California over their abortion requirements and their insurance. Why did you make such a bold move? That's going to make a lot of people angry and, you know, Planned Parenthood is spend $45 million [Inaudible]?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we have a group of people that are just amazing and they've been with us and we've been with them. And we want to do what's right. We want to do what we feel is right.
<Rachel Campos-Duffy> <Negative> [Not on video. On Covington High School student Nicholas Sandmann returning to the March for Life on the anniversary of the confrontation at last year’s rally]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nicholas is a great young man and the Covington High School students were— they weren't causing any trouble. And you could see it was building and building and building … I hope he got a good settlement. Very unfair.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> But first, joining me live on the phone tonight, the President of the United States, Donald Trump. Good evening, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You can't agree —" And they said the testimony was totally mischaracterized.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> So you're happy with Dan Coats?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm happy with Dan Coats. I am. That doesn't mean --
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Is that a change?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, no, everybody changes. You know, this business, other than me, everybody changes. You know, if you look at my staff. So I wish you could have been here before. Because we had this whole side of the room with secretaries, every one of them. Sonny Perdue. Linda McMahon, big, a big sleeper, she's phenomenal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Somebody said, she's one of our best -- you know and you don't ever hear about her or anything. We had Mike Pompeo. We had all of our secretaries, many of our secretaries here, probably half of them. And then you had the China group over here, the delegation. And I'm looking and I'm saying these are really outstanding people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're outstanding. Did you notice that today? How outstanding? We have a lot of great people. Now I do tell the story about driving down Pennsylvania Avenue, you know. Because I'd been in Washington probably 17 times in my life. And on the 18th time, I was president of the United States. And you know, Washington wasn't really my place.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I didn't know people. I didn't know a lot of people. And I got -- I put some people in that I wasn't happy with and I put some people in that I was very happy with. But we've gotten it very -- you know, as I've -- now I know a lot of people.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> Do you ever -- and I want to go back to your point about military intervention in a second -- but do you have any thoughts about defense secretary and where that's getting in terms of --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I wasn't happy with Mattis. I told Mattis to give me a letter. He didn't just give me that letter. I told him. And you could have seen that on "60 Minutes." I did "60 Minutes" and Lesley Stahl asked me a question: "What do you think of General Mattis?"
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hello, Jeanine.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> All right, Mr. President, welcome to Justice. I saw yesterday, Good Friday, that you had Bishop Harry Jackson in the Oval Office. And you spent a great deal of time talking about religion. As you turn to reflection and prayer in your own relationship with God during this holy week, what is your prayer? And what is your message of faith for Americans?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I love the people of our country. And we are bringing our country back. I want to pay my deepest love and respect to all of the families and friends of those who perished so sadly. It was so incredible, how it came upon us, this invisible, I call it, this invisible enemy. And it’s just a terrible thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We were doing things that this country had never done before, in terms of our success. And now we’ll rebuild it again. We’re going to rebuild it again, in honor of all those who perished, Jeanine.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Well, you know, it’s Christians around the world, I mean, celebrate tomorrow, which will be the holiest day of the year for them, I mean, it is, it is the beginning, it is a new life for many Christians. I mean, do you see America coming to a point where when we do reopen it will be a renaissance for us as well?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think we have a really great chance of that. We’re working very hard with Congress on stimulus and taking care of our workers and taking care of people whose fault this was not. And we’re doing very well. The Paycheck Plan, as you know, is moving along quickly. That’s the workers of companies that -- we’re loaning money companies.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're able to pay their workers. It’s a thing that’s doing really well. And it’ll be very shortly a lot of money is going to be given to employees. We have to keep it all together. But a lot of things are happening. And I think the stimulus coupled with this pent-up demand and everybody wanting to get out and go back to work, I think we’re going to have just a tremendous surge.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it’s going to be like a rocket ship, I really believe that. We’ll have to see what happens. But there’s a lot of things happening. But you know, with all of that, we still have to remember all of the people that perished. We did it. We did it the right way. We took care of social distancing and all of the things, words that nobody ever heard before, frankly, and phrases.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> You called him a Democrat, didn't you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I said let me be generous. But I just -- I didn't like the job he was doing. I wasn't happy with it. I wasn't happy with the -- I got him more money than the military has ever seen before. And I wasn't happy with the job that he was doing at all. And I said it's time. That's why in the letter he wrote, "You have to have your own choice." The reason he said that was because I said, "You're just not my choice."
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Who is your choice then, sir?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have a lot of great people that want it. I also have somebody there who's really been very good. Pat, Pat Shanahan. He's acting. And he's been doing -- Maggie, he's been doing a great job. Yeaaaaah?
<Unidentified Aide> <Positive> You just have some important calls whenever you're finished.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> O.K., I'll be in in a little while. What's more important than The New York Times? Ok, nothing, nothing.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> We ask that of ourselves all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I'm sure you hear good things about him. He's a very solid guy. You know it's interesting, historically, you just never -- you rarely put a military person in, which surprises me. When I first got here, I said what do you mean? That's the natural of all naturals. Actually you need special approvals to put them in, you know, etc., etc.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Normally a business person goes in and I mean you have one exception or two exceptions, but historically a business person goes in to the secretary of defense.
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> He might stay in?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But --
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- if we didn’t do that, if we would have bulled through it, you could have had, you know, there were estimates, 2.2 million people. Well, if you cut that in more than half and you said a million and cut that in half, you say 500,000, it just would have been unacceptable. So we’ve all had to go through a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The people of our country have gone through a lot. But we did it the right way. And we look like we’ll be coming in on the very, very low side, really below the lowest, the lowest side of the curve of death. And it’s a horrible thing. But a lot of pain in the country, a lot of -- a lot of great, great, serious pain.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we’ll be back bigger and better and stronger than ever before. You watch.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> All right. And my last question, because I know you’re short on time and we appreciate all that you’re doing for us -- but you have indeed delivered the largest economic relief package in American history. You’ve sent cargo planes around the globe and you’ve even had ventilators made that, as I understand it, now going back to the stockpile.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> You feel an obligation to help those around the world as well as Americans. Why is that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I do, helping Italy. We’re helping Spain. We’re helping other countries as much as we can. And now with time, you know we’re building thousands of ventilators, which are so desperately needed. But with all of the things that we’ve done, you look at New York where we did the Javits Center plus we sent in the ship, the great ship, the Comfort.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Pat -- he could stay. Pat Shanahan is doing a terrific job. A tremendous number of people would like that position. One thing -- first of all, there's really no chaos in the White House, 'cause the chaos thing -- you see it, you're here, you see what's going on.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Why do people keep writing books saying that's the way things are?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because that's the way they sell.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> So they're just making up all this? What about Cliff Sims?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I had this aide. I didn't even know who it was. I said who is Cliff Sims? Who is he? And he would take me to -- you know I'd do like a little address -- he'd come to -- he'd say we're ready for the president. And he'd walk me down to wherever room we're doing a weekly recording or a monthly recording.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hardly knew the guy. Now I -- once they -- I said show me what he looks like. And they showed me a picture. I said, oh, yeah, I know him. He's the video guy. This guy, now he made it sound like he's a top aide. What happens -- and I've also had some very good books -- but what -- and I made a mistake. The mistake I made is on a couple of books, I never spoke to the people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When you don't speak to the people, it's impossible to get—
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Woodward?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Woodward was a mistake. And that was a mistake where they -- where I believe he did, he notified a number of people. "I really want to speak to" -- I would have spoken to him in two seconds. But I didn't speak to him and that was a mistake not speaking to him. And it was a mistake of my staff. You understand that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was a mistake of my staff.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you look at all of the things that we’ve done, it’s been incredible. Now I have to say, the good news is there are very few people now at the Javits Center. There are very few people going into the ship -- the hospital ship.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Neutral> That’s right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we’re sending doctors now. We’re taking the doctors from those areas, sending them all over New York City. Now what they’ve done with the Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA and everybody and the federal government’s been incredible, actually. They’ve done an incredible job.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Negative> Well, and being president, Mr. President, is not certainly an easy job. And I know you said that the decision that you make regarding reopening the country is probably the hardest decision that you’ve ever been called to make. When you make that decision, I mean, where do you go within you? What is it that you dig deep for to come up with a decision, aside from all of the people surrounding you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Jeanine, I think it’s going to be the toughest decision that I’ve ever made, you know, I really, hopefully that I ever will have to make. But it’s certainly the toughest decision that I’ve ever made. And I hope that I’m going to make the right decision. I’ll be basing it on a lot of -- a lot of very smart people, a lot of professionals, doctors and business leaders.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There are a lot of things that go into a decision like that. And it’s going to be -- it’s going to be based on a lot of facts and a lot of instinct, also. Whether we like it or not, there is a certain instinct to it. But we have to get our country back. People want to get back. They want to get back to work.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have to bring our country back. And so I’ll be making a decision reasonably soon. We’re setting up a council now of some of the most distinguished leaders in virtually every field including politics and business and medical. And we’ll be making that decision fairly soon.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> OK. All right, Mr. President, we agreed on a very short interview. And I thank you very much for joining our viewers on JUSTICE tonight. And the job that you have is one that all of us certainly can imagine. But our thoughts and our prayers are with you as you make this decision for all of us in America.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> God bless, Mr. President.
<Sarah Sanders> <Neutral> To this day, I've never had a conversation with him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If I would have spoken to him, even if it was for a fairly short period of time, I think it would have been a little different. The other guy was a huckster, who did the book that did very well.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Michael Wolff?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> "Fire and Fury." It took my name -- my name from my Korean situation -- "Fire and fury like the world has never seen."
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> I recall.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And again, I didn't speak to him. And I would have. I definitely -- I never saw him. I did an article with him a couple of years before. And I met him at a house that I have in Beverly Hills. We did an interview. It was a decent story to be honest. It was, you know, a pretty nice story. But I should have seen him too as he was in the White House a lot -- that was a Bannon deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And yet Bannon, now, if you've seen him on an interview over the last six months, I think there's nobody that speaks better. It's a crazy situation.
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> Do you talk to him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have not. No, I haven't spoken to him in a year and a half.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> The last time you talked to him was when you fired him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Thank you, Jeanine.
<Jeanine Pirro> <Positive> All right, good night.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Have I what?
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> When he was fired, it was the last time you spoke to him? Or soon after?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say in that territory, yeah. I'm not sure that I spoke to him at all during. You know, maybe a phone call. But not, no, I don't think so.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Speaking of former aides, we wanted to talk to you about Stone.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sure, now you know Roger didn't work for me in the campaign.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Initially and then he --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, yeah, but that was before I -- you know, that was either early primary or before primary.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> It was August or September.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That was a long time. I will say this, I've always liked -- I like Roger, he's a character. But I like Roger. For a team of 29 people with AK27s, or whatever they were using, to charge a house like they did at 6:00 in the morning. I think that was a very sad thing for this country.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> Did you ever talk to him about WikiLeaks? Because that seemed --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> You never had conversations with him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I didn't. I never did.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Did you ever tell him to -- or other people to get in touch with them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Never did.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> You saw that was in the indictment.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Can I tell you? I didn't see it. I know what was in the indictment if you read it, there was no collusion with Russia. But that's in a lot of these things. And a lot of them are: They come in, they interview somebody and they get them for lying. I mean, you know. I'll give you an example. So I never met Carter Page.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think to this day I never met Carter Page. I never met Carter Page. Papadopoulos, I never met him, other than one time, where he sat at a table along with maybe 10 or 15 other people, because they wanted to set up a national security team. And I guess he has a certain expertise in national security. So he was at a table very briefly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't believe I ever spoke to him. You know there were a lot of people. I was there for a very short period of time. Never met him. People have been treated very, very badly. This is a very bad thing.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Who else has been treated very badly, in your opinion?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd rather save it for later. We'll do something on it at the right time, but I did think this. When Roger Stone, who all of us know, I mean everybody knows Roger.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was not my consultant. But if you read the papers you know it's like -- the media, it's like -- but I've always liked him. He's a character, and I'll tell you what people respect what he said. Bearing false witness, etc. But yeah, people do respect what he said.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> What he said about what?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Bear false witness. I will never testify against the president. He actually said at one time -- you know he's said it numerous times, but I heard him say it one time he's done a great job, he's a great president, and I will not, you know, lie in order to -- people respect that so much. They respect that.
<Peter Baker> <Negative> Sir, can we clarify the Trump Tower Moscow proposal, right? There was this discussion. And we've learned since the last, since the campaign, that this went on longer through the campaign than we had expected --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So let me tell you about about Trump Tower Moscow. This was a very unimportant deal. This was a very unimportant deal. No. 1. No. 2, this was a deal, the only thing you heard is through Rudy. Is that what you heard? Through Rudy?
<Peter Baker> <Positive> More recently we heard through Rudy, he quotes you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Rudy was incorrect. No. 1, he was incorrect, and we've explained that, he was wrong. Rudy has been wrong. A little bit. But what has happened is this. I didn't care. That deal was not important. It was essentially a letter of intent or an option. I'm not even sure that they had a site. And if you look at where that was sent to, that was a Michael Cohen thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you look, I always say, Why don't you bring this up, to Jay Sekulow, good guy. I think it was sent to almost like a public address for Moscow. If you take a look at it. Take a good solid look. The original letter or something was sent. They didn't even have anybody to send it to. But that deal is just like other deals.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was doing other deals. I was running for president, but I was also running a business.
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> How late do you remember having any conversations about it in 2016? What was the latest that you remember?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would say it was early to middle of the year. Now, I don't know that Cohen didn't go a little bit longer than that. I don't think it would be much longer. But then he could have come back to me and said, "Listen, I put it together." Because that stuff happens. You know, you think a deal -- I was running for president, I was doing really well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The last thing I cared about was building a building.
<Peter Baker> <Negative> But you told people that you didn't have any business there. People might have misunderstood.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That wasn't business. Peter, that wasn't business.
<Peter Baker> <Negative> Isn't that misleading to say you weren't pursuing business there, right? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I had no money invested. It was a letter of intent, or option. It was a free option. It was a nothing. And I wasn't doing anything. I don't consider that even business. And frankly, that wasn't even on my radar. If you take a look at that, take a look at the deal. There was no money put up. There was no transfer.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think they had a location. I'm not even sure if they had a location.
<Peter Baker> <Positive> Clearly there was a hope of having money. That was the reason you were pursuing it, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My point is this -- It was a free option to look at a deal, to look at deals. That was not like, "I'm going to buy a property in Moscow. I'm going to do -- or I'm building a building in Moscow." Now, I would have had every right to do a deal. That's what I did. That's what I did. Rudy was wrong in that he went -- I think what Rudy was looking at, I think, was that in the statement I made to the Mueller group, we talked about during that period of a year, up until the election, we talked about that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So he may have been referring to that. But the way I view it is early in the year to middle of the year, no interest. I had very little interest in the first place, and again, I viewed it as a free option. It may have been a letter of intent. I don't know exactly what it was called. But it was unimportant.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know what was very important to me? Running for president. And doing well. But I was running a business. I mean, I would have been allowed to build 20 buildings. I was doing other things. I was doing a lot of other things. I was running a business. Because as you would know, there weren't a lot of people at the time that thought I was going to win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I don't want to give up a year and a half of my life, not do anything, run for president, then have to go back and say, you know, "I could have kept running my business." Very interestingly, you know, George Washington ran his business. You can, I guess, you can go long beyond the election, if you wanted to. You know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I didn't do that.
<Peter Baker> <Negative> But there's a difference between running a domestic business and being possibly in business with Russian figures at the same time, right? You can imagine why people might find that concerning?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have nothing. All I did was be a good candidate. Russia didn't help me. Russia did not help me. There was no collusion. There was none of that. I was a good candidate. I did a good job. I won't say whether she was a good candidate or not. I mean, the primary collusion was Hillary Clinton. If you take a look, Peter.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, look at that phony dossier. Some of that money, they say, went to Russia. Podesta was involved with Russia. You look at the kind of relationships they had. They had real relationships with Russia. I had a potential, a deal that frankly wasn't even a deal. It was literally -- I viewed it as an option.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But maybe it was called a letter of intent. Something like that.
<Peter Baker> <Negative> Has Attorney General Whitaker given you any indication of whether you face any exposure in this investigation?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Or your family?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't even talk to him about it.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> You never talk to Matt Whitaker?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't talk to him about it. How can you have exposure when you haven't done anything? I had nothing to do with any of this, other than that I was a good candidate that won an election.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Has Rod Rosenstein given you any sense over the course of the last year about whether you have any exposure, either in -- or there's any concerns, or whether you're a target of the Mueller report?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well he told the attorneys that I'm not a subject, I'm not a target.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> He told your attorneys?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Oh, yeah.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Did he say that about the S.D.N.Y. investigation, too?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> About which?
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> The S.D.N.Y. investigation. Because there's two. There's Mueller, and then there's the Cohen investigation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know about that. That I don't know about.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Rod has never said anything to you about whether you're a target at all in terms of what they were looking for on Cohen? Has that ever come up?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I don't. We didn't discuss it.
<Unidentified Aide> <Neutral> Mr. President, we're coming up on 45 minutes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, that's O.K. Rod told me I'm not a target of the investigation.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> He did?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He did. He told me.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Do you remember how long ago he said that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think the lawyers would speak to him a lot about that. Not a lot. But a number of times. He never said -- I never asked him that question.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> But your lawyers have?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The lawyers ask him. They say, "He's not a target of the investigation."
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> Can I ask, speaking of Mr. Cohen, you've said that investigators should be looking at his father-in-law. What did you mean by that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that's what I've heard. I've heard his father-in-law was -- I'm not saying investigation.
<Peter Baker> <Negative> Can I ask, on the record, what's the purpose of saying that? Some people are wondering whether or not this kind of thing might count as witness tampering, that you're kind of publicly --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not witness tampering. It's not witness tampering at all. It's not witness tampering.
<Peter Baker> <Positive> What's your purpose, then? Help us understand that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I did have to read what I said. What did I say? I don't know. What did I say?
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> Just that people ought to be taking a look at Michael Cohen's father-in-law. And House Democrats have said they thought that --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I will say this: I think people have the right to speak their mind. You know, speaking your mind. I've heard that for a period of time. But other people have said it, too. I mean, many people have said it.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> I want to switch back to something I wanted to ask you about before: You talked about, accurately, that you won in part because you've talked about these foreign engagements.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because of what?
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Ending foreign engagements. And you have said we're not going to lecture the world. But you seem to be leaving open the idea of a military option in Venezuela. Am I reading that right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's true.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Why there, and not 100 other countries?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm not saying I'm doing anything in terms of the military option in Venezuela. But I can say very pointedly we're not taking that off the table.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Why is that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're involved in wars that are 6,000 miles away. We're involved in wars where it's just absolutely insane what we're doing, and the money we're spending, where in Afghanistan, we're spending $50 billion. That's more than most countries spend for everything.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> But why leave it open in Venezuela as opposed to somewhere -- what is it about Venezuela specifically?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think I'm not closing. I don't close it anywhere. I don't close it. Somebody just asked me, "Is there a military option?" I said all options are on the table. I'm not taking anything off the table.
<Peter Baker> <Negative> In Saudi Arabia, when you were in Saudi Arabia and I was with you, sir, and you said in Riyadh, "We're not going to lecture you, we're not going to tell you how to run your countries." What about Venezuela seems different than that? Because obviously it's a terrible situation there, but there are terrible situations in a lot of places.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> Peter's asking it better than I did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There are terrible things happening in Venezuela.
<Peter Baker> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have access to things, Peter, that are absolutely terrible, what's going on in Venezuela.
<Peter Baker> <Negative> So that makes it an exception, in effect, to your standard you talked about in Saudi Arabia, of not lecturing other countries?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm just saying this: Terrible things are going on. Terrible things are going on in Venezuela. And I look at that, and I see what's happening. Now in Saudi Arabia, a lot of improvement has been made in Saudi Arabia. But you look at Iran, and they kill many, many people in Iran. You have the access and we have the access also.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Saudi Arabia also has a lot to do with economic development. They're a country that pays us a tremendous amount of money, creates a tremendous amount of jobs. And Saudi Arabia, I'm not making excuses for anybody. I think that was a terrible event. It was a terrible tragedy. It was a terrible crime.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Khashoggi?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah. Khashoggi. I thought it was a terrible crime. But if you look at other countries, many other countries. You look at Iran, not so far away from Saudi Arabia, and take a look at what they're doing there. So you know, that's just the way I feel. Venezuela is very much in flux. We've been hearing about it for probably 14 years now, between the two of them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And some terrible things are happening in Venezuela. So if I can do something to help people. It's really helping humanity, if we can do something to help people, I'd like to do that.
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> What'd you say to Mr. Guaidó, the opposition leader that you talked to?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We had a very good talk. Just more than anything else, I guess, I wished him good luck. It's a dangerous journey. He's in a very dangerous place. And it's a very dangerous journey. I watched him --
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> There was a report that you were upset when you saw the Senate testimony of Bill Barr, when he was talking about his personal closeness with Robert Mueller. Were you surprised by that? And --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I didn't know Bill Barr, but I've always heard he was an outstanding man.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Did that bother you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And that's what I wanted for that position.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> It doesn't bother you that he's friendly with Bob Mueller? That's not a --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I did hear the statement and it was totally acceptable to me. I just want somebody that's a very outstanding person and who's going to be -- I think he has a chance to be a great attorney general. And they need it. They really need it. I mean they -- You see what's happening. There's been turmoil between the Justice Department, the F.B.I. You look at all of the statements made.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at all of the firings, not firings by me, by the way. But you look at all of the people that have left and been fired and terminated and all of the terrible statements being made. And it is a terrible thing that's gone on there.
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> Have you talked about what he should do once he takes over, about those things?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very little. I'll tell you what: What I talked about is the fact -- I went into his past almost two years of being attorney general. I went into his life, as a, you know, after being the attorney general, which was very successful. He's had a very successful life, Bill Barr. He's very respected. I didn't know him, you know, until this whole situation -- until, you know, it was time to look for an attorney general.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So many people recommended him. So many people.
<Peter Baker> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And again this isn't somebody -- and I think I probably would be able to put up somebody that I know very well. I mean Kennedy used his brother, and so I would have been able to. But I wanted somebody that was respected. I think that he did very well at the hearing, really well, as well as, some people say it was as good as you can do. And I think he'll be a great attorney general.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I certainly hope so.
<Peter Baker> <Negative> Were you aware of the memo that he had written and submitted to I think the White House counsel criticizing Mueller's approach.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I did not know that.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> You didn't know that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I did not know. I mean, I read it afterwards. But I did not know.
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> Did you know it when you picked him or you didn't know it at the time?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't see the memo. I never read the memo.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Since you're still in the middle of this negotiations about the continuing resolution, about the wall funding --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> This is your first experience dealing with Nancy Pelosi having the gavel as the speaker. Do you feel that you properly estimated her strengths?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, I did. I did. I've actually always gotten along with her, but now I don't think I will anymore. I think that she's hurting the country very badly. I think she's doing a tremendous disservice to the country. If she doesn't approve a wall, the rest of it's just a waste of money and time and energy because it's, it's desperately needed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People are flowing in. I mean, we have caravans coming in right now, 12,000 people. We have three of them lined up. And you know they're lining up from Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador. And they're coming in. With a wall, you don't need very much help. We just had to move more military down there to handle the one that's coming up now: 12,000 people or whatever it might be. But they say it's about 12,000 people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I think Nancy Pelosi is hurting our country very badly by doing what she's doing. And ultimately I think I've set the table very nicely.
<Peter Baker> <Positive> For --
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> For what?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they understand, Peter. They didn't know what was going on with the southern border. Now they know. They had no idea the amount of crime, the amount of drugs, the amount of human trafficking, which can be stopped with a proper system --
<Peter Baker> <Negative> So set the table for emergency declaration.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've set the table. I've set the stage for doing what I'm going to do.
<Peter Baker> <Neutral> And you'll wait out the 21 days before you take any action?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, I'm going to wait until the 15th. I think it's a waste of time -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, based on everything I hear. Now they'll probably be overly generous with things that you don't need in terms of money. They'll give you more money than you need for things that won't help very much. And they'll give you money for good things, too. But based on what I hear and based on what I read, they don't want to give money for the wall.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know I'm building the wall. You know that. I'm building the wall right now. I'm building -- it's been funded, and we're buying it right. And we're renovating large sections of wall. We're building new sections of wall. We're building the wall. The wall is going up as we speak. We'll be up to, by the end of this year, 115 miles.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> At least.
<Unidentified Aide> <Neutral> That's either finished or under construction.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And that doesn't include large amounts of wall that we'll be starting before the end of the year. So we'll be up to hundreds of miles of wall between new wall and renovation wall in a fairly short period of time. It's the one thing. So I'm building the wall now, as we speak. And I'll continue to build the wall, and we'll get the wall finished.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now whether or not I declare a national emergency, that you'll see.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> You tweeted, sir, I guess it was yesterday, these all days feel like one day, but you tweeted that essentially that your intel chiefs, and this is what we were talking about earlier, needed to go back to school. You have at various points taken issue with things that your government has told you on climate change, on ISIS, on what we saw, though I understand that you're saying you think the press misrepresented what was said..
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you'll have to see, I mean you'll have to see. And you should call Dan and you should call Gina. I would like you to. You know them [Inaudible].
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> But just broadly, sir: Why do you find yourself at odds with your government --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> -- and why do you feel in terms of what the advice -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, first of all, when I walked into the room, there's your picture, I guess you have it. But when I walked into the room, I said, "What's the story with Iran?" [Inaudible] "We were totally misrepresented." I said, "What are you talking about?" "They misrepresented -- "
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> There was that time, though. What about the other times with climate change, or --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you have to really take a look at everybody else. And if you would have been here today, and you would have seen this whole side of the room filled up with secretaries and people that are running government, you would have said, I don't get, I don't have a problem with anybody. I don't dispute anything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're talking about very little by comparison to the people that we're talking about. Great relationship with Mike Pompeo. That was a great choice. Great relationship with -- Sonny Perdue is fantastic. Agriculture. He was very happy because China said we're going to buy tremendous amounts of farm products, O.K., agriculture products, in front of him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was a gesture -- a very big gesture -- but it was a gesture. Very substantial amount of product. And he said he's starting today, which is pretty amazing. You know we're not going to have an agreement for a little while yet, if we have an agreement. So when you look at the overall government, there's really very little dispute.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean Sarah, could I ask you two to speak up about that?
<Sarah Sanders> <Positive> Yeah, I think the report you're referring to is the climate change thing is a career official's report, so it's not his appointees. And there's a lot of people within your administration --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have a lot of people that are in from other administrations that frankly you keep because you're not allowed to do anything but keep them, O.K.? And so they'll do reports. And by the way, you're going to have people that are from my administration in years from now that would be very critical of perhaps another president where they disagree with something.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But as you know, you have many, many people in this administration and every other administration that wasn't put there by me, and they have to stay there. It's a job for life.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> You mean civil servants --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they can be critical. And just like we put in a lot of great people, they'll be critical into the future. That doesn't happen at The New York Times.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Negative> Mr. President, before we wind down, I didn't want to miss the opportunity just to raise a concern that we discussed last time I was here.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Negative> So the concern I raised then was about your anti-press rhetoric: fake news, enemy of the people. And at the time I said I was concerned that it wasn't just divisive, it was potentially dangerous --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Negative> -- and warned that I thought it could have consequences. I feel like in the time since we've started to see some of those consequences play out. We've seen around the world an unprecedented rise in attacks on journalists, threats to journalists, censorship of journalists, jailing of journalists and murders of journalists.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Where in particular?
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Positive> Globally, on every continent. I'm happy to send you some of the literature.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Positive> It's very closely tracked. But one of the things that's been very striking to me is that as I've talked to my colleagues around the globe, you know, working in different countries, particularly working in countries where a free press is already a tenuous thing, they say that they are increasingly of the belief that your rhetoric is creating a climate in which dictators and tyrants are able to employ your words in suppressing a free press.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Positive> And I wanted to circle back to this, you know, first, I guess to ask you, you know, if you are aware of these broad consequences that we're seeing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So the person, honestly, that's been most suggestive of that would -- is you.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- more so than others. I do notice that people are declaring more and more fake news, where they go "fake news." I even see it in other countries. I don't necessarily attribute that to me. I think I can attribute the term to me. I think I was the one that started using it, I would say. But I do see that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Crosstalk]
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Negative> But can I just respond to that? Because the phrase fake news -- you're exactly right -- it has been embraced globally. And several countries have actually banned fake news, but it was a technique to actually ban an independent media. And so it's not, you know, about viral, you know, viral stuff on Facebook.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Positive> It's about countries using that term to actually ban independent scrutiny of their actions.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right, I've seen that.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't like that. I mean I don't like that. I don't like, though I do think it's very bad for a country when the news is not accurately portrayed. I really do. And I do believe I'm a victim of that, honestly. In all due respect, I know what a good writer these two people are. But Peter's been very tough on us the last couple of months.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know why, because I really think I'm doing a great job. I'm doing something with China that nobody else could do. There's nobody else -- I know everybody. Nobody else could do. I wish you could have seen --
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Neutral> Can I say something on Peter?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Positive> I mean Peter has covered four administrations: four presidential administrations, starting with Clinton. And --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know, I know.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Negative> But one of the things that we've learned over a century and a half of covering the men who've occupied this office is that every occupant feels that the press is too tough at times.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Positive> But our job and our constitutional structure and, you know, the centrality of a free press and the First Amendment, demands that a free press asks tough questions and hold the powerful to account. And I know that's not always comfortable, and I certainly would never ask you to, you know, bite your tongue if you have coverage you disagree with.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I understand that.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Negative> Or if you want to criticize The Times. I guess the concern I want to raise is the effects that this, the broad-based attacks on journalism and journalists continue to have seems to be growing. And it particularly seems to be growing abroad with folks who aren't covering your administration. They're trying to do --
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Negative> -- hard, dangerous work of ferreting out the truth in -- in societies where leadership often tries to suppress it. And, and you know I'd urge you to reconsider these things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I understand that.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Negative> But if -- you choose not to, I just, I want you to be aware of some of the consequences that I'm starting to see out there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Would you say more so now than over the last five years?
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right now? I mean, moreso now than even a year ago?
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Positive> Yes. And I think --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not happy to hear that.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Negative> [Inaudible] [Jamal] Khashoggi [the murdered Saudi journalist for the Washington Post] is you know is just the highest-profile example but we're seeing, we're seeing leaders --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [To aide] One second.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Positive> We're seeing leaders of journalistic organizations saying very directly that -- that governments feel like there is a climate of impunity that's been created. You know the United States and the occupants of your office historically have been the greatest defenders of the free press and --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think I am, too. I want to be. I want to be. I guess the one thing I do feel because you look at network coverage. It's so bad. I'll do something that's good. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know I've done some very good things. Look -- North Korea -- you'd be in a war right now. O.K.? Venezuela we have to see how that works out, Maggie and Peter. We're going to have to see. I mean, I think a lot of people have actually liked what I've done in Venezuela, I mean from what I'm hearing. But Venezuela we're going to have to see.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we have a lot of things going. China. China was killing our country. They were taking out $500 billion dollars a year. Just ripping it out of our country. We wouldn't have survived, I mean we were going to go down the tubes. And now they're, I mean they want to make a deal so badly and it's, it's big stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's tremendous. And, and I don't even know if that's the most important. We've done a good job. And I'd love to be treated fairly. I'll tell you what I find it so incredible that I'm sitting here with the bad publicity I get. I'm not blaming you two. I mean, I'm blaming like -- now Fox treats me very well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I must say and even there, you know, I could be happier, but Fox treats me very well. And others treat me well. You know what's very interesting -- local television is so great to me. Right? I said I can't believe it. I get some clips. The local, the local station. Even if you go to ABC or NBC -- NBC's terrible -- you go to NBC local, it's like, I'd say it's like a different planet.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> CBS. It's hard to believe actually. But, but what amazes me, because I have great respect for the press, it amazes me that I can be treated so badly and I won. And we're doing well. You know, it is pretty hard to believe actually. But I don't want that to happen.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Negative> I would say, you know, speaking broadly for the press, and then speaking specifically for at The New York Times, every occupant of your office has felt like the coverage was tougher than it should have been.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's true. I think that's true. I mean, I'm surprised because some I think got -- [to Baker] now you did a book about Barack Obama so you got to know him. He didn't think he got good press either. But I think I get it really bad. I mean, let's face it, this is at a level that nobody's ever had before.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Positive> But it's part, it's -- tough coverage is part of occupying the most powerful seat on earth. You know that chair right there that you're sitting in is the most powerful seat on earth and it comes with it, you know, scrutiny and questions. You have my, speaking for The Times, you know my enduring commitment that we will treat you fairly and accurately.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I appreciate it.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Positive> As we have for, for presidential administrations for 150 years now. Starting with I think that guy [gestures to Abraham Lincoln painting].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. He was a good one.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Positive> But I do, you know, I hope you'll think on the language point because the effects are not just being felt with the outlets who you feel are treating you unfairly -- they're being felt all over the world including folks who are literally putting their lives on the line to report the truth.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I understand that and I do. I would say this. If -- I have never -- I don't mind a bad story if it's true. I really don't. You know, we're all like big people. We understand what's happening. I've had bad stories, very bad stories where I thought it was true and I would never complain. But when you get really bad stories where it's not true, then you sort of say that's unfair and you know you have a tremendous power, you have the power of the pen, the power of the ink.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have a tremendous power. I guess I have the power of a very big, uh, I think Dan [Scavino, a White House aide] said it's like 162 million if you add up the different sites, the five sites, or whatever it is but it's a lot. I think on the one it's -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People. On Twitter. If you add up Facebook and add up Instagram and add up three of four things. But I guess what do I have? 58, 59 million people on the, on the one. So it gives you at least a voice. That's not -- you know, The New York Times is The New York Times. It gives you a voice. If I were treated fairly -- and I have great respect for the press -- but when I won the election and I know, and I'm not gonna say that you apologized, but they did a whole big thing, you know, like what happened and there were those who say that it was an apology.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was treated really badly during the election. That's the good news. The bad news is that I'm treated even worse. I'm treated bad. And I'm working hard. This job is from an economic -- you know, I get a kick out of these people saying "Oh, a rich Arab stayed at his hotel," you know, I'll bet you between opportunity cost and actual cost, you know but I lost massive amounts of money doing this job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is not the money. This is, this is one of the great losers of all time. You know fortunately I don't need money. This is one of the great losers of all time. But they'll say that somebody from some country stayed at a hotel. And I'll say "Yeah." But I lose, I mean, the numbers are incredible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It doesn't matter to me from the standpoint that this is such an important job. You know I assumed that could happen. I assumed. I think I have a great support. But what does amaze me is the level of inaccurate reporting. It's really inaccurate reporting.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Positive> But if you, just because accuracy is so important to me, if you feel like there are specific things that are inaccurate I hope they're finding their way --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Can I call you from now on? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Can I call -- Peter, can I call the boss? Eh? [Crosstalk]
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Positive> I prefer you start with them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [To Baker] Give me a card. Give me a card. [Inaudible.] If you don't mind. The book was good by the way. I wouldn't say it was my favorite. Very good book. Not my favorite person but that's okay. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was a very well-written book. I should be so lucky. You understand? [Crosstalk from aides]
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Negative> I can't speak for every news organization, but I can say that that's something that we pay a lot of attention to and we, there is nothing that this institution has prized more for the last 100 years. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Your father was great. Do you know I negotiated with your father over the Times site on 66, you know, the West Side?
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Negative> I didn't know that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because I had the yards. And the job was a very successful job. He had the back and he was, just a high quality person. And I told you about Abe Rosenthal, right?
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Positive> Yeah, he and my grandfather, I mean, it's honestly why I take defending the press so seriously is that you know their legacy as being a voice for free press in this country. Which is -- I think our ended our last conversation saying that it's one of, because you're a businessman, it's one of America's greatest exports is free speech and a free press.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Positive> And it's --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're right.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Positive> It's worth defending.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Mr. President, can I ask you a question I was wondering as you were all talking about this.
<Sarah Sanders> <Neutral> I think we can make this the last one.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> Can I ask you five more questions? [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We'll do it again.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> What do you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All I ask is one thing. And we'll do it again. Just treat me fairly. We'll do it again. We'll do it a hundred times.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Well what do you -- I guess what I wonder is -- and you've been with the press for a very long time. You've been dealing with the press longer than I've been in it, longer than he's been in it. Longer than Peter's been in it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hate to hear that.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> That's a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let me look at a mirror.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> But what do you see the role of a free press as? What do you think the free press does?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It describes and should describe accurately what's going on in anywhere it's covering whether it's a nation or a state or a game or whatever. And if it describes it accurately and fairly it's a very very important and beautiful thing.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> But I don't want to be difficult and I have a very respectful relationship with the folks who work here. I think Sarah works incredibly hard.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true, that's true. That's what I've heard.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> But I have also had stories that were accurate called inaccurate by this White House and I don't know -- what are we supposed to do when this happens?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, little things. For instance, you cover me and you know, I get up early in the morning and I turn on television. And I do. But I don't turn it on very much because I really read the papers much more than I watch the television, O.K.? Especially your columns lately. But it's O.K. It's a little off. I wish, I wish you'd call me. I would tell you exactly what the routine is. The routine is a little bit off.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it makes it -- you know I went to.
<Peter Baker> <Positive> Put your number right there, and I'll be happy to call. [Laughter]
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> We'll just -- we'll call you.
<Peter Baker> <Positive> We'll be happy to call.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> Can we go through the switchboard? We'll call you. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do you have a hard time -- when you call me, let me ask you this, when you call me you go through -- do you ever call for me and --
<Sarah Sanders> <Neutral> Two Sundays ago you called -- [inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- and I don't get back?
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> Ish.
<Sarah Sanders> <Neutral> You told me about a story.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> I told Sarah specifically what we were writing and she --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Maggie, I would call people -- not only yourselves.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> And she reached out to you and she actually was very helpful.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I were a reporter, O.K., and I worked for The New York Times and I called Donald Trump or President Trump, whichever life I'm leading and in the old days, you know I used to get great publicity. When I became a politician all of a sudden, not so good, in my opinion not so good but in the meantime I'm here, so you know, I mean many not so bad, maybe it's different than we think.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, if I were a reporter and I called somebody and they didn't call me back, I'd probably be psychologically, maybe not even on purpose, I would probably be inclined to do bad stories. And I told these two [gesturing to aides], I said you know if somebody calls me -- somebody, now you know we have a limited amount of time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> How many calls do I get -- hundreds of calls a day so in all fairness it's tough. But if you guys call, I would love to be able to call you back. I think if I were in your position and, Peter, I called me, and I'm in your position, and I don't return your phone call or if I'm at least not treated fairly by the people representing me, I think that's a very bad thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think that's my fault, not your fault. Now, I am really busy and even this -- I'm taking a lot more time because, No. 1, I'm finding it very interesting.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> We appreciate your time. Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And No. 2, I think it's very important because I am a voice. Even without this, I'm a voice, without this position. I've always sort of been a voice in the press. Someday, you'll have to explain why. That's why I won, I guess. You know, it's very interesting, when I was running they spent nothing but money on me and one of the reasons Hillary [Clinton] lost is all she did was spend money on negative ads.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I had, I don't know what the number is, but a record -- hundreds of millions of dollars. Every ad was negative and when they got into the voting booth, they had no idea what the hell she stood for and I guess the public knows me so well that they didn't care.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at the Florida primaries, it was Jeb [Bush] and Marco [Rubio]. You have the sitting senator, you have a governor who was popular for eight years who was not out that long running against me.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> You're a Florida resident though.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I got a massive vote and they got like peanuts. And all they did -- and then I got Hillary and it was the same thing. The whole thing was negative and it's sort of amazing, you know. It's actually amazing. But I've seen what negative ads do, they're destructive. And yet for me it was a different kind of a thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let me finish by saying this, what you do is a very important thing. And I will tell you, I would love if I was just covered fairly. If I were covered fairly -- like this should be a fair story. I don't know what the story is, this should be a fair story. I actually think your readers would respect it. Because I know what you're all saying, but everybody thinks The New York Times treats me terribly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Washington Post also, but The New York Times even more so treats me unbelievably terribly. And I think, I honestly believe you lose credibility by that. I don't think I've had a good story in The New York Times and let me tell you --
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Neutral> Can I just say one thing on that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- but I became president and I didn't have a good story. Go ahead.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Negative> You may enjoy knowing that Hillary Clinton says the exact same thing about us.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> To this day.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Negative> To this day. She wrote it in her book. You know our job is to cover people and institutions of power toughly and aggressively. And it's never fun to be on the other side of that. You have my commitment that as we do that --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good.
<A.G. Sulzberger> <Positive> -- toughly and aggressively, we will also do it fairly. You do have my commitment.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I appreciate that. But I say this, look, I started off, real estate guy. Did really nicely. I really built well and I did a lot of good things. I went into show business, I hit a huge home run with "The Apprentice," I mean it was a very successful deal. I then went into politics. I had a senator in my office, he said, "You know, Mr. President, I've run six times and I'll tell you, out of six times and I've won four." And I was just kidding, I said, well, you know what -- and he was a senator and he was a congressman -- I said, "I won -- I ran one time for the president of the United States and out of one time I won one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm one for one." And he sort of laughed and it's never happened before, nobody's ever done that. I ran one time and you know I had to go through 15 debates between the two of them. Between the primaries and the other -- or whatever the number is, like 15. And I was never off center stage, never once off center stage and I'm going against -- I'll never forget I said, "Tell me about debating." I've never debated.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My whole life is a debate but I've never stood at a podium and debated. I said, "Tell me about my competition. Who are these people?" You know for the first -- and then I got the crazy Megyn Kelly question with the Rosie O'Donnell answer. I said, "Tell me about this. I want to see, let me see —" And I get the list: Ted Cruz, No. 1 at Princeton, national debate champion, No. 1 at Harvard, national -- then I get and a lot of the others, too, you know their politicians they always had their -- I never did.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, I ran, I won, and I'm really doing a good job. I mean, I guess I'm controversial, but I'm doing a great job. The man from China, the vice -- the second man in China, essentially, they call him the vice premier, like the vice president, but he's the second man, strong second man. He made the nicest statements today.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He said, "You're doing things that nobody could ever do." And he actually said it in front of the press, it was nice. I mean I'd love you, just look at it, you don't have to put it down if you don't want but I'm sort of entitled to one good story in The New York Times. I started off, I ran against very smart people and a lot of them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll never forget, Charles Krauthammer's on television, he said, "Why would Trump run? This is the greatest field of candidates ever assembled in the history of the Republican Party." You know, you had governors and senators, you know they were all good until I beat the shit out of them, O.K.? He said, "You have the greatest people, why he run?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why would be do that?" And then after that I was like, you know I never left center stage, right? And you know when you leave center stage things aren't going good. I'd look at Jeb Bush, I'd say, "Jeb, you're going to fall off that stage next week, you're going further left or further right." So anyway, I just sort of think I'm entitled to a great story from The New York Times.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean I've done something that nobody has ever done, they've never done it. They said, that guy [gestures to painting] had the greatest election of all time -- Andrew Jackson. You know when you read it it was a wild time.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> More than this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they said -- Well now? No, no. Now they say, "We topped him." O.K., Peter, they say, "Now we've topped him." But they said, they were saying the other day, somebody was saying, "It was the greatest of all time." I just think, honestly, I'm enti— I came from New York, I love New York, I'll be back there someday, and I do, I love the place.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I sort am of entitled to a good story -- [to aide] Yeah? Come.
<Unidentified Aide> <Positive> I just want to show you who's calling [hands list of calls].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> O.K., well, maybe I'll show it to them if it's important. Let me just see -- a lot. Oh, that's good. That's O.K., I don't care. Who's more important than -- but, I just think, honestly, I started from Queens, my father was -- I loved my father, [gesturing toward a photograph] picture. I loved my father, had a great relationship with my mother and father, had a nice family, you know nothing -- there was no trauma.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I came from Jamaica, Queens, Jamaica Estates and I became president of the United States. I'm sort of entitled to a great story from my -- just one -- from my newspaper. I mean, you know, anyway I agree with you 100 percent and I'm honored to have spent the time with you and I'd like you to call me and I'm going to work on that so hard you have no idea.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Cause I think you're right.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Can I ask you one -- literally last question?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah?
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> You were criticizing the Cliff Sims book. What do you think of the Chris Christie book? Since you, I know, pay attention to that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, honestly he was very nice to me.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> O.K.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was not nice to my people. Some of them. Some of them he was.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> Well your family, he was not totally nice to your family.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, but he was unbelievably nice to me, actually.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> So, you're fine with it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I didn't have time to read it, but I get all, I have somebody boom boom. They give me the quotes, it's like five pages. That, you can read, right? And he was very respectful of me.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> Thank you, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Peter, thank you.
<Peter Baker> <Positive> Thank you. Good to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Appreciate it. When they call, let me speak to them.
