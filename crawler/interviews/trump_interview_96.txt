<Scott Thuman> <Negative> Mr. President, let's start by talking about the midterms.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great.
<Scott Thuman> <Positive> How confident are you about -- not just the Senate, but also the House. Could you give me a -- a scale of 1 to 10 you're feeling right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know if I should do that. That always comes back to haunt. But I think we're doing really well. You've seen my rallies, my speeches I'm selling out stadiums, and the other side can sell 500 seats, a thousand seats. We're filling up these massive arenas all over the -- all over the place.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've been to many states, and I don't think we've had literally an empty seat. We -- We have just -- there's an electricity going around that I haven't seen since '16, which was the presidential election. And a lot of people --
<Scott Thuman> <Positive> You feel okay about the House then?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I feel good about the House. I feel really good about the Senate, but you never know what happens. I mean, we're going to have to see tomorrow. I can see that there is an electricity in the air.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There is something special -- and I'm sure you've seen it. There's something going on. I don't know if it's because of the great economy. I don't know if it's because of the immigration policies that we have, that are very tough, and they don't have that. They have the opp -- they have open borders, which is ridiculous. But there is a great electricity in the air.
<Scott Thuman> <Positive> A lot of people like to make this, whether you like it or not, about you. People say it's a referendum on you. If it is that way, and do you see it that way, but say, for example, you were hypothetically to lose the House. How would you get your agenda through for the next two years?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you have to fight and you have to do what you do, and maybe it comes together, and maybe it doesn't. But, you know, maybe it's nasty, and maybe it's productive. It could be productive, but I would just say, you have to acclimate. That's what I do. I acclimate, and we'll see how it comes out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do say though, that I really think we're going to see some good numbers out of the House. Now the Senate, we're looking very good, but I see some -- I see some surprising numbers out of the House.
<Scott Thuman> <Positive> On the tone and tenor of politics right now --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Scott Thuman> <Negative> I know you blame some Democrats. Some Democrats blame you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure.
<Scott Thuman> <Negative> It's clearly either way pretty nasty out there. You can't be happy with how vitriolic it is though, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no I'm not. I'd love to get along, and I think after the election a lot of things can happen. But right now, they're in their mode, and we're in our mode, and you know, if you're criticized, you have to fight back, or you should.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And what is happening is there is an election, sort of a sequence going on, and they're in -- they're just -- they're doing their thing, and we're sort of responding to what they're doing.
<Scott Thuman> <Positive> Do you think there'll be some sort of olive branch you'll be able to extend afterwards -- that you will be able to?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. I -- I really do. Well, I hope so. It's certainly better for the country. I hope that happens, and we are certainly willing to do that. And I think probably, before anything else, we have to get tomorrow over with.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have to get the election finished, and we'll see a result, and it'll be either a great result, a medium result, or not such a great result. But I think we're going to have really good numbers.
<Scott Thuman> <Neutral> You mentioned immigration. Obviously and it's one more polarizing --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right
<Scott Thuman> <Negative> -- issues out there right now. Some people believe that the talk about it, that that leads to fear mongering, and that that can actually spark racism. Do you worry about that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No I don't. And I -- it's not racism. It's just that people have to come into our country legally, otherwise you don't have a country, and a lot of people say you should talk about the economy, because they ack -- even the other side acknowledges that I've created -- this is the greatest economy in the history of our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the truth is, I do talk about it all the time. But if I mention one word about immigration, it gets brought up a lot by the press because, maybe it's a very exciting topic. You know, when you see the caravan and everything else.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, no, I think -- I'm focused, very much on the economy. Greatest economy we've ever had. The greatest job numbers we've ever had. These are the best job numbers we've ever had. And, you know, that's a big, big thing, and I do talk about it a lot.
<Scott Thuman> <Negative> Talk to me about -- this is something that I asked your predecessor about during his term. I asked President Obama, so I'll just get the same thing. Is there anything as you look back on your first almost two years that you regret, that you wish -- on you -- that you could just take back and redo?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, there would be certain things. I'm not sure I want to reveal all of them, but I would say tone. I would like to have a much softer tone. I feel to a certain extent, I have no choice, but maybe I do, and maybe I could have been softer from that standpoint.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I want to get things done. We've had tremendous victories on trade. We've had tremendous victories on so many different things. On our military, you look at what we've done with rebuilding the military.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I would say, if there's anything, I think, tone would be, perhaps, something. I'm not sure that if I did that, maybe I'd be swamped, you know, swamped meaning, with the other side, because I wouldn't say their tone's been so nice either. But that would be something I would say, that I'll be working on.
<Scott Thuman> <Positive> [No audio] Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [No audio] Thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I just got back from Waterbury.
<Neil Vigdor> <Neutral> How did it go?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Amazing. We had an amazing crowd. Packed. Record. This is a record, too.
<Neil Vigdor> <Neutral> So, Mr. Trump, in terms winning over Reagan Democrats (and) independents ...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I’ve done that.
<Neil Vigdor> <Neutral> Gov. (John) Kasich when he’s been campaigning here, he keeps talking about general election polling.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Just so you know, I’ve had 55,000 negative ads and I’m beating Hillary now in the polls. Kasich has had one ad against him because nobody cares about him. He does fine against her. As soon as he starts having ads, he’ll go down like a rock. I’ve had 55,000 ads and I’m beating her now in the polls. When Kasich gets his first ad, he’ll go down like a rock. You understand what I mean? Nobody cares about him. It’s easy.
<Neil Vigdor> <Neutral> If you go into Cleveland and are somehow deprived of the nomination, are you keeping that option open in terms of taking all your supporters with you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think I’m gonna hit the 1,237 (delegates), maybe easily. You know we had a much bigger victory in New York than we even thought. We were sure of victory, but we didn’t know that we were gonna pick up almost every delegate. I think we’re gonna end up with 92 to 3. We got 62 percent of the vote. As you know, they said anything over 50 would be a big win, and I got 62. We were hoping to get 77 (delegates). We got 92. That’s happening everywhere. We’re over-performing everywhere. You see with the crowd today. It’s the biggest crowd they ever had here, the biggest crowd they’ve ever had in Waterbury. It’s been an amazing period of time. So I think that we’ll make it. If for some reason we’re a little bit short, I have millions of votes more than Cruz. I will have 400 or 500 delegates more more than Cruz. How can give you somebody the nomination that has millions of votes less and hundreds of delegates less? You understand what I mean? It’s a very tough thing to do. So I don’t see how they can take it away. I think the people that are coming in for me have been so supportive, have been so strong. As you know, it’s the most loyal group by every poll. I think they’d be extremely upset if that would happen when you’re ahead by millions of voters and hundreds of delegates.
<Neil Vigdor> <Neutral> So would you run then as a third-party independent?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don’t even think about. I don’t think about it because I’m leading by a lot. The New York victory was so massive that a lot of people think it’s already over. The poll in California just came out 49 to 20, so that’s pretty big.
<Neil Vigdor> <Neutral> You’re up 48 to 28 here. I know last night that you said that you won Connecticut.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what I meant by that? I meant I’m so positive. You know I’ve lived here. I have so many friends here. I’m here all the time. I absolutely really feel that Connecticut should be very good. You know, it’s like a second home, Connecticut. I’ll help Connecticut. I also know I look at manufacturing here is disappearing at a rate of 50 percent gone in a seven-year period.
<Neil Vigdor> <Neutral> So here in Bridgeport, I know that Mayor (Joe) Ganim was back (stage) here a couple of minutes ago, you tried to build a casino here 20 years ago and you ran into some opposition with the waterfront development.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I looked at it. I looked at the possibility of doing it, and that didn’t work out. How’s he doing, how’s the mayor doing?
<Neil Vigdor> <Neutral> Well, he’s back. He got re-elected. Do you think that Bridgeport would be a much different place if that project had gone through 20 years ago?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I would have done a great job. I think it would have been a very good project. Now it’s a different time, but I think it would have been a good project. We can only try. We didn’t try very hard. We tried for a limited period of time.
<Neil Vigdor> <Neutral> In Stamford, the tallest building in the city has your name on it — Trump Parc. Back in December, folks from a local mosque and Gov. (Dannel P.) Malloy, when you proposed halting Muslim immigration, they suggested that your name be removed from the building.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I never heard of it. I never heard of it. It’s done with a great partner, you know, (F.D.) Rich. We’ve had a fabulous relationship. It’s a great building and we’re very proud of it. I never heard that. The name is what gives is what gives it big value. The name gives it big value.
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> All right. Let's talk about a man who knows a lot about money, but it's a far different way. As we all know, Donald Trump is a very, very wealthy man. But recently, allegations have surfaced that he may have money problems, and may not be worth as much as he says. So we went to Trump Tower today and spoke to him. And, at times, things got a bit heated.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, Sam, I don't know if you [Inaudible]
<Sam Donaldson> <Neutral> But you know I'm not an accountant.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It makes no difference.
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> Just like you're not a broadcaster.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, you're not an accountant, you're a confrontation.
<Sam Donaldson> <Negative> [Voiceover] Is Donald Trump still a billionaire? Next, when Primetime continues. [Commercial break
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> Donald Trump, the man who loves to deal, the man who says money means nothing to him, except as a means of keeping score, may be hurting on his favorite scoreboard. Suddenly, there's talk that the Trump financial empire is shaky, that the immense debt he's piled up in acquiring his properties could bury him. The most damaging of such suggestions was published this week in Forbes magazine, the respected business publication owned by the late Malcolm Forbes. In an interview with us this morning, Trump made it clear he was furious at what he called "Forbes' hatchet job."
<Sam Donaldson> <Negative> Let's take the Forbes magazine piece. It says that you have a debt of about $3.2 billion, a net worth of about $500 million, and that you're losing money at the rate of $40 million a year. True?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Forbes has been after me for years, consistently after me. They took properties and devalued the properties. They say the Plaza Hotel's not worth what everybody knows it's worth. They say the Taj Mahal -- they include the debt of the Taj Mahal, but not the income. They said that my empire is down to a mere $500 million. I'm saying that the assets are far more valuable than they give them credit for.
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> Okay. How much are you worth?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have absolutely no idea.
<Sam Donaldson> <Negative> [Voiceover] Maybe not, but Forbes has made its own estimate, one that has upset Donald Trump. Trump controls a huge financial empire, no doubt about it. In New York City, he owns luxury apartments and condominiums, including the Trump Tower. He owns premier hotels, including the world-famous Plaza. He owns 100 acres of prime Manhattan real estate for development.
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> [Voiceover] He owns an airline, the Trump Shuttle, which flies between New York, Boston and Washington, and a helicopter service to take gamblers to Atlantic City. There, he owns three hotel-casinos, including his newest, the $1 billion Taj Mahal. And when one adds personal residences, including his Florida estate, and such things as his yacht, it is all staggering.
<Sam Donaldson> <Negative> [Voiceover] Forbes puts Donald Trump's total assets at just under $3.7 billion. But hold on. Trump does not own all this outright. His debt on these assets amounts to almost $3.2 billion, according to Forbes. Subtracting that produces the $500 million Forbes net worth figure. And when Trump announced he might sell his airline, the financial sharks smelled blood.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, this started because I said to a reporter I might sell the shuttle if I got the right price. And all of a sudden, "Why is he selling the shuttle?" That's how it all started. It used to be that if you buy low and sell high, you're a hero. You're the smartest guy, there's nobody like you. Today, if you buy low and sell high, everyone says, "Why is he selling it? What's he doing? Why is he selling it? Does he need the money?" And that's what started all this.
<Sam Donaldson> <Negative> Why are you selling it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm starting it because -- and I'm going to be selling certain things, not necessarily the shuttle. If I got the right price -- I love the shuttle. The shuttle has become very successful. If I got the right price, I would consider selling the shuttle. And because I said --
<Sam Donaldson> <Neutral> What's the right price?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. I mean, I've been offered a lot of money for the shuttle. So far I've turned it down. We'll see what happens. I don't really want to talk about it.
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> Well, now, you put about $400 million in the shuttle, correct?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Probably less than $400 million, yes.
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> Analysts tell us that it's worth about $400 million. What price do you think you can get?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, what does an analyst say? I mean, analysts tell you this -- analysts tell you whatever they want to hear.
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> Well, don't financiers do the same thing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If I -- no, I don't think so. I don't think in all cases, no. Certainly this is one that doesn't. If the shuttle were sold for $500 million, $550 million, $600 million, I would consider that to be a pretty good deal. If I got the right price, I'd probably be inclined to sell it, because I think I can make other investments over the course of the years that are going to be great. Cash is going to be king. The people that have the cash are going to be the people that make the good deals.
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> Well, if cash is going to be king, Mr. Trump, why didn't you start selling a couple of years ago when the market was high?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't think the market's any different for my kind of thing. I think the shuttle --
<Sam Donaldson> <Negative> The real estate market is going in the dumper.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you don't understand. What I own is trophies. The Plaza Hotel, which I wouldn't sell -- but the Plaza Hotel's a trophy. The Taj Mahal, where it has record earnings, that's a trophy. I own trophies. A trophy doesn't go down. Real estate can go down. And I don't know that real estate's going down, if you want to really know the truth. I'm doing a building, Trump Palace, on East 69th Street, and we're getting record prices and record sales. We're doing very well.
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> Well, now, you can't pay your bills with trophies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think you can pay your bills with trophies.
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> [Voiceover] Perhaps Trump's proudest trophy is the Plaza Hotel in New York City, on Central Park South. Looking at the numbers here may help to explain why it is so difficult to value Trump's holdings. Trump bought the Plaza in 1988 for $407 million -- all borrowed, according to Forbes. He put in another $25 million in renovations. Forbes lists the hotel on its asset sheet at $400 million. Trump says that's low. What's it worth today?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's worth a lot of money, but I couldn't tell you what it's worth. I think, when you put up the Plaza -- if the Plaza were ever for sale, it's worth a tremendous amount of money -- more than that, a tremendous amount. But I can't tell you -- look, when the Bel Air Hotel --
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> Well, you told another reporter that the Sultan of Brunei had --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Bel Air Hotel -- excuse me. Excuse me.
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> Well, I -- let's get this in, here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Bel Air Hotel sold for -- excuse me, Sam. You're rude to most people, don't be rude to me. The Bel Air Hotel sold for $1.3 million a room -- $1.3 million a room. The Plaza Hotel -- the Bel Air in Los Angeles. The Plaza Hotel has 800 and some odd rooms. Tell me, if it's a million, does that mean $800 million? I don't know what the Plaza's worth. [Inaudible]
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> My purpose is not to be rude, but we were on the Plaza. And I take your point, that a property is worth what someone will pay for it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It depends. Yeah, absolutely.
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> And you told us you didn't know what it was worth, and I just wanted to remind you that did you not tell a reporter that the Sultan of Brunei had offered you, what, $700 million?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> $750 million. But you have to understand something. I have no idea what it's worth. I don't know what it's worth until I put it up for sale.
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> [Voiceover] Trump has put another of his trophies up for sale -- his yacht, which we caught up with this week in Hong Kong. And, he says, he's about to close the deal. Okay, let's take the Trump Princess. You've got about $50 million in it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How do I have $50 million? I bought the -- I bought it for $29 million, and I spent less than $10 million on fixing it. How do you figure $50 million?
<Sam Donaldson> <Neutral> That's the Forbes figure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Forbes -- you don't understand. Forbes is doing everything they can, possibly, to make me look as bad as possible. Now, that's another thing. I don't believe they valued the Trump Princess. I'm building another yacht, and I don't believe they valued the Trump Princess as what -- I will sell the Trump Princess for $115 million.
<Sam Donaldson> <Negative> Who's going to pay that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A very wealthy man.
<Sam Donaldson> <Neutral> Have you got the deal?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have just about got the deal, yes.
<Sam Donaldson> <Neutral> You mean it's signed?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, it's going to be signed. And if it's not signed by him, it'll be signed by five other people. The Trump Princess is a bargain. Now, just so you understand --
<Sam Donaldson> <Neutral> How can you sell it for -- let me ask you about this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because it's a trophy, because it's the greatest yacht in the world, and because people want to own it. Just so you understand -- I bought a boat --
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> - for $29 million. I'm going to sell it for $115 million. Now, it could be between $100 million and $115 million, net, net, net. But I'm going to sell the boat for between $100 million and $115 million. Forbes doesn't even discuss it! It's like I don't own it.
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> [Voiceover] Trump's financial future may depend on what happens in this building, his brand-new, opulent Atlantic City hotel-casino, the Taj Mahal, which opened last month to such fanfare. Forbes says it's worth just under $835 million, a figure Trump does not dispute. What is in dispute is whether the Taj Mahal can operate in the black. Trump borrowed every penny he has invested in the Taj Mahal. Forbes questions whether he can take in enough money to pay off his debt. He did extremely well in the first few weeks of the hotel's operation. But can he keep it up? You showed us the headline, which I take your point, that you made a tremendous amount of money in less than a month. Now, Forbes says you have to make $1.3 million a day each day of the year, just to service your debt and overhead.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're wrong. You need $1 million a day each day of the year. And $1 million a day is made by -- almost made by Trump Plaza, which is one-third the size of the Taj Mahal.
<Sam Donaldson> <Neutral> But now you have three hotels in Atlantic City.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sam Donaldson> <Negative> Don't they steal from each other?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They might, to a certain extent, and for a certain period of time. Ultimately, they're going to be good for it themselves, and all of Atlantic City. What's going to happen, in my opinion, is that all three hotels, plus the rest of Atlantic City, will do better because of the Taj Mahal.
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> So you think it can sustain this kind of casino take, day in and day out --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, I think so.
<Sam Donaldson> <Negative> - even though, traditionally, in the fall and winter it falls off in Atlantic City.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The building is that great. The building -- look, we're talking about April. April is one of the worst months in Atlantic City.
<Sam Donaldson> <Negative> But all the hoopla.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And in proportion --
<Sam Donaldson> <Neutral> The hoopla -- the start-up hoopla.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It doesn't mean anything. People don't go for hoopla, they go for quality. And in the short --
<Sam Donaldson> <Neutral> Then why do you indulge in a lot of the hoopla promotion, if it doesn't do you any good?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The promotion gets people to look. And now what's happened is, they're all coming back. They love it, they're all coming back.
<Sam Donaldson> <Negative> But it's all borrowed money. You have to service the debt.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why do you say -- do you know my books? Why do you say it's borrowed money?
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> Well, if it's not, tell me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What right do you have to say -- what do you know about borrowed money?
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> All right, let me tell you what I know. All I know is what people write about you. You're right, I haven't seen your books. What they write about you is --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, see, if you were smart, you'd want to see my books, okay? Because you'd see that a lot of the statements you make are false. You'd see that, sure, the shuttle has debt, as everything has debt. If you buy a house --
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> You want to show me your books?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I might almost consider it.
<Sam Donaldson> <Negative> I'm not competent to look over your books.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can see that.
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> But we'll hire a competent firm --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can see that you're not competent to look over the books.
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> - an accounting firm to look over your books.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Truly, I can see that you're not competent to look at the books. What happens is, every asset has -- and I'm sure you're not going to play that. Every -- but now you might, because I said I'm sure you won't. Every asset, every asset has some debt.
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> [Voiceover] Trump resents recent questioning of his financial health. He particularly dislikes the Forbes article written by Richard Stern, a reporter who, once before, wrote that Merv Griffin had bested Trump in a business deal, when it turned out just the other way around, and who now Trump accuses of deliberately excluding income from the Taj Mahal to make his cash-flow figure look bad.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Just so you understand, Forbes -- they included the mortgage, but they didn't include the income! They don't include $34.4 million. It's a disgrace. But again, the same writer that wrote about Merv Griffin, and consistently writes negative about Trump, because, I guess, he doesn't like Trump. I don't like him, he doesn't like me, so we're even.
<Richard Stern> <Positive> Well, I certainly -- Forbes wishes him nothing but the best. We hope he does very well. But I think Mr. Trump's really having a very trying time, these days, personally and financially. And so, you know, perhaps, what he says -- he gets a little hysterical about what he says. But if you look at where we come out computing that he doesn't have enough cash to pay his debts, we don't include the Taj. We include his two other casinos, but not the Taj. To us, it's a wash, at this point. Let's see what happens with the Taj.
<Sam Donaldson> <Neutral> So, in concluding how much money you say that he's spending each year above his income, you don't include the Taj one way or the other?
<Richard Stern> <Neutral> That's correct.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's a total hatchet job.
<Sam Donaldson> <Negative> It's a hatchet job, you say. But it's a hatchet job that could hurt you, because the banks --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It doesn't hurt me. The banks --
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> Well, the banks rely on the name Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Can I tell you? Can I tell you something?
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> And if the name Trump --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, no. If the name Trump gets smeared by people like you, I mean, it's not the greatest thing in the world. But the banks love Trump. Now, it's interesting that Malcolm Forbes has apologized to me, literally, for the last year and a half prior to his death, for the last story they did on me. Every time he'd see me at a function, he'd say, "Donald, I'm sorry about that story. We really got it wrong. We really got it wrong." He's probably spinning in his grave when he sees this.
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> If he were alive today, there wouldn't be this story?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I really don't know. I mean, Malcolm -- you're going to read about this. I think Malcolm had his own problems with me. I do think Malcolm had his own problems.
<Sam Donaldson> <Negative> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You'll read about it in my book, Sam. I think you're going to find the book really good. I hope you buy it.
<Sam Donaldson> <Negative> Will it be titillating?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I won't send one to you, I hope you buy it. Will it be titillating? I don't think it will be titillating in the sense that you're talking about. But it'll be very interesting with regard to Forbes.
<Sam Donaldson> <Negative> If I buy it, can I get a cut rate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You'll get a cut rate. Absolutely.
<Sam Donaldson> <Positive> So Donald Trump will soon be out with his second book. And what titillation there is in it, who can say? Incidentally, Trump declined to discuss his finances with us unless we agreed not to question him about his personal life. But the fact is, much of the uneasiness about Trump's financial health stems from an uncertainty about how his marital troubles could affect his net worth. The public may be amused by Trump's private life, but the banks, who leant him the money, are not.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Tonight: Donald Trump. He is not happy about the Supreme Court's health care decision. How do we know? Well, immediately after the ruling, he tweeted, "The USC" -- meaning United States Supreme Court -- "made a terrible decision today. How can a requirement to buy private health insurance logically be a government tax?" And Donald Trump wasn't finished with that.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> He fired off more tweets with extra harsh words directed at Chief Justice John Roberts. He tweeted, "Justice Roberts turned on his principles with absolutely irrational reasoning in order to get loving press from the Washington establishment. He should be ashamed of himself." Why such tough talk? Donald Trump joins us. Nice to talk to you, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hello, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And I should say you cannot -- you continued today. You posted or tweeted, "Justice Roberts changed his vote in order to make the media happy. He was intimidated by the press." How do you know that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it's what I've heard. It's what I'm hearing from the press. It's what I'm hearing from some of your brethren that cover the Supreme Court. And supposedly, a month ago, he was all set to go, and then all of a sudden, he changed his mind. And frankly, Greta, I was watching and I was watching the kind of horrible press the so-called conservative judges were getting.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I said, You know, I wouldn't be surprised if one of them -- and I sort of thought in terms of Roberts, but one of them -- changed just to curry good favor with the press. And that's what happened. He was totally against -- his decision made no sense whatsoever. It wasn't even rational. And you know, it's come back to haunt him a little bit.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Two things have happened. Number one, the decision itself is not a respected decision even by his opponents because they can't believe he did it. And so that level of respect that he was seeking I don't think he got. And of course, the good news for Mitt Romney -- I think this could really be a huge positive.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've never seen the Republicans so energized as they have been over the last four days.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You know, for me, Donald, it's a little tough to think that a Supreme Court justice would go outside the record and be weak-kneed and be influenced by the crowd, essentially. So it's very -- you know, it's very troubling when I hear that. And I know that everyone seems to believe that and I know people are pointing to irregularities in the decision.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But you know, I certainly think that is -- if that's true, it certainly is a terrible destabilizing for our judicial system and for our system of government.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, Justice Roberts is a smart man and a smart man could not have made this decision because you look at his decision, it's just fraught with ambiguities and inconsistencies and it doesn't make sense. He knows it doesn't make sense. He grasped at the tax concept so that he could justify it. But I have no doubt that he read that unbelievable barrage of -- I was actually saying to myself, I said to other people, You know, somebody is going to come out and do something where they're going to support Obama in order to curry favor.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And that's what's happened. But actually, I think it's turning out to be in reverse for him. I think people have lost respect for what he did. And I have no doubt that he was in favor -- look at what happened during the argument. I mean, he was vocal and vocally against. Now, I'm not saying you can predict judges, and you never really know what's going to happen, and sometimes you get some very, very strong statements and then that judge goes against you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But in this case, everybody knew what was the right thing, and he did the wrong thing. He thought he did the right thing for himself, but I think that's going to turn out to haunt him.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, what's unprecedented here is that the leaks are coming out of the Supreme Court. We never get leaks out of the Supreme Court.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And there seems to be incredible, you know, discontent there and a lot of accusations flying. Assuming the leaks are correct, it does -- you know, it is very -- you know, it's a very -- it's a stain on the court if the court is so vulnerable to outside influence. Now, it could be that Justice Roberts, Chief Justice Roberts, simply intellectually changed his view, but the press he's getting today is rather painful.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, the funny thing is that the leaks are coming from the liberal media. That's the ones that seem to have -- I don't know, you know, I've dealt with press all my life. Some is honest, some is good, some is just horrendous and totally dishonest. So you never know necessarily what to believe. But the leaks are coming mostly from the liberal side of the media, and it's very interesting what they're saying.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But they're basically saying that he was a done deal, and that Kennedy, who should be, by the way, very, very proud of himself for sticking up for his deals and for what's right, maybe even more importantly -- but Kennedy was the one that everybody was concerned about, and he was this way from the beginning.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He was strongly opposed from the beginning. And Roberts changed his tune. And I have no -- look, we're not computers. We're not machines. He decided -- and this has nothing to do with week-kneed. Maybe the opposite, but he decided that he was going to curry favor. And he has! I mean, he's gotten...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But his job is not to curry favor. That is simply not his job!
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely. Of course not.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> His job is to decide -- however the cards fall within the courtroom, within the record that's presented to him, with his intellectual abilities, looking at the Constitution, looking at precedent. But if he's paying attention at all to what is going on outside and listening to the crowd, that's a very different situation.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Greta, his job is to do the right thing and he didn't do the right thing. And that's why they don't have elections and that's why they get -- they're in there for life because they're not supposed to be influenced at all. They're not supposed to -- I guess, in theory, they shouldn't even be reading newspapers.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They should be doing what's right. I have no doubt -- as a human being, I have no doubt that he read the papers and he said, You know what? I'm going to do something that's going to shock people. And man, am I going to be popular in Washington and Georgetown.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Do you think he wants to be popular? I mean, that's such a -- I tell you...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> ... that's so unlike my impression of what the court has been historically. And I guess that's because I'm a lawyer and I -- you know, I have respect for the court system. But to think that a chief justice would be want to, quote, "be popular" with the crowd in Georgetown -- do you really believe that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, I do. Absolutely. And I think less him than -- you know, I -- I really think that some maybe moreso than others, but in this case, I have no doubt that what the liberal media reported was true. He was totally against and strongly against it. He changed his tune all of a sudden. Kennedy was very angry at him, supposedly not talking.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And what is interesting is for the first time that I've ever watched this -- and I've been watching it all my life -- I see that reporters seem to have access to the Supreme Court. Very interesting. I've never seen inside reporting on the Supreme Court before this.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, I think it's because the justices, the colleagues are so furious is why I think that we're hearing things. I mean, the leaks are coming not because everything is fine and dandy inside the court. It's because there's great dissension and people are troubled by what went on inside. I think -- I think that's why we're getting leaks.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think Justice Roberts did a very dishonorable thing. I think what he did was dishonorable because there was no justification for he what did. His decision didn't even make sense. If you read his decision, this is not the decision of a smart man. And frankly, the Kennedy decision was an unbelievably well written, well crafted, and actually angry decision, I suspect angry because of what Roberts did.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But it was an angry decision, but it was also a correct decision.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, I don't -- actually -- you know, Donald, I don't have any problem with the justice, during the course of deliberations and writing opinions, changing his or her mind on how a case should be decided. The only thing that troubles me is if it's outside influence.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> If someone wants to be popular...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Why?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> ... or someone is trying to curry favor, that's what's troubling, not that someone might change his mind.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's called the "why." Why did he change? How come he changed? What was he reading? What was he looking at? What influenced him to make this change? And there's no question that he changed. I mean, it's not, like, Oh, gee, he felt this way from the beginning. There is no question that he changed. And I would tell you that I would think that President Bush, who appointed him, is a very unhappy camper at this point and very embarrassed by it, but he has to be a very, very unhappy camper.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> How do you think that this -- you said earlier that you thought this helped Governor Romney. Governor Romney has through his spokesperson -- not Governor Romney, but Governor Romney through his spokesperson says that he agrees essentially with the White House that this is not a tax. Does that not put him in the wrong position in terms of his -- his constituency?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, Justice Roberts said it was a tax. And I heard the representative say that. I have not heard Mitt say it. But you know, as far as I'm concerned, Justice Roberts said it was a tax. That was the only way he could justify his ridiculous decision. So I would be more inclined to say it was a tax. I think it's frankly better for Mitt if he views it that way.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And what was said was said. But that's up to him. I haven't heard what -- I haven't heard Mitt's take. I've heard people talking, and maybe talking for him, and maybe not. Nobody even knows. But I have not heard his take yet. I will say this. It has energized -- because Mitt is saying he will absolutely knock it out.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> As soon as he gets in, they will start from day one to knock it out. The Republican Party is energized like it was not. It was fine. It was good. Things were going good and there was energy. But now it's got super-energy. And I think in the end, this could really be something very important for Mitt Romney.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Does it matter -- or should Governor Romney come out and say what he thinks it is, whether it's a tax or not a tax, and does that matter?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, he will come out and say. I mean, obviously, you and everybody else that speaks to him -- and I'm sure the first time the reporters speak, this will be the first question. So at some point, he'll come out and say, My preference would be -- and my -- what I say means nothing, but I would just stick with the decision.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They call it a tax. So President Obama brought a tax on all of the millions and millions and millions of us that he said he wasn't going to be taxing. So the people of this country were taxed by somebody that says he was not going to be taxing. Not only is it tax, it's 21 separate taxes. If you look at this, there are 21 separate taxes, smaller ones, bigger ones.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You add them all up, it's a group of anywhere from 19 to 21 taxes going up through the line. And he said he wasn't going to tax. Well, Obamacare is a major tax as far as I'm concerned. Now, Mitt may have a different view on it. He may have a different take on it. And I think that's fine.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, let me switch topics now. Today -- earlier today, the news that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has apologized to Pakistan for the loss of life having to do with the NATO strike last November. The apology has been sort of a bit of a rub between our country and Pakistan because -- and as a consequence, they closed down our supply routes.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Your thoughts on this?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, you know, I have no objection with apologies when somebody does something that was a mistake or something happens. But you know, we should be apologized to also because they housed Usama bin Laden right next to their major military base, and he was there for years and they knew it. And to think that they didn't know it is idiotic.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So I mean, maybe they should be apologizing to us. We've been feeding them billions and billions of dollars, tremendous amounts of money. And they'd been housing, you know, at the time, I would say, psychologically, at least, our worst enemy. So maybe they should apologize to us.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, we -- are we sort of cornered on this, though, because apparently, it's cost us about $2 billion to go through a different supply route for our troops, going through -- going through Russia. It's cost us a lot more money because of Pakistan closing down their routes. So we've sort of gotten into a little bit of a squeeze.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Either we apologized or didn't. It saves us a lot of money. On the other hand, you know, they didn't -- you know, we have not heard an apology from them at all for housing and giving safe haven to Usama bin Laden.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, they don't apologize to us because they don't respect us. It's very simple. And frankly, if it cost us $2 billion -- and I hadn't heard that number. I had heard a smaller number. But if it cost us $2 billion, let's deduct it from their foreign aid. Very easy to solve. We just deduct it out from their foreign aid -- if we should be giving them foreign aid at all because I'm looking at what's going on over there, and they are certainly not our friend.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, earlier today, you also tweeted this. It says, "Just as I predicted" [Inaudible] that "I" is you -- "Barack Obama is preparing a possible attack on Iran right before November." Do you believe that the president is looking to take us into military conflict?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, he's a lousy negotiator, so if you can't negotiate peacefully an do -- I mean, we have all the cards because, I mean, Iran is crazy if they don't sit down and negotiate because the same thing is going to happen to them as happened to Iraq and so many other places. And it'll be long and nasty, but ultimately, it's the end of Iran as you know it today.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So we have all the cards. And frankly, this is a great time for the right person to negotiate something without having to do this. But I've been predicting -- and I did it on your show first -- that, yes, I believe that we will end up in a war with Iran because I think Obama views that as politically good for him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's in a poll, and I see the polls that just came out this morning, where he's actually losing really for the first time, and he's losing in swing states, most importantly, and he's losing fairly substantially. Now, maybe that's accurate, and maybe it's not. And polls are oftentimes wrong. And I've watched them all different ways.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But he's losing in swing states. I have said for a year-and-a-half that in the end, we'll end up with -- - somewhere before the election, we will end up in a form of war with Iran. And I think he's doing it for political reasons. There is no way -- if you send in the right person to negotiate -- we'll win much more than we ever could win through war.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And we have all the cards. They have no cards right now.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You know, Donald -- Donald, you know, it gets mean and ugly in this city and people fire shots back across the bow all the time, Democrats and Republicans. But when it comes to the issue of war or military conflict, you're saying that the president is really thinking about doing the unthinkable for political advantage, for himself, taking us to war.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And that -- I mean, that -- you know, I think most people would say that's -- that's -- that's beyond.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I don't think...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You know, that's beyond [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... it's beyond. That's my opinion. And I think that's my opinion, and let's see what happens. I hope that doesn't happen. By the way, if that happens, oil prices are going to shoot up like never before. But I think that's what will happen. But we'll see. I mean, look, what should happen is Iran has to be -- despite their bravado, they have to be scared stiff right now because, I mean, they've just looked at what's happened to other countries because we are the most powerful and what we've done to others, whether we should have been there or shouldn't have been there, is unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So what should happen is the right person should negotiate a phenomenal deal, everything. We should get 100 percent of everything. I have predicted that I think it's not going to go that way. We don't negotiate. We don't know how to negotiate. Why didn't we ask Libya? We say, Hey -- you know, when the -- when the rebels came in, they said, We're being routed.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We've only got one day left. Why didn't Obama say, We want half your oil? They would have given us everything. Instead, you know who's getting their oil right now? China. We spend the money -- we -- let's not say free Libya because the ones that take over Libya are going to make everybody else look very bad, believe me, and it's going to be the group that dislikes the United States the most.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But the point is this. We could have said as an example, We want half your oil. They would have said, Where do we sign? We don't do that. So we don't have negotiators. We don't have the right people. And if we did, we wouldn't have war and we'd get much more than we could ever win through war. And as you know, I'm a fairly militaristic person, to put it mildly.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But we can do better without it. But I have said that he would use that, in my opinion, for political purposes, yes.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, one quick last question. Who's on the top of your list for who you think the -- Governor Romney should pick as a vice president? Who do you think would be his best choice?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I don't want to say, but... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right. I don't want to say, but there's some very good choices. I feel we have some very, very...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, well, give me a hint. Come on! Give me a hint.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think Rubio is a good choice. I think Chris Christie is a good choice. I think Portman is a good choice. I think we have some really good choices, I mean, some very good people, each bringing very different things to the fore. But you know, in the end, it's all about Mitt because people don't really go for the vice president.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, they don't -- and this has been proven over many, many years of history. They don't vote for the vice president, they vote for the president. But I think he's got great -- whether it's Chris Christie or Portman or Rubio, I think he's got some great choices.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, if have -- if you have the governor's ear for just a second, you could give him a piece of advice tonight, what would it be?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, just hold the course. Stay the course. He's doing well. He's solid. He's very, very smart. I really think that, to a large extent, this is a referendum on Obama. He said he was not going to have deficits. He was going to cut the deficit in half. The deficit is through the roof. We're up to almost $17 trillion now, a word that we never even heard before, the word "trillion." But we're up to almost $17 trillion.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If you look back to the early days, he said, I will cut the deficit in half. Well, the exact opposite's happened. So this is really something where I think if Mitt just stays the course, we will have a new president. And he'll be a great president.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you very much.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Congratulations. You moved into the White House. How is it?
<Melania Trump> <Positive> We are enjoying it very much.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> How about Barron with school?
<Melania Trump> <Positive> He loves it, yes. All settled. He loves it here.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Are you missing New York?
<Melania Trump> <Positive> Not really. I'm so busy, and we're doing so many great stuff, so it's a really special place, and I love it here.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> And tonight?
<Melania Trump> <Positive> Tonight, it's a great picnic, Congressional picnic, with all of us getting together. It's New York... New York City team, and we have Carousel, and great stuff outside.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Big news today. You said you didn't tape James Comey. Do you want to explain that? Why did you want him to believe you possibly did that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I didn't tape him. You never know what's happening when you see that the Obama administration, and perhaps longer than that, was doing all of this unmasking and surveillance. And you read all about it and I've been reading about it for the last couple of months about the seriousness and horrible situation with surveillance all over the place. And you've been hearing the word "unmasking," a word you probably never heard before. So you never know what's out there, but I didn't tape and I don't have any tape and I didn't tape. But, when he found out that there may be tapes out there, whether it's governmental tapes or anything else, and who knows, I think his story may have changed. I mean, you'll have to take a look at that because then he has to tell what actually took place at the events. And my story didn't change. My story was always a straight story. My story was always the truth. But you'll have to determine for yourself whether or not his story changed. But, I did not tape.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> That was a smart way to make sure he stayed honest in those hearings.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it wasn't very stupid, I can tell you that. He did admit that what I said was right. And if you look further back, before he heard about that, I think maybe he wasn't admitting that, so, you'll have to do a little investigative reporting to determine that. But, I don't think it'll be that hard.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Robert Muller, do you think he should recuse himself from this, because he is good friends with James Comey, he's hired some some attorneys that were part of Hillary Clinton's Foundation, had given money to President Obama and Hillary Clinton's campaign. Should he recuse himself?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he is very very good friends with Comey, which is very bothersome, but he's also... We're gonna have to see. I mean, we're gonna have to see in terms... Look, there has been no obstruction. There has been no collusion. There has been leaking by Comey. But there's been no collusion, no obstruction and virtually everybody agrees to that. So we'll have to see. I can say that the people that have been hired are all Hillary Clinton supporters. Some of them worked for Hillary Clinton. I mean the whole thing is ridiculous, if you want to know the truth, from that standpoint. But Robert Mueller is an honorable man, and hopefully he'll come up with an honorable solution.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Today there's four senators that are not supporting this health care bill, four Republican senators. What is your message to them, because your supporters that voted for you are a little frustrated, because you have the White House, you have the House... Republicans have the House and the Senate, but you have these senators that are not on board.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they're also four good guys and they're four friends of mine, and I think that they'll probably get there, we'll have to see. You know, health care is a very difficult situation. If you look, the Clintons tried to get it and after years and years they couldn't do it. Obamacare was murder for them to get, and now it's failed. It's virtually out of business. Obamacare is a disaster, and we're trying to do something in a very short period of time, It's interesting, in that I have been here for only five month. People saying, where's the health care? Where's the health care? Well, I've done in five months what other people haven't done in years, and it's been... People have worked on health care for many years. It's a very complicated situation, from the standpoint you do something that's good for one group, but bad for another. It's a very, very narrow path. But I think we're going to get there. We have four very good people that, it's not that they're opposed, they'd like to get certain changesm and we'll see if we can take care of that
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> We're getting word now that some Democrats even want Nancy Pelosi to step down. A lot of Republicans think Democrats are in denial. They didn't win the.. The special elections. They don't have the House. They don't have the Senate. They don't have the the White House. What do the Democrats need to do? Are they in denial and what do they need to do to get on board?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, first of all I hope she doesn't step down. I think that it would be a very, very sad day for Republicans if she steps down. I'd be very, very disappointed if she did. I'd like to keep her right where she is, because our record is extraordinary against her. But we'll see what happens. There has been a lot of talk about her stepping down. We'll have to see what happens. The victory in Atlanta was very big, they spent $30 million. We had a candidate who did a very, very good job. I think I helped a lot, and we had a great candidate. But we were 5 and 0, as you know, in these special elections, and I think the Democrats thought it would be a lot different than that. Five and 0 is a big... That's a big margin. And this last one was very interesting, because they put everything into it. Every consultant, they had agencies, advertising agencies I mean think of it.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> Hollywood?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hollywood came out, and in the end we won. Quite easily, much... You know, by a bigger margin than anybody would have thought. So, they're gonna have to do something. I will say this: they are, right now, obstructionists. All they want to do is try and obstruct. I think they'd do much better as a party if they got along with us, if they called us and said: let's work on health care together. Let's work on tax cuts together and tax reform. Let's work on infrastructure together. We can do it together. I honestly think they'd do better at the polls. I think the American public is tired of obstructionists, and I honestly believe that, and when I say that, boy would the people love to see two parties getting together and coming up with the perfect health care plan. Because Obamacare has failed now, it's dead. The insurance companies are all flocking and leaving, and it's a real problem.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> Wouldn't that be refreshing if we all came together?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It'd be so nice. And that's the way it should be, and there have been moments in our country's history where that's what happened, and those were the greatest things. Whether it was Social Security or Medicare, it was two parties got together and came up with great solutions to problems. I don't think that's going to happen, but that is what should happen.
