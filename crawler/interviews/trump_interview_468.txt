<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Earlier, we heard Sarah Palin tell Barbara Walters that she can beat President Obama in 2012, but first she may have to beat another reality TV star in the Republican primary.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> A close confidante of billionaire developer, Donald Trump, has set up a website touting a White House run, and The Apprentice star gave me an exclusive interview yesterday to talk about it. [Begin recorded interview] Do you believe that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's a very nice statement.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> Do you accept?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll tell you, I am thinking about things. And I'm looking at this country, George, and what's happened in terms of respect. I have many people from China that I do business with. They laugh at us. They feel we're fools. You know, they're getting away with absolute murder. They're making the products that we used to make in this country -- they're making them in China. We're rebuilding China.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> If you were president, what would be different?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd do things very strongly. I'd tax China. They manipulate the currency. By manipulating the currency, it's very hard to complete with China.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> You tax China, they stop financing our debt, our economy collapses.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We tax China, we'll pay off that debt very quickly because that's the kind of --
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> Why would you they go for it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They don't have to. It's us. It's us. We have the cards because we're the ones that are spending all of this money in China.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> But don't they have the cards because they're our bankers?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think so at all. I've had bankers over the years. I don't think the bankers have the cards.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> So how serious is this? I mean, you set up an exploratory committee back in 1999 -- I think we talked then -- and then decided not to run.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, in 1999, a group of people wanted me to run. I never wanted to run, and I never was a big believer in the independent party at that time. And it really -- I was lucky that I didn't do it because they really self-destructed.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> So walk us through your thought process. What are the triggers that could get you into this race?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Would I rather be in the race or not be in the race? I can tell you I love what I'm doing. I'm having a great time what I'm doing. Although, it could --
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> But you're talking about it, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. It could be fun because I'd like to see some positive things happen for the country. When people tell me from other countries that they no longer respect our country -- now, whether you like Ronald Reagan or didn't like Ronald Reagan, I mean, there was a level of respect for this country that we had.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> Do you think President Obama doesn't have that? He's had periods where he's quite popular around the world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, initially he was. I mean, certainly, initially he was. But we cannot let the rest of the world beat us up. I mean, we're like a whipping post right now.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> So if you ran, you'd run as a Republican; correct?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am a Republican. I would run as a Republican, yes.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> When you look at the field now, we've got Sarah Palin --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very interesting.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> ' -- she's really thinking hard about it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hey, same producer. Mark Burnett produced her show, produces The Apprentice But Sarah Palin, hey, she's very interesting. And don't underestimate her. I mean, I see what she does. Do not underestimate Sarah Palin.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> Would you take her on if she gets in --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, if I ran, I'd have no choice. I would take her on. I like her, but I'd take her on.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> Let me go back to my original question then. What's it going to take for you to get in?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm going to make a decision, probably, by June.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> You're worth more than a billion dollars. How much are you willing to spend?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I'd spend a lot. Yeah, I'm worth a lot --
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> But Meg Whitman might have spent about $200 million, maybe just a little less, to try to be governor of California.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She didn't work for whatever reason. She was very smart, very this, very that; it didn't work.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> One place where it worked was here in New York City where Mayor Bloomberg spent a lot of his fortune to get elected the first time around. He's looked at the presidential race. Do you think he could do it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's a very good friend of mine. I don't know if he can do it as a Republican because he's got -- he's a little bit on the liberal side of things. So getting the nomination --
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Are you pro-choice?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me?
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Are you pro-choice?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am -- well, I don't want to discuss right now, but you will be shocked when I give you that answer. Okay?
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> How can I be shocked?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you will be very surprised what I give you. I'm going to make a decision, and when I make a decision, I'll let you know about that. But I think you'd probably be surprised.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> I'm having a hard time figuring out how serious you are about this. You're, obviously, passionate about a lot of issues, but you've walked up to this line --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm passionate about the country.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> So isn't another reality show?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. I've done very well. I've had a show that, for many nights, was the number-one show on television. I don't need that.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> Well, when you're ready to make a decision in June, you call us up.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You'll be right there.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> Good to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, George.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> Thank you. [End recorded interview]
