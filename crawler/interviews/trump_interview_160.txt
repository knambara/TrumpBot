<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> Mr. President, thanks for doing this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> So we saw you sign the agreement right in this room. You also said you developed a special bond with Kim. Describe that bond.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's been a very intense day, and as you know, we discussed things over the last few months.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> You did? You've spoken with him before?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I have spoken, yes, I have spoken to him, I have spoken to a lot of his people, his, as you know, his, I would say very top person was at the White House last week. And so we've developed a pretty good relationship in terms of getting something done. It got done. I think it's a terrific document. It's a starter, but it's a terrific document. I think far more -- and there are things that we negotiated after that document that are also very important.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> Like what?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're going to get rid of certain ballistic missile sites and various other things. We're gonna put that out later. But we have the framework of getting ready to denuclearize North Korea.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> Yeah, and the phrase in the document is "complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula." Does that mean that the nuclear umbrella that we have over South Korea is on the table for negotiation?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. That means that they're going to get rid of their nuclear weapons. We never even discussed the other. They're going to get rid of their nuclear weapons, George, and I think they want to do it relatively quickly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, we're going to see. I mean, they're going to start working on it immediately. We're going to work with South Korea. We're going to work with Japan. We're going to work with China. But it really has been an incredible exercise.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> You've set the bar for nuclear agreements by criticizing the Iran nuclear deal, said it's the worst deal ever made.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Terrible deal.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> Does that mean that any deal with North Korea has to be tougher than the Iran deal?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think a deal could be softer. First of all, we're not paying $150 billion, OK, we're paying nothing from that standpoint other than, you will see what happens. I think there's going to be a great partnership with Japan and South Korea. President Moon has been terrific.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> But they have to get --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> President Abe has been terrific.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> But they have to get rid of all their nuclear weapons?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have to get rid of, yeah, I think that they will. I really believe that he will. I've gotten to know him well in a short period of time.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Did he tell you that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, he's de-nuking, I mean he's de-nuking the whole place. It's going to start very quickly. I think he's going to start now. They'll be announcing things over the next few days talking about other missile sites because they were, as you know, they were sending out a lot of missiles. It was a period of time where I was saying, what are they doing? Every week it seems another missile going up. I mean, they're going to be getting rid of sites.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> Is he going to stop testing?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How many months has it been, George? Seven? Where there's been no missiles going out?
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> He's committed to not starting that up again?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's committed to not starting again. That won't be happening. He means it he really wants to do something I think terrific for their country and it's the only way it can be it's the only way it can be terrific.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> How long is it going to take?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, if you look at, if you talk to the experts, you can't just do it immediately.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Some say 15 years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It takes a period of time. Some say 15 years, if you go rapidly. But when you're in the process of doing it, you're really dismantling, in other words, you can't do anything during that period of time. But they have a process for getting rid of nukes that does take, it's not like, oh gee, we'll get rid of them tomorrow.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It just can't be done scientifically. But they're gonna do it. They're gonna start immediately. They really already started. They blew up a site, which was the real deal site that was their big site, they've blown it up. They're getting rid of things that haven't been mentioned in the document, they're getting rid of certain missile areas and they're not going to be sending missiles up. They're not doing research --
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> And they're going to announce that and confirm it as well? These additional steps --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Say it?
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> The north koreans are going to announce these additional steps as well?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah they're going to be announcing them shortly, they might have announced them already but after we signed we agreed to that also, and I'm doing something that I've wanted to do from the beginning.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We stopped playing those war games that cost us a fortune. You know, we're spending a fortune, every couple of months we're doing war games with South Korea, and I said, "What's this costing?" We're flying planes in from guam, we're bombing empty mountains for practice. I said "I want to stop that and I will stop that, and I think it's very provocative —
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Could you talk --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Especially, George, since, we're getting along. In other words, we're in --
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> Did you talk about pulling troops out?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- process of signing something. Excuse me?
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> Did you talk about pulling troops out? U.S. troops out of South Korea.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We didn't discuss that, no. But we're not gonna play the war games. You know, I wanted to stop the war games, I thought they were very provocative. But I also think they're very expensive. We're running the country properly, I think they're very, very expensive. To do it, we have to fly planes in from Guam -- that's six and a half hours away. Big bombers and everything else, I said, "Who's paying for this?" I mean, who pays, in order to practice.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> What are the kinds of security --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So one of the things that I suggested and I wanna do is we're going to stop the war games, unless for some reason, we're unable to go further.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> What other kinds of security guarantees did you offer, did you put on the table?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we've given him, I don't wanna talk about it specifically, but we've given him, he's going to be happy. His country does love him. His people, you see the fervor. They have a great fervor. They're gonna put it together, and I think they're going to end up with a very strong country, and a country which has people -- that they're so hard working, so industrious. I think if you look at South Korea, someday, maybe in the not too distant future, it will be something that.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> You say his people love him. Just a few months ago you accused him of starving his people. And listen, here's the rub. Kim is a brutal dictator. He runs a police state, forced starvation, labor camps. He's assassinated members of his own family. How do you trust a killer like that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> George, I'm given what I'm given, okay? I mean, this is what we have, and this is where we are, and I can only tell you from my experience, and I met him, I've spoken with him, and I've met him. And this was, as you know, started very early and it's been very intense. I think that he really wants to do a great job for North Korea.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he wants to denuke, it's very important. Without that, there's nothing to discuss. That was on the table at the beginning, and you see a total denuclearization of North Korea -- so important. And, he wants to do the right thing. Now, with all of that being said, I can't talk about -- it doesn't matter. We're starting from scratch. We're starting right now, and we have to get rid of those nuclear weapons.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> How do you trust him, though? Is he willing to change? Do you believe he's changed?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, over my lifetime I've done a lot of deals with a lot of people, and sometimes the people that you most distrust turn out to be the most honorable ones, and the people that you do trust they are not the honorable ones, so we are starting from a very high plane, we're starting from a very good relationship. This has been a very big day in terms of the world. I think it's been, maybe I -- a lot of people have been saying it's historic.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> We're all calling it historic.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, even my enemies are calling it historic. And you know, the fact is that we've done something that's very unique. Nobody's met with the family, nobody at a high level --
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> — no president has.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No president has, certainly. And we've done something that we're very proud of. It's a very strong document.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> His father made agreements with the United States and then said he was going to freeze the nuclear weapons then backslid. Didn't keep the commitments.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right, and he talks about that. He said that, you know, there are reasons he didn't because he was let down by the United States, but that's irrelevant. What he's doing, and and he very much said that, he said you know over the years -- first of all, they've never gone this far, you know, they've never been at a level like this, and his father never dealt with a president, and a lot of other things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But he said, it's very much on his mind. He said, "We are going to get this done." In the past we've tried, but it never worked out and it never did work out. And it was embarrassing actually to the United states and to our leadership. This is different, I believe you'll find in the years to come, George. I think you're going to find this different.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> How are you going to know he's keeping his word, he's committed to this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're going to be following things. We're going to be monitoring things. We're dealing with him very, on a constant basis. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did a very very good job, great energy. And they have a great relationship, his counterpart. They have a really good relationship. They're moving along, they're getting it done. I mean, I've been up 24 hours now straight between phone calls and working it. This is a very, look this is 72 years we're talking about, and we put it into one very intensive day and some meetings beforehand.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> And, but a lot of people look at Kim Jong Un and say there is no way he is ever giving up those nuclear weapons, that's why he survives, that's why he was in this room today.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think we have to disagree. Otherwise I wouldn't be here or I would have respectfully, you know, I would have shaken his hand. I would have said, listen, I'll see you sometime. But I wouldn't have had any interest. No, this was very important, it's in the first paragraph and it says complete total denuclearization. Without that I wouldn't have been interested. I believe that he wants to get it done.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> You trust him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do trust him, yeah. Now, will I come back to you in a year and you'll be interviewing and I'll say, gee I made a mistake? That's always possible. You know, we're dealing at a very high level, a lot of things can change, a lot of things are possible. He trusts me, I believe, I really do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, he said openly, and he said it to a couple of reporters that were with him that he knows that no other president ever could have done this, I mean no other pre–he knows the presidents, he knows who we had in front of me. He said no other president could have done this. I think he trusts me, and I trust him.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> Ronald Reagan said trust but verify.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> How do you verify this commitment?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're going to be verifying, and we're going to be working with them. And it's going to be much more open than it is right now. Right now it's obviously very closed, it's a very closed society we know very little about. You know, if you ask intelligence, they will tell you probably they know less about this area of the world than they do any place, anywhere in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to be working very closely with him. We've developed great relationships at different levels. Mike Pompeo has got really, very good, strong relationships and others have also. Today, we introduced him to John Bolton which was a very interesting thing, and --
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> He says, how do you know Kim Jong Un is lying, his lips are moving?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the end of that conversation, it was good. I think they have a good trust.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> This has been a dizzying few days of diplomacy --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> True.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> -- for you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> You know, you're reaching out here to Kim Jong Un -- longtime enemy of the United States. Coming off of that summit in Canada with those tough words for the Canadian prime minister. How do you explain that to people who might be confused, that we're reaching out to our enemies, antagonizing allies.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, no, I have great friendships. If you speak to Prime Minister Abe, who I'm helping a lot, because, you know, Japan, three or four times they had missiles going right over the middle of japan. I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Abe. I have great relationship with the new man who I like a lot as you know from Italy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He just won and you know, we had very good. And frankly really good with Merkel. Really good pretty much with all of them. I was very surprised because we actually were getting ready to sign a document, I made them make various changes. And you know the so called semi-famous picture of --
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> I've seen the picture.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. She was looking at me, you know what we were doing? We were talking while we were waiting for the final copy of the document. That was, that was such an innocent picture. You know, we put out that picture. That was put out by my people. That was really a picture of me sitting this way. And I'm waiting for the document so we can final read it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What happened is we had a final document. I wasn't a hundred percent, but I wanted to leave nicely, so we had a document. I get into Air Force One, the television's on, and I see a news conference being given by the prime minister of Canada. And Justin. And I said, "Oh that's nice, Justin's giving a" -- And then he talked about how they won't be bullied. And I said "What's this all about? He didn't do that to my face, what's this all about?"
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But here's what the story is: We have been taken advantage of as a country for decades by friends and enemies both. We have been, our trade is a disaster, our trade deals. We lose eight hundred and seventeen billion dollars was the last count on a yearly basis. Think of it, George. In other words, when you add China and all of the other places, Germany, the European Union is a disaster for us.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We lost a hundred and fifty one billion dollars last year. Billion, not not million. We lost a hundred and fifty one billion. They don't take our product. They won't take our agriculture. They won't. We lost a hundred and fifty one. Now they were at the meeting. The European Union. I can't be thrilled. I let "em know. And I said, fellas we gotta change it. And if you don't change it, we're not going to do trading.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> Fin --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just do want to say, though, that picture was supposed to be a friendly picture. That was put out by us. And we were waiting for the document to come back so we could read it. I left, everybody was happy, everybody shook. You should ask Prime Minister Abe. Everybody was happy. And then he gave out a little bit of an obnoxious thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I actually like Justin, you know, I think he's good, I like him, but he shouldn't have done that. That was a mistake. That's going to cost him a lot of money.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Neutral> Final question. When is Kim coming to the White House?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I want to get it along. I want the process to start. I want to see some real work going on, which I believe I will, and I would love to have him at the White House -- whatever it takes, and I would love to have him at the White House, and I think he'd love to be there. And at a certain point when it's all complete I'd love to be there.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> Mr. President, thanks for having us here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, George. Thank you.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Positive> Thank you.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And welcome to "Hannity," and we're coming to you from the Pabst Theater. We're in beautiful Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Tomorrow, voters in this great state will head to the polls and choose who they want to be the 2016 presidential nominee. On the Republican side, 42 delegates are up for grabs. Tonight, for the full hour, GOP front-runner Donald Trump with a special guest, his wife, Melania.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And we invited people from all over Wisconsin to be apart of our audience tonight. We have a lot to get to, so let's welcome the 2016 Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and his wife, Melania.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Great to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What a group. Thank you.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> I don't think you'd ever get sick of this, right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you. This is so great. Nice place. Beautiful theater.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> So you had been -- RealClearPolitics average, you were down 6.5 percent, but a poll just came out earlier tonight that has you up by 10 in the state. Is that possible?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, a very good poll, a good company. Let's see what happens. And then the only poll that matters is tomorrow, right?
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> That's true. That's true.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So [Inaudible]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> [Inaudible] never get a chance to talk to Melania. I'm going to start with Melania. Great to see you. Thank you for joining us here in Wisconsin.
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> Of course. It's great to be here.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You didn't want Donald to run.
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> Well, when we discussed and he asked me, I said, you know -- we have a great life because I know life changes after, you know, all that's going on.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> It's changed a lot, right?
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> It's changed a lot, and you know, he's not home much and with me or with my son. So it's changed. That's why I said. But I know what he could do for the America, so...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> It's -- it's tough on families. I mean, when they run a -- a super-PAC ad attacking you, is that painful?
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> I have a tough skin. I think it's not fair that they're attacking family, wife or children.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Yes.
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> It's unfair.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Yes, all right. Now, my wife gives me great advice in my life. Right, guys? We know what that's like? We get our best advice from our wife. You have said you want Donald to be more presidential sometimes. [Audience member yells "Go Trump"]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Explain that.
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> Well, sometimes I feel that, you know, the retweets sometimes get him in trouble, so just -- I say stay away from -- you know, stay away from retweets and... [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She does say that.
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> And you know, if he would only listen! [Laughter]
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> I could [Inaudible] every day and every time. But you know, he's doing great.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Is there a side of him that maybe you think the public doesn't know that you would want them to know about him?
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> I think he's very kind. He has a great heart. He would not harm anybody. He would not harm women or men. He's really a great, great guy. You know, beautiful heart. And he loves to help and so...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Let me -- by all accounts, you've had a pretty tough week. You actually said something in interviews with both Maureen Dowd and Bob Woodward that a lot of people were hoping you would do at some point. And you said, You know what? I think I shouldn't have sent that tweet out about Heidi Cruz.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think I really said, Hey, I could've done without it. And it's true. And I wish I didn't send it out. It would have been simpler. It was done as a little bit of retaliation. But in the end, it's so -- you know, it's just something -- if I had it to do again, I would not have done it.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Yes. Well, you know, you just had your eighth grandchild...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> This whole issue when you were on with Chris Matthews -- I was watching the interview -- he never shuts up. [Laughter, Audience Boos]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> It's just so annoying. Sorry, it's true. And I was watching the interview and he's grilling you and pushing and pushing at a hypothetical question on abortion. That became a problem for a few days. And I just thought I'd give you an opportunity in your own words to talk about abortion. Ted Cruz took the position today he doesn't make exceptions for rape, incest or the mother's life.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Is there a difference in your position?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Inaudible] Lyin' Ted. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Lyin' Ted. We don't know what, but he lies. Lyin' Ted, L-Y-I-N apostrophe, right? Lyin' Ted.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And how does... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So look, I will say this. You know I'm pro-life, OK, and with the exceptions. But -- but I am pro-life. I did the show because it's not a high-rated show. He's always been -- I mean, he has never treated me very badly, and frankly, he...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> He treats you badly when you're not there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, perhaps, I mean, but he's always been, you know, fine.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> So he's a phony.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I -- I didn't think it was a big thing to do the show, and it was a hypothetical question. And as a hypothetical question, you give a hypothetical answer, and I didn't see the big, big huge deal. And I will tell you this, Sean, and I'll say it, and we can, you know, have this out. But so many people called me up and they thought that was a very strong answer and a very good -- Pastor Jeffress, who's a fantastic guy who's been on your show...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Many times.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... a great man...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> But the reality is, that's not the law.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And -- well, he said -- but as a hypothetical question, that was a hypothetical answer that was not a wrong answer. And there were other people that wrote me letters, and I mean, by the hundreds, saying, that was a great answer to that question the way it was phrased.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Did he make exceptions -- because it's a -- look, it's a very sensitive issue. It's a very personal issue. I know that my position of making exceptions for rape, incest and the mother's life are inconsistent a little bit with my belief that life begins at conception.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Do you make those exceptions?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I do. I mean, I come with the three exceptions, and it's -- I think it's very important. But I will say that -- I mean, to me it's very important. I will say I watched Kasich being interviewed on a channel. I won't even say it. It didn't happen to be yours. He gave -- they were talking about abortion, and he gave such a bad answer -- it was so bad that at the end, he said, I don't want to talk about it anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't want to talk about it. If I ever did that, if I ever gave that answer, it would have been 10 times bigger headlines. And I said, I wonder -- oh, he's going to get killed. And I'm saying to myself, He's going to get killed for that answer. Nobody ever said anything. Nobody ever talks about it.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> He doesn't have a chance to win.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, whatever. Nobody -- nobody cares. I mean...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Crazy.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> So I want to ask this audience because it became such a distraction. I watched the videotape at least 150 times. Did anybody see anything that looked like an assault? If you do, just...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> I didn't see it. [Audience Member shouts "No"]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> The easier thing would have been to fire your campaign manager, make that problem go away. And you were asked a lot about that over the weekend. You wouldn't do it. Why?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Amazing the way he shifted to that topic. I mean, he went from it to assault. And I said, Wait a minute. He's talking about -- look, I have a campaign manager who's a very -- he's a very good campaign manager. He's doing a great job, and all of this stuff. I mean...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look, hopefully, I can say he has an OK candidate, right? He has an OK candidate, but he is -- I mean, we're number one by a lot. We're leading by millions of votes. Nobody ever talks about the votes. They -- you know -- by millions and millions of votes over Cruz and over Kasich.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Nobody ever talks about that. And we're also leading by -- you know, we just won Missouri. We -- Missouri just came in. But we're leading by close to 300 delegates. So we're leading by a lot. Corey is -- forget about campaign managers. He's doing great. But Corey's a fine person. He's a good person. He's got four beautiful children.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's got a wife who's a terrific woman. He lives in New Hampshire, where I have a warm spot because that was my first victory. I mean, I love New Hampshire, right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So -- so I read the statement made by this person, who I didn't know -- Michelle Fields. She's a reporter. And you have to find out, did she quit or did she get fired? Because, you know, I heard a story about what happened, that they -- they were pretty tough on her because of -- they didn't necessarily believe it. I'm not saying -- you're going to have to ask them.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm sure they'll eventually have to talk about it. But when I saw the tape -- I saw her -- first I saw her statement that she was practically thrown to the ground. I said, That's terrible! And I would have fired him on the spot if that actually took place. Then I have very good security in my place. I have beautiful security cameras all over for -- not for this.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> [Inaudible] for the heads-up. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By the way, not for this, but, you know...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Whatever reason.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So I have these great security cameras. I said, Do me a favor. Check those cameras. Maybe there's something. So I read her statement that she was thrown to the ground or almost thrown to the ground and gripped. Now I see her in the tape, right? First of all, she grabbed me or touched me or whatever, but she grabbed.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And you see me looking and -- and -- like this, right? Number one, she wasn't supposed to be there because we had just finished a -- a press conference. But here's the thing. I saw Corey -- and on your show, on various shows, they've had criminal defense lawyers there. Everybody says, What did he do? He didn't do anything.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How can I fire a man and ruin a man's life -- and most of you have seen the tape -- I mean, if anything...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'll tell you, if anything -- and -- and I say this -- and you know, the easiest thing would have been -- it's so sad -- if I would have fired him, it would have been so much easier. This would be -- I can't do that. I'm loyal to people. I'm loyal to the country. I'll be loyal to the people of the country!
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, when I -- when I saw -- and you know what I'm talking about because I've seen a lot of different shows. Not even yours. Yours too. But I've seen a lot of different shows where they have lawyers on, and they're showing the tape. And virtually every single one of them said, What did he do? It was almost that he was running interference.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Number one, she wasn't supposed to be there. She cut in front of Secret Service.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Well, but the -- it was -- the press conference was over.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was over. And it was a long press conference.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And he had put the hand out, No more questions. That's what I saw.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And she wasn't supposed to be asking me -- so that's not a big deal. She's [Inaudible] She shouldn't have been there. That's a certain space that you have with Secret Service, not supposed to be there. And if you look at him, he basically ran interference. I mean, it's not like -- now, do I destroy a man's life?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because you know, if I fired him, that would be the destruction of his life professionally, in my opinion. Do I do that? Then I guess she reported him to the police department. And I mean, he's got charges, and for what? And people are looking -- she grabbed me. She touched me. I looked down. You can see I'm pulling my arm, you know, as they run it slowly.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's not supposed to be there. Now, maybe I should file charges against her for grabbing me or touching me.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, maybe I should file.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Let me ask -- so I -- I think it -- you have now been...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By the way, Jupiter, Florida, is a great place. I, I respect it so much.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> It was a Hillary prosecutor. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I want to tell you -- I want to tell you, I think it's a real black eye to justice and to criminal justice when somebody gets in trouble...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> For nothing!
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I always say thank goodness we had that tape because I can imagine -- you know, when she saw that tape, all of a sudden, the story sort of changed a little bit. It wasn't -- remember, you have to look at her first statement -- pulled to the ground or almost pulled to the ground. And it was, like, pretty vicious-sounding.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And then I saw the tape. So I think people should look at that. I think it's a great injustice.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Let me ask this question. You now -- do you remember the day you came down Trump Towers? Melania was with you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Your family was there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You've been at this what, nine months?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Nine months.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> From June 16th.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> What -- what have you learned the most about our political system, especially coming off of a hard week? [Audience shouts]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well -- what? What? You wait. What was that? [Audience shouts]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Inaudible] Well, I've learned that our country is very poorly run, I can tell you that. No, I've learned there's great -- and I have to say this, and you're a total professional and there are others -- but I've learned there's tremendous dishonesty in the media.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> True.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Tremendous dishonesty.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Beyond anything -- beyond anything I've ever witnessed. Beyond anything I've ever witnessed. For instance, I talk about NATO, and I give this long -- I understand. You know, I get it. I get how it is. I said it's obsolete, and two, three days later, people say, Wow, that was really something. I said that we're spending too much money.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're taking care of all the freeloaders. You know, we have 28 countries in there. We're taking care of a vast preponderance. But they're not paying. And they're really not paying because nobody's asking them to pay, in my opinion. You know I have an instinct for this stuff. They should pay. But it's really -- you know, we need something for terrorism.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That was set up I think 68 years ago or so for the Soviet Union. Well, the Soviet Union doesn't exist anymore. Russia's plenty tough. But here's the one thing. They cover my answer so inaccurately. And it's unbelievable. And every time I give a speech, I get a standing ovation on NATO and many other things.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But the press takes about 3 percent of what I say, and they disguise it to make it look as bad as possible. So you know, I -- very, very dishonest.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> What advice throughout this campaign, Melania, have you given your husband? Or what would you like him to change a little bit?
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> Well, as we discussed before, I said, you know, tweeting and being more presidential. And he has, you know, great nights, and he can be presidential. But sometimes, he just -- like, he cannot stand if somebody attacks him because if somebody attacks him, he will punch back 10 times harder.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> All right, we got to take a break. We'll come back. Things are just getting started -- 2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, his wife, Melania, they're with us for the hour as we continue "Hannity" on the road. We're in beautiful Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at the Pabst Theater. [News Break]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Welcome back to "Hannity." We continue now with 2016 Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, his wife, Melania. You met with Reince Priebus. How did that meeting go? Can you tell us what you talked about?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, the meeting was fine. We had a short meeting, probably half an hour. And he was there with his staff. And he's a really nice guy. I've always gotten along. But I just said I wanted to be treated fairly. I mean, I'm getting far more votes than anybody. In Louisiana, I won the state, and I find out I have less delegates than a guy that I beat quite easily.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Audience Boos]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And it doesn't -- and you say, What's going on? Now, in all fairness, we're way ahead in delegates, but why would somebody that loses have more delegates? They say, Well, there's this way, and -- I say, Wait a minute. I don't care about ways. I won the state. I'm not supposed to have less delegates than a guy I beat.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It doesn't work that way!
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Let me ask you a question. John Boehner said he hopes that they would pick Paul Ryan. They can nominate anybody at a contested convention. [Audience Boos]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> John Kasich told Strategy Now, he says it'll be a great educational opportunity. He can't get to 1,237. The only way he can win is to leapfrog over you and Ted Cruz.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You have Scott Walker, in a private meeting with a friend of ours, said last week he wants Paul Ryan. We know that Mitt Romney strategy. [Audience Boos]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Karl Rove has said it. There's a local radio guy who's not on my station, Charlie Sykes, has said it. He wants to jump over the winner. [Audience Boos]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> So my question to you...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Stop with the news. We'll go over.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> First of all, Romney is -- lost so badly. He was -- it was one of the great defeats in the history of presidential politics. And for this guy to be talking -- and he knows how I felt. And I said, Hey, look, he's a choke artist. He choked with President Obama. And that's not presidential to say, but I'll say it anyway.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have to say -- I always say -- I want to say it until I win. Then I promise I'll get presidential, OK? [Laughter]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But Romney is nothing but a choke artist. And I don't want his endorsement. You know, if I win this, I don't want -- I need his endorsement because...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> But the strategy is to take this...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> ... from the people that won the most votes, the most states, who got the most delegates.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Millions and millions of people that are out there voting, and I have people -- it's the biggest story in politics today. The Republican Party, I hate to say it because it's, you know, whatever -- because I'm running, because they want to see America be great again, et cetera, et cetera, all the things we're going to do. The Republican Party is getting millions of votes more than it did four years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now, it's getting millions of votes more than it ever has!
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And in all fairness, the Republican Party never had that image. It was like sort of tired, tired, exhausted, tired. And now, all of a sudden, you go to South Carolina, you go to New Hampshire, you go to different -- Nevada -- and a woman working in Nevada said, You know what? And she said this on television.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm watching television. She said, I've been in here for 25 years. They'd have, like, three people in this room. Now they had a line that was going back six blocks, five deep. And she said, I've never seen anything like this.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And that's every single thing. So -- so...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> We had more people...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... the Republican should...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> ... than we had room for here.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But you -- look at you. I mean, you were supposed to have just a little audience, and now they have to open up all the decks.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There's something amazing happening.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> But let me ask you something.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There's something...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> If -- if -- let's say you fall shy of 1,237 -- I mean, this is not a Chris Matthews hypothetical -- but if you fall shy of 1,237, and you get to the convention and it becomes contested, and they try -- and you have more votes, more delegates, won more states than anybody else, and they try to take that nomination away from you, what is your answer to them?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, let me tell you what's unfair. I was always very good... [Audience shouts]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We won't let them, right? [Audience shouts]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let me tell you, I was always very good... [Audience chants "No Trump, No Vote"]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you. Wow, that's very nice.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> All right, I have a question for the audience. If they try to do what I'm describing, how many of you would want him to walk out?
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> How many of you would not vote for whoever they pick?
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> So they -- they've got a big problem.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, we have -- we have millions... [Audience chanting]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you. We have millions -- we have millions of people. We're not talking about small. You know, like, as an example, above Cruz. And in all fairness to Cruz, at least he's going through with this process, and it's not an easy process. [Audience members shouts out "Lyin' Ted"]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But over -- over Ted Cruz, I have millions of additional votes, not only delegates, but millions of additional votes. I think it's really hard to do it. But I was always very good with mathematics, OK? So here's the problem we have, and that anybody in my position would have. I won, as you saw, many states.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think I have what, 22, 23 states? We won a lot of states, all right, more -- by far much more... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... much more than anybody else. OK, so -- but the problem is those first states, we had 17 people running. So you could win a state -- you get 24, 25 percent, you'd win a state. But with all of those people -- you had governors -- you had people of great achievement. I mean, you had Ben Carson, who's a fantastic guy, but -- great achievement.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He endorsed me. Ben endorsed me. And you had Chris Christie, who endorsed me. But you had people of great achievement. You had governors, senators, et cetera, OK? And they all had 2 percent, 3 percent, 5 percent. We had 17 people! So it's impossible to get to that threshold in those early states. Even now, we still have Kasich.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now, here's the problem with Kasich. First of all, I happen to think he takes votes away from me, moreso than Cruz. But...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But Sean -- Sean, he's 1 for 31, OK? Thank you. He's won -- it's not fair! [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> ... more than 31, but yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, I think it's more. It's probably 33, if you add on the islands and everything else. But he's one for 31, probably 33. And if I spent two days more in Ohio, I would have won that, too. We did great in Ohio. I would have won Ohio.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And you know why I didn't do it? Because I wanted to be sure that I won Florida. We won Florida big. But I would have won Ohio. But the point is this. So we have all these people -- we have all these people, and it's very hard therefore to get the 50 percent plus one when you go -- despite that, I think we're going to do it. I'll tell you what, if we can win Wisconsin, and we are doing great, we're going to do it pretty easily.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> I read a recent interview, and a couple of times you used an analogy that I -- well, in a primary, I got to be tough, I got to break some eggs, and then I'm going to be -- what Melania is asking you and Ivanka's asking you and Eric and Don, Jr., are asking you, to be more presidential.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Very boring. I'll be very boring. [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> What does that mean you're going to -- how is that possible?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, he'll be so -- he'll have Trump on, and he'll say, That was the most boring interview I've ever done. No more Trump. No, I understand. You know what Melania says, what Ivanka -- Ivanka's the same...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You agree with her.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do, but I want to finish the job. You know, look...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do. You know, in the last debate -- the last debate -- and Drudge is an amazing guy, by the way. But Drudge has a poll -- right? He really is. People don't know what an amazing guy. But Drudge has a poll, and Time magazine and all these -- you know there's, like, seven or eight of them, on-line polls after the debates.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've won every single poll of every single debate. In other words, who won the debates. You know that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now, so they told me on the final debate, Be presidential. Don't hit back. Don't -- and I tried it. And I succeeded. I was so proud of myself! [Laughter] [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But it was also -- by the way, I did good in the poll, but it was also the most boring debate of all, you have to say. [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> I want to know, I -- when we come back, I want to ask specifically how you go after Hillary. Let's talk about some policy issues, ISIS, the economy, much more as we continue with 2016 Republican front-runner Donald Trump, his wife, Melania. "Hannity" on the road in Milwaukee, and we will continue.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Welcome back to "Hannity." We're in beautiful Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at the Pabst Theater with 2016 Republican presidential front- runner Donald Trump and his wife, Melania. I have asked you this question about the economy before -- 95 million Americans out of the labor force, 50 million in poverty, 46 million on food stamps.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You know what a bad economy is, right?
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And we've doubled the national debt.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And I think the question is, how do we fix this and how fast can you do it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK, we can do it fast. We have to bring our jobs back and we have to stop jobs from leaving. Every day, you read about companies...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sean, right, every day, we're reading about companies, great companies -- Pfizer, great pharmaceutical companies -- moving to Ireland. A lot of companies are moving to Mexico. I mean, Mexico's like a China, a little smaller version. We're losing so many -- but we're going to build a wall. Who's going to pay for the wall?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're going to build a wall, believe me. We're building the wall. You know, with Mexico, we have a trade deficit of $58 billion a year.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> China is worse.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, China, $505 billion. And we're going to stop all that. And we have the greatest -- you know many of them, and you know they're friends of mine, and have endorsed me. Carl Icahn...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> But how do we...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're going to get the greatest negotiators and...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Is that enough to get Americans back to work?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, it's going to be so good. It's -- we're losing, we're losing all of our jobs, folks. We're losing so much. And what they do is the monetary manipulation. They devalue their currencies to such an extent. And they're grand masters. And we have people in Washington, they don't even know what's happening to us. You take a look at Komatsu in Japan, they make tractors.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look what they're doing to Caterpillar. So many companies are just absolutely --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You said we're headed for a massive recession.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If I'm not elected. If I'm not elected.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, no, no. No, I, I did make the statement, I did make the statement, because we're in a massive bubble. We have money that's the cheapest money we've ever had yet. Nobody can borrow it unless you're very rich. I mean, if I want to borrow money, I can borrow all the money I want to borrow. But if you aren't really rich, you can't borrow money.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So did you ever hear of cheap money that nobody can get? We're sitting on a bubble. The stock market is very inflated and very -- now, we have to straighten out our country. We are $19 trillion in debt. The budget -- -- you know they talk about Paul Ryan. Well, I like Paul Ryan personally. No, but this omnibus budget from three months ago that they passed is a disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It gives Obama the money to bring people in from Syria. It gives him the money to bring the illegal immigrants in. It gives him money for Obamacare, which has to be repealed and replaced.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Would you put forward a balanced budget your first budget, or will it take a couple of years?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, no, but it will take fairly quickly, and it can be done.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Three years?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, he likes the penny plan. And you know, the penny plan, you know it sounds simple. It's actually very good. And you can do more than a penny, by the way. But it will take place and it will go relatively quickly. But what we have to start doing again, immediately, we have to make better trade deals.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'll be able to that very -- that's what I do, make better trade deals. We have to make sure that these countries -- you know, we protect Japan, we protect Saudi Arabia, we protect Germany, we protect -- we're like the policemen to the world. We protect everybody. When they say that our military budget is many times that of any other country, of course it is. We're protecting everybody.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So we have to renegotiate deals. I don't mind protecting countries, but we have to get paid a fair amount of money for it. [Audience Cheers]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Do you -- how important is it that government -- for example, are there any departments you would eliminate? I like the penny plan. You cut a penny, you eliminate baseline budgeting, all important and, from my perspective -- energy I think would create a lot of jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it has got to be loosened up. It has got to be loosened up. You know, we take our coal, because I'm somebody that believes in clean coal. I believe in all forms of energy. I think it's fine.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> All of the above?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Including --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Including the newer stuff that I use, solar, et cetera, et cetera. But it's not working. It's so expensive. It's just not working. And it will get better and better with time. But we can't rely on that. I mean, solar is wonderful and great, but, you know, there's a 32 -- year payback. Who wants a 32 -- year payback?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Same thing with wind. Wind is a horrible thing in terms of vision, what it looks like. And it has a place in certain areas, it has a place. As you know, in California, it's killing all the eagles.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Outside the Kennedy compound, that's where I would put it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, no -- yes, but they don't want it.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Yes, exactly.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's amazing. They all want wind until you're going to put it next to their house, and then all of a sudden it's like, we don't want the wind.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But look, it all has a place. We -- coal, we have in West Virginia, in Ohio, I mean, look at what has happened to Ohio. They have clean coal now. We send our coal -- you know what, we send our coal. We don't do much coal anymore. The miners are devastated. That industry is -- we send it --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Do you manage the budget at home or does Melania?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, we don't have too much of a budget, right? [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By the way -- just a thought though. We send our coal to China. We send our coal to China. We can't use it. We're not allowed to use it practically, it's so restrictive. But we send our coal to China. It's so sad.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am totally in favor. You know, nuclear had a big setback when they had the problem in Japan. They were all set to go. But new nuclear is really -- and very, very inexpensive. You look at certain countries like France, not that I want to copy France --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> No, 75 percent. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But they've got a vast majority of their energy is from nuclear.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Would you eliminate any departments?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh absolutely. First of all --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> First of all, first of all, we want to bring education back to Wisconsin, right? Right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So we end Common Core, and Department of Education can -- I mean, the Department of Education is massive and it can be largely eliminated. Now you maybe want to have a little bit of, you know, tentacles out there, make sure everything -- but largely we can eliminate the Department of Education. Department of environmental, I mean, the DEP is killing us environmentally.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's just killing our businesses. That can be state.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> We've got to take a break.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> We'll come back. We have much more with Donald Trump, his wife Melania, right after this break as Hannity continues from the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on the road.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And welcome back to Hannity. We continue now with 2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, his wife Melania. All right, so the president was in Cuba doing the wave. [Audience Boos]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And then he did the Tango. And that was after he got lectured by Raul Castro. You're the president of the United States. I assume you wouldn't have been in Cuba, but something like Brussels happens, how would you have handled it differently?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, you know, by the way, speaking of Cuba, and I'm not saying we shouldn't do something eventually, but we have to do a great deal as opposed to the deal we're doing. But worst, when he landed in Air Force One and there was nobody to greet him. To me, can you imagine? [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I said, you know, Air Force One has been around for a while. I said, that may be the first time in the history of Air Force One that the president of the United States lands in a country and there's nobody to great him. So it's a total lack of respect. He should have left immediately. He should have left, should have left the baseball game.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The wave was not a good thing, especially in light of what we're going through.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But he should have left immediately and come back home to Washington where the president belongs at a time like that.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Let me ask, Obama last week was attacking you that you don't know foreign policy. And I'm thinking, all right, this is the guy that $150 billion to the radical Islamic mullahs of Iran.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who, by the way, and this is interesting, yesterday for the first time he is now saying Iran, not so happy with Iran. He's not so happy with the deal. I've been telling him that for two years it's not going to work out. And, you know, it's interesting. Hey, I wrote a book in 2000, I talked about Osama bin Laden in the book, two years before the World Trade Center got knocked down.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And Brussels.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And then I talked about Brussels recently. And "The New York Times" put this big story in that Donald Trump -- I said Brussels is a hellhole. Now, I know that because it's a big financial capital and friends of mine are very much involved with Brussels, and they tell me what's going on. And "The New York Times" came up and they wrote a vicious story about me talking so badly about Brussels.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And then you had this horrible attack. And now everybody is saying he was right. I know what I'm doing. I mean, I know what I'm doing. [Audience chants "Trump"]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And I'll bring Melania back in here because he wants you to be more presidential. We know every election cycle what the Democratic playbook is going to be. It's going to be that if you're the nominee, you're racist, you're sexist, war on women, you want dirty air and water, and throw granny over the cliff.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> So the question is, first of all, do you have a nickname for Hillary?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, you know, I haven't really. I just haven't wanted to give it yet. I sort of do but I want to knock off the next two people, and then I can focus on Hillary.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And then you'll reveal it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, it's going to be great.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I will say this, and I think -- I think a lot of people will confirm it. Nobody has more respect for women than I do, that I can tell you. Nobody.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Melania, when you read these polls and you see how they're trying to position your husband, that he's anti-woman, and they use different narratives, what are your thoughts? What would you want to say to people as somebody that obviously knows him better than anybody?
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> I think he is the man -- he respects women. He hires the women on the highest positions. And he trusts them. And he's the one that he will take care of them. He's the only one.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Let me go back just a little. You obviously broke a lot of eggs, to use your analogy, in the Republican primary. And if she's the nominee, assuming she's not wearing an orange jumpsuit and shoes without laces, how -- do you have to maybe navigate a little differently because she's going to play that gender card?
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> [Audience Boos]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it seems unfair to have to do so, probably there will be some of that. It seems unfair. She's playing that card very heavily. Now she played the card two months ago, and the only time I really hit her was two months ago. And Bernie got all the credit, because she went down and all of a sudden he started doing well.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, when I did that two months she went right down. I think I'm going to have to take a little credit for what's happening with Bernie because he has won, what, the last six in a row.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I'll tell you, Wisconsin is going to be very interesting. I understand he's leading in Wisconsin. It's going to be an interesting -- so I don't know what's going to happen. I mean, I can't say. But I look at what's happening. You take a look at Libya. That was her baby. And a friend of mine who's very well-versed in what's going on, Libya had great oil, very, very pure, very beautiful oil.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know who has got that oil now? ISIS. ISIS has that oil. They've taken that oil. So you had Benghazi. You had the ambassador and the others, wonderful people, being absolutely and brutally killed, nobody talks about the viciousness of those killings. They were vicious. And remember the famous phone call, when you get the --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> It's 3:00 a.m.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, she wasn't there to answer the call. I mean, she wasn't there.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> So without giving it away, do you have your strategy?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do. I have a strategy but --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Already in place?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's too early. I don't even know if she's going to be the nominee. It's too early to even --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> I have 1,000 pages of opposition research on her. Remember, I was the one out there on Obama, warning the country that he was a radical, you know, Reverend Wright, 20 years in that church, "G-D America," Alinskyite, Acorn, Bill Ayers, Bernardine Dohrn, no one wanted to talk about it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It says better than anything when he won't use the term "radical Islamic terrorism."
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> It says everything.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And with -- you saw what happened yesterday with the French where he had the word --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> They edited it out.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It had to happen. He said it was a technical mistake. This is what I mean. Those two words or three words were edited out. It was a technical mistake. To think, I mean --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> It's scary.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, well, it's a lie. [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> We've got to take a break. More with Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, and Melania, right after this break as Hannity continues from the Pabst Theater, we're in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Stay with us.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Welcome back to Hannity. We continue now with 2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, his wife Melania. Jordan, first time caller, longtime listener, how are you?
<Question> <Neutral> Good, how are you?
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Do you have a question for Mr. Trump?
<Question> <Neutral> Yes. Mr. Trump, if you were the current president of the United States, who would you nominate to the Supreme Court and why?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK. Well, we just lost a great one. And who would have thought this could have happened. And I think it's one of the probably, maybe -- well, look, defense is always most important. But one of the most important things going on right now is who are the justices going to be, because there could be as many -- could actually be as many as five.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So it's going to change. I would go with a very conservative person. I would go --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would go prolife. I would go with great intellect and somebody that would be like Scalia, worthy of tremendous admiration and respect. It's so important.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Melania, you've watched a lot of interviews with him. Is there one question that you wish that maybe somebody had asked your husband and they haven't asked yet?
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> I think they need to ask many, many questions, yes. [Laughter]
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> I don't think --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> When you sit at home and you're watching these interviews or watching people attacking him, that's not easy on any family, right?
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> Well, we know what comes with the territory, you know, when you go into that. And you know what it -- what's coming up. And we have a thick skin. You know, I'm explaining to my 10-year-old son and he understands too. He needs to get a thick skin, you know. It's life. Life is not a bowl of cherries, so --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> It's not cotton candy and rainbows, that's my line. Real quick, we have about a minute.
<Question> <Neutral> Hi.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi.
<Question> <Neutral> I'm Ashley Cross. And my question is with Russia and the USA having a common enemy with ISIS, would you reach out to Russia to make them an ally?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think it's fine. You know, I took heat from these people that don't get it. When Russia started bombing ISIS and then said, we should be doing that, you know, these Lindsey Grahams or these characters that don't know what they're doing. [Audience Boos]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They've been fighting -- you know, he said, I've been doing this for many years. That's why we keep fighting. We should knock them out quickly. But -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But that's why we're losing, exactly. Said very well. The fact is, we have to knock ISIS out so fast. And if Russia, you know, Putin has said very nice things about me. So people said -- actually during one of the debates, one of the people said, you should tell him to take that away. I said, I'm not going to take it away.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He called me a genius, actually, thought that was very nice. But you know what, you know what --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- if Russia wants to help us, if Russia wants to drop bombs all the hell over ISIS, who are cutting people's heads off and drowning people, that's OK with me.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> When we come back, we'll continue, more from Milwaukee, Wisconsin with Donald Trump and Melania Trump, straight ahead.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> All right, unfortunately that's all the time we have left this evening. But be sure to tune in tomorrow night, 10:00 Eastern. Now the polls close here 9:00 Eastern, and we will have full coverage, our regular time, 10:00 Eastern. Did you all have a good time tonight?
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> I want to thank you, Mr. Trump. It's great to see you. Melania, thank you so much for being with us. Appreciate it. That is all the time we have. Tomorrow night, our regular time. We'll have Wisconsin primary results for all of you. We'll see you back here tomorrow night.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Now honored to have Donald Trump. He is currently a candidate for the Republican nomination for president of the United States. Mr. Trump, thank you very much for joining us on the initial Breitbart News Daily show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's such an honor. The initial show, wow. We'll have to mark this one down for posterity, Steve. Very good, congratulations.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good luck, you'll do well.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> [Laughter] Well, thank you, sir. I'd, look, one of the things is that, you know, very early on in this process, in places like New Hampshire and Iowa, we were very honored to have you come on our weekend show, or when we were doing those six- or seven-hour marathons and we were telling people at the time, I said, 'Look, this guy is, people are leaning forward in these audiences when he was talking.' Of course, we were mocked and ridiculed and, you know, 'What are you guys doing? This is a joke.' In fact, the Sunday show, Tom Rose and Gary Bauer tell the story how they were laughing at me when I was saying, 'Hey, this guy Trump, this is going to be very serious.' So it's good to see that you're in the heat of combat now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, I remember that well, and oftentimes with you, especially because I'd always mess up my hair when I put those big microphones around, you know, you'd always help me put them on. So I'd mess up my hair, which is fine. But I remember that you looked and you said, 'Boy, those are big crowds you're getting. You have more than anybody else by far.' I said, 'Steve, I'm telling you, just watch.' And, you know, now we're getting, I mean, we had 20,000 in Dallas.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We filled up an arena in three days, you know, Mark Cuban arena where the Mavericks play, and 35,000 in Alabama, and 20,000 in Oklahoma, you know about Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina, been unbelievable, the crowds, so we've really, you know, we've had a lot of fun talking about very negative subjects, because everything is negative with the country, Steve, I mean there's nothing good happening, there's nothing positive happening. We don't win anymore, so we have to --
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> What is it about the message that, you know, whether it was a year and a half or two years ago, when you first started this, started going to these events Dave Bosse was putting on in New Hampshire and Iowa, what is it about the message that you think is resonating most with the American people now, that's drawing bigger and bigger crowds, and clearly a lot of enthusiasm, has you at the top in many of the polls?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yea, I think the big message is 'make America great again.' And, you know, I built a great company. In fact, as you know, a lot of people said, 'Well, he won't run.' Then I ran. Then I filed different papers. Then they said, 'Well, maybe he won't file his financials, maybe he's not as rich as we thought.' It turned out I was much richer.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I built a great company, like an unbelievable, in fact, Steve, I might have filed them anyway, to be honest with you, I think I might have filed them even if I didn't run, so, you know, people have seen what [Crosstalk].
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> You mean just to shut the critics up, say, 'Hey [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh yea. I always have people who 'Well, maybe he's not that rich,' but, you know, that file, I mean, they expose everything. You know what. It was 100 pages of financial information, and I gave the, and by the way, the biggest one ever filed, I think, was two pages, OK? I was over, I think it was close to 100 pages [Cross talk].
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> By the way, on the disclosure, I could tell people, [Inaudible] oh, they're arguing about his net worth, I said, 'Listen, the cash and marketable securities, which is the acid test, I think is $450 million, is 2X Mitt Romney's total net worth, so when people talk about it, I said, 'Just go to the cash and marketable securities, that's liquidity.'
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hundreds of, hundreds of, many hundreds of millions of dollars in cash, and the assets are the best, you know, the buildings in Manhattan, Turnberry in Scotland, one of the great places of the world, and Doral in Miami, you know, there's hundreds of acres of land right next to the airport in Miami, you know, the whole thing. I mean, they're great assets, but I'm not saying that in a braggish way. I'm saying, or I should say, in a braggadocious way, I'm saying it because that's the kind of mentality that we need in the country. We don't make good deals anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you look at what we're doing with China, if you look at what we're doing with all these countries, I use China because they're the biggest abuser of the United States.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> OK, I wanna get into those deals for a second, because, look, being trained at the, of course, I went to the poet's version of business school, Harvard, I know you went to Wharton, where you gotta know math, you have to know the math, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Laughter] You actually have to know the math.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> So, but at Goldman Sachs, they always teach you about op, you know, negotiating leverage, operating leverage. Last night, over the weekend, the campaigns have now taken direct control of these debates, and that is because, as I've been telling people, I said, 'Hey, the leverage here is Donald Trump's and Ben Carson's and a couple of other guys. They have the leverage, not the RNC. They've cut bad deals.' The same logic applies to China and Iran and throughout the world.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> The United States has been a punching bag. Let's go back to the RNC thing first. What, exactly, have you guys done to kind of say, 'Hey, look, would I rather have Reince Priebus or Donald Trump negotiate my deal with the networks?' What have you guys actually done, cause The New York Times is kind of saying, 'Oh, you know, they're going to have a little bit of openings.' We've been saying it's much deeper, it's much more profound, and this is a seminal moment.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well it started really with CNN because we had a two-hour debate, and then I got to the place, and they said, 'Oh congratulations, it's three hours.' And, as you remember, it was extremely hot, and everything, you know, it was a very terrible situation.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> You don't think that's anything about trying to sell some additional ad time for a network that's hurting?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Cross talk] Oh no, no, no, not a little bit, 100 percent. They made a fortune. Steve, the ads were 4,000 for a 30-second ad. They got 200,000 and 250,000, OK? They sold out the first two hours.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was a two-hour debate. They sold out, they announced a couple of days early, without anybody's approval, I didn't even know about it until I got there, that it would be three hours, and they sold out that. They made a fortune.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Jeff Zucker's trying to hit a quarterly number, you gotta give a brother a break here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, with CNN, and Jeff Zucker's great, and I don't blame him, but I said, 'Well, I won't go in the debate," And I'll tell you what
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wonder if that had anything to do with C -- now you went Harvard, do you think that had anything to do with [Cross talk]
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> No, no, no, that was a totally random, totally random event.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, it was just my luck. It just happened to happen that way, right? So anyway, but [Crosstalk] not gonna happen.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> By the way, by the way, at CNBC the biggest audience in 30 years of broadcasting, by, what, 10X, the biggest audience they ever had.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yea, by 10 million people, and you know, and, look, I don't want to take credit for it, but I will. You know, frankly, everybody, you know, Variety, everybody said it was, so, you know, I figure I have some leverage, so I called up --
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Not some leverage, not some leverage. You and Carson, you and Cars, no, no, you and Carson have all the leverage. If you and Carson don't show up, there's not a debate, right? That's [Cross talk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the way, they were great. Their team was great. You know, my team knows their team, and called them up and said, 'Listen, you know, this is ridiculous. They want to put us on again for three hours, only because of commercials.' Has nothing to do with the people or anything else and we were able, I was able to negotiate in, let's say, three minutes, three seconds.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said, 'Listen, I'm not showing up,' and I threw in Ben Carson, 'I'm not showing up, and neither is Carson. We're not going unless it's a two-hour debate.' They said, "OK
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> But, I wanna talk about the mentality, because I think you see the same mentality [Cross talk] No, it's the mentality of the RNC that you gotta play, look, the media is the Praetorian Guard of the permanent political class, all the consultants that come after you and Dr. Carson and Ted Cruz, all day long, the permanent political classes, consultants, they're all in bed together, right? They all want the same [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I agree.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> By the way, the same mentality of the RNC is the same mentality, you've got Froman, the trade negotiator, we just had Nigel Farage on, they're over there saying, ‘Oh by the way, if you leave the EU we're not going to cut a bilateral deal with you.’ These guys, the same mentality, they don't know what negotiating leverage is, whether it's China, whether it's Mexico. They mock you cause you said, ‘Hey, I’m gonna build a wall and they're gonna pay for it.'
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, 100 percent they'll pay, Steve, by the way, 100 percent. You know what we lose on Mexico a year? Forty-five billion in trade. We have an imbalance with Mexico, 45 billion. The wall's gonna cost, you know, they said it was going to cost 12, I could build it for six and it will be bigger, better, and stronger.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I'm building the Old Post Office right now on Pennsylvania.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> You can't miss it. It's got every, outside it's got the big Trump, you've got, you got the big Trump [Laughter]. [Cross Talk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's a political [Inaudible]. No, it's a hotel, it's opening in 2016. But either way it's one year ahead of schedule, was gonna open in 2017, I said, 'We can't do that.' So it's one year ahead of schedule, open up in September of next year, of 20 -- how about that timing?
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> [Inaudible] By the way, a stunning building. It's absolutely a stunning building on Pennsylvania Avenue.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It will be the greatest hotel in the United States. I mean, really what's incredible and, you know, the amazing thing and nobody's ever mentioned this. And I'm fine with it. But in the Obama administration as, as you know, they run the GSA, and the people at the GSA are terrific people, by the way, and very professional people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But to think that Trump got it -- it was the most heavily -- more people, as you can imagine. Location, you know, it's the best. This incredible building in the best location. And Trump got it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> How did Trump get it over Hyatt, Pritzker? How did Trump get it off, you know, Pritzker's his biggest contributor. How did Trump get it? People [Cross talk].
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Well, secretary. Also secretary of commerce, I think, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well that's why -- because they didn't get that. So he gave her secretary of commerce. That's what happened, in my opinion. They were not happy when they didn't get it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But anyway what we're building there is going to be incredible. But here's the thing. We're under budget and ahead of schedule. Wouldn't it be nice if the country could do, and the same thing with CNBC.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Everybody said, 'Oh they won't cut it, there's no cut, there's no provision.' I said, 'That's OK. Let me give it a shot.' I made the call. And one of my guys made the call. Corey is terrific, who's a big fan of yours, by the way.
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> Your campaign manager.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yea, right. Within three minutes they agreed and we were told, you know, that they would never agree to it. Now, they took a big loss. I said, 'Here's what you do: double the price of your commercials' [Cross talk].
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Here's what I learned at Wharton: supply and demand. Raise your price.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yea. I said, 'If you sold out this early, your price is too cheap, even at $250,000 for 30 seconds.'
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> But what got you guys then to decide, 'We just gotta cut the RNC out, right? We just gotta cut the RNC and directly negotiate with the networks themselves.' What got you to move to that after the, after CNBC cratered on the [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, John Harwood is a sleaze, and I knew that. But he interviewed me two weeks before and he was very nice, couldn't have been nicer. You know, very nice interview, soft, easy, nice, but, you know, but I still didn't trust him and I figured because he was asking me to do it and he was one of the moderators. You know, I sat down for an interview with John and I guess it was on CN, yea, it was on CNBC, and that was fun.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it was a normal interview. Nothing spectacular. And then all of a sudden, he starts with me with the first question, OK? And it wasn't the question, is what he said during the question, you know? And then I actually thought the one that they hit was me. And, of course, I can say the same thing in all fairness for Fox.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I can say the same thing to a lesser extent, you know, for CNN I think, well, yea, I guess. But the fact is that when he hit me like that I couldn't believe it. I mean I couldn't believe it. I said, 'That is disgusting.' And he was so nice.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In other words it was a little bit of a setup because he was so nice two weeks before with the interview. So I said very unfair. But it wasn't really, because I don't mind the tough que -- did you see the -- every online poll had me winning the debate. Did you notice that?
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Yea, I saw that, yep, the Drudge particularly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Even CNBC had me winning the debate. That's sort of an amazing thing. The only way I didn't win the debate is some of the pundits that are going absolutely crazy that I'm leading in the polls. I can't, you know, they've been going crazy, their whole lives are at stake, it seems.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean they should loosen up a little bit. But so that was the story. It was a, I thought the moderators were just, didn't do it, I like Becky Quick, by the way, I really do.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Well you've been on CNBC a lot [Cross talk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yea, I like Becky and I like Carl. The other, Harwood, is not a good guy, he's not a good --
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> But is, going forward, this negotiation, are you guys going to try to change structure? Format? I mean you've got the leverage, the networks, [Cross talk] If the network doesn't like it, you say, 'Hey look guys, you know, just drop the debate. We're going to do something, we'll go to somebody else.'
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We know we have the lever here. I think of it, they're making a fortune off of us. Like, for instance, when CNN did their extended version without anybody knowing about it until we got, I mean, I literally didn't know about it --
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> The incremental third hour.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yea. Now I heard they announced it a day before, or two days before, but I literally didn't, I got there and I say, 'How long this is, by the way, it's a two-hour.' No no no no, they walked in, they said, 'It's a three-hour debate.' I said, 'What do you mean a three-hour? That wasn't agreed to.' When they did that, I said, 'We should immediately strike and we should ask' -- you know, I'm like a union worker now -- 'We should immediately strike and we should ask for that extra hour.' At least 50 percent of that money comes to the RNC, you know, comes to the Republican Party, OK? Or what I really said, and you know I said this, 'Let it go to the wounded warriors, let it go to the veterans.' All of the money that they made, and I really wanted to do that but we didn't really have enough time. It's a little tough when they say, 'You're on in 15 minutes.' You'll understand that.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> It's the mentality, though, of saying, 'Hey we don't have to play by a set of rules that they, when people, when you first said, 'Hey we're the United States, we should get the best deals. I will get the best deals. You were mocked and ridiculed, guys saying, 'Hey he's not a real estate developer, wants to be president of the United States,' but the same logic applies, whether it's China or Mexico or Iran or the EU.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Or Bergdahl, or Bergdahl
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> Or Bergdahl
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How about Bergdahl?
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> We've been pushed around by everybody
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We get Bergdahl, they get five killers that they've wanted for eight years, OK? OK. That's the way, that's the way we negotiate. I don't want Bergdahl. Send him back, drop him back in the middle of the place.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we get Bergdahl, a traitor. They get five killers. What kind of a deal? That's the way we deal. I mean --
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> What would you do different? What would you do different as president of the United States and commander in chief in this, in this area of really representing American interests versus people like, countries like China, like Mexico, like Iran, like the E.U.?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, many things, Steve. No. 1, I have a natural, you know, way of negotiating. OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I know the greatest negotiators. They're friends and enemies of mine. I have enemies and have friends, OK? And, you know, we're too predictable as a country. You know, everyone says like even sending these 50 guys in.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why do we have to announce that we're sending them in, OK? These guys are in great danger now, because they're going to be looking for. them. Why can't we just send them in and not say anything?
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> A whole new a whole new concept. Kind of like FDR ran World War II, right? I don't think we tell the Germans, 'Hey, here's what we're going to do.' Don't telegraph it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Every time we do something we have to announce it, OK? Because he's just a political guy who's doing a horrible job as president, he's the worst president ever, he's doing a horrible job. So instead of sending 50 guys, that are top guys, you know, these are really great guys, right? But they're in great danger because this enemy is not stupid. They're now looking for these 50 guys. Why didn't we just send them in and not say anything? Because he has to talk because everything is politics.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But basically, if you look at, it's everything, it's everything, it's military. You know, it came out in all the polls that I'd be by far the best on financial and the economy. And they said I'd be by far the best on the military, and I would be the best on the military. But what you have to do is you have to get the right people in to negotiate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, Carl Icahn endorsed me. You know, you know Carl, OK?
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Pretty tough, pretty tough hombre.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, great. Built a tremendous fortune. He doesn't want money. I mean, he doesn't want a fee.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He wants to do it because he wants to do it. I mean No. 1, he loves the country. No.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> 2, it's a challenge for him. You know, he's tired with all these deals, he does deals, he does great.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Just what China wants to know is that Carl Icahn is going to be negotiating across the table from them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well you know I laugh as tell, I know people don't know who he is, you know, the audience, they're not sure. I said, 'Just trust me.' So we put Carl, I say, 'Carl, do me a favor, you negotiate with China. Look over the trade pacts.' I say, 'Folks, go home, relax, have dinner, just don't worry about it anymore. It's going to be fine.'
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> But let me ask you about that. One of the big issues in this, in this campaign is going to be trade, although CBC didn't want to talk about TPP. You're a guy, whether you're financing, building a hotel, acquiring a property, buying a distressed asset, the contract is everything because all the reality exists in the contract. That's just the way, that's the way, by the way, the rule of law -- In TPP, you have these massive trade deals that are, as you know, enormously complicated with, you know, 10, 12, 15 countries [Inaudible].
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> It's in a secret vault. You can only go down there part of the time. You can't fully vet it. With you as president or commander in chief, would you allow us to get into these multilateral trade deals that are so complex where you can't fully vet all the details in the deal itself?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In my opinion that deal was made for China. China's going to, you watch, China's going to come in through the back door. China is going to come in and take advantage of that deal through the back door. You watch.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> As sure -- you know I'm very much opposed to that deal. First of all, we should be making trade deals with individual countries not as a big group like that. We should be doing --
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> The way the founders had it set up: do bilateral trade agreements and then bring them back to the Senate. Trump brings it back to Senate and gets his bilateral trade deal with Taiwan or with Japan approved by two-thirds of the Senate.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Steve.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> And you have to go argue, 'Hey this is why this is a good deal.' And that's the way the founders wanted it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, in that group we've had company, countries that treat us badly. And we've had countries where we get along well with them, and it's been fine. Well, the ones that treat us badly are getting the benefits of the deal because of the ones that treat us well. The whole thing is crazy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But here's the worst part: monetary manipulation. They manipulate their currencies, right? It's not even covered in the deal. The single greatest weapon that all of these countries have and use against us, whether it's Japan or China or Brazil, anybody, is currency manipulation, OK? They manipulate their currency and, you know, to downgrade it. I mean, it doesn't sound good but it sure as hell works.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the greatest one in history for currency manipulation has been China, in history, They're the great geniuses of this. So we don't even, it's not even covered in the trade deal, and a group came to me, I don't even know if you are involved with this group, but a group came to me and they didn't even want my money. They wanted me to do a radio commercial a big [Inaudible] they spent a lot of money on it, talking about this, and they actually took the commercial -- I did it. I was like the voice, I was the host of the commercial, which is a little bit different.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But there are tremendous numbers of very smart people that are totally against this deal. This deal is a disaster but the single biggest point is not even mentioned in the agreement. And frankly, most people don't even know what is mentioned, because if you want to see the agreement you can't even read it, so I know you're against it. I think it's a horror show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's great for a few companies that pushed it very hard and have very powerful lobbyists, some of whom I know, by the way, and they got it through. It's incredible.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> I know it's going to be fully vetted in this cam--, they're trying to kick it past the primary season, but I know that you and others, Senator Sessions, I know Ted Cruz, I know others are going to drill down in the details.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, it's a horrible, it's a horrible deal.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> We've got so much more to ask you. Hopefully later in the week we can get you back. Talk about H1-B visas and the whole situation down at Disney and all that. There's so much going on.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> I really appreciate your time. I know you're incredibly busy and if you want to follow Donald Trump, just go to the pages of Breitbart. It's up there every day, what's going on. Tremendous deal you just cut with getting the RNC out of the TV business.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well they're going to be out, and by the way, Reince is a very good guy. But this takes a lot of pressure off him, frankly, and, you know, we know how to negotiate, and it will be a much fairer situation.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> I think if you had a choice between Reince Priebus as nice a guy as he is, and Donald Trump cutting your TV deal, I think most people would take Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I'm not allowed to say that, OK? But I can tell you he's a very good guy. He really is. He's a very nice person. And I think that he is, you know, hopefully he's going to do a good job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, look, you know, you get a candidate, you really need that RNC to go in there and fight hard. And they have to be very tough and very smart. You have this crazy, you know, Wasserman Schultz, Deborah Wasserman Schultz, who is in there, a highly neurotic woman. This is a woman that is a terrible person.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I watch her on television. She is a terrible person. And in all fairness she negotiated a great deal for Hillary because they gave Hillary all softballs.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Every ball was a softball
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And in fact the other candidates weren't even allowed to talk up against her. How about, and, by the way, he destroyed his campaign, Sanders, he totally destroyed his campaign.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> He destroyed, two guys --
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> By the way, two guys quit the day after [Inaudible] threw the towel in, said, 'I'm out of here.'
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, when Sanders gave up the emails, that was the end of it. Even he said that's the end of him.
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> That's the tell.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He gave that up. It was a great sound bite for about three minutes, for three seconds. You know, they clapped for about three seconds. When he gave up the emails, he is now just wasting his time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's going around. By the way, his audience have shrunk. Now he's got to take ads and everything else. His audiences have gone.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know I have by far the biggest audiences even before, but his audiences are gone now. When he gave up that email thing he said, 'Here, Hillary.' And you know what? That was orchestrated by the Democratic Party whereas you would really properly say, the Democrat Party because they don't say that. They add the 'ic' on the end and they shouldn't be doing that. But, but that was probably Deborah Wasserman Schultz.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Yea, cutting the deal. Mr. Trump, thank you so much. Amazing interview.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Really appreciate you coming on our on our show and hope to have you back in the future.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I look forward to it, Steve. Thanks a lot.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Thank you, sir.
<Harry Smith> <Positive> When you hear Taj Mahal, you think of India and the beautiful marble structure that's been a tourist attraction for ages. Well, now, thanks to Donald Trump, maybe you'd better think twice. The original Taj Mahal was begun in 1632 by the mogul Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, for more than 300 years a symbol of serenity, purity and eternal love.
<Harry Smith> <Positive> Well, move over mogul Jahan and make room for mogul DonaldJ. Trump and his version of the Taj Mahal. Nothing serene or pure here,and if there's evidence of eternal love, it is our eternal love of money and gambling.
<Harry Smith> <Positive> The Trump Taj Mahal Casino & Resort officially opened last night with a laser ribbon-cutting ceremony and fireworks. At $ 1 billion,this is the largest and most expensive casino resort ever built,according to Trump. And if that hype doesn't get you, he adds that it is the eighth wonder of the world.
<Harry Smith> <Positive> Its opening coincided with the latest round of headlines in the Trump divorce case dubbed, at least one way, the eighth blunder of the world.The casino alone at Trump's Taj Mahal covers 120,000 square feet, and that's where we caught up with Donald Trump yesterday morning just before the grand and grandiose debut.
<Paula Zahn> <Positive> And good morning, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning, Paula. How are you?
<Paula Zahn> <Negative> We can't see you, but we see some flashing poker signs. Oh, here you go.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that sounds good.
<Paula Zahn> <Positive> Congratulations.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. It's a great honor.
<Paula Zahn> <Negative> You describe your place as the eighth wonder of the world. Where are you standing now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, right now I'm in the casino. It's just about ready to open,so we have a lot of people working here right now. But the people are going to be streaming in in another 15 minutes or so, and it really has become -- it's the largest casino in the world. But, more importantly, Ithink, it's far and away the most beautiful.
<Harry Smith> <Neutral> Tell about what is hanging from the ceiling above you there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, this is a crystal chandelier. We have a combination, I guess -- in combination, 48 of these chandeliers. They're extremely expensive and, I guess, overall we have close to $ 20 million worth of chandeliers in this room alone.
<Paula Zahn> <Neutral> Do you think that makes any difference to the people who come in there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was asking that question myself. In fact, I said: Why did I spend the money? The casino would have looked just fine without them.Why did we have to spend -- I think it probably makes that little bit of an edge. It gives me an edge. It's a lot of money, but it's a greatquestion. I literally was asking that question this morning. As beautiful as they are, will anybody appreciate them? We'll let you know in about a year.
<Harry Smith> <Positive> Is the allure here the idea that it's the largest this, the most expensive that? With all of those superlatives, is that what is going to draw people into this place?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I've been successful with those superlatives, but you have to produce. You can't just use the words, and this is really the -- the biggest and the best. It's the most beautiful. People have come from the Mirage in Las Vegas, and they've said: This is far more beautiful. And it is a far more beautiful casino, and, you know, that is very much of an honor, because I think that's also a very nice hotel. I really . . .
<Harry Smith> <Negative> How do you compete with an exploding volcano, though?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's easy to compete with. I mean, they haven't got the chandeliers. They haven't got the opulence of -- in the casino.
<Paula Zahn> <Negative> Donald, there are lots of folks out there -- analysts -- who are very concerned that you're not going to be able to pull in the $ 1.3 million in cash that you need to to meet your . . .
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I thought it was one million.
<Paula Zahn> <Neutral> . . . debts, sir. Hey, the numbers are going up all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I know. Now it's going up. When I built Trump Plaza, which is now number one in Atlantic City -- far and away number one -- we beat outCaesar's for the year. Everybody said: How are you going to do $ 250,000a day? Well, we're doing almost $ 900,000 a day. Trump Plaza does$ 900,000 a day, and it's only one-third the size of this particular hotel, so I think a $ 1 million is going to be very easy.
<Paula Zahn> <Negative> So how much of your own cash is at risk, Donald? We know how you financed this with junk bonds. How much cash is in the deal?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, not a lot. You sound like a very good businesswoman, Paula.I'll have to talk to you.
<Paula Zahn> <Neutral> Well, I know a little about real estate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You just signed a hell of a contract, I'll tell you. You just signed a hell of a contract -- not very much of my own cash, but my reputation's at risk. I mean, if this doesn't turn out as successfully as I want it to, my reputation's at risk. At that, to me, in a sense, is more important than perhaps the money involved.
<Harry Smith> <Negative> All kinds of gewgaws there. For instance, this thing behind you -- what's it made of?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, this is a beautiful wood piece with copper fittings and toppings, hand-carved in Marrakesh, and it really came out beautifully.This is ancient carvings and we have a lot of great works of art throughout the building.
<Paula Zahn> <Neutral> Why don't you describe to us what some of the other opulent things are that you can see around the place, and we will show pictures as you talk about them?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we also, as you saw -- you saw the chandeliers. I really think the chandeliers are one of the great features of the building, butI will take you you upstairs to look at the suites, because I've never seen -- I own the Plaza Hotel in New York, and yet I've never seen anywhere in the world suites like we've been able to build at the Taj Mahal.
<Harry Smith> <Neutral> Who's going to be the first one to stay in the suites up there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Why, I think we have a number of main suites, but MichaelJackson's coming in, and a lot of the big stars are coming in and a lot of the high rollers are coming in. Perhaps the high rollers don't want their names mentioned, but they're all coming.
<Harry Smith> <Negative> Do they have to pay?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The high rollers generally don't pay. It depends on who we're talking about. But generally speaking, a high roller coming who spends literally millions of dollars over the course of a year on gaming and gambling doesn't pay for a suite.
<Paula Zahn> <Positive> Well, you're under a tremendous amount of pressure lately.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why do you say that?
<Paula Zahn> <Positive> Both in your professional life and your personal life. How you doing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've never heard anyone say such a thing. I'm doing well.
<Paula Zahn> <Neutral> How are you doing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I feel great. I'm doing well. This was a very big undertaking,and this has turned out to be far more successful than I had thought,because I never realized the kind of accolades we'd be getting for it and the numbers of people that would be coming. I feel good.
<Harry Smith> <Neutral> Do you think all of the publicity about your personal life actually may be enhancing what's going on here -- all of this publicity? I mean, Donald Trump has not been out of the newspaper for -- what? -- three or four months now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Unfortunately, yes. That's right.
<Harry Smith> <Neutral> I mean, this may be . . .
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think . . .
<Harry Smith> <Negative> . . . this may be making money for you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think probably it is. I think that, in a sense, it's unfortunate. I think that, you know, I like doing things on their own merit. I suspect that perhaps you wouldn't be here today had it not been for that. I'm not sure. I mean, you'll have to ask your producers . ..
<Paula Zahn> <Negative> Oh, don't be that cynical.
<Harry Smith> <Negative> I wonder if you would be here if it weren't for that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Huh? I don't know. I'm not even sure, but I really think probably it's -- we have as an example in the opening on Thursday, we have2,400 press credentials coming. That's monstrous. When I did theTyson-Spinks fight, which was the biggest fight probably in the last 10years, I had 700 press credentials. We have 2,400 press credentials. We expected -- let's say, three or four months ago, we expected to have maybe100 press credentials, maybe 150 and possibly 200, and we end up with2,400, so I realize probably that they're not here only because of the brick and mortar.
<Harry Smith> <Positive> Donald Trump, we thank you for giving us a little tour here today.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you and good luck and congratulations on your ratings.I've been watching.
<Paula Zahn> <Positive> Terrific.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're creeping up. You just keep creeping up. Congratulations.
<Paula Zahn> <Positive> Thank you, Donald. We appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So long.
<Paula Zahn> <Negative> Good-bye.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Good-bye, Paula. Good-bye, Harry. We'll be back.
