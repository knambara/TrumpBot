<The Washington Post> <Neutral> Republican nominee Donald Trump sat down with The Post's Philip Rucker for an interview at Trump National Golf Club on Aug. 2 following a rally at a nearby high school. This is a lightly edited transcript of the 50-minute interview.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> So how are you feeling about the campaign?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think really good. I think, uh —
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> Cause there are a couple of polls that came out showing Hillary got a big bounce —
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, she got a bounce —
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> — after her convention.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she got the second. You have the advantage being the second convention. It's a big advantage being the second convention. But I feel good. You see the crowds. I mean, you don't see enthusiasm like that at a Hillary rally. People are falling asleep.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> Did you see Tim Kaine's speech?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I thought it, yeah —
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> He tried to impersonate you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, I thought he was terrible. I thought his speech was terrible. Although he's not popular here. You know, this is Loudoun County. Loudoun County's a big deal.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Whoever wins Loudoun wins the election.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Is that what you think?
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> It's one of the swing counties, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, George! Come here. He just said whoever wins Loudoun wins the election. This is Loudoun.
<George Gigicos> <Neutral> GEORGE GIGICOS, Trump campaign aide: We're in Loudoun County now.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You got 800 acres in Loudoun.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> Loudoun, Fairfax —
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What about Fairfax? Same thing? [crosstalk]
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> [Hillary Clinton is] trying to be the changemaker now. We heard Bill Clinton: She's the biggest changemaker he's ever met in his life.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's been there for 30 years. She's not going to change. Because you look at her donors. So you heard my speech?
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> Mhm.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> How did you like it? [crosstalk]
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> It was interesting.
<Phiip Rucker> <Negative> You made a comment yesterday that has a lot of people talking today, where you said if, if Ivanka worked at Fox News and had that kind of sexual harassment scenario, you think she should —
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm surprised people are talking about that.
<Phiip Rucker> <Negative> They are. You think she should leave and go find another —
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You can do it either way.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Would you want her to follow the path that Gretchen Carlson did?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd want her to do what makes her happy. I'd want her to do, Phil, what makes her happy. [Trump looks at a nearby television, which was tuned to Fox News.] Oh, did they have another one of these things go down? It's terrible that crash. Never liked that plane, structurally. I never thought that plane could —
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> Why should she have to change careers or jobs?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She doesn't have to. She can do it either way. Some people would rather change and some people don't. Some people don't want to be forced to stay in a certain atmosphere. You can do both.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> What do you mean?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You can go through the process. You can also change. You can do both. Uh, you can do one, the other, or both. And I think it depends on the individual. You understand what I mean by that, right?
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> One, the other or both.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> And is there one that's preferable, in your mind?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's gotta be up to the individual. I think it depends on the individual. It also depends on what's available. There may be a better alternative, then there may not. If there's not a better alternative, then you stay. But it could be there's a better alternative where you're taken care of better. But some people don't like staying in an atmosphere that was so hostile. You understand that?
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They don't want to stay in an atmosphere that's so hostile. [crosstalk]
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> Rather just stay there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you can do one, you can do the other, or you can do both — meaning fight it out but be in a place that's more comfortable.
<Phiip Rucker> <Negative> Leave and work someplace else while you fight it out.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Correct.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> What if —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you're right. But if she's being harassed, would you want to stay in a place that she's being harassed in?
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Yeah. And that's what you meant by that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Absolutely. I think a lot of women wouldn't want to stay in a place where they're being harassed.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> Can we talk about the debates for a minute?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> So, master negotiator, how would you negotiate these debates? What —
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think — first of all —
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> — kind of debate do you want?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've been very successful at negotiating debates because if you remember when we had to negotiate, I negotiated the proper timing and other things having to do with one of our other debates, okay? You —
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> Primary debates.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That was me. I don't — I think three debates is the right number. I think that, uh, they'll be extremely well watched. There are those who will say it will be one of the highest-rated shows in television history, if not the highest.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> They're probably right about that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, they're thinking — you know, I've heard that a long time ago. I've heard — when I first started, people were saying, "You know if it ends up being Trump against Clinton, it's going to be the highest-rated debate in the history of television — or, show in the history of television. And they also said something else. It'll probably be the greatest voter turnout in the history of this country. That could very well be.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> What would you negotiate for? Do you want for example Gary Johnson and Jill Stein?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No because they're not getting any . . . I'd rather have head to head and right now they're not getting any numbers. She's doing better than he is, but right now in some polls she's actually not doing badly.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> There were some Jill Stein supporters in Philadelphia.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She doesn't get media coverage only because people perceive her as hurting Hillary Clinton. I'm not sure that that's true.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> I don't know about that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People perceive her as hurting Clinton. I think she's doing very well. I don't think the numbers will be good enough for them to be in the debate.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Have you identified dates when you want it to be? You took issue with it being near the NFL.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think they should be against the NFL because the NFL, those are two big games. I don't think it would be good for the NFL and I don't think it would be good for the debates.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> You have the World Series. There are other events.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There are plenty of dates that are dead nights that you could do. There are plenty evenings that are dead nights that you could have the debates in.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Who do you want to be a moderator?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd want to play a role in that. I'd want to have a fair moderator. I thought that Mitt Romney was treated very unfairly in the third debate [in 2012].
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> You mean Candy Crowley?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I thought it was very unfair. I thought what happened to Mitt Romney was very unfair in the third debate. So, I'd want to be. I'd want to have somebody that I think could be fair. But I think three debates is good. I think it should be on a night where viewers are going to be able to watch. I wouldn't be surprised if Hillary's people had something to do with putting them on these evenings because that's what she did to Bernie Sanders. In all fairness, even if. September, she was always going to be the Democratic nominee so there was no negotiating even back then. You know this was before. . . . She was always expected to win the Democratic nomination so I wouldn't be surprised if they picked those evenings . . .
<Phiip Rucker> <Negative> You said yesterday that you worried the election might be rigged in some way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Phiip Rucker> <Negative> What is your worry exactly?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't like what's going on with voter ID.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> It would be what's happening in the states?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think its ridiculous. I mean the voter ID situation has turned out to be a very unfair development. We may have people vote 10 times. It's inconceivable that you don't have to show identification in order to vote or that that the identification doesn't have to be somewhat foolproof.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Although, there's a tradition in this country of when somebody loses an election, they concede graciously and try to get their supporters on board like Al Gore did in 2000. Would you? You know if some reason Hillary were to win narrowly, would you contest that in some way?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to jump the gun. I don't want to talk about that. I'm just saying that I wouldn't be surprised if the election . . . there's a lot of dirty pool played at the election, meaning the election is rigged. I would not be surprised. The voter ID, they're fighting as hard as you can fight so that that they don't have to show voter ID. So, what's the purpose of that? How many times is a person going to vote during the day? If you don't have voter ID . . .
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> Do you think someone can vote multiple times?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Multiple times. How about like 10 times. Why not? If you don't have voter ID, you can just keep voting and voting and voting.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> Is there anything else that you think could be going on?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, you never know. It started with me in Louisiana when I won Louisiana and I got fewer delegates than Ted Cruz.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> I remember that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said, "Whoa! Whoa! What happens here?" And then I polled well in Colorado. and instead of voting, the bosses picked it. I said, "What's going on here?" It took me a little while to get accustomed to the world of politics and then once I did we started running them off. But, who would've thought that was going to happen? I win a state, I get fewer votes. Then, I poll great in Colorado and all of a sudden . . . the voters aren't going to choose. The bosses are going to choose. Anything is possible.
<Phiip Rucker> <Negative> I have to ask you because this has been the story now for four days: the Khan family. I've seen the statements you've put out and what you had to say last night on Fox News. First of all, does it bother you that they continue to do interviews and sort of drive the —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Just unfair media. Just the unfair media. It's purely and simply the unfair media.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> What do you mean by that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They want the story to stay alive as long as possible.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Do you think they're somehow trying to, the Khan family, are they on TV to try to help Hillary?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People have to form their own opinion. I've said everything I can say about it. I was viciously attacked from the stage, and I have a right to answer back. I've said everything I could say. I was viciously attacked on the stage, and I have a right to answer back. That's all I have to say about it.
<Phiip Rucker> <Negative> Do you understand why some people would say that you lack some sort of common decency?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think frankly a lot of people agree with what I'm saying. I was viciously attacked on the stage. All I did was respond to it. Pure and simple. It should've been a one-hour story and they make it a longer story.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> It's a four-day story.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean fine. So, I have no further thing to say other than I have a right to answer back.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> Now that the conventions are over and we're moving into the general election, you've been going after the media more than you have been before. Do you sense any actual shift in the way you're being covered in this phase of the campaign?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah. It's getting worse.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> In television in particular . . .
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's worse now because before I had 16 Republican, conservative people and the media had their favorite but they didn't particularly love anybody. Now it's myself really against the media.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> What do you mean by that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The media has a tremendous bias and has for a very long time against the Republican party and against somebody that happens to be conservative. They certainly have a tremendous bias against me. Everyone's talking about it. Worldwide, they're talking about the bias. When you look at the New York Times, when you look at The Washington Post, when you look at CNN. I mean CNN is all Trump all the time. It's called the Clinton News Network. Every story is Trump. All day long no matter what it is.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> You are the biggest story in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I get ratings. If I didn't get ratings, they wouldn't do it. They don't care about poll numbers, they only care about ratings. And, I get ratings but I don't do interviews for those people anymore. I don't watch CNN anymore. I don't do interviews with CNN anymore because its not worth it. It's very biased against me.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> What's your plan then if you don't engage with the media that you think are biased against you? How do you get your message out and communicate to people?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What I did today.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> Just social media? Rallies?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Social media, where I'm head and shoulders above everybody else. I've read now 22 million people on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. More than 22 million people. Nobody else is even close. [crosstalk]
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> How has [running mate Mike] Pence been doing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Pence has been great. You know Kaine, in Virginia where I am right now, you know he wasn't popular?
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Well, he got elected several times to different jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No but they're very close, ever notice? They're very close elections. He even said they were very close. But his first move as governor of Virginia was to raise taxes by 4 billion dollars. He was not popular in Virginia. He wasn't popular. [Trump looks up at the television] Do you believe that Debbie Schultz, Wasserman Schultz, there she is. She's very happy — look how happy she looks. She looks very happy.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Not very happy at all.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Do you believe that Deborah Wasserman Schultz [crosstalk] she looks just as happy as Bernie did. She's now hired by Clinton.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Oh, well, she's got a job on the campaign now.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Payback.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> She also has a primary challenge that comes from the Bernie people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think she's gonna lose.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> You think so?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Are you hearing that? She went to a rally and they were booing her.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Now do you believe definitively that you support Paul Ryan in his primary? Because that's something that blew up last night because you had a comment in support of his opponent in the primary.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I didn't support him. I just thanked him for sending their love.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Have you endorsed Paul Ryan?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> His opponent sent me a nice letter and I merely thanked him.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Do you support Ryan?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nobody has asked me if I support Ryan.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> I'm asking now though.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm giving it very serious consideration.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> To supporting Ryan?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> But you haven't decided?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I never said I'd support him. I'm giving it very serious consideration. [crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Just so you understand, his opponent is a big fan of what I'm saying. Big fan. His opponent who's running a very good campaign obviously. You may have heard. His opponent sent me a very scholarly and well thought out letter yesterday. All I did was say thank you very much for your very nice letter.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> It got interpreted a certain way though to suggest somehow that you're supporting him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I'm giving it very serious consideration to that whole situation.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> To Ryan.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> To Ryan. To Paul.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Do you want to work with him? Do you think you can work with him if elected?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, I think so.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Even though on a couple of these instances he's shone some daylight with you, like over the Khan — [crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Trump watches himself on TV] Lot of energy. We got a lot of energy. She certainly doesn't look presidential to me, Hillary. I don't think you get to look less presidential actually than Hillary.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Let's go back just a little bit to Pence. I'd love you to tell me what your relationship's like.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think it's phenomenal.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> How do you guys communicate during the day?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Beyond good. Beyond good.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> Do you talk each day?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, there look, can you believe that? Something, right?
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> Do you think he really gave you the Purple Heart?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, he did. He gave me the Purple Heart.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> I can't believe that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Amazing. [crosstalk]
<Phiip Rucker> <Negative> Did you think about not taking it? Like insisting that he keep it himself?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I did. I said you can't give me this. He said, "Mr. Trump you mean so much to me and my family." You know we're doing very well with the veterans. I know you guys do not like to say that.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Well, half the people in your rallies are veterans.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Looks at the television again] Look at this. It's all Trump all day long. That's why their ratings are through the roof. I'd hate to say, Philip, if I wasn't running, the television networks would be doing less than half the business.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> You think so?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In fact the Hillary convention which did very well but not nearly as well as mine, in all fairness, would've gotten one-third the ratings they got if I weren't.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You want me to give you an exact quote on the Paul Ryan? You were asking.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Yeah, please do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, you're asking me if I'm supporting Paul Ryan?
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Yeah, if you're supporting Paul Ryan.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm not quite there yet.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> And why is that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Just not quite there yet.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> Has he asked for your support?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Everybody wants my support. You know why? Cause I had more than 14 million people that voted for me. And nobody gives us credit. There were 17 people in the race. I got more votes than anybody in the history of Republican politics. By millions. Don't forget. How about if I had two people in the race? The number would've been twice as good. In other words, people with 2 million people. Because the Republican party increased. [Trump looks at the TV.] That statement's gotten a lot of play. I love that statement we wrote. So I'm just not quite there yet.
<Phiip Rucker> <Negative> So you're doing what Paul Ryan did to you, which is not endorse right away but sort of think about it for some time?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like Paul. I like Paul. But these are horrible times for our country. We need very strong leadership. We need very, very strong leadership. And I'm just not quite there. I'm not quite there yet.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> Now Mitch McConnell is not on the ballot this year but where are you in terms of him, should he be the leader of the Senate?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's up to the Senate. Up to the senators.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Were you bothered at all by John McCain's statement yesterday? That was a pretty extraordinary statement.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I haven't endorsed him, as you know.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I haven't endorsed John McCain. And I've never been there with John McCain because I've always felt that he should've done a much better job for the vets. He has not done a good job for the vets and I've always felt that he should've done a much better job for the vets. So I've always had, I've always had a difficult time with John for that reason. Because our vets are not being treated properly, they're not being treated fairly.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> When you say you're not there with him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I didn't say that, I said that about Ryan.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Would you ever consider supporting an opponent to him, or you're just not going to actively —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, just, I have not endorsed John McCain. I have not endorsed John McCain. [crosstalk]
<Phiip Rucker> <Negative> Is it a political mistake for some of these senators to be distancing themselves from you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I think it is because —
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Like Kelly Ayotte up in New Hampshire?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look, in New Hampshire, I'm at —
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Well you won the primary there —
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By a lot. New Hampshire's one of my favorite places. You have a Kelly Ayotte, who doesn't want to talk about Trump, but I'm beating her in the polls by a lot. You tell me. Are these people that should be representing us? Okay? You tell me. I don't know Kelly Ayotte. I know she's given me no support, zero support, and yet I'm leading her in the polls. And I'm doing very well in New Hampshire. We need loyal people in this country. We need fighters in this country. We don't need weak people. We have enough of them. We need fighters in this country. But Kelly Ayotte has given me zero support and I'm doing great in New Hampshire. You know, as you saw, I'm eight points up. I'm leading Hillary Clinton by eight points.
<Phiip Rucker> <Negative> That word fighter, that was in the Democratic Convention every night, that was the big theme for Hillary, that she's been fighting her whole . . .
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hillary's not a fighter.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> . . . life for children and families.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hillary's not a fighter.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> Why do you say that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And Hillary's not a change person. She's gonna be a person to keep it just the way it is. It's gonna be four more years of [President] Obama.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> So 98 days, 97 days now. Left in the campaign. How are you going to beat her? Explain the path here. What are the states you win? What are the kind of voters you're going to bring into your coalition?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I'm going to to do great in Ohio, we're going to do great in Pennsylvania, I think I'm going to do great in Florida and I think I'm going to do great in states that some people aren't even thinking about. Because I'm different than Republican candidates, than other Republican candidates. I've got states that we can win that other Republican candidates wouldn't even stop over for dinner.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Like what? Like Maine?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd rather not say. Because why should I highlight it? But we have some states that I think are very competitive in that no Republican has ever been competitive in. But I'd rather not say what they are. Don't you agree with that? I'd rather not say what they are.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> So you'll win with the secret state strategy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, not the secret state, no. But I have states, and you know this, I have states that no other Republican would do well in that I think I'm gonna win. But I don't want to name those states.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> But I mean Michigan and Pennsylvania.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's my attitude on the military. I don't like telling the enemy what I'm doing. I think I'll do well in Michigan. I've been talking about cars for five years. And how unfair it is that . . .
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> Jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I've been talking about Michigan for five years. I won Michigan in a massive landslide. Remember, I beat Kasich. Remember, Kasich was gonna win Michigan? There was only one problem.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> He didn't.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He had the wrong person he was running against, okay? Remember he was gonna win, you know, the whole belt around him? Except one problem: I won everything around him. And I did well in Ohio, too, by the way.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> He's still resisting you in Ohio, I mean he was making a big show of that in the convention, of not stepping foot in the convention.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's okay. Look, I got 13 million more votes than him. I had, including the islands, 42 states, including the islands, he had 1. I had 42, he had 1. I had 14 million, uh, 13 million votes more, I don't think so, but we'll see. You know he's taken it very hard, he's taken his loss very hard, and I can understand that. But he did sign a pledge. I mean that's a problem, for him. But look, he's gonna have to do what he has to do, but I think I'm going to do very well in Ohio. The people of Ohio are not happy with what he's doing. I can tell you that. They're not happy with what he's doing. But the Republican Party more than any other thing has to have a victory, a presidential victory, for one thing, if nothing else: Supreme Court justices. [crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> For anybody that fights me, like if John Kasich is fighting or if somebody else fights this, because, I mean, why would he fight? I had a massive victory over him and everyone else. Massive. I don't mean like I eked it out. I had a massive victory over Ted, it turned out. Remember Indiana was gonna be the change? I was gonna win New York, I was gonna win, then Indiana? But Indiana was a landslide. You gotta get over it. You know, at some point you gotta get over it. Otherwise we're gonna have three or four new Supreme Court justices that are going to be a disaster for the Republican Party.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I am gonna do a couple PACs, at the right time.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> What do you mean?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm gonna do two or three $10 million PACs at the right time.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> What does that mean, though, a PAC?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Anti-certain candidate PACs.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> You mean Clinton, or elsewhere?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm not saying against her, but I'm gonna do anti-, I'll be active in politics through PACs at a later date.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Like during this election year, or?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> Or in the future?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> For future elections.
<Phiip Rucker> <Negative> Oh. So if there's a candidate you don't like who's running, you would fund a PAC to hurt them?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Republican or Democrat.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. That I'll do.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> Would you do that against Cruz, if he runs again?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Maybe.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> He seems to want to run again.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Maybe against Kasich.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> They both want to run.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Cruz's numbers have gone through the floor. Now that showed loyalty.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> I was on the floor of the convention when that happened . . .
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They had to bring his wife out. She was in danger.
<Phiip Rucker> <Negative> . . . and interviewed a lot of delegates and they were very upset with him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> From Texas.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> Yeah.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> I just want to make sure I understand what you are saying, after this election's over you would be considering starting some PAC
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Here's what I think: I'm gonna win the election. Somebody said on television, somebody said last night on television: Nobody has gotten rich betting against Donald Trump. That's in my lifetime. That's not just for this election cycle. I went in, and people said: "He's not gonna run." I've gone through this with you.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> And your papers. They said you wouldn't file your disclosures.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By the way, those give you much more detail than tax returns, okay? Tax returns give you nothing. Tax returns give you no information.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> And you won't go back on that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. Not until I'm finished with my audit. You know, Mitt Romney was treated very unfairly. Mitt Romney didn't want to give his tax returns, because people don't understand returns that are complicated, and complex. And he didn't give it. He fought it, fought it, fought it, all the way into September. A month before the election, he gave his tax returns. And they picked out two items that were absolutely perfect. He did nothing wrong. And his returns are very much smaller than my returns. You saw the picture of me with my returns? Mitt had perfect returns, they did absolutely nothing wrong, and they took a couple of lines made him look bad.
<Phiip Rucker> <Neutral> The Swiss bank account.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He did nothing wrong. They took a couple of lines that were absolutely perfect and they made him look bad. Now, my returns are four feet tall.
<Phiip Rucker> <Positive> I think we'd all like to see them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Show him the picture with the tax return. So, the audit's routine. I've been audited for many, many years in a row, which I think is unfair, but that's the way it is.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> It's 31 past the hour. Joining us now, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. It's his first interview since the Iowa caucus. Donald, good morning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> How's it going?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's going good. It's going really good.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> OK, so let's talk about Iowa. What happened?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Can you hear us?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can hear you fine, Joe.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Yes, so the question is -- you talked about it some last night. What's your postmortem on Iowa? What do you think happened there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that I did well there. I think, you know, I came in second place, a strong second place. I think that probably if I would have -- I was told always that I could not do well in Iowa. I was told don't go to Iowa.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I said what are you talking about? And they said it's not your place, don't go there. I said but I know people there, I think I'll do well. And I went there. You know, I started in 10th place.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I went there, I came in, I ended up in second place. I guess there was a poll that came out that had me winning it by four or five points, a pretty close poll, but I came in second place and I'm happy with that. It's interesting that Marco came in third place and they said it's one of the great victories in the history of politics. And I said, well, how come if he came in third place and I came in substantially better at second place, why isn't mine one of the great victories in the history of politics? And they said no, no, his is, but yours isn't.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I said, oh, that's wonderful, I didn't understand that. But I came in second place. I was satisfied. I think probably it's a place I could've won if I really went there more and did a little more work there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I was satisfied with it.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> So it's interesting because I've heard you talking about Iowa, and you said that before. It seems like -- I guess I'd like to ask what you're learning along the way but about what worked and didn't work. It's not like you've done this before, so the second place finish is fairly incredible when you look at historic lines. But for example, what worked and what didn't work in Iowa? And I'm curious what you think about Sarah Palin's involvement. Was it a plus for Sarah Palin or a plus for you? .
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it was a plus for Sarah, to have her. I think she's a very good person, she's a terrific woman. I think it was a plus. I think it helped. I think it was very good for me. And certainly Ted Cruz would have liked to have had her. He wanted her very badly. But I think having Sarah was a plus.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> So moving on to New Hampshire, what have you learned from Iowa that you're going to apply to New Hampshire, South Carolina, and other contests ahead?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's different because the caucus system is very complicated. I mean, you just never know what's going to happen with a caucus. You think everything's fine and it's not like you walk in and you vote and you walk out. You're in and out in ten minutes or two minutes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The caucus system is a complex system and I was never familiar with it. I mean, I was never involved with the caucus system. Don't forget, Joe, I'm doing this for the first time. I'm like a rookie and I'm learning fast and I do learn fast, and I think we're doing really -- I think we did very well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, look, there were many governors and many senators in Iowa that would have loved to have had the second-place finish. I am doing I think really well in New Hampshire. The response is great. I don't know if you saw the speech I made last night but we had 5,000 people there last night packed into two big rooms, two massive rooms actually.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They were pretty big. And it was an amazing thing. Other people were up there three or four days before, they had 200 people and 159 people. And we had 5,000 people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was an amazing event and it had a great chemistry going last night.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Now let's go to Willie Geist in New York who has a question. Willie.
<Willie Geist> <Positive> Donald, good morning, good to talk to you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi, Willie.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Hello. Let's talk about what happened in Iowa just a little bit as it pertains to New Hampshire. You've obviously risen on the power of your personality and your big crowds, but Ted Cruz won Iowa based on his organization. He had people who'd been working for months and months getting out to precinct, making sure that voters came out. Do you feel in some ways you need to have a little bit more of a conventional campaign? Which is to say more organization on the ground going forward and more of a team that's working on those kind of things?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think we could have used a better ground game, a term I wasn't even familiar with. You kow, when you hear ground game, you say what the hell is that? [Laughter] Now I'm familiar with it. But, you know, I think in retrospect we should have had a better ground game. I would have funded a better ground game, but people told me our ground game was fine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And by most standards it was. Don't forget, in the history of Iowa, I got the most votes other than one person, Ted. I got the most votes in the history of Iowa for the Republican primary and caucus. I got a tremendous amount of votes, nobody came close.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So that's in history, other than the one person. So there was a lot of action we had -- I think 50,000 or 60,000 people more voted than last time, which is tremendous and I think I'll take some of that credit. There was a lot of spirit. I think I brought something to the Republicans.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And actually Ted had said this and other people have said this, you know, I had brought something. I brought a lot of people, a lot more eyeballs are going in, looking at what we're doing, and the crowds are much bigger. I think crowds are bigger for everyone. The crowds are very big for me but I think I've helped the crowds be bigger for everybody.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So that's a great thing. Now we had a record turnout, a record voter turnout in Iowa. My vote was a total record. I came in second place, and it was an easy second place.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I won by more than 2,000 votes. You know, people said that Marco, a good guy, but people said Marco was right next to me. Well, he was more than 2,000 votes away. That's a lot of votes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I came in tan easy second, and the one thing I had spoken to Joe about after it happened, I said sort of strange because when Marco came in third, they were saying it was unbelievable. In fact, you would have thought he won. And I said why are they so excited about Marco's third place finish? And then people spoke a little derisively about my second place finish. I said to myself that's strange. I came in second, he came in third, and his is a tremendous victory and mine's not.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Donald, welcome to politics.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Exactly.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Howard Dean finished third in Iowa and his campaign was over. And Marco Rubio finishes third in Iowa --
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> And Hillary Clinton celebrated without even knowing whether she had really won.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Yes. It's all expectations. Cokie Roberts?
<Cokie Roberts> <Negative> Mr. Trump, I have to get a little plug in here. ABC has a debate Saturday night. Are you going to show up?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, I will. You know, we had a debate -- a lot of people said maybe that caused me to go down a couple of points. Because I like the debates, I've done well in the debates, I've won a lot of the debates. Some people said I've won all the debates.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> According to the polling I've won all the debates. I do like doing it. I didn't know -- what did I know about debating? That wasn't what I did for a living. And so I like it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I was not treated properly by Fox and -- with their memo. And I said I'm not going to do it. And, you know, I'm happy I didn't because I raised $6 million for the vets. I had something that night, I had basically a fundraiser for the vets.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And in a period of one hour we raised $6 million, so I was very happy with that. And frankly I don't think I would have given up a first versus second and not give the vets $6 million.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So finishing second and getting them $6 million was OK for me. But I might have been hurt by the debates, by not being at the debates.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Interesting. Katty?
<Katty Kay> <Positive> Mr. Trump, it's Katty Kay here. I just want to ask you about a tweet that you wrote. I don't believe I've been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So Katty, I've turned down tens of millions of dollars of friends of mine that want to give -- just like I raised the money for the vets. I got Carl Icahn for a half a million dollars. I got Phil Ruffin for a million dollars. I got Ike Perlmutter for a million dollars. You know, I got these people giving millions of dollars, so I would be the greatest fund raiser in the history of politics if I was let loose. I said that I was going to self-fund my campaign. In other words, I was going to put up my money. So I don't think I get any credit for it.
<Katty Kay> <Negative> But you think it's not worth it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What's that?
<Katty Kay> <Negative> You it's not worth self-funding your campaign?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, I'm just saying with the voters, I'm talking about. I don't think that I get credit for doing -- I think it is a -- look, I don't mind taking in $200 million, $300 million. You know, Bush took in $128 million, all right? That's peanuts compared to what I'd raise. I'd get guys to put up so much money, $10 million easy a shot. I would have that number beaten by five times if I wanted.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> So, so, Donald --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And here's the thing. I didn't think I get any credit for self-funding my campaign. In other words, the voters aren't going into the booth saying oh, Trump is self-funding his campaign, that's a big factor, and therefore I'm going to vote for him. And yet it's a very -- I mean, you're the talking about a lot of money. You're talking about potentially hundreds of millions of dollars.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> So, are you, Donald, are you going to change --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't think I get the credit that it's worth.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> So are you going to change possibly and possibly start taking money in the future?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. I said I'm not -- no, I said I wasn't going to change. But I just don't think it's fair because I'm the only one that's self-funding. Everyone else is, you know, taking in money from the lobbyist and special interests.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So, Donald, let me show you -- and, actually, I think you're reading that wrong. I think it's why a lot of people are actually showing up because you're not getting money from the usual suspects. I'm showing a chart right now on TV. This is not even super PAC money.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> If this were super PAC money, the numbers would be a lot higher. If I am investing in Donald Trump's operation, I would invest with a guy who gets the most bang for his buck. That is you. At 300.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> But then there's the question -- should you have spent more money in Iowa? You were the most efficient spender there, but going to New Hampshire, going to South Carolina, will you spend more money to make sure you finish the deal in future states?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, Joe, there's no limit on the spending. The reason I didn't spend that much in Iowa is everyone told me I couldn't win so I sort of just went through the motions a little bit. And then I came in second place. I was surprised, because it only came out the last couple of days where it looked like I could win Iowa with this poll. And by then --
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Do you trust polls -- do you trust polls less? Or do you just do -- I mean, we all put it down to how weird the caucuses are. Are you still going to be trusting polls as much as before? Or do you think Iowa's sort of a one-off?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it is. I think that polls for a caucus don't work very well. The polls for a caucus, it's too complex, the system is too complex.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And if you look through history, polls aren't very accurate for the caucus. I would say that polling, yes, I trust polling for other things, especially when you do cumulative polling, when you take many polls, put them together. I really -- I generally tend to trust it. I don't know.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sometimes I wonder how that can work where they take 300 people and they do a poll of the United States and it comes out pretty accurately. The good ones come out pretty accurately. Hard to believe.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Well, congratulations on a strong showing in Iowa. And by the way, what do you think of what happened on the Democratic side?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think when you're flipping coins and when I think Hillary won six out of six, and if she got the nomination because of that, but she's flipping coins, I want to find out where did she get the coin because I want it. [Laughter] She won six out of six coins. That's pretty crazy.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right, Donald Trump. You can take that one to Vegas.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Donald Trump, thank you very much, we'll see you in New Hampshire.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Take care.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Goodbye.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Joining us now from his headquarters here in New York City is Mr. Trump. So, the journal says, you are killing the Republican Party over immigration. And you say?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to bring our country back, Bill. We are in big trouble. We are losing so much, we're losing so much to sell many and we have to bring our country back. We have at least 11 million illegals in the country not only the jobs they are taking but everything else. And you know about the crime wave because I think probably nobody has covered the crime wave better than you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There is a literal crime wave going on. You know, and if you look, we have spent last year $113 billion on illegal immigrants. We have to do something about it and we have to start by building a wall, a big beautiful powerful wall. It can have a gate. It can have a door. We'll let people in illegally but we have to stop what is happening to our country because we're losing our country.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Okay. Now, I want to advance the dialogue here. The strongest part of your immigration plan in my opinion is the wall. I think it is a doable thing. Rudy Giuliani came in here and you can do it. And that would cut down a lot of the illegal immigration and not only that, the drug trafficking which is out of control.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> So, I support the wall. But then you say, well, we have to have mass deportations, that is not going to happen because the 14th Amendment says if you are born here you are an American and you can't kick Americans out. And then if you want to deport the people already here, each and every one are entitled to due process and it would take decades to do that and gazillions of dollars and the courts would block you at every turn.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> You must know all that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Bill, I think you are wrong about the 14th amendment and frankly the whole thing with anchor babies and the concept of anchor babies I don't think you are right about that.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> I can quote it. You want me to quote you the amendment? If you are born here you are an American, period, period.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But there are many lawyers -- many lawyers are saying that's not the way it is in terms of this. What happens is they are in Mexico, they are going to have a baby, they move over here and a couple of days they have the baby. No, but Bill, they are saying it is not going to hold up in court. Now it's going to have to be tested but they say it's not going to hold up in court.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Regardless, when people are illegally in the country they have to go. Now, the good ones and there are plenty of good ones, will work so it is expedited, we can expedite it where they come back in but they come back legally. Bill, we have a country. You need borders and you need laws. We have no law.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> I have been saying that for decades I've been saying that. But you are not going to be able to deport people who have American citizenship now and the federal courts will never allow mass deportations without due process for each and every one. And do you envision federal police kicking in the doors in barrios around the country dragging families out and putting them on a bus?
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Do you envision that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Bill, I don't think they have American citizenship. And if you speak to some very, very good lawyers. And I know some would disagree. But many of them agree with me, you will going to find, they do not have American citizenship. We have to start a process where we take back our country. Our country is going to hell.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have to start a process Bill where we take back our country.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Now, there is a way to do it and that is to try to get the constitution amended. Do you know how to do that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a long process and I think it would take too long. I would much rather find out whether or not anchor babies are actually citizens.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> All right. You can test, why don't you test it out? Why don't you have your guys file a federal suit now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We'll going to test it out.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> You can do it tomorrow.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We'll going to test it out. That's going to happen, Bill.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Now, the "Wall Street Journal" basically says, look, in the fields of California, there are food rotting because we can't get Americans to go in at $17 an hour plus benefits by the way, and pick the fruit and pick the vegetables in California. So, you need the illegal labor in there. I don't think you need illegal labor.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> I think you need legal labor. And I would make it much more, much easier to get legal people in here to do that work if they want it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I agree with that. I agree with that.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Okay. You agree. Good. I'm good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Now, the journal also says that Hispanic-Americans are going to turn away from the Republican Party in droves because of you even if you don't win, they're going to hate the Republican Party. What do you say to that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, in Nevada, they just did a poll, I am leading in every state virtually every state that they polled. And in Nevada, they just did a major poll where I am not only leading by big numbers but I also won the Hispanic vote. And I have been saying, I'm going to win the Hispanic vote. And the reason I'm going to is, I am going to bring jobs back.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm going to bring jobs back from China, from Japan, from all of these places including Mexico by the way which is really taking advantage of the United States both on the border and from the standpoint of trade. So, I will be bringing jobs back, Bill. Nobody else can do it like me. In fact, in the same poll they had me blowing away the competition when it comes to the economy which is a very big factor.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Okay. Now, you in order to be president are going to have to win over a sizable amount of the so-called independent voters, not registered Republicans. Okay. You know that, right? Because all the polls based on republican-leaning voters and now you will have to go out. All right? Are you going to modify it a little bit?
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Are you going to go out with the scorch and burn tactics you've used so far?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, if you look what happened last time with Romney, I mean, they say he didn't do well with the Hispanics. But the truth is, he didn't do well with the Republicans. They sat home and they didn't go out and vote. They had no incentive to vote. If you look at the polls that are coming out on me, they have a great incentive to vote.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They like what I say. I think they like me in a certain way which is nice. It is always nice to be liked. But they have a great incentive to come out and vote for me because we are going to make America great again. Romney never said that and unfortunately tremendous, millions and millions of people sat home Bill, and didn't vote.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They will come out and vote.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Three million. Three million.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We are going to energize the base.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That would have been a big difference.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Fair interview tonight? Fair?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Say it again.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Was this fair? This interview, fair?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're always fair.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> All right. So, you are not going to whine about FOX News now? I'm not going to get, you know, O'Reilly this, you're not going to do that, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I promise. I think you are terrific. I watch you all the time and I think you're fair tonight.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Don't think I'm terrific. Don't think I'm terrific. That's not good for me. All right? And I'm worried if you are president and I will get deported. All right? That's what I'm worried about.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we will going to try like hell to keep you here, Bill.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have always been fair and I appreciate it. Thank you.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> All right. Donald Trump, everybody.
<Larry King> <Positive> Tonight, the Donald is back. Donald Trump, rich, powerful and loves to defeat his opponents. So what's the star of The Apprentice make of these other rich-guy reality shows? How does he feel about getting married soon? All that and more with the one and only Donald Trump for the hour There are so many things going on in his life. It's always a great pleasure to have Donald Trump with us. He's an old friend. His latest book is Trump: Think Like a Billionaire What do you think about all of this, Donald? What's happened to you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know what happened, Larry. It's been a lot of fun. I'm having a good time, but I'm not exactly sure what's happened. It's been wild. The Apprentice has been a tremendous success. The real estate in New York has never been better. I've never been -- I've never done as well as I've done. I'm the largest developer by far in New York. And I'm just having a good time.
<Larry King> <Negative> Is the only downside in all of this the Atlantic City story?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Atlantic City's doing well. I mean, yes, I put a lot of debt on the property years ago, and now I made a deal that's really terrific. It's less than 1 percent of my net worth, so it doesn't mean a lot from that standpoint. But I think Atlantic City is actually going to be a substantial part of my net worth in the future. As you know, I worked all that out with bondholders, and they were terrific, and I was terrific, and I think Atlantic City is going to be a very big factor and, frankly, the gaming industry in the future. But, right now, it's really just less than 1 percent of my net worth. Frankly, without The Apprentice
<Larry King> <Positive> How do you -- have you always had this bounce-back ability? We've gone through times where I've talked to you where things have been pretty low, and you never lose faith in yourself.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you can't lose faith. I mean, you always have good times and bad times, and you really can't lose faith. I don't want to lose faith in myself.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If I did, I wouldn't be talking to you right now, I guess. It's been just very good. I've had a great life.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've enjoyed my life. I've had a lot of fun. I've had some downs, but, you know, I've had friends that went out of business, you'll never see them again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I never went bankrupt. I never any of the things that so many people had to do over the years. And, you know, my company today is much bigger and stronger than it ever was in the past by far.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, they used to talk about me as an '80s guy because I had a hot company in the '80s. But my company is many times bigger than it was in the '80s. So I'm just having a lot of fun.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then, on top of it, we have the hottest show on television, and it's been just great. The Apprentice has been a lot of fun. Working with Mark Burnett and his whole staff has really been a lot of fun for me.
<Larry King> <Negative> OK. You title the book Think Like a Billionaire. What do you mean?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's a mindset, Larry. It's really just -- really in the truest sense of the word, it's a mindset. You have to think like a winner, and most billionaires are winners, although I could see that Mr.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Branson or Mr. Cuban have been sort of losers lately. They got clobbered in the ratings.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I know in the case of Cuban, his show was taken off the air, and I think Branson will soon follow. He had almost nobody watching the other night. But, you know, generally speaking, you have to think like a winner. You have to enjoy what you do. If you don't enjoy what you do, it's never going to work, and maybe almost as importantly as that, if there's a wall in front of you, you have to go through it. You can never, ever give up.
<Larry King> <Negative> Why do you enjoy -- now Branson and Mark Cuban -- both are winners in their life. Both would be declared as highly successful people. So they fail maybe in this show. Maybe they don't work. Why do you enjoy racking it up?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I enjoy winning. I love winning. I love beating people and especially when they get a little bit nasty.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, Cuban started getting a little cute with me and a little nasty to get some publicity for his show and it failed, and I enjoy, you know, rubbing it in his face when he does fail. And the same thing with Branson. I mean, Branson was going around saying how great I was, and then, all of a sudden, a week before his show goes on, he gives me negative stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, he doesn't want to shake anybody's hand. Of course, that's sort of an intelligent thing to do. And I do shake people's hands. But, you know, I'm not a man of the people, right? He is. But the fact is that, you know, as far as Branson's concerned, I doubt -- I personally don't see how he could be a billionaire. He's in the airline business. Who's a billionaire in the airline business? So, you know, he's got a show called The Rebel Billionaire. It had terrible.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Did you watch it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I watched the first 15 minutes of it, and, after that, it was virtually unwatchable.
<Larry King> <Negative> What was -- as a critic, assess what was wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, he tried to copy The Apprentice. but I have real people. I have great people And it was a bad copy of me, and I think it was a bad copy of other shows, frankly, other reality shows. He probably tried to put it all -- but the one he was attacking was me, and The Apprentice So, you know, I don't need to be attacked for that. I should be complimented. And, actually, he started out complimenting me, but some wise person said about a week before he went on that you should really not compliment Trump, you have to go after him to get a little publicity. And he did, and he got a little publicity, and he failed.
<Larry King> <Negative> What makes Apprentice work?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it's a lot of things. I think that, you know, we have a nice cast, but I'm not sure that that's the answer. I think Mark Burnett has done an amazing job, and I think I've done an amazing job. It just works.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Did you ever expect You're fired to become what it became?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I would have never thought that those words would have become -- if I walk down the street, hundreds and hundreds -- and even thousands in some cases -- of people shout out You're fired I went into a stadium the other day, and the entire stadium was screaming You're fired. So who would have known The Apprentice was going to be a ratings juggernaut and just this great phenomenon?
<Larry King> <Neutral> Yes. Since you told me once that you never have much said in your life You're fired
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I have said it, but I've said to people that stole. I mean, generally speaking, you don't say it, Larry, because it's too harsh. In fact, I fired somebody yesterday and I took 20 minutes to explain to him why he can do better outside of my company. I do it nice and easy. Of course, they wake up the next morning, they hate you anyway because they realize, hey, I just got fired. But there's something very beautiful about the words, and when we started...
<Larry King> <Positive> Beautiful?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there is. It's very succinct, there's no question about it, and it certainly plays very well, and it's become an amazing phrase.
<Larry King> <Positive> Doing -- say it for me once like the way you say it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Larry, you're fired.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Now do you enjoy saying it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I don't like firing people. I'm not Leona.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm not other people. I don't really enjoy firing people. But I have certainly a good time on the show.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It just works for the show so well, and, you know, it's not like, oh, gee, please, give me another chance. It doesn't work that way. It's so succinct. It's so beautiful in its finiteness. And it's just -- it's over. It's just over. And, you know, this happened on the first show of The Apprentice I was going to say, Hey And I heard them just screaming. And they were probably 50 yards away. And I said, What's going on? I didn't even know what happened. And they loved it so much. So this was something that I came up with during my first boardroom scene and I used it. I've used it since.
<Larry King> <Positive> When we come back, we'll ask Donald what's it like to have been so well known in the business world and now go way beyond that as to be known by the guy on the corner in Des Moines. Right back with Donald Trump. The book: Think Like a Billionaire. Trump: Think Like a Billionaire. More about the book. More about lots of things. Don't go away.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Begin Clip] Jennifer, what did you think of Elizabeth?
<Jennifer> <Negative> I think she was weak, she was ineffective, and she's indecisive.
<Unidentified Male> <Positive> Mr. Trump, Elizabeth really personified bad leadership.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Elizabeth, all of your people that you were leading are saying you were terrible.
<Elizabeth> <Positive> Yes. Well, they're going to say that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What the hell's missing with you? Let me ask you: Would you pick two people or three people to come back to the boardroom?
<Elizabeth> <Neutral> Two.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Honestly, Elizabeth, I just don't think it's necessary. You're fired. [End Clip] [Begin Clip] Chris, why didn't you let her go?
<Chris> <Positive> I'll tell you why. Two different vendors came up to me, and they said, you know what, if she wasn't a lawyer, she would be excellent as a salesperson in this business.
<Carolyn Kepcher> <Positive> You sold two dresses. How good could she be?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, should I fire Yvonna right now?
<Chris> <Positive> Instead of me? Absolutely. I'm an asset.
<Yvonna> <Negative> I'm a performer… [Crosstalk] ... be here.
<Chris> <Negative> How many people have called me to the boardroom out of the five times you've been here? It's never happened. This is the first time I've been here. She's been here five times.
<Yvonna> <Neutral> Because you've been skating by by the skin of your teeth.
<Chris> <Neutral> So I would say that I'm -- I would say that rather I've been more of a leader.
<Yvonna> <Negative> You can complain and complain and complain, but you never offer solutions.
<Kevin> <Negative> People are always slapping the people who take the most in.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Kevin, who would you fire?
<Kevin> <Negative> I would fire Chris.
<Yvonna> <Neutral> I would fire Chris as well.
<Chris> <Neutral> Listen...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's more spark right now in the final minutes before execution than there was for two days, and I can't believe you led the team so badly. And, Chris, you're fired.
<Larry King> <Negative> [End Clip] Donald, how did the previous winners -- how have they done?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They've done unbelievably well. If you look at Nick and Amy and Omarosa -- I mean, Omarosa -- people couldn't stand her, and she's making a fortune. They've all done really well. And the new crop are absolutely equal at least, are just making a fortune after they get fired. So they have done -- they have hit paydirt. Somebody was telling me that Troy goes out and makes speeches for $20,000, $25,000 a speech. So they're all very happy, and, you know, Larry...
<Larry King> <Neutral> How about Bill? How about Bill Ransick?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Bill Ransick is doing fantastic. He's probably making less money than anybody else. But Bill Ransick is absolutely a winner. He's been a fantastic guy and a fantastic asset to me. And, as you know, we're starting a $900 million building in Chicago. We just started construction of it, and Bill's involved, and he really couldn't -- somebody asked me the other day, would you have done Bill again, would you have hired him again, and the answer is absolutely yes. He's been even better than I anticipated.
<Larry King> <Negative> Wouldn't it have been very awkward, Donald -- I guess you thought about it -- if he hadn't worked out?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, of course it's awkward, but a lot of things don't work out and you get by it. But Bill has worked out and he just couldn't be a better guy. And he's learning. He's an apprentice.
<Larry King> <Positive> I mean, he's not going to build a $900 million building. He's an apprentice. He's working with tremendous professionals. We just started demolition, as you know, of the Sun-Times site. It's the best site in Chicago, always has been. I've always wanted it. I got it. And we just -- literally just started of the building, and it's going to be a fantastic building. I think it will be one of the great buildings of this country. By the way, when we had The Apprentice competitors on
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Troy is fantastic. But I also understood that when I did it, I wasn't being that generous. I really would love to do it. But Troy's probably 32, 33 years old. He's got a family and children, a fantastic guy, and I think it's going to be hard for him to go back to college, OK. So, when I said I'll pay for your education, how do you go back to college at that age with that family? But I think that if he does go back -- and I hope he goes back in a certain way, but, in another way, he's got to take care of a family. So I'm not sure it's going to be easy. But I certainly will pay for his education.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Do you get emotionally involved with these people?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think so. I respect them. I like them. I guess I like them even more because the show has become so successful, and, you know, they've become legendary people in their own right. So there's a certain, you know, family spirit there. But emotionally involved? No.
<Larry King> <Positive> Concerning ego, I once asked Jackie Gleason about ego, and he said all ego is is confidence. If you've got confidence in yourself, you should have an ego. How do you react when people say that you have an enormous ego?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I've never seen a successful person without an ego. Never. I have never -- I've watched over the years, and I look for it, and I try and be as non-egotistical as possible and all of that stuff, Larry. But I've never seen a person who was successful who didn't have an ego or, maybe to put it in your terms, who didn't have confidence.
<Larry King> <Positive> But you wear it on your shoulder more or you're certainly more outward about it. We all may have it, but not many go around saying, wow, I'm fantastic.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, I do a good job, Larry. I'm the biggest developer in the city. I do a great job in real estate. I do a good job at what I do. And, frankly, you know, you might as well say it.
<Larry King> <Negative> I've seen many people over the years who had talent, but they didn't have any idea how to sell their talent and nobody knew that they were talented. Nobody knew they did good, and, ultimately, they failed. So I don't fail and I'm not going to let myself fail. It just isn't in my vocabulary. Latest rumor, by the way. Are you buying the Ritz in Paris?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, that was a joke. I said -- in fact, Mohammad al Fayed owns it. He's a friend of mine. And I said I think I'll buy the Ritz and give it to Melania, and every -- it became a front-page story. It was just a joke.
<Larry King> <Negative> What about Vegas?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm just starting in Vegas. We have a great building going up. A friend of mine -- a great friend of mine is Phil Roughin who owns the Frontier, and we're doing a 64-story Trump International Hotel and Tower, and it's going to be beautiful. We should start it within a few months, and it's just going to be an amazing building. It's a condominium. And when it's completed, I think it will be just absolutely one of the top buildings anywhere.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Why not a gambling casino?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I may do that second. I mean, I wanted to get there with my real estate business first because the real estate is so good in terms of what I do, and I do it so well, and I may very well end up doing that. You know, the gaming company that I have is a very -- has become, with the advent of the deal I just cut, a very, very strong and powerful company, and maybe I'll take that there afterwards. But, right now, I'm building a residential and hotel tower, and it will be, I think, a tremendous success. It's a condominium.
<Larry King> <Negative> Why is Vegas so hot as a living community?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think the politicians and the casino control commission and everybody -- they all work together. They've really made it a tremendous place. It's tremendous esprit de Corp, spirit.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There's just a great feeling going on in Las Vegas, and I like it. I love going there. I've had a great relationship with many of the people out there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Steve Winn is a good friend of mine. I mean, so many different people I have out there, and, you know, you look at the great job that Terry Lanny's done and Kirk Kerkorian and all of the people at MGM and so many other companies -- they really have done a great job. But the government has led them down a very correct path. Now maybe they influenced the government, and that's a positive thing. But Vegas has just been a great phenomenon, very much like The Apprentice has been a phenomenon. You don't know why sometimes.
<Larry King> <Positive> So these are competitors, the Trumps and the Winns, that you respect?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, sure I respect. And, you know, I like a lot of people that I respect. Oftentimes, you don't like people that you also respect, but the people I mentioned, I like them all very much.
<Larry King> <Positive> We'll be right back with more of Donald Trump. The book is Trump: Think Like a Billionaire We'll talk about the merchandising of Donald Trump and other areas and about fame right after this.
<Darrell Hammond> <Negative> [Begin Clip] And 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
<Darrell Hammond> <Positive> Hello. This is the Donald from Trumpsylvania telling you to watch this week's special Halloween episode of The Apprentice. These contestants are going to be shaking in their suits because
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Begin Clip] Kwame, I think you have an amazing future. You're a brilliant guy, great education, and I have no doubt that you're going to be a big success. But, for right now, Bill, you're hired. [End Clip]
<Larry King> <Negative> A dramatic moment. Donald, what's it like to have gone from a very well-known businessman, entrepreneur, New Yorker to being known in Wichita?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think I was known, Larry. I think I was known all over the place, but...
<Larry King> <Negative> But not like this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... I guess nothing like this. Look, when you have, you know, a super hit show on television, you probably are known better, but, you know, somebody was saying, oh, you're on the cover of all these magazines in the last six months and year, and I said but I was on the cover of all these magazines before, other than perhaps TV Guide and a couple of them. You know, I was on the cover of TIME And it was sort of interesting looking at that clip. When I said Bill
<Larry King> <Negative> Very.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... but it doesn't have the beauty of So-and-so
<Larry King> <Negative> You're not kidding. Let's touch a lot of bases. I want to get into the book, too. When Martha Stewart was found guilty, you were on this program and you said her mistake was -- in fact, you predicted it -- that her mistake was not testifying. What do you make of her decision to do prison time and how it might effect the business?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I hate the fact that she's doing the prison time because I think it really nullifies the appeal. I think it's hard for an appeals court judge -- and I know a lot of the appeals court judges, and they're brilliant people and they're terrific people, but how do they -- it's very hard for them to now all of a sudden overturn something when she's in there. It's like -- and this is psychological.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This isn't law. This is psychologically it's awfully tough for them to say, OK, let her out, she's OK, the trial -- let's do a mistrial, let's do something. And I really tried to encourage her not to go.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And now she also wants to get out -- you know, she wants to get on with her life. So, from that standpoint, I can see it. From the appeals standpoint, I think she did a terrible thing. And I saw the other day where she wants the $4 million legal fees to be paid by her company, and I'm saying to myself she had such bad lawyers. I mean, they did a terrible job for her. Can you imagine being charged $4 million? And she's sitting behind bars right now. She's a great friend of mine. She's a great woman. She took a very, very heavy hit. But I think she'll come back.
<Larry King> <Negative> Are you saying if you were on the board of the company, you would not approve paying the legal fees?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm saying that I don't think the lawyers should be paid. That's what I'm saying. I thought I made that clear. I mean, you know, they got $4 million and look where she is, right? Give me a break.
<Larry King> <Neutral> What's your -- what's your read on the outcome of the election?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it's terrific. Look, you know, you had two good guys running. You have very -- you know, actually, you have to give President Bush a lot of credit. He really ran a great campaign. He won by four million votes, which is a lot. Now the electoral college, which I think they should do away with, is, you know, a little bit closer. But the fact is he won by four million votes, and that's a pretty good mandate in an election that was supposed to be so much closer than that.
<Larry King> <Neutral> But you always admired Senator Kerry, didn't you? You...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. I like him. I like both of them, Larry. I like both of them very much. And they're both very different, but they were very talented and very everything. The fact is that President Bush won. He ran a great campaign. I think his tax policy is fantastic. It's going to get the nation going. I really believe that it's going to kick in. Maybe it's starting to right now. All of a sudden, the job reports are coming out great and a lot of other things. So I really believe in his economic policies toward this country, and, ultimately, we'll get out of Iraq, I hope, and...
<Larry King> <Negative> That you disagree with.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... we'll do...
<Larry King> <Neutral> In Esquire
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do not believe that we made the right decision going into Iraq, but, you know, hopefully, we'll be getting out. Now I do think we have other problems. I think you have to do something with the nuclear weapons that are obviously being built in Iran and the nuclear weapons being built in North Korea where they're -- that's not even obvious.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, they're saying they're building nuclear weapons, and we're bogged down in Iraq. Now Iraq can solve the problem with Iran because you happen to be right next door, and, all of a sudden, Iraq maybe turns out to be a good transaction, so to speak. The fact is that Iran is building nuclear weapons and North Korea is building nuclear weapons, and that's the big quinella, and I hope President Bush can do something about that and quickly.
<Larry King> <Positive> If you were to bet on a place you would never build, it would be the Middle East. If that's true, do you ever have any hope there?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Boy, it's such hatred, so many years and years and even centuries of hatred, that it just seems inconceivable that they come together.
<Larry King> <Positive> But I will tell you I watch today the Palestinians and the Israelis and the level of hatred and the level of animosity and all that's going on, and it's really, really sad. I would love President Bush to call me and say, Go over and negotiate peace between the Palestinians and Israel. I would love to do that. That's one thing that I would probably like doing more than building great towers all over the place because I really believe with the right intermediary, the right mediator, the right negotiator, you could go over and really do a job. I really believe you could get them together. You are offering your services?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would do that in a heartbeat. I mean, what's more important? They're killing each other. It's leading to beyond even them. I mean, it's leading to problems like nobody would believe long beyond them. But if he would ask me to do that, yes, I would do that.
<Larry King> <Positive> Donald Trump's our guest. More to come with an extraordinary guy. Don't go away.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Begin Clip] Maria, you were difficult to work with. You lashed out at your project manager, which was completely out of line. Wes, you lost control of Maria, and you failed as a leader. You both did a horrible job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Maria, you're fired. And I just have to do this. I have no choice. Wes, you're fired, also. [End Clip]
<Unidentified Female> <Negative> [Begin Clip] Being a bitch is going to be your problem. You have to live with that for the rest of your life.
<Unidentified Female> <Negative> I didn't come here to make friends. I said that from day one.
<Unidentified Female> <Neutral> Mr. Trump, I worked for the last two weeks.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We all have problems. I don't like excuses. Omarosa has to go. You're fired. [End Clip]
<Larry King> <Negative> Why don't you like excuses?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I don't like excuses. And frankly, Omarosa had a lot of excuses, to put it mildly. But she's doing very well right now. That was one of the most popular firings. I mean, I had thousands and thousands of letters saying, thank you, Mr. Trump. But she was really -- I'll be honest, she seems like a very nice person on a personal basis. But she had some real problems with what she was doing.
<Larry King> <Negative> Let's discuss some of the things you write in your book about God and religion. You write, I believe in God. I believe God is everywhere and in all of us. And I want every decision I make to reflect well on me when it's time to go to that big board room in the sky. Some of you may think it's wrong to talk about God and business in the same breath. But God has always been central to our way of thinking about capitalism. The pursuit of prosperity is ingrained in our religious culture. The more you have
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I think it is. And I think it always has been. And it always will be. I mean, it's wonderful to say, gee, it's not part of it. The fact is it really has been. And if you look at President Bush and how well he did, a lot of that was from the very religious people. They really believed in him. And they believed in him strongly. It turned out to be a very powerful group. And I think there's nothing wrong with voting for somebody that you think believes the same way that you believe.
<Larry King> <Negative> Where were you on 9/11?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was in my apartment, watching an interview of Jack Welch. And it was just an amazing tragedy, just the most horrible thing, the worst attack ever in this country. People talk about Pearl Harbor, but at least that was a sneak attack on soldiers. This was a sneak attack on civilians. There's never been anything like it.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Were you able to look from your building south?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, I was. Actually, I built a specific window in my building that looks directly at the Empire State Building and the World Trade Center. And I saw the second plane hit. I saw everything. I got a very big view of that tragedy of what happened.
<Larry King> <Neutral> What did you do that day?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I think what everyone else did. We all watched. We all waited. We wanted to see where everything was going. And ultimately, I will tell you it's a great testament to New York, that New York City can be hotter than it ever has been before, ever. It's never been this hot before. That New York City with the greatest tragedy in American history, that a few years later, this city is hotter than it ever was before, is a tremendous testament to the people of New York.
<Larry King> <Negative> How do you explain it? One would say, why would you invest in a place that's so high on the threat list?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think we just took a hit for the rest of the free world. I mean, this could happen in any other city. This can happen in any other country and it does. It constantly happens in other countries. And we took a real hit for the rest of the free world. And I'll tell you, I've never seen people respect New Yorkers more than they have over the last couple of years, because of the way that we took the hit. And the way we bounced back.
<Larry King> <Negative> Writing a book about being a billionaire. Now it's obvious a lot of people can't be billionaires. They are the smallest percentage economically in the society. What was the aim here?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I just want to give people a little bit of incentive and hope and other things. Because they can become -- and it doesn't have to be a billionaire, it doesn't have to be a millionaire. But they can become really, really successful by reading the book and using some of the principles I've used in the book.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> One of them is positive thinking. But beyond everything else, just enjoy what you do. Really enjoy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've had so many friends that are talented but they're doing the wrong thing. They don't enjoy it. They're never, ever successful. So I wrote the book Think Like a Billionaire because I understand how billionaires think. And they think in a certain fashion. And that really can pertain to a lot of other people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I use it. And it's a catchy title. But the fact is that it's just been terrific. I'm so happy with the book, because I just wrote one why How to Get Rich. Then
<Larry King> <Positive> Does a billionaire -- I don't know, you can speak for all billionaires -- does he think differently in that -- when he looks at a building, does he think, what's the building worth? When he gets on an airplane does he say, I wonder what this costs? Or what did it cost to build? How does he think differently?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think a billionaire probably thinks differently. I have my thought process and it seems to work in terms of business. It so far hasn't worked that well socially, but these are minor details. But it works certainly in terms of business and money. I don't do things for the money, I do things because I enjoy doing them and I make a lot of the money because I enjoy and it they work out well. But I think a billionaire certainly thinks a little bit differently. And maybe in some cases a lot differently.
<Larry King> <Positive> So money is a by-product of what you do, not why you do what you do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In my case, I really live to enjoy things. And enjoy what I do. It's my canvas. And money really -- it's an expression, I guess I have heard, but money would be a by-product, I think that's true, Larry.
<Larry King> <Positive> So, I gave you a new expression to use.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, finally after all these years.
<Larry King> <Positive> All right. Here's some of the -- 10 ways you have of thinking like a billionaire. Don't take vacations. Now why would you tell someone...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I say that, and we have fun with it. But the fact is, most of the people I know that are successful really don't take vacations. Their business is their vacation. I rarely leave. You know that. You and I are friends. How often do you see me going away? I never go away. I love it. Now, I'll go down to Mira Largo in Palm Beach, Florida. But I own Mira Largo, it's a very successful club, and I'll work. I go crazy when I have to go away for a couple of days on a vacation. So, if you really love what you're doing, you never take vacations. You know, when I go away I end up buying something in the community that I go away to. So, I'm always sort of working.
<Larry King> <Negative> This also seems weird. Another one of your top 10 tips. Have a short attention span. I thought that's a defect.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think it's an asset to a certain extent. You want a little bit of a short span so you get things done. I know people, they agonize over details for weeks and months and nothing ever happens. So having a shorter span is not so bad. And you know, most of the people that you know, I mean, sadly, because I'm not saying asset or liability. But most of the successful people you know tend to have a shorter attention span.
<Larry King> <Negative> We'll take a break and be back with more of the Donald. We'll ask about these other businesses. There's a Donald trump scent, s-c-e-n-t. Don't go away.
<Unidentified Female> <Negative> [Begin Clip] Ivana.
<Unidentified Female> <Neutral> Yes.
<Unidentified Female> <Negative> I want to talk to you, because I feel like we need to talk before going any further.
<Unidentified Female> <Neutral> Yes.
<Unidentified Female> <Negative> I don't think you quite understand the implications of you saying that I was crazy.
<Unidentified Female> <Negative> I honestly felt scared. You were like a very, very different person.
<Unidentified Female> <Negative> You labeled it at -- he asked you specifically, is Stacy crazy.
<Unidentified Female> <Neutral> I said it was a Stacy issue.
<Unidentified Female> <Negative> To me, you're a liar. You misrepresented me. And that's not cool...
<Unidentified Female> <Neutral> Stacy, that is...
<Unidentified Female> <Negative> [Crosstalk] When you should have been fired from the second task.
<Unidentified Female> <Positive> Stacy, I said, you require a lot of supervision.
<Unidentified Female> <Negative> You require a lot of supervision. You're quixotic, indecisive, disorganized -- look, you walk away from me every time. [End Clip]
<Caller> <Negative> [Begin Clip] All of us want to know if your hair is real or a if it's a toupee or if it's a comb-over or if it's some sort of dyed amalgamation of or mix of one of the above.
<Larry King> <Neutral> One of the most asked questions of America. Lets start first.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Come on lets go. Come here.
<Larry King> <Neutral> It is not a toupee. OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. Will you please inform the public.
<Larry King> <Positive> It's not a toupee. Lean forward a little. It's not a toupee. It is not a comb-over.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don't mess it up to much.
<Larry King> <Neutral> It's not a comb-over.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's really not that much of a comb-over. But I get killed on this hair. [End Clip]
<Larry King> <Neutral> Have you ever thought of change is it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's been lucky. I've never had any problems with it. You know, it's -- I will say, I am just abused. I mean, somebody said the other day, one of the critics that actually loved my show and hated the Branson Show My hair's not so bad.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Is your...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do get abused by my hair.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Does your fiance like it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She likes it. So, she's smart. If I like it she likes it. So, she's a smart woman.
<Larry King> <Neutral> When is the wedding?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're probably going to do it January 22nd at Mira Largo. I built a new ballroom at Mira Largo, that's really crying for a major event like this. And it's going to be terrific.
<Larry King> <Negative> I'll come down.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK, you're invited.
<Larry King> <Neutral> I figured I would be, but -- Mira Largo, Palm Beach, January, a Trump wedding, what could be better?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It will be a terrific wedding. And hopefully it's going to be -- you know, my parents were married 63 years. And my father says, I greatly admire your success in your business, but I beat you in the marriage department. And he really did. It was 63 years. I said, but you had the advantage of having my mother.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Your father was a great man. He built Bensonhurst where I grew up. He built it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right, in Brooklyn. I learned a lot from my father. He's a terrific developer.
<Larry King> <Positive> All right, what about this game, a doll, a scent? You're working with Esteem Lauder. What's going on?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, what happened is because of a lot of different things, and in all fairness even prior to The Apprentice
<Larry King> <Negative> Can you overdo it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I always say that there's no such thing as overexposure. So we'll see. I mean, you know, because in theory, look, I'm on television every week. Everybody's watching the show. It's a big monster, all that stuff. I don't know, it doesn't seem to be having any impact. But, you know, at some point, it will calm down. My attitude is, take advantage of it while you can.
<Larry King> <Positive> Did you have to approve everything? Do you approve The Scent? Do you approve...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I approve everything. I have wonderful people...
<Larry King> <Positive> If I see your name on something, you've approved it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I approve it. I worked very hard with Estee Lauder and the top people at Estee Lauder, including Leonard and William. And you know, I've worked very hard on making sure it was the right bottling and the right scent and the right..
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I love it. I was never a fragrance person, Larry. And all of a sudden, they came up.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll be honest with you, I don't know too much about it. I said, give me some -- I don't know what I'm -- I said, I want you people to give me something that's fabulous, that's going to work, something great. And I like the thing they did. And you know what I tell people, if you're a man and you use the Trump fragrance, you're guaranteed to get any woman or man or whatever the hell you're looking for. Guaranteed.
<Larry King> <Positive> So gays can use it too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Gays can absolutely use it. I'm sure they'll love it.
<Larry King> <Negative> OK, now, on a negative side, I just saw -- this is airing on Wednesday night a week before Thanksgiving, but we taped it a little earlier the previous Friday. And just I saw in the papers today in New York, that your son Donald Jr. got engaged and apparently the big headlines, that he did it tacky, did it in a shopping mall, and that the jeweler gave him the ring free. What's the story?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I wasn't thrilled with what he did to be honest with you. And he got a free ring for promoting the jewelry company. And who knows if the jewelry company is even any good. But he got... [Crosstalk] I guess, he's trying to learn from me, Larry. But you know, from a business standpoint, I guess it's sort of cute, but I didn't like it. I certainly don't like it with respect to a wedding ring.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Did you talk to him about it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I talked to him. He's a very smart guy. He went to the Wharton School of Finance.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a good kid. He's doing a terrific job. And he thought it was, OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He had no idea this would get publicity like this. I mean, he ends up being on the front page of the Post and other papers. And I said, you have a big obligation, you have a name that's hot as a pistol, you have to be very careful with things like this. And you know, if you can make a good deal, hey I bought a ring, I got it from Graff, you negotiated hard. And I said you're going to get a lot of publicity and I want a great price, blah, blah, blah. But I don't do a big stunt over it. So, I think he learned a great lesson. He's a good kid. He's a smart kid. And I think he learned a great lesson. And he's marrying a terrific girl.
<Larry King> <Neutral> That's what I was going to ask you, you like her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's really -- first of all, she's terrific.
<Larry King> <Positive> Beautiful.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's beautiful.
<Larry King> <Neutral> End of report.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well. She's a great girl. I think she's -- I think they're going to have a terrific marriage. I mean, off to an interesting start with this publicity, but that's all right. He was trying to be a businessman, and maybe from a business standpoint. You know, there are a couple of people who thought it was great. They said, hey, he's pretty smart. And he is.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Bailey Banks and Biddle -- Bailey Banks and Biddle are big jewelers.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Are they big?
<Larry King> <Positive> Yes, their in every mall in the country. And they are sort of upscale mall.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He could have done without Bailey Banks, in my opinion.
<Larry King> <Positive> OK. You're writing a book. I'm always amazed people tell me I'm a master promoter, because I never think of myself as a promoter. What do you think of yourself as?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think of myself as a great builder. I'm the biggest, as I said, the biggest developer in the city by far, and I build great product. I'm building on 59th and Park at the old Delmonico Hotel.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> As you remember, Ed Sullivan used to live there and a lot of your other friends. But I'm building a building that's phenomenal. I just finished a building opposite the United Nations, 90 stories, Trump World Towers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm very proud of it. I'm building the biggest job ever approved by the New York City Planning Commission in Manhattan, on the west side of Manhattan, from 72nd to 59th Street. And what I am is a great builder. And then sort of interesting, you build a great building, it works. You work so hard, with the unions and labor and all the problems and construction. Then it works and they say, Trump's such a great promoter. I'm a builder. And I don't necessarily even consider myself a great promoter. I'm a great builder.
<Larry King> <Neutral> What do you think of the new stadium idea on the west side?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's terrific. Woody Johnson's a friend of mine.
<Larry King> <Neutral> The owner of the Jets.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's terrific. You know, people forget the Jets left New York, everybody was devastated. And now they're coming back and people are fighting it. I think Woody Johnson will get it done, and it will be a tremendous success. And we should have it in New York.
<Larry King> <Negative> A traffic boondoggle?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, because it's Sunday. Most games are on Sunday. You have to understand, this isn't baseball where you play 165 or whatever it is games. This is football. And you're going to have about eight home games, not including the playoffs, and they're mostly on a Sunday. And that section of Manhattan is not all busy on a Sunday. I think it's a great thing for New York.
<Larry King> <Neutral> How about building it, though?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, Woody knows I'm the best builder, so he'll probably have me build it. But I haven't discussed -- I spoke to him yesterday, actually, about something unrelated. He's going down to Mira Largo, he loves the Mira Largo Club. He's a member of all my clubs. But he's a terrific guy and I think he's going to get it built.
<Larry King> <Positive> We'll be back with our remaining moments with Donald Trump. If he thinks something's going to happen, it generally happens. We'll be right back, don't go away.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Begin Clip] Ellen, for your task. I want you, Houston, and Ellen to go out on the corner, the sidewalks of New York, the mean streets, and create a wonderful hot dog business. I want you to sell hotdogs. At the end of the day, you're going to come back to see me and I'll see how much you made in the sale of hotdogs.
<Ellen Degeneres> <Neutral> We can handle it. Not only can we handle it -- more than handle it.
<Unidentified Male> <Negative> Handle it. [End Clip]
<Katie Couric> <Negative> [Begin Clip] Is it true you failed to complete the task? Do you think you should be fired?
<Unidentified Male> <Positive> He failed to complete the task. He never opened his mouth. He sat there and took it. There is no way he could ever be a good part of the Trump organization.
<Katie Couric> <Positive> Carolyn, what do you think? Do you agree?
<Unidentified Male> <Negative> I'm still trying to figure out what you're bringing to the table.
<Katie Couric> <Negative> You know, listen. You tried to throw your weight around. Couldn't even get your hair right. I know you tried but I just have two words for you. You're fired. [End Clip]
<Larry King> <Neutral> Was that fun to do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was. Katie's terrific. And that whole Today Show group is fantastic. I love them. You know
<Larry King> <Negative> It was a great take-off. A couple more tips you have in the book. Don't sleep any more than you have to. In other words, when you open your eyes in the morning you're up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm lucky. And I guess I got this from my parents. But I sleep very little, 3 or 4 hours a night. And that's what I need. And I have friends that need 12 hours' sleep. I say, 12 hours? What are you going to do? So how does somebody that's sleeping 12 and 14 hours a day compete with somebody that's sleeping 3 or 4 ? It doesn't work that way. So if you can -- now, part of sleeping not so much is enjoying your life. If you don't enjoy your life, I know other people when they're doing well and things are good, they sleep 5 hours. When things aren't going so well they're in bed all week long. But the fact is that sleep as little -- you're going to be sleeping for a long time someday.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Don't depend on technology.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I am a great believer in computers and everything else. But honestly, I see kids coming out of school that if you say, how much is two and two, they can't add it up without going to their computer. So I think it's gotten too much. But hey look, I'm one of the great believers in technology. But maybe it's going overboard now.
<Larry King> <Negative> It's often to your advantage to be underestimated.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well it always is. And I've known many people over the years who are underestimated and they've done probably better than anybody else. And if you can create -- I see these sharpies come in with the beautiful suits and the handkerchiefs and the whole deal. And you sort of have your guard up. On the other hand, you have guys come in, you sort of take it easy, and they fleece you, Larry. They fleece you. You don't know what happened. You say, what happened?
<Larry King> <Positive> Friends are good. Family is better.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Always true. I mean, if you can have the great family, if you have really terrific family, there's nothing better than that. You know that. You know what you're going through now compared to what you went through in the past.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Also, nothing like kids.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The kids are fantastic, especially when they're the great kids. I've known some pretty bad kids. I've known some very bad sons and daughters to parents. But you get the right kids, there's nothing like it.
<Larry King> <Positive> Would you say you've been lucky with your children? Part of it's luck.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have wonderful children. I have smart, wonderful children. I have four children. They're all fantastic.
<Larry King> <Neutral> How much of it is Ivana?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have Ivana with three, I have Marla with one, Tiffany. And they just -- I don't know. It's combination of everything. They're all different. I have wonderful children.
<Larry King> <Neutral> Is Ivana a recording artist now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's what I'm hearing. That's going to be next. You know what, I hope she does well. She's terrific. I hope she does well.
<Larry King> <Positive> One of your tips, treat each decision like a lover. Explain.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I mean, you know, you treat lovers when you get the love, I guess you're doing OK. You want to treat each decision very, very importantly, very gently. And make the right decision.
<Larry King> <Positive> And you also write, be curious. Would you say all successful people are curious?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've never met a successful person that wasn't curious. I mean, oftentimes I go out with somebody who's very successful, they spend the whole night asking me questions. And then I go out with people that aren't so successful and they're telling me things the whole night. So, being curious is a great thing.
<Larry King> <Negative> I never learned anything when I was talking.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's true.
<Larry King> <Neutral> I learned that a long time ago.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You do a lot of talking.
<Larry King> <Positive> Well, I mostly do asking.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nobody does it better. It's been fun to be with you.
<Larry King> <Negative> How do you top, finally, this book? I mean, now you've billionaires. What's left? Trillionaires. What?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think I'm not going to do any more books. I've done six. Every one of them has gone to be a No.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> 1 best seller, every single one of them. And I think this is it. I've gotten -- unless I learn a lot over the next 10 years, I think I won't be doing any more books, Larry.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm really happy with the last one. I think the billionaire book might be my best book. Maybe even better than The Art of the Deal which was the biggest selling business book of all time But I think the last book could be my best book. And I've had it. I'm not going to do any more. I hate book signings. It's very, very difficult to sit down, and you have 4,000, 5,000 people waiting in a line, and you feel so guilty. And you sign 400 books and you leave and you feel guilty. I don't want to do that any more.
<Larry King> <Positive> Donald, it's always great seeing you. Have a great holiday. See you in January.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Larry. You too.
<Larry King> <Positive> Donald Trump. And the book, the latest is Trump: Think Like a Billionaire I'll be back in just a moment. Don't go away. Thanks for joining us on this edition of Larry King Live with the Donald, the one and only.
<Larry King> <Positive> Speaking of one and only, Aaron Brown and Newsnight is next. We'll see you tomorrow night with another great show. Thanks for joining us. Stay tuned for Aaron. Good night.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Begin Clip] Larry, you're fired. [End Clip]
