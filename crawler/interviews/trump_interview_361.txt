<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Mr. Trump, thank you so much for joining us today. Mr. Trump, as we started the show we had breaking news.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Breitbart broke the news last night that was the lead on Drudge overnight that eight Syrians had been apprehended on the southern border in Laredo, Texas. In addition, when we got up this morning the prime minister of France went before parliament and gave an address talking to the French people and saying, 'Hey, given this dragnet that's taken place over the last couple of days, 168 raids, gun battles for seven hours, 5,000 rounds disseminated, that everything's on the table, that they're going to come after us for beheadings, they're going to come after us for gun battles. We have to be prepared for everything.' In addition, he said, "We have to be prepared for biological and chemical
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> that everything's on the table. You mentioned, 'Hey, these mosques are safe havens.' You got a firestorm of criticism from the left and the Republican establishment gives you the 'Tsk, tsk, tsk, here's Donald Trump again wandering around on the playing field.' What's your view of this, particularly given what's happened in Paris today with the prime minister talking about potential chemical and biological warfare?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that could very well happen. It's getting worse and worse as hatred and as hatred like nobody's ever seen and it's obviously emanating from and coming out of, among other places, the mosques. There's something going on in those mosques that is not lovely. That I can tell you, and that, you know, and we had a very strong unit.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We did a lot of surveillance of mosques in our city, in New York City, and from what I understand, we're not doing that anymore. I think that's a terrible mistake.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> I believe as mayor de Blasio's first act, they had an AP, I think, expose of this. What it was, as Andy McCarthy said, it was an intelligence unit that had networks of information in the community and very much like Rudy Giuliani and the NYPD have built up over decades. Rudy Giuliani was able to turn on the five families when he broke the back of the mafia in New York City. It was the same type of structure to go into the neighborhoods and really get informants.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> It was a network of informants.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think we ought to start it up again and we ought to start it up like this morning. We ought to start it up again and get going, and use your head. This is a lot of nonsense that we ended that. That was a good thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That was something that we needed and it was something where, frankly, good information came out of it and I think we ought to start it up and not be na√Øve and not be stupid, and they ought to start that up immediately. As far as weapons, I mean, they'll use anything they can get. These people will use anything. They're not worried about 'Oh, gee, this is unethical.' These are not people that are politically correct.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> There's no doubt in your mind that if these guys had the access to chemical, biological, even nuclear weapons that they would use them against the Judeo-Christian West as civilian populations?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do you know how much doubt is in my mind? Zero, OK? Zero. They would use whatever they could get and beyond that they would use too, believe me. They would use whatever they could get and we've got to take them out. We have to take them out fast.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, Steve, I was against the war in Iraq, OK? And I was right about it. You also know I predicted that Osama Bin Laden was coming to the United States because I knew a lot about it and I know more about it than most, believe me, and I've been given credit for it. I mean, in my book in 2000 I said, 'Osama Bin Laden is bad guy.' At that time he was a terrorist and he was actively talking about coming into the United States and doing bad stuff and I said, "You better take him out
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I've made a lot of good predictions including terrorism in that same book. I think a friend of mine said, 'No, forget about Osama Bin Laden. Your prediction on terrorism was even better.' And then I said, 'We have to take out the oil' and everyone laughed at me two years ago. I actually said, 'Take it out and keep it.'  I'd like keeping it, OK? To the victor belong the spoils.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We don't do that. To the victor belong the spoils. Well, we don't have that theory anymore. We just fight wars and leave like in Iraq we left, we had nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> $2 trillion, wounded warriors, wounded everybody.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Ten thousand casualties, 10,000 killed in action of this generation in Iraq and Afghanistan. Forty-thousand wounded. Over $2 trillion and nothing to show.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We get zero.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Not even freedom. Not even freedom for the people we were over there to defend.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You remember I said, 'Look, you keep the oil, right?' Well, you know where's the oil now? Iran has the oil because they're taken over Iraq, as sure as you're sitting there. Iran has the oil and ISIS has the oil. We have nothing. Two trillion dollars, thousands of lives.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have nothing. And I think that's probably why I'm through the roof with all the polls because I have common sense, because I built a great company, I built a phenomenal company and people know it.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> OK, let me ask you, the GOP smart set, which we at Breitbart identified all these kind of intellectuals or quasi intellectuals.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think we should call them the smart set. You know what, they're wrong so often.
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> We do it to --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we belittle ourselves [Inaudible] by calling them the smart set. They call them the GOP elite. I don't think they're elite. I think we're the elite.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we're the elite because we're the ones that are right. I don't think we should --  just like they shouldn't call ISIS, like this so-called leader of ISIS, they say, 'The mastermind.' He's not a mastermind, he's a punk, and they ought to call him what he is. He's garbage, and they ought to call him what he is. So, the press, I see they're saying, 'The mastermind.' Well, in the meantime you have the ISIS folks using the Internet better than we use it and they're trying to recruit and they're hearing all about these kids who are forming, I mean, it's too bad.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a very sad thing but they're hearing about the mastermind and they respect him. The press should not be referring to these guys as masterminds and all of the names. Then you wonder why the kids are joining and going over to ISIS. One other thing, Steve, when they go to ISIS and they fight in Syria or wherever they're fighting and then they come back into the United States, no way they come back in, no way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We let them back in. We're so badly run. We're so badly run.
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> Let me ask you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We let 'em back in. They can go fight --
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> You would take the passports right away, absolutely, no --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No way. I wouldn't even, I would never let them get in. They would be permanently banned lifetime. They would never be able to get into the United States, and we would have strong borders, Steve, not like it is now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you see what happened where they just caught Syrians trying to come through the border. And I promise you those were not positive people that were coming.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> No, we broke that story last night. By the way, Mr. Trump, we're about, Brandon Darby's going to break additional story today on the southern border, additional people from Muslim-dominated countries in this war-torn area caught by Border Patrol. We're going to break that.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Let me ask you, since the Paris thing happened the other day, all a sudden, I won't call them the GOP smart set anymore, but the intellectuals, the intelligentsia, the consultants and Politico and others are saying, 'Uh oh, now that people realize we're at war, Donald Trump's finished because now they're going to get serious about guys like Marco Rubio and others that have so much experience in the world.'
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They're lightweights.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> But this is my question. Talk to me as commander in chief. What can the American people expect if the establishment Republicans are dismissing you as a lightweight and a guy that's over his head.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, nobody's calling me a lightweight. We're calling Marco Rubio lightweight. I'm the one that said Marco Rubio is not equipped to do this job. Marco Rubio is a lightweight.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they're not dismissing me anymore, Steve. They were dismissing me. Now, they're not. I was just watching Morning Joe and they're all, guys that were saying, 'Oh, he's never going to run.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's never going to run.' They're the sort of saying, 'Oh my god, what's going on? Look at this' because numbers just came out in New Hampshire, numbers just came out, Fox just announced numbers on other things and, you know, I'm leading on everything and leading not by a little bit but by a lot, but I have to say, you have to stop using the word 'the intellectuals.' I went to an Ivy League school. I was a very good student. I'm more of an intellectual than I think anybody --
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> By the way, our audience here on Sirius XM Patriot and at Breitbart, where I say every day these working class men and women, middle-class men and women are 10 times smarter than this intellectual group.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I say that too. These guys in television have been -- I mean, I can only speak for myself. They've been wrong for -- I've been really watching. I've been a politician for five months.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What can I tell you? Four months, five months. And I've been really very focused and when I focus, I focus. I've been watching these guys. They're wrong on everything.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are wrong so much. So don't call them the elite. Don't call them intellectuals. Call them establishment guys.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You could say they're establishment because they've been there a long time. I think, establishment, but you should never use the word 'elite.' I mean you should call me an intellectual. You shouldn't call them an intellectual.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Let's go to you as commander in chief. Walk the American people through domestically and internationally if you win the nomination and eventually elected president of the United States and commander in chief, when you take over the first 90, 100 days, what can the American people, what can the world expect from Donald Trump as commander in chief?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Are you talking about with respect to ISIS or are you talking about overall?
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Let's talk ISIS. Let's talk the war.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because if you talk overall, I mean, Steve, that's a very big question. I could be talking to you for the next three to four hours.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Let's talk about the war against radical Islam.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you're talking overall, which you're not, but if you're talking overall, I'd start, we're going to get new health care, we're going to terminate ISIS, we're going to repeal it, we're gonna get great, wonderful health care [Crosstalk]
<Steve Bannon> <Neutral> How are you going to terminate ISIS?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're going to terminate ISIS. We're going to terminate the order along the border. There are so many things. Within that first hour there are so many things that I can do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. 1, we're going to terminate Obamacare. We're going to terminate, we're going to repeal it, we're going to replace it. We're going to go after ISIS like you've never seen before.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to form a group. You know, the one thing we're not doing properly, because Obama doesn't do it, he doesn't form coalitions. He just doesn't form coalitions. It's hard to form a coalition.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We already have NATO. We're going to get NATO, we're going to form, we're going to get bigger than NATO. We're going to add additional. We have to go after ISIS and we have to terminate ISIS.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to get them out. And, remember, I was the one that said, 'Don't go into Iraq because you're going to destabilize the entire Middle East,' and I turned out to be right and I'm the only one running now that said, 'Don't go into Iraq' and yet I'm more militaristic than anybody else running, that I can tell you. I will build our military so strong, so powerful that we'll never have to use it. Nobody will ever mess with us.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We'll never have to use it but I would hit ISIS so hard. And a couple of things we have to do. We have to demean them. I started telling you about calling them the mastermind behind an attack.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What's a mastermind? Guys go into a theater and they start shooting people. That's not a mastermind. That's not like what I would say is a mastermind. These people are animals and you can't call them masterminds and you can't call them the names of press.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm watching some of the things on television. I'm reading things. They're building these people up so much. We have to tear them down from that standpoint psychologically and otherwise.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to take over the Internet in addition to the bombing and everything else that we have to do and I will find a real military leader, not these characters I see on television that are in the military that don't know what they're doing. I mean, I'm watching people, generals that are not the right people, they are not the right leaders. And, by the way, they shouldn't be on television. General Patton wouldn't be on television.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> General Douglas MacArthur wouldn't be on television. We would have a military that would be so strong and so efficient but I would get coalitions together, lots of coalitions together. Also NATO. I'd put a whole group together.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd add them in. I'd add additional groups, additional countries, and we would knock the hell out of ISIS. But we have to also, Steve, you have to take over the Internet because they're recruiting through the Internet. They play the Internet far better than we do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're the ones that came up with the Internet but they're playing it better than we do. So, we have to be a force on the internet because they're getting so many people. And, by the way, when those people leave us and they go over to fight for ISIS here, at some point they are not going to leave us, they're not going to go over to fight for ISIS over there. They're going to go over, they're going to stay right here and fight for ISIS.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You understand that. That's what's happening. And the other thing, nobody, nobody under the migration, nobody comes into this country because I have no doubt that ISIS is coming in through, you know, under the guise of --
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Paul Ryan is about to give a head fake on this vetting process and go ahead and fully fund President Obama's -- last night on Hannity he sits there and smirks and shakes his head and says, 'This is not who we are as Americans.' What's your response to that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Wow. I'm surprised to hear that he would do that because, you know, he just became speaker and I am very surprised that he'd take that stance. I had actually heard he was going to take the other stance, that he was going to pass something where he's not going to allow funding and it's not going to happen and all that. I think he'd be very unwise to take that stance.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think, it would be a very, very big slap in the face to a lot of people that didn't particularly want him in that position and they went along with it. I think he would be unwise if he took that stance. I'm surprised that he's going to take that stance. I heard he's going the other way, that he would defund, that he wouldn't allow Obama to get away with what he's doing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, Obama wants to bring not the 10,000, not the 15,000, not even the 65,000 that they talked about in the debate, in the Democrat debate. Obama wants to bring, I hear, 200 and 250,000 into the country.  That's what I hear the number is.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Well, at least we know it's 100,000. I think there's all kinds of debate about how much would the ultimate number's going to be.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, he's not gonna stop. You know if he got 60 or 65. Then he's going to get 100. You know the guy's not going to stop.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, this man, he is so bad, he is such a bad president. We have so many problems in our country and now we're going to have to worry about ISIS being on our shores. We already have. By the way, we have tremendous numbers of people that are ISIS or ISIS-related already in our country.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> Let's talk about that. You got a lot of blowback the other day from saying, 'Hey, you may have to go in and shut down some mosque.' Were you actually saying you need a NYPD intelligence unit to get a network of informants?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> At a minimum. I want that at a minimum. We have to start that back up again in New York City and elsewhere. I'm sure other cities are doing it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We had it very strongly in this city and we had great surveillance and then, I understand, when the new mayor came in, de Blasio, I hear that he ended that. I think that's a terrible mistake.
<Steve Bannon> <Negative> I guess, what I'm saying is you're not prepared to allow an enemy within, a fifth column within this country to try to tear down this country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's right. That's not going to happen. Let me tell you something. If I'm president, it's not going to happen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's not happening because I'm going to be politically correct and I'm going to be such a nice person, and I am a nice person but I'm a smart person, and it's not going to happen.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Mr. Trump, I appreciate you taking time. I know you're enormously busy. I appreciate you taking time to share what you would do as commander in chief if you're elected president.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Steve. You take care of yourself.
<Steve Bannon> <Positive> Thank you, sir. That's Donald Trump. He's running for the Republican nomination for the presidency.
