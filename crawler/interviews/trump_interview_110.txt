<Mike Huckabee> <Positive> Do you trust Kim Jong-Un?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I think that I've had a very good relationship. We have a good chemistry together. You know what that means and that happens sometimes and sometimes it doesn't. And I really believe he's looking to, maybe even beyond trust, he's looking to do something for his country, maybe for his family, for himself but he's looking to do the right thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He wants to bring enterprise into North Korea. They have tremendous potential in terms of location. It's an amazing piece of property to put it in real estate terms. It's got unbelievable natural potential and I think he wants to do something with it.
<Mike Huckabee> <Positive> Maybe build a condo on the beach. I saw the video. It was awesome.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm sure it would do very well. No, I really believe that he doesn't want to go through what he would have to go through because that would not be a good thing for anybody.
<Mike Huckabee> <Positive> Then, let's talk about that. If he doesn't make good on his commitment, what is the U.S. prepared to do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, first of all, we came to a wonderful agreement. It's a shame that the fake news covers it the way they do. Honestly, it's almost treasonous, if you want to know the truth, because we signed an agreement and the big thing that they'd said was I met, okay? You know, there was nothing else they could say. I met. Well, let me tell you we got our hostages back, we get the remains back of our great heroes that have died, thousands and thousands of young people, we get the remains back and you have no idea how many people came up to me and said "Could you get the remains of my father?" It was so sad.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And at the time I said "There's no relationship there" but the big thing is the denuclearization and it says right in the first paragraph "We will denuclearize North Korea." It says it and they'll say "Oh, they didn't mention it." They would actually say it's not even mentioned. It was the number one thing. Obviously, my whole thing is about denuclearization but it talked about all the different steps. It was an incredible piece of paper. And if you listen to the mainstream media, it's almost like I lost a negotiation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it's not even a question of winning or losing. I'm not saying it from that standpoint but look at all of the things we got. There's been no missiles fired. There's been no rockets fired.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Japan thinks I'm like a world hero over there. They said "We haven't had missiles going over Japan for the last six-seven months." They were sending them over like it was the Fourth of July. And so many other things. No nuclear testing. They're getting rid of their engine factory where they make the engines for the ballistic missiles.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're doing all of these things and then to hear the mainstream media, that was the thing that most angered me to hear the mainstream media. Chuck Todd actually stood up and said "The President got so little and North Korea got so much." And I'm saying "What did they get other than I met?" I did meet. Now, the war games, I call them war games, I've been against them for a year and a half. They cost a fortune.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We fly bombers all the way from Guam, massive bombers, drop bombs and then they go back to Guam. Then they come back a second time. It's crazy. We spend tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars on these war games. We're not being reimbursed by South Korea. We're not being reimbursed. And I've been after this a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I say number one, it is very provocative but number two, who wants to spend this kind of money. So, very interesting. The deal is phenomenal but if you read the mainstream media … Now, if you talk about the fair press which is a lot of people also, in all fairness, it got rave reviews. And in Asia, and they know better than anybody else, all of Asia, they are thrilled, they are thrilled.
<Mike Huckabee> <Negative> The embassy was moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. I was there. It was as surreal a moment as I've ever witnessed. You made that promise.
<Mike Huckabee> <Positive> You kept that promise What was it that just made you decide to do what no other President, even though they had promised it as well, what made you decide "I'm going to do this because I said it would."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the embassy was a big thing but it was for many presidents before me and everybody campaigned that they were going to move the embassy to Jerusalem and nobody did it. And I never understood why. I really never did. I knew there would be pressure but I never understood but I do understand now because two weeks before I did it, when the word was out that I was going to do it, I was called by so many countries saying "Please don't do it." It actually got to a point where I said "I'll call you back in a week" because I didn't want to have him tell me "Don't do it" and then I do it because I was going to do it. It was a campaign promise. I thought it was very important. And you know who really likes it the most? The evangelicals.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll tell you what, I get more calls of thank you from evangelicals and I see it in the audiences and everything else than I do from Jewish people. And the Jewish people appreciate it but the evangelicals appreciate it more than the Jews, which is incredible.
<Mike Huckabee> <Positive> It's not a surprise though, Mr. President, because evangelicals are people of the book and they believe that you kept a promise that was fulfilling really 3000 -year-old commitment to recognize Jerusalem as the capital.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's a nice thing to say because, I mean, it really affects Jewish people in theory more yeah but, as you say, people of the book, people of the Bible but the evangelicals really appreciate it and that makes me feel good but nobody did it. I never understood why. As soon as that second [inaudible] up and once I did it, it was something very special. It's an important event.
<Mike Huckabee> <Negative> Immigration has been a controversy over the past several weeks. What is it that Americans need to know that they're not hearing from the media?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That it's the Democrats' fault. They refused to sit down and draw an agreement that's good for security and good for everybody. We need merit-based immigration. You know, we're taking in people that will never help us as a country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know this. It's okay for people to help us as a country. It's okay for people to go out and work for some of these new companies that are moving into our country, of which we have many, but I think more than anything else, it's the fact that we need people that can help us. We want a merit-based immigration system. We need safety at the border. We need the wall. The wall's going to happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's going to happen. We have to have the wall. If anything, it shows how much we need the wall but it's the Democrats' fault but it wouldn't be their fault for long if they sat down with us. We could make a deal so quickly but the question is "Do they mind having open borders?" and it's looking like they really want open borders and they want really crime to pour in because we have people, we're doing an incredible job in terms of security. MS-13, horrible gangs, we're getting them out by the thousands but our job would be so much easier if we had what we need on border security, border safety. We need the Democrats to come to the table and make a deal.
<Mike Huckabee> <Positive> Are you optimistic that you'll be able to persuade Congress to come to the table? I mean, you've been more generous than they even originally asked for in terms of everything except the wall. They don't a wall but if they give you the wall and you're giving them more, then they …
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Wall and very strong border security and get rid of catch-and-release, get rid of the chain migration which is very tough, get rid of it. And the all-time beauty is the lottery. We pick names out. So do you think the country is giving us their finest. Are they giving us the Sarah Huckabees of the world? I don't think so, okay? I don't think so.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're giving us some rough tough people and we want merit. We don't want that. So we don't want the lottery system. I mean, who can blame a country Honduras and these different, who can blame them. But one other thing I want to do is you take a country like Honduras, there are so many others, they're sending people into our country by the thousands, I think we should stop giving them money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We give them tremendous aid. Why are we giving them aid when they're letting people pour out of their country? And they're pushing them out. When they're letting people pour out of their country and they're coming through the borders. Why isn't Mexico, when we are doing it, we're making Mexico pay us but why isn't Mexico stopping them more? Had I not gotten on the phone and let them know last week when they had the caravan, it started with 2,000 people and about a hundred people got in but Mexico has very, very strong Immigration law like really strong, among the strongest.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They could stop them cold called if they wanted to. There wouldn't be people walking across Mexico like that but they walk right across Mexico which are a long journey. Mexico is a bigger place than people understand and they come in. I don't want Mexico to let them walk across that country but we wouldn't even have to worry about that if we had strong border laws which we have to have.
<Mike Huckabee> <Negative> Let's talk about the economy a minute. Highest number of people among minorities have jobs in the history of the U.S., not just in the last 10 or 15 years, in history.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Black and Hispanic have the best unemployment they've ever had in recording history in terms of great numbers. So, we have the best and the lowest unemployment in history for black and they love it. African-American people have never had a job situation like this, the lowest in history, unemployment. Lowest unemployment in history for Hispanic.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Among the lowest for women, it's 21 years now. 21 years is the best for women. We're doing really well. The country is doing well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Companies are coming back into the country. I'm trying to and I'll succeed. It's actually not even going to be tough, frankly, but our trade is so imbalanced between China and the European Union and Mexico and so many other countries. For years they've taken advantage of the country.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have to straighten it out and we're in the process of straightening it out.
<Mike Huckabee> <Negative> You mentioned the trade issue. People have accused you of saying you want to create a trade war but I've heard you repeatedly say you want no tariffs from anybody. That's about as free trade as free trade can get.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I actually offered that to Canada. I said "Okay, I'll tell you what, if you think it's so wonderful, let's just go no tariffs." Canada, on milk and dairy products, charges us 300% of tariff when our farmers send in milk. So what does that really mean though, Mike? It means they don't send it because it's not competitive, okay? So Canada doesn't take it. And they try and act aggrieved with their Prime Minister.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They try and act nice and aggrieved. "Oh, isn't it terrible? We fought World War One together, World War Two together." They have tariffs that are massive. They don't take care of our people in Wisconsin. They don't take care of our people in New York State.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They don't take care of a lot of the dairy places. They won't take our product and they do it by having these massive tariffs and they shouldn't be. I actually told them, I said, "Look, here's what we do. Nobody gets tariffs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No more barriers." They have a lot of barriers. European Union has berries. They won't take our products. So they have a barrier and yet they'll send in Mercedes and BMWs, the cars, they'll send them right in. It's not right. And I told them "That's why we put steel." And, by the way, our steel industry is coming back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> United States Steel is now expanding and opening six new plants. I put a 25% tariff on. Our steel industry is coming back because that way they don't have to pay the tariff. It's very nice, actually. Also, Mike, it's very interesting, we put it on solar panels.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we had 32 empty plants, we had 32 plants, many of them closed. Now many of them are opening again. We put a tariff at 30% on solar panels. Washing machines.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You wouldn't think it's a big business. It's a very big business. We put a tariff on washing machines because they were dumping washing machines all over the country and not good ones either, by the way. They didn't work so well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, all of a sudden were expanding our washing machine production business in the country because companies, even if they're outsiders, they come in because they don't want to pay the tax.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's actually a very beautiful thing that's happening. People don't quite get it yet but they will.
<Mike Huckabee> <Negative> Three years ago this week you came down the escalator of Trump Tower and you announced you were running for President. The skeptics were enormously, plenteous everywhere. We're sitting here in the Cabinet Room of the White House where you've been President for a year and a half. Do you look back on some of your skeptics and critics and just wonder what they were missing?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I look back on you when you said "He's going to win", okay? Very early.
<Mike Huckabee> <Negative> Yeah, I didn't enjoy saying that when I was a candidate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You even held up my tie. You said "Look, I wear one of his assortment" but you said that. It was great. Now you've been so great right from the beginning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're a real professional, I mean, really incredible. That actually meant something. And you said "If he says that, it means something" and the other guys knew it meant something too. You know what, we've done a record amount.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You think of it. It's 510 days. In 510 days, a lot of people are saying we've done more than any president ever in their first 500 days. And I think we have regulation, the big cut in taxes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Regulations, I've cut more regulations than any other president in four years, eight years or in the case we have a 16-yearer, right? I've cut more regulations than any other president by far and we're talking about 500 days. The country is doing well. Companies are coming back. The jobs are the best they've been.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You saw the other day jobs are the best they've been in 44 years, okay? So we're doing very well and I'm very proud of it.
<Mike Huckabee> <Positive> As well you should be. Mr. President, an honor and a pleasure to be with you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Mike Huckabee> <Positive> Thank you so much for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Mike Huckabee> <Positive> Thank you.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Mr. President, thanks so much for sitting down with me today.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Here we are in the week that the Dow Jones industrial average just hit 23,000, 5 1/3 trillion dollars of market value created since your election and largely because of this anticipation and hope that your policies will get implemented. Tell us where we stand on the tax plan right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're doing very well. We will -- we had a fantastic vote as you know, and budget is indirectly passed. Now, it is going to go through a little bit of an iteration but it's going to end up I think again doing very well and I think we are going to get our taxes. I think it is going to be -- well, hopefully before the end of the year but maybe much sooner than that. You know, there's great spirit for it, people want to see it and I call it tax cuts. It is tax reform also but I call it tax cuts. It will be the biggest cuts ever in the history of this country. And I think that there's tremendous appetite, there's tremendous spirit for it. Not only by the people we're dealing with in Congress, but for the people out there that want to see something, $5,000 -- almost, it can be $5,000 average per individual per group. And -- so I'm really looking forward to it. Let's see what happens.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> It could be quite historic. I know that this weekend is the 31st anniversary of when President Reagan last instituted tax reform.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right, on Sunday. That's a big deal.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> That's a big deal, on Sunday exactly. Do you think you have the votes?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we have the votes. I think that Rand Paul is actually going to vote for the tax cuts. I think that other people -- you know, we had tremendous enthusiasm this time. Healthcare, I was told was tougher, but it was close. I mean, so far I would say it's not even a contest. And I will tell you speaking of healthcare, I believe we're going to get that also. It will be in the form of block grants to the different states, and it will be a wonderful healthcare. It will be a tremendous healthcare, managed properly in smaller doses where you can really do it much more individually. So I think we're going to get that also in a little bit later probably in three or four months from now. But I do believe we will have that long before the election in '18. As far as taxes are concerned, you see what's happening. It is really doing well, great enthusiasm.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Yes, you soured on the healthcare bipartisan plan a bit; right, from Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I have looked at it very, very strongly and pretty much we can do almost what they are getting. I think he is a tremendous person. I don't know Senator Murray. I hear very, very good things, but I know that Lamar Alexander is a fine man, and he is really going to do good for the people. We can do pretty much what we have to do with that. You know, the Secretary has tremendous leeway in the -- under the Obama plans. One of the things that they did because it was so messed up, they had no choice, but to give the Secretary leeway because they knew he would have -- he or she would have to be changing all the time. And we can pretty much do whatever we have to do just the way it is. So this was going to be temporary, prior to repeal and replace. We're going to repeal and replace ObamaCare. And I think we actually have the votes. People are criticizing me for saying that. I think we actually have the votes for that. You know, we were basically one short and I think we're going to have the votes for that also, Maria.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Yes, I'm going to ask you about that because even your supporters say, you know, he has fantastic policies. We want to see this through, but the bickering and the feuding actually gets in the way. So obviously the feuding with Senator Corker, I think there's a personal thing going on between you and Senator McCain, do you worry that this bickering and feuding gets in the way of your agenda?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, and sometimes it helps to be honest with you. So, we'll see what happens in the end. But I think, actually sometimes it helps. Sometimes it gets people to do what they are supposed to be doing and you know that's the way it is. I just want what's right. And I think, for the most part, they want what's right too. So we'll see what happens. But I do believe we have the votes for healthcare at the appropriate time and I think that we're going to have the votes for taxes. And I will say the fact that healthcare is so difficult, I think makes the taxes easier. The Republicans want to get it done. And it's a tremendous tax cut. I mean, especially for the middle class, and especially for business. We have, you know, we're losing our companies. We have companies leaving. And I have to say since I've been elected, that's really stopped. It's really slowed down. There's a tremendous enthusiasm for business in this country so a lot of things have changed.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> And you see the job creation as well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's been so fantastic.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> If they can't get this tax bill done this year, should they forego Thanksgiving and Christmas? Should they be here if they don't have a bill on your desk by Thanksgiving?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think they should and I think they will. I think a lot of things are happening unless, you know, it's going to right after that. But I don't even like them leaving, but I will say this, I want to get it by the end it was year, but I would be very disappointed if it took that long. It could be substantially less than that depending on what happens when we send the bill back to the House. You know, they'll send it back and people are going to go and you know, make 200 suggestions as opposed to maybe no suggestions, because it's a great bill. It's going to be a great bill. And we're adjusting. We're adjusting so that there's no way that the middle class doesn't greatly benefit. Every once in a while there's a method under which, you know, it could be that some people in the middle class won't benefit as much as we want them to benefit, and we're making certain adjustments, but I think we're going to have it sooner rather than later.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Paul Ryan did an interview this week and said you are insisting that they have a fourth bracket. It is on your insistence that they have a fourth bracket. I know that you are very focused on the middle class, but do you want to raise taxes on the rich for the fourth bracket?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well he really said that on the basis that I wanted it or was thinking about it because I want to make sure the middle class gets taken care of, so in that way, yes. But actually, we do have four brackets because we have a zero bracket and people aren't including that. So that would make it a fifth bracket as opposed to an eighth bracket on the other -- on the other side, on the other way. I call it our competition, which is the competition of the past. No, I think that when Paul says that -- we may not have that but I would rather do that than do anything to hurt the middle class.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> But see, that's what I don't understand and I followed your policies really closely. The state and local income tax deduction elimination, you take that away. And then you go to a fifth bracket or a fourth bracket however you want to say it and you get a higher rate for the top earners.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> If the top earners pay 80 percent of the taxes, why are you so afraid to cut taxes on the top earners?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think this, look, you know, I am very happy with the way I've done prior to this in my civilian life, all right?
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Of course. This is not about this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Other people -- well, it's about me representing rich people, let's say, representing -- you know, being representative of rich people. It's very interesting to me, Bob Kraft [Inaudible] was very nice. He owns the Patriots. He gave me a super bowl ring a month ago.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> But [Inaudible] have kids, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he left -- which was very nice -- yes that's right. But he left this beautiful ring and I immediately give it to the White House and they put it someplace, and that's the way it is.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> How great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But he said to me -- he's a good man -- he said to me, you have to do us all a favor. Give the tax decrease to the middle class. We don't need it. We don't need it. We don't want it. Give it to the middle class. And I've had many people very wealthy people tell me the same thing. I've had very few say I want more. I want more. They really want to see -- you know, the middle class has really not done very well over the last long period of time. And so when Paul mentions maybe one more category -- which I would rather not have, it may not happen. But the only reason I would have -- and he does say this, he's very plain on what he said, is if for any reason I feel the middle class is not being properly taken care of. [Commercial Break]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We need a corporate tax down, you know, maybe it's the most important. We have a lot of most importants, but bringing it down from 35 down to 20 percent, that's a massive -- that's the biggest that we have ever done.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> That's a big deal on the corporate rate, for sure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is a big deal for companies, it is a big deal for investment. I think one of the other ones is expensing. You know, when you write something off in one year, as opposed to, you know, over many years, I think that's going to be tremendous. We have so many things in this plan that are going to be for growth. And, you know, your next question is going to be deficits, and I fully understand that and we all understand it and growth. If we pick up one point on GDP that's 2.5 trillion dollars, if you think of it, 2.5. It more than pays for everything. And I think we pick up much more than one point. And I've been the one that's saying we're going to hit three sooner rather than later. Well last quarter, we hit 3.2.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We haven't been -- Maria, we haven't been there in a long time. It's been a long time. As you know, the previous administration didn't hit it for the year for eight years. In eight years it didn't hit it at all. Here we hit it in, you know, an early quarter from me. And actually, before that it was down in the ones, it was down in the ones.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> People got used to like 1 1/2 percent growth for a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I call up -- I become friendly with leaders of other very, very, you know, large countries. And I would say how are you doing, and they would say we are not doing well. We are not doing well. GDP is at seven percent, GDP is at eight percent. We are not happy. And I'm saying you know we had it at one percent. So I really think we can do much more than a point. Let's see what happens. But one point is 2 1/2 trillion and millions of jobs.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Let me ask you about your courting of the Democrats recently. I mean, the reason that I brought up this other bracket is because I feel like the Republicans get bullied by the left, by this whole talking point of it's always tax cuts for the rich. You've been --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. By the way that's an automatic talking point.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Exactly.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> So, did you get bullied again? Are you getting bullied again?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think so. I mean, it doesn't seem like it. We just got the budget passed.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> If you get a fifth bracket --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But here the thing. Schumer, I like Schumer. But before he even knows the plan he says, oh, this is for the rich. He doesn't even know what the plan is and he's screaming it for the rich. He did it with healthcare too. He said this is for the rich, this is for the rich. You're not going to get your coverage. Everyone is going to go into hospitals. It is going to be terrible. The world is coming to an end. OK. He didn't even know what the plan was. That's OK. You know, we're all learning politics; right? And he said that. He says the same thing because I saw him two days ago before he really knew what was happening. He said, oh no it's for the rich. That's an automatic statement. It's like in business, you ask for twice as much. I mean --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Right. But you go back with Chuck Schumer.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do. I do you.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> I mean, both from your --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I've always--
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Do you think this is helpful in terms of the negotiations?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think it matters. I mean, I really don't. But I met with the Senate Finance Committee. I met with the Republicans, Democrats together right across the hallway two days ago. We had a great meeting. Ron Wyden was their Chairman. We had a fantastic meeting. There's a lot of similarity. They want tax cuts also, Maria. They want tax cuts and they want them as fast as possible. Now, they don't want to say it, and they are saying, oh gee, you know, the middle -- the middle class -- I call them the working people because they are really the working people -- but the middle class doesn't benefit. That's their standard. But they know they do benefit. They are the big beneficiaries. The other thing -- the other big beneficiary is jobs, wages.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> And that's been your priority.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's been my priority. And if you look at what I've done between regulation -- I've cut more regulations in nine months than any President has cut during the entire term that they were in. Nobody's cut - -
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> You're better than President Bush, I mean, the federal pages are down 30 percent under your leadership
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, and by the way, I've just begun because --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> So there more regulation that are about to come?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- there's so -- well there's a lot more. I mean, really a lot more. I mean, I think I can double it before it's over. But a lot of it is statutory, we have to give a 90-day notice and then you have to give a 120 day. We've given those notices. I mean, we're going to be doing a lot more. But you look at you know, Keystone Pipeline, Dakota Access Pipeline, these were all dead projects. I approved them in my first few days. I mean, literally in my first few days.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> See, I think that's why we have a frequent one percent GDP because of the regulation rollback that you did. There were some industries that are not that regulated. I'm wondering what you think about tech right now because you have these companies that are more powerful than ever before. They've got everything, all this data on us. They are selling the data. Should the tech companies be more regulated?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I guess some people talk about freedom and other people talk about we want to know who is taking ads or doing whatever, and I would imagine something is going to come down along the line like we're doing right now for regular, you know, whether it's commercial or not, for a normal broadcast company. It will be very interesting to see. You know, that's an argument that's happening right now. It will be very interesting to see -- there's two very distinct views on that. I can go -- honestly, I can go either way on it.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Mr. President, who do you want to see running the Fed?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, as you know, I've been seeing a number of people. And most people are saying it's down to two, Mr. Taylor, Mr. Powell. I also met with Janet Yellen who I like a lot. I really like her a lot. So I have three people that I'm looking at and there are a couple of others. I'd say, I will make my decision very shortly, pretty shortly.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Isn't there a way you can that you can get Taylor and Powell in there because you've got a Vice Chairman opening as well. You can actually put them both in there. Is that in your thinking?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It is in my thinking and I have a couple of other things in my thinking, but I like talent. And they are both very talented people. And it's a hard decision. It's actually a very, very important decision. People have -- most people have no idea how important that position is. That position is actually more -- a lot of people say get rid of the Fed, take the Fed out. The Fed is a very important position. It's also important psychologically, if the right person is in there, a lot of good things can happen. I think I'm doing a good job for business in that way. People are coming into country. You saw what's happened with Foxconn going to Wisconsin. You see what's happening with Apple where they are going to --I said to Tim -- I said to Tim Cook. I said Tim, I want some of these big beautiful plants that I see in China, they have to open in this country. You've got to give me some big beautiful plants. It's happening. It's all happening. The auto companies are coming back into our country, coming up to Michigan again. They're going back. We're not going to be taken advantage of. We were taken advantage of by -- I wouldn't say the company so much but by other countries. We were so badly taken advantage of. As you know we're negotiating with NAFTA and they have an election right now and lots of things, but at some point, either NAFTA will be renegotiated so that it's fair to the United States or it will be terminated. It's very simple. People think that's a very tough statement but it will probably be renegotiated. But if it's not successfully renegotiated so it's fair for the United States, it will be terminated. [Commercial Break]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He is a very elegant man. He is a tough strong Four Star Marine. If you're Four Star Marine, you're -- you've got something special to start off with, OK? General Mattis, General Dunford also, but very few. He was so offended because he was in the room when I made the call and so were other people. And the call was a very nice call. He was so offended that a woman would be -- that somebody would be listening to that call. He was -- he actually couldn't believe it. Actually, he said to me, Sir, this is not acceptable. This is really not -- and he knew -- I was so nice -- I was -- look, I've called many people and I would think that every one of them appreciated it. I was very surprised to see this, to be honest with you.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> He spoke very well yesterday.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the way, I spoke of the name of the young man, and I -- it was -- it was a really -- it's a very tough call. Those are the toughest calls.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> It's a very tough --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These are tougher than dealing with the heads of countries, believe me. These are very, very hard calls. They are sad and sometimes, you know, the grieving is so incredible. But he's just an elegant man and a wonderful man, and he is doing a fantastic job as Chief.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> The Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, she said oh, everything he said was because he's just trying to keep his job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, he doesn't need this job. In fact, he didn't really want this job. He was so happy -- you know, he's a military guy. He was doing this incredible job on the border and elsewhere. You know, he ran Homeland like nobody has ever run it, down 78 percent at the border crossings.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> It's incredible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's before the wall. He was -- there's nobody close. You go to the original first day, there was nobody close to doing the job. And I said I'd like to take you. How would you like it? And it's not that he wanted it. Actually, he would have preferred doing and staying where he was. He's a man that felt it would be important for the country. He does it for the country. He's not doing it for what he wants. He does it for the country. He's a very unusual man. So when she made that statement, I thought it was sickening actually.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> I just want to ask you before I lose you about the border. And you've said you want a legislative fix for DACA. What else do you need to see in terms of the border? What do you want overall?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're going to see -- we are working on DACA. We will see if we can get something with DACA. We have to build the wall. We have to -- all you have to do is look at what's happening in Mexico. We have to build a wall. We're going to stop drug trafficking to a large extent. I mean, what's happening with drugs -- and I'll be making a big announcement on that next week -- what's happening with drugs in our country -- and by the way, in the world, it is not like we're singled out, but it's never been like this. And a lot of the drugs come through that southern border and we need a wall. We're going to have a wall. We have to -- I would like to do something with DACA. And we are negotiating right now with the Democrats. We will see if we can come up with a solution. But I can tell you, I and the Republicans are very open to it. We have to get something in return.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> And last week on this program, we had Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He commended you. He congratulated you for decertifying Iran in what you did last week. Do you think you're going to get Europeans to support you in terms of sanctions, in terms of not selling technology to Iran?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Honestly I told them -- they are friends of mine. They really are. I get along with all of them. Whether it's Emmanuel or whether it's Angela. I get along -- I really like those people. I told them just keep making money. Don't worry about it. We don't need you on this. You just keep making money. When Iran buys things from Germany, the from France, and from the various you know, by billions of dollars, even us, you know, they were going to buy Boeings. I don't know what's going to happen with the deal. We'll see what happens with the deal. But when they buy those things, it's a little harder for those countries to do something. Would they do it if I really was insistent? I believe they would. I told them, just keep making money. Don't worry, we don't need you on this one.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> And on North Korea, is our policy with China just about what it does with North Korea or do we have a separate policy with China for something else?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> China has been -- I've developed a very good relationship with President Xi. President Xi is now going through his congress and it's going to be something very soon that's going to happen that gives him something that few leaders of China have ever had. And I'm really good with that. And to be honest, I told him this. I want to keep things very, very low key until such times as he gets that. I want him to get that. I think he deserves it. He's a good man. They have been helping us. They're closing off their banking systems to North Korea. They have cut the oil way down. Now the banking systems we can see because it all comes through here, as you know. The oil you can never really see what's going on, but the oil is way down. The oil is -- they are doing a lot of things.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> For the first time ever?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> For the first time ever. There was a recent article that said I had the greatest relationship of any President the two of us and I think we do. I really do. I don't want to be foolish. He's for China and I'm for the U.S. OK. So we start off with that. But we do have a very good -- I would say an exceptional relationship. And China's really helping us. And with respect to North Korea, look, 93 percent of the things going into North Korea come through China. China is big stuff. I believe he's got -- he's got the power to do something very significant with respect to North Korea. We'll see what happens. Now, with that being said, we're prepared for anything. We are so prepared like you wouldn't believe. You would be shocked to see how totally prepared we are if we need to be. Would it be nice not to do that? The answer is yes. Will that happen? Who knows. [Break in Interview]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's such an interesting question because I have friends that say oh don't use social media. See I don't call it tweets. Tweeting is like a typewriter. When I put it out, you put it immediately on your show. I mean, the other day I put something out, two seconds later I'm watching your show it's up. Donald Trump --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> You're right. We're watching your Twitter feed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they're well crafted. I was always a good student. I'm like a person that does well with that kind of thing. And I doubt I'd be here if it weren't for social media to be honest with you because there is a fake media out there. I get treated unfairly by the media. And I have a tremendous platform. I think I have 125 million people between Twitter, Instagram and all of them, and Facebook. I have a tremendous platform. So when somebody says something about me, I'm able to go bing, bing, bing, and I take care of it. The other way, I'd never been able to get the word out. [Commercial Break]
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> [Video Ends] Do you get any sense of this fifth bracket? I mean, if you do a fifth bracket, is that a million dollars, $2 million? What's the number?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think we'll use a fifth bracket. I only will use a fifth bracket if for any reason I feel the middle class is not get as much as I thought they would or as much as they are entitled to. They're entitled to a lot. This is really about the middle class, truly about the middle class and about jobs. And if I feel the middle class is not getting what I want them to get, and that's going to be a lot because I want them to get really a lot, then I'm going to do a fifth bracket which will give them more.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Morning glory and evening grace America. It's Hugh Hewitt in Colorado today. Yesterday, I was on Face the Nation in Washington, DC, and I'm back from New York where I have launched my book. I am joined now by Donald Trump, candidate for the presidency of the United States. Donald Trump, welcome back to the Hugh Hewitt Show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you, Hugh, it's great to be with you, really great.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Now I've got, I would be remiss. I've got the greatest marketing and promotion genius in the last many years on the phone talking to me, and I've got this new book, The Queen: The Epic Ambition of Hillary and the Coming of the Second Clinton Era . What's your advice on how to sell books like this, Donald Trump, in this era?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think selling book just generally is, you know, it is a lot different than it used to be. I did The Art of the Deal, Hugh, as you know, and it was the number one selling business book, or at least so they say, of all time. And you know, it was a different world. I've never seen an industry change like the book selling business, because today, they pick up their computer, they pick up their iPhone, and they see everything that they want to see.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it's a little bit different. But I think if a message is good, if you can just get the message out, but today, you really need the right message to sell a book. There's no question about that.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Can I get Donald Trump to say 'The Queen Ð Buy it, get it?'
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You said 'The Queen?'
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> 'The Queen.'
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, and that, Hugh, let, me ask you something. Is that your book?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Oh, it's my book. I just wrote it about Hillary.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, all right, good. Good. 'The Queen' Ð Buy it, get it. It's got to be good.'
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> (laughing) There you go. Now let's get serious. Speaking about the queen, she had this to say about you this weekend, Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Hillary Clinton> <Negative> I think decent people need to stand up against it. It should not, we should not accept it, Joe.
<Joe Ralston> <Negative> But how do you stop it?
<Hillary Clinton> <Negative> Well, I think we have to speak out against it. Like for example, a recent entry into the Republican presidential campaign said some very inflammatory things about Mexicans. You know, everybody should stand up and say that's not acceptable. You know, you don't talk like that on talk radio.
<Hillary Clinton> <Neutral> You don't...
<Joe Ralston> <Neutral> You can name him. You can name him.
<Hillary Clinton> <Negative> You don't talk like that on, you know, the kind of political campaigns. Now I think he is emblematic, so I want people to understand it's not about him. It's about everybody. And but then, the second thing is guns.
<Hillary Clinton> <Negative> Let's just cut to the chase. It's guns.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> So Donald Trump, first of all, she attacked you personally, didn't name you. What do you think about that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well number one, I'm honored. And number two, as far as Mexico is concerned, I believe strongly in a very, very strong border. We have no border right now. It's like a sieve.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's like water pouring through. It's ridiculous. And I have a great relationship with Mexico. I have a great relationship with Mexican people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And frankly, you know, I just feel strongly that you have to have a border, and it has to be strong. I often say that nobody can build a wall like I can build a wall. I build great buildings all over, all over the world, and frankly, nobody can build like I can build, and nobody can build a wall like I can. And people, some people thought that was a racist statement.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not. And I'm not talking about keeping Mexicans out. I'm talking about keeping the world out. You know, we're like a dumping ground for the rest of the world, Hugh.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, they just send, and we're not getting the finest people. We're getting people that many other countries, including Mexico, don't want. They're sending them over to us, because our government is so stupid and so foolishly run that we accept everybody with open arms. It's not like the old days.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we're getting a lot of bad people coming in, and I'm not talking about Mexicans. I'm talking about a lot of bad people period.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> So she has falsely accused you, Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they're coming through, and they're pouring through our border, and we don't know what to do with them. So we just, and we literally fly them to all parts of the country. We take them to all parts of the country. So I feel we need a strong border.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't feel, I know. If we're going to run, if we're going to have a country, we need a border. And we have to have a strong border so illegals aren't coming in, and that's illegals from all over the world.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> But Hillary was saying that you were using incendiary speech. Did she falsely accuse you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I would say yes, because I don't. I mean, all I do is I want to have borders. Now if that is incendiary, if that's, you know, being tough or being unfair, you let me know. But I think having borders, and having strong borders, and I mean strong borders, I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And frankly, this country had better get smarter, or we're not going to have a country. We're, as I said, we're a dumping ground for the rest of the world, and we have got to create a border. You don't have a country without a border. You know, what's a country? How do you define a country if you don't have borders? So many people have given me praise for saying it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A lot of the people running, they don't want to say it, because you know, you take some heat when you say it. And this has nothing to do with the Mexicans coming in. This has to do with the world coming in. The world is coming in.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're going to have the Middle East coming in, you're going to have everybody coming in, because it's literally a sieve.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Now Donald Trump, let's turn to the second part of what the former Secretary of State said. Let's talk about guns.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> What would you do, Donald Trump, to end gun violence in the United States?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all, I'm a huge 2nd Amendment person. I believe in it. And I told the story, actually, it was very interesting, because when I announced last Tuesday, which was quite an announcement. We've gotten wonderful feedback on that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And when I announced, I told the story about a woman and a man living together, husband and wife, and they're up in upstate New York. You had these two killers amazingly get out of a maximum security prison, which was fascinating in itself. And they get out, and they're vicious guys. And the woman was always against guns, I mean, strongly against guns.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the man was in favor. And all of a sudden, she said you know what? You're right. Now they've said they have a gun on every table, because they don't know who's going to pop into their house. And it's very interesting, but no, I've always been a very strong 2nd Amendment person.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Interestingly, if you look at Chicago, they have about the strongest gun control laws in the nation. And they are riddled with problems, riddled with problems. And you look at New York tremendous gun control laws, very, very hard to get a gun, almost without exception, it's rampant. So you know, it's like, you can't legislate against this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm a 2nd Amendment, I believe in it. You have to have the right to protect yourself. One thing you know for sure, Hugh, is that the people, the bad ones, are not giving up their guns, okay? And you know, you have some people, they want to give up the guns, they want to change the size of the magazines where you can have seven bullets, not ten. Can you imagine a bad guy loading up a magazine, and he says you know, I think I'll abide by the law.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll only put in seven bullets. You have a magazine that holds ten and more bullets, and they say oh, good, we'll only put in seven, because we want to abide by the law. So the bad people, the bad folks that have these guns are not giving them up. And the good ones will give them up if legislated, and you can't allow that to happen.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> So Donald Trump, we have six incidents, and let me list them for the audience. We have the massacre in Charleston last Wednesday night. We've got Michael Brown in Ferguson, we have Freddie Gray in Baltimore, we have Eric Garner in New York City, Tamir Rice in Cleveland, and of course, Trayvon Martin. Are they connected in some way, because of the media coverage...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was just going to say, you're reading them off, they're all so different when you think of it. I mean, they're all so different. And each one of those is quite a bit different from the other, and all very sad and horrible. But they're all, I mean, they're really, I think they're very, very different incidents.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> And so what, what should the conversation be about? As I said on Face the Nation yesterday, after the people are buried and grieved in Charleston is when people ought to talk about the Confederate flag. But generally speaking, there is this series of incidents involving race. Is there a lesson that Donald Trump draws from them?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, one of the things that I watched in Charleston, and I'm there a lot, and we have a lot of relationships over there, and one, I thought it first of all was horrible, and this guy is a sick cookie and lots of problems and everything else. But I thought it was amazing the way the people came together. It was like beautiful. There some something beautiful, even right after this horrible tragedy took place, the way they held hands and prayed, I saw them drop to their knees and start to pray.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There was something really dignified, and as horrible as the tragedy was, there was something beautiful the way the people came together, and still are coming together. So I thought it was, maybe it was a lesson, almost, because you see so many problems in so many different locations, Hugh, and all of a sudden, you see this beautiful, this beautiful aftermath to a horrible tragedy. And I watched it, and I thought it was really incredible, actually.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> But are race relations cratering That is true. That is very inspiring, and a lot of pulpits heard a lot of sermons yesterday about forgiveness such as the families practiced. But are race relations generally in America cratering right now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we have an African-American president, and you know, the biggest thing that I thought, I was never a fan, but I always thought that when he got elected, when Obama got elected, he'd be a cheerleader for the country. And certainly, you would have thought he would have been much better for African-Americans who are really suffering, more than anybody else right now in terms of jobs and everything else. So you have an African-American president, and African-American youth is doing worse than virtually it's ever done. I mean, we've had some pretty bad times in this country, but virtually, it's ever done, and you would think that that couldn't have happened with Obama as president.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So look, I am a big believer in jobs. We're losing our jobs to China. We're losing our jobs to Mexico and so many other places. And I'm just a big believer we have to bring our jobs back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have to have plants being built in this country, not in other countries. I'm a free trader, but the problem with free trade is we need smart leaders, and we don't have smart leaders. I love free trade. I love the concept.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we don't have free trade with China, because if you want to sell something in China, if you're a manufacturer, Hugh, and you want to go to China and sell your product, it's going to be almost impossible for you to do so. And yet they come in here and they openly sell it, no tax, no nothing. So I believe in free trade totally, but you need smart leaders. And you need rules.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> But Donald Trump, when you get on a microphone, the whole country watches you. And I call you just an American P.T. Barnum combined with Howard Dean combined, you're just legendary at getting people to focus on you. Yesterday, Michael Gerson said one of the Republicans has to step up and talk about ending or diminishing violence in the United States, and I agree with that.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> How could Donald Trump help in that? I mean, how do you help stop the slaughter in Chicago, not just the slaughter in Charleston, but generally, what can candidates do to bring down the volume and to increase the peace?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is a huge problem. It's a problem that's very rarely discussed. It's being discussed by you a little bit, and a few other people. But even you don't want to hit it the way you've really liked to hit it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you hit it hard and you start talking about, and if you start talking about and going into great details, you get called racist. You get called everything. It's a huge problem in this country. People need to be enthusiastic.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They need to love our country. And they need to have hope. They have no hope. They absolutely have no hope.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they have no jobs. They need jobs. They need hope. They need cheerleading.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have nothing going right now. The gang violence, which is a part of this, is unbelievable. So it's a big problem. But one of the ways you have to start, and if you look at what's going on in Chicago, it's like a bloodbath, and it's only in certain areas of Chicago, and nobody talks about it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They don't say that. They just talk about Chicago. I mean, it's only in certain areas of Chicago. It's in certain areas of New York and lots of other places.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They need hope, and they need jobs. You've got to, you've got to create incentives for people to go out. And you have to be able to have the jobs. I know people that have, you know, they go to college, kids go to college, they spend money, they borrow it to the hilt, they owe tremendous student loan debt, they have debt all over the place, and they get out, and they do well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They get good marks, and they're really good students, and they can't get a job. They don't have jobs.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Last question, because I think you're onto something here, and I know we've got a hard break at :15. They need cheerleading. You just said that. Ronald Reagan was a big cheerleader.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> I worked for Ronald Reagan.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Absolutely. He was a huge cheerleader.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> So he was a great cheerleader.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, Ronald Reagan was a great cheerleader.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Explain to people what you mean by cheerleading.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Creating a spirit for the country. We don't have that spirit anymore. You know, it's very interesting, my daughter, Ivanka, told me a story that she would go when she was a very young girl to a communist country, Czechoslovakia, and they were so proud of the American dollar, they used to, I never heard this before. They used to take the American dollar and scotch tape it onto their windshield of their car, even if it was a dollar bill, because they were so proud of having anything American.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They were proud of even just a small one dollar association with the United States. And they'd post it, and she said today, it's a whole different thing. Today, they laugh at us and they scoff at us. But you know, she told me that story, and I think I'm going to use that a little bit.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I haven't used it except for you right now, but I heard it two days ago. And she said you know, dad, when I used to go to Czechoslovakia, because he in-laws were there, she'd go there for a week. And the people were so proud of that dollar being posted on the windshield of their car. We don't have anything like that today.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Today, they're not proud.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Donald Trump, I am glad to have you use my prompt, and I will use your prompt to promote the Queen. Thanks for coming, come back early and often through 2015.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Fantastic. Thank you very much, Hugh.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Be well, Donald.
