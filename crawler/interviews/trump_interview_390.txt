<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Let's start with the big issue in the 2012 presidential race. Jobs, why haven't jobs come back as fast as many people thought they should?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because they're going to China. China's taking our jobs. They're making our product, and we have to do something about it. We have to do something about it quickly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are decimating our country just as OPEC is decimating our country with their oil prices.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> How can you compete with Chinese labor which is much, much less than unionized American labor, I mean you're going to make a law that says you can't...? American companies can't manufacture in China, you going to make a law?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By getting China not to manipulate their currency. It's very tough for our companies to compete with Chinese companies because very simply they manipulate their currency. When you manipulate a currency like they do they are professionals at it.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> How are you going to do that, China's going to say we're going to do what we want, and we don't care what you want?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to do very simple, Bill. Now, people are starting to use my thing. I mean the one negative about saying it and frankly if it's good for the country I don't care is that now everyone else is starting to say it, and I started it. Twenty five percent tax on China, unless they behave that...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> two things really, and really three, people will start creating, will create jobs in this country, number one. Number two, China is going to come to the table it will never even come to that because they can't do it. We are rebuilding China.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> All right, but you're threatening China with a trade.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not threatening it. No, I'm not threatening.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Twenty five percent tariff, that's big.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Bill, they are threatening us. They're going to make a $300 billion, let's call it profit this year on the United States, 300 billion. And more importantly not only 300 billion, they're taking our jobs. We have to do something about China.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to do something about OPEC. We cannot have oil at $105, which is going to go to $150 very soon. We have nobody to speak to these guys. They wouldn't be there except for us.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They wouldn't be there.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Well, what are you going to say to the OPEC, you're got to keep your oil at a price that we the United States want? Again, I'm going to say no.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The messenger is the key. If you have the right messenger and they know how to deliver the message.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> You scare them?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You got to scare them, absolutely.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> How are you going to scare the shakes, how you're going to do that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They wouldn't be there except for us.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> What are you going to say?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We protect them. We have soldiers in Saudi Arabia. They don't pay us for anything. How about the new thing with Libya.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Arab League which is Saudi Arabia and others, they tell us to go and attack. They don't like Gadhafi attack. They don't pay us. We're going to spend, we have already spent a billion dollars.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me, Bill.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Worst case scenario, though. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We spent a billion dollars. Why aren't they paying us?
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Fine, in a fair world they would.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know where Libyan oil goes to?
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Yeah, Europe.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, excuse me, it goes to China. China is their biggest customer.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> A lot in China, but a lot in Europe too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know where it doesn't go to?
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Correct.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Okay, but unintended consequences of you threatening the Chinese and OPEC, I mean that's going to have a big blow back on the United States. Now, it sounds good to be a tough guy. I'm a tough guy. You know that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're a tough guy.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Okay, all right, but the blowback, all right, from China and OPEC could really, really harm the country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The only thing you have to fear is fear itself.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> FDR.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm so surprised that you... let me tell you something, the mere threat of doing that, they know what's right.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Then why didn't Obama or Bush done it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because they don't have the capacity to do it.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> That's a smart stuff thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Maybe they're not smart enough. Maybe they're not tough enough. Maybe they don't have the right ingredient to do it, and they should absolutely be doing it. The mere putting on a tax on China, you're never going have to do it because they're going to come to you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're going to call you and I don't mean what you give them a big party for their president who's been screwing us for years and years and years at the White House. They're going to call you and say what we have to do because we are rebuilding China. You go to China, they're building airports, they're building bridges, and they're building cities, bigger than New York City, all with our money, mostly with our money.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Okay. You're going to be the tough guy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know what I noticed the other day, Bill?
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> What?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was watching a great documentary on China, and they're building bridges all over China, massive bridges like the Verrazano Bridge, like the George Washington Bridge like we used to. What was the last time you saw a bridge being built in this country? It doesn't happen anymore. When was the last time you saw an airport being built in this country? It doesn't happen anymore. We're policing the world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're in Iraq. We're in Afghanistan. We're in Libya. We're all over the place, policing it, and China is out spending more money than us on taking over the world economically.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're fools, Bill. Our leaders are fools.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Okay. You're going to be a tough guy if you're elected president.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not going to be a tough guy.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Yeah, you are.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> You're going to scare me down.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm not a tough guy. I think I'm a smart guy. Okay, let's not use the word tough. I know a lot of tough guys.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> What are you saying is tough right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let me tell you, I know a lot of guys that think they're tough, they're not tough. Let's use the brain not the toughness. We're going to be smart.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Okay, but the confrontation is going to come across as tough, if you, what you do is what you say that's a tough approach, you know that, that is a tough approach.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to lose $300 billion a year to China, where we can't afford to build schools for our children, where we can't afford to build highways, where we can't afford to build railways, where we can't afford to build bridges. I mean I don't want to build, Bill, it's very simple. I want money to be invested in jobs and in this country. I don't want to rebuild China.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to rebuild the United States.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> All right, Obamacare. Big program?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a disaster.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Why is it a disaster?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know I graduated from a grade school, the Wharton School of Finance, and I have six friends and they have companies, they are medium sized and smaller companies, but they've always made a nice living. The smart guys always were smart guys. Of the six, three of them recently told me they're going to have to close their companies because Obamacare is so expensive. Now, what do I know? All I know is these are really smart guys that operate mid-size to small companies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They've always done a good job, employ lots of people, etc., etc. Three of them are going to close their companies because of Obamacare. Three of them are not happy about it but they think they can get by. That's all I have to hear.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Do you believe the federal government has an obligation, a moral obligation to provide people who can't afford health insurance with health insurance?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I certainly would like to see, you know I have a big heart. I really do despite what you may think. I have a great, big, fat, beautiful heart and when people are in trouble. I like to help them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What I don't like seeing is South Korea, we have thousands of troops in South Korea. We're protecting them from North Korea, we're sending ships. We're doing everything. You know what happens.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They give us nothing. Saudi Arabia, we're protecting... wait a minute.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Okay, let's get back...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If we have to ran our country properly...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Then we have money to do that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We would have so much money would be coming out of your ears.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> But do we have a moral obligation to give people health care who can't afford it or just won't bother?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have a moral obligation to help people, I really believe that. I believe that strongly and not everybody does.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> So there would be Trump care then?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it would be a form of much better... as an example, I have a big company, when I buy health insurance, I can't go across state lines to buy it, you know why? And I can make a better deal in New Jersey, than I can in New York with a better company.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> You'd get free competition.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Number one, anywhere in the United States has to be a strong comp -- but we should be able to go out and price it privately. I believe in the private, but I don't want to be stuck with one or two companies in New York. I should be able to go to Wisconsin. I should be able to go to Iowa.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If I want to buy health care for my people as long as it's a strong company. I should be able to bet it out. You would save so much money. But these brilliant politicians don't allow that to happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We can't go across state lines. You tell me why? That would be a big thing right there.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> One of the reasons the recession hit is so hard is because weasels on Wall Street ginned up these are real estate derivatives, you are a real estate guy. Would you crack down on Wall Street, would you have a moral regulations on these people, more rules they have to follow over there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would not do that. You know, I grew up and I went to school with many of these people, and they're very smart and you'll come up with rules and they find ways to go around.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> So you let them do whatever they want?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What you are doing, Bill, is you're making it so tough for our companies and our Wall Street people. Let's use the word, "nicely."" Our Wall Street people to compete with the rest of the world because you have guys in London
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Okay, but you know...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Otherwise people find their ways around regulation very easy. These are super geniuses.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> But these guys hurt the economy with these derivatives you know they did?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, a lot of things hurt the economy. I think just as much as that was oil at $150 a barrel hurt the economy, to me that's hurting the economy.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> The derivatives really doing. All right, now, you have a situation where the unions are being attacked by some governors because the public service unions tremendous perks, okay, you use union labor.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> What do you think about the unions?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have a great relationship with unions. I understand what's happening, let's say in Wisconsin. I understand what's happening...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Is [Inaudible] Wisconsin?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think that he is maybe right for his state. I think it doesn't necessarily apply to all states you know, I've had a great relationship over the years with unions. We've had collective bargaining. I've become very wealthy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've dealt with unions because as you know New York has largely unions you're dealing with them. I have great friends that are in unions and heads of unions. I haven't had the same difficulty and problem, but I think you have to do what's right. I respect him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's tough. Yes, he's unyielding. And maybe sometimes to unyielding and maybe not too unyielding. He wants Wisconsin to come back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He wants to have a great balanced budget so I understand what he's doing.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> All right. Do you support what he's doing? Are the unions in the public sector strangling the states, so that they are in debt and in danger of default?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, certainly the unions, some unions have taken advantage, if you look at what the unions did to General Motors, if you look at what the... and they've also been some very bad decisions from management. But certainly some unions have done a big number in companies and doing States. No question about that.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> All right. GE pays no taxes at the federal government. Do you see my report the other day?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I saw your report. I saw a lot of reports.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Okay, no tax, zero. Nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not so good.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> What do you do?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, you change the tax code, so that the people have to pay something, they have to at least pay... now, it's interesting that some companies paid 40%.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Well, tell me what you do to make GE, and other companies that don't pay anything because they park money offshore?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The problem with the tax code is, it's so complex. As an example, me I have a big company. I pay lawyers millions of dollars a year, millions, over a tax code. I think that you have to simplify it and people should pay a fair amount of tax...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> How? What's fair?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...without a tax increase. Well, whatever is fair?
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Do you want to apply tax, what do you want?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you have companies, some were paying 40%, some were paying nothing.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> But tell me what you want?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And by the way, some of the ones that were paying nothing, were doing better than the ones paying 40%.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Fine, but if you're a president, you're not going to be able to do it on rhetoric. You're going to have to say this is a fair tax code. How much should I pay? I make a lot of money. Not nearly what you make but how much should I pay in tax that federal government, what percentage of my income?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think we need a taxes...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Tell me how much I should pay?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can't do that right now, Bill.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Bill, I'd like you to pay 100% because you have plenty of money. You should pay everything.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Okay, so just give everything away?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You should pay everything. Just you, should be the only one of the country.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> But don't you see that people are going to want you as a candidate for president to tell them how much they should pay. How much corporation should pay?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have to look at the deficits. I will tell you if ever decide to run, that's 14 trillion and it's increasing rapidly correct.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Correct.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If I ever decide to run and I may and I'll make that decision before June. We're not going to have the kind of problems that we have right now because I won't be taken advantage of by the rest of the world, we are a whipping post.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> I got it, all right. But you got to come up with some kind of tax code.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Believe me, there won't be so much tax necessary as there is right now because we are a whipping post. We are being ripped off by the rest of the world to the tune of trillions, by the way trillions of dollars. I'm not talking about the old word billions. I'm talking about the new word trillion.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Okay, illegal immigration. How are we going to stop that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you either have a country or you don't. You either have a line in the boundary or you don't. Something has to be done.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> What? Tell me what you're going to do to stop millions coming over, what are you going to do, militarize the border?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a very easy and quick solution and a lot of people would like to see it. It's a very, very strong solution. But you either have a country with a line or you don't have a country. And right now, we don't have a country.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Okay, what's the easy solution? Go.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, you put soldiers on that line.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> So you militarize?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do you have a choice?
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> No, I don't think so. I've been calling for that for 10 years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're coming over and they're climbing over a fence and there's nobody within ten miles and they walk in, and they get a job.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> So you militarize the border, you make it very difficult?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And they're selling drugs all over the place.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Yeah, you stop the narcotics along the...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they're killing people all over the place. We're not doing anything about.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Okay. Now, the 15 million illegal aliens already in the United States. What do you do with them?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well you know, I have a real interesting situation going. I have friends that want to get, and they think I have this great influence. Oka, they're wrong, but they think I have tremendous power and tremendous... so they call me and they have PhDs from Europe and they have PhDs from Asia, physicists, doctors, brilliant people, great people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They want me to help them get a green card, and you can't get it. And yet if you come in from someplace you don't have a job, you never went to school. You come into the country and automatically you're made a citizen. And we ought to sort of have a merit system.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We want to get some great people in this country. If you're great, if you've gone to school in the finest school in Europe and you have the highest marks in the finest school, you can't come into this country and telling you...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> All right, so you...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me, Bill, and I'm talking about calling the biggest Senator, the biggest Congressman, and the most powerful people. They can't do it.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Okay, so you can change the illegal immigration system, and I think everybody would agree with that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would certainly change it.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> But what do you do...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know what I want in this country? I want people to come into this country that are going to be productive. I want productive people in this country.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Okay, we got it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I hope you get it?
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> I get it. I'm slow, but I do pick it up.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> What do you do with the 15 million here? Do you give them a pathway to citizenship, what do you put them on a bus and drive them out of here?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think right now you're going to have to do something. And you know it's hard to generalize but you're going to have to look at the individual people, see how they've done, see how productive they've been, see what their references are, and then make a decision.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> All right, on a case by case going to take a long time, and a lot of people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A long time, but you know you have some great productive people that go down, and then you have some total disasters that probably should be in prison.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Okay, real quick, social issues, abortion, you favor it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> As you know, I'm pro-life.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Okay. You're a pro-life on abortion. Would you outlaw abortion?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd go a step. I'd go a pretty strong step. It's something I don't like, I used to not be pro-life. I become pro-life.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've seen friends that had children that they didn't want, and now they have children and they are the apple of the eye. I've really changed my views over the years. But I am pro-life. I would really...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm forming an opinion... I'm forming a very strong opinion, but I'll let you know in about three or four weeks if I decided to run.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> All right, gay marriage. Favor it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm against it.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just don't feel good about it. I don't feel right about it. I'm against it and I take a lot of heat because I come from New York. You know for New York its like how can you be against gay marriage, but I'm opposed to gay marriage.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> They say the gays that this violates their rights, that they are American citizens and they should have a right to live the same way heterosexuals live, and you say?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think it's a tough situation. I'll tell you what I say, I say that we have other problems. We have other problems in this country and I don't think a president should be elected on gay marriage or not gay marriage because we have some very big problems. Based on everything I see Obama who said basically the same thing as I do.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think he's going to come out in favor...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> But you remain opposed?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am opposed, yes.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> All right. You saw me on the view with the ladies walking out?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, I did.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> But they didn't walk out on you, when you brought out the birth certificate and then they should have that was worse than what I did. Muslim problem in the world. Is there a Muslim problem in the world?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me explain one thing. I don't think it was worse. I'm just saying, Obama, let me see...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Okay, now we'll get to that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know what the big deal was.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Well, Whoopi...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Whoopi, took it a little hard. Whoopi is a friend of mine. I was in her movie and lots of other things, but, you know, it's one of those things. Go ahead.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Is there a Muslim problem in the world?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean I don't know the Swedish people knocking down the World Trade Center, there certainly is.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Then why...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I came out very strongly against the Mosque being built virtually in close side.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> And so honestly, you and I were on the same page.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You and I...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Okay. However, Muslim-Americans say, hey, you're picking on us.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, nobody is picking. The fact is it was so insensitive when they announced the Mosque in that location. Don't forget, that's my territory. Manhattan real estate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When they announced the Mosque in that location, I couldn't believe it. You know, you have people, 3,000 people died, and you have all those parents and sisters and brothers and wives and I mean, just saying I can't believe it. The World Trade Center came down. My loved one, more than anybody in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I love this person dead. And now they're building a Mosque across it.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> I thought it was the same way, insensitive.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's a very insensitive...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> You do believe overall there is a Muslim problem in the world?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, there is a Muslim problem absolutely. You just have to turn on your television set.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> And do you think it encompasses all Muslims?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, and that's the sad part about life because you have fabulous Muslims. I know many Muslims and I... they're fabulous people, they're smart, they're industrious, they great. Unfortunately, at this moment in time, there is a Muslim problem in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By the way and you know it and I know it and some people don't like saying it because I think it's not politically correct.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Whoopi and Joy will walk off on me. But when I say that there's a Muslim problem in the world, I basically say why don't the good Muslims that I believe outnumber the bad Muslims. Probably eight or nine to one, why don't they, the Muslim community throughout the world, speak out more forcefully against the Jihadists. Why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there's something out there that brings a level of hostility that I've never seen in any religion. I mean you can say what you want about the Qur'an, you can say what you want, there's something there. There is tremendous hatred and tremendous hatred of us. I look at Iraq.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was watching the other day. You know, we've spent all this money and all those lives in Iraq. They hate us, they hate us, they can't get rid of us fast enough. By the way as soon as they leave you know, as soon as we leave, Iran is going to take over the oil.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know that.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> We know there's a big problem, we'll get too far in a minute. Okay. Now, when you were on the view and they didn't walk out which they should have because they walked out on me and they should've stayed, you were way, way worse than I was on that view. You were hammering the birth certificate.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Now, we very early on did investigation about Barack Obama's birth certificate, and what the factor found out was there were two announcements, the week he was born in both Honolulu newspapers saying that he was born. Okay. That is impossible. That is impossible to make happen, if he had not been born in the hospital.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Therefore, I just put it to bed, I said he was born in Honolulu. All right. The two newspapers documented it. His mother was a hippie.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> His father was a guy from Kenya who split, there could have been a sophisticate, what is he, a baby Jesus. There was a sophisticated conspiracy to smuggle this baby back into the country. I just dismissed it. But you made a big deal out of it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Bill, I grew up with Wall Street geniuses. What they do in terms of fraud and how they change documents. And I'll tell you something if you notice those dates were three days later. And here's what I asked people, who puts announcements, here two poor people, a man and a woman with no money.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They have a baby. There's announcements in the newspaper.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> The [Inaudible] said.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me, the [Inaudible]. Nelson Rockefeller doesn't put announcements...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Sure, there are birth announcement all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've never seen one.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I've never seen.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> They're common.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've never seen one.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> But why is this so important to you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because if you are going to be the president the United States you have to be born in this country and there is a doubt as to whether or not you are born...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Come on, do you really feel there's a doubt?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I started off by saying and I always do and I did on the View. I'm a very smart guy. I went to the best college. I had good marks.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was a very smart guy, a good student all of that stuff. Okay. Because what they do to the birthers which is a term I hate because a lot of these birthers are just really quality people that just want the truth. What they do to the birthers is unbelievable, to a point where people are afraid to talk about the subject, they're afraid to confront you or anybody about this.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Do you think it's an important subject?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Listen. I have a birth certificate. I have my birth certificate and in fact they said the one I gave yesterday wasn't good enough. I actually got the one from the Health Department which is the perfect one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay, because they were saying, oh, the one I gave yesterday was not good enough, so I got the other. People have certificates, he doesn't have a birth certificate. Now, he may have one, but there's something on that birth... maybe religion, maybe it says, he's a Muslim.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. Maybe he doesn't want that. Or he may not have one, but I will tell you this if he wasn't born in this country, it's one of the great scams of real time.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Absolutely, but I don't think that's the case.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I mean you don't, but I'm starting to think, which we don't like. Two weeks ago...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> I don't think you believe that either. I think, it's provocative, you get a lot of attention raising the question, but I don't think you believe.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Two weeks ago, I felt like probably he was born in the country. Today, it's possibly. I'm telling you, it changed. I've seen too many things.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Why did Whoopi Goldberg get so angry about you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. And then she said...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Did you asked her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She said to me, and she likes me. She said, Donald, I love you but she actually said if it were a white man... now, I know they asked for Bush's birth certificate. I know for a fact they asked for John McCain's birth certificate.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> So why did she make ration, why do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know, she brought race into it.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> What?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She brings race into, what can I tell you.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> You don't know why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She started up by saying I love you, and that she brought race into it, you tell me what that is.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> I don't know.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> All right, let's go to Libya. The Libyan action is being explained by President Obama, as you know, as a humanitarian act to stop a slaughter, which we all believe would have happened.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Which is fine.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Okay. Do you support it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I support stopping that kind of a slaughter. The problem is where do you stop? You've got other countries that are doing worse than this guy ever dreamed of. And we're not doing anyway.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Well, we have other countries like Darfur.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're not doing anything, though. You know, the one thing I would say, Bill. And I've never said this before. This is a first in your show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good luck with it. Run with it. In the old days, when you had wars you win, right? You win, to the victor belong the spoils. When we go to Iraq, we spend a trillion for so far and thousands of lives are lost, right? And not to mention all the poor guys and gals with one arm and no arm and all the pap's, right? We're going to leave, and as sure as you're sitting there, Iran is going to come over, take over not only Iraq but perhaps more importantly to them take over the second biggest oil fields in the world, right? And I like the old system better.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You want a war, you stay there and you keep the oil. And you know then those people will not have died in vain. Forget the money we spend. They will not have died in vain.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have the second largest oil fields in the world. Now, they're not going to come as long as we're there. But 15 minutes after we leave, Iran is going to go into Iraq...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> And what do you do to Iran if that happens if you're president?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody is going to have enough heart to want to go back.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> But you're going to be president.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You to stay. Keep the oil.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> You are going to be in the office. Iran comes in, and tries to take the oil. What do you do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You stay and you keep the oil. If Iran is going to take over the oil, we stay and we keep the oil.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> But if they're out of there...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Same thing, excuse me...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Which they will be, in 12, they're going to be out of there. So say you win the presidency?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We shouldn't be out of there, what we should do is take of the...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Shouldn't, wouldn't, Obama, is going to pull them. There's going to be 20,000.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> As sure as you are sitting there, Iran, two minutes after we leave, Iran is going to come in and take over the oil.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> What do you do about it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You stay and protect the oil, and you take the oil and you take whatever's necessary for them and you take what's necessary for us and we pay ourselves back a trillion and a half dollars or more. We take care of Britain, you take care of other countries that helped us, and we don't be so stupid. You know we're the only country... and if you look at wars over the years and I study wars.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay, my whole life is a war. You look at wars over the years, a country goes in, they conquer and they stay. We go in, we conquer, and then we leave and we hand it to people that we don't even know. Now, who are the people that are going to be running Iraq? The person that hates the United States the most will be running Iraq.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And will be living with like whether it's Mubarak or anybody else with their billions of dollars. It's horrible what's going on. So in a nutshell, we go in, we take over the second largest oil fields, and we stay. I don't want to hand...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> So you're going to take over the Iraqi off?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm not going to hand it back to Iran that I can tell. Don't smile.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> I'm just saying, look, if you're going to go with China and you're going to threaten them. And then you're going to threaten OPEC...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm not threating China.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Twenty five percent...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm saying to China that unless you behave, that unless...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> And then if you're going to go into the Iraqi oil fields and take a more oil, going to be a lot of blowback.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> China, between China, OPEC is the worst abuser, and China is the second worst abuser. China and OPEC are destroying our country. We will soon not have a great country. We will soon be second to China by a long way in 10 years to 12 years, we will be a distant second to China.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if I would have said that five years ago, people would have left.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Okay. Iran is trying to get a nuke. You're going to stop them if you're president?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wouldn't let them have a nuke.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Now, how do you stop it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would do what I had to do.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Which is?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They will not have a nuke.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> What do you mean, to level them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will stop. They will not have a nuke. They will not have a nuke.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> All right. So now we've got China mad at us, OPEC, Iraq and Iran.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know, what's going to happen?
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll have better relationships than our weak president has right now. Look, our weak president that kisses everybody's ass is in more wars than I've ever seen. Now, he's in Libya. He's in Afghanistan.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's in Iraq. Nobody respects us. And nobody respects, listen...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> So no nuke for Iraq?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And nobody respects our leadership.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Okay. No nuke for Iraq.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean why, can I do worse? You're talking about me like I'm a warmonger.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> I'm not talking, I'm just asking the question.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This guy got the Nobel Peace Prize and every time I look he's going into another country.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Afghanistan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, the amazing thing about Libya, France leading the way. And to me that's a great, our great French leader.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> They're afraid of the...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you know the other amazing thing, the Arab League. You know the Arab League is? Saudi Arabia, and a couple of others of the richest nations in the world. They said, we want you to go into Libya. We don't like Gaddafi.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Get rid of Gaddafi. Why don't they pay for this? Why aren't they paying?
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> [Inaudible]. Let's charge him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the way just to finish you off in China, if China gets its oil from Libya and you know by far the biggest customer is China. Why are they contributing to this fight in Libya?
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Well, they like Gaddafi. Chinese like Gaddafi.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me, why aren't they...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Why would they fight them, if they like him?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know if they like him, but I don't like him.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> No, they voted at, they don't want him...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But that's what they get, the oil. Why aren't they doing something having to do with [Inaudible].
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Because they like him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they're going to get their oil from there anyway, whoever it is. That's the other thing you have to worry about Libya. I hear, and what do I know, but I hear that the so-called rebels, you know we make them look like heroes, right? I hear they are very inspired by Iran and by Al Qaeda. So how about we make it possible for them to take over Gaddafi and Libya? And then at the end of the whole process they turn out to be worse, and that could happen, mark my words.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Okay. Afghanistan, you stay there if you're president, you keep troops there?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the problem you have is there you don't have oil. You have drugs, but you don't have oil. I guess probably for them drugs were almost the same thing, but you don't have oil. Look, I am the strongest military person, and if I have Iran and won, I would be the strongest military president ever.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I believe in having... I would not be cutting the budget. I'd be coming out with the best weapons ever. All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But with Afghanistan, I want to build our country. You know in Afghanistan I heard a story...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> But would you pull out of it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They build a road. They build at the end of this beautiful road, they build a school. They blow up the school, they blow up the road we then start all over again. And in New Orleans and in Alabama, we can't build schools.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want to rebuild the United States, just like I rebuilt the Wollman Skating Rink. We had a Wollman skating. You know what...?
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> I know, we know the story.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay. Well, no, not everybody, took the city of New York, eight years, they couldn't build it. I did it in three months for one tenth the cost.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> All right. I you did it by yourself. There was nobody out there with you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I did it by myself.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Do you pull out of Afghanistan, you let the...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's how often used, you know it's in all the textbooks, the Wollman Skating Rink, what I did, and the fact is it chose private industry, private enterprise, can do it better than government.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> No doubt about that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Eight years, $21 million. I did it in three months for a million eight.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Do you pull out of Afghanistan, let the Taliban take over?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know that Afghanistan is much of a problem as Pakistan because everyone is telling me, they're all in Pakistan, and they're not in Afghanistan.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> But you're going to come back at the U.S...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they may, I mean they may, that's only Pakistan. If Osama bin Laden is in Pakistan. Why are we paying them hundreds of billions of dollars a year? Now, what I would say and don't get scared. I want to get along fellows, I love you, let's go have a drink.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you're not getting money. We want Osama bin Laden because if you don't give us Osama bin Laden, we're just not giving you your hundreds and billions of dollars.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Listen, I'm just calling for tougher Pakistan, though.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know, what's going to happen? You have a six foot, six Arab, six foot six, who's on a dialysis machine supposedly. And we can't find them. Now, if you tell me that the leaders of of Pakistan don't know where a six foot six guy is standing. You're wrong, okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're wrong.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> We know where he is.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, what we said... well, you don't know, and I don't know and I wish I did because...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Now, what is your stand?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what, okay, well, I hope you're right, but I'm sure if you said that he's gone rogue by now because you know one thing he's a cunning character. But here's what's not so cunning. We pay hundreds of billions of dollars a year to Pakistan. And if we said to them, sorry folks, we can't do it, you have to give us Osama bin Laden.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know what, he'll be standing on the White House doorstep very quickly.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> But what I'm getting for you...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we don't have anybody that even thinks this way.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Okay, what I'm getting from you though is you would withdraw U.S. troops out of Afghanistan.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, I would.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Okay, and then the Taliban comes back because they would.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they'll come back anyway because they are really in Pakistan.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Okay, but that's...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Are you a warmonger, do you want to attack Pakistan?
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> That's a short drive.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Bill, you are warmonger.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> No, I'm just like... this is serious. So they come back and they reconstitute the Taliban government. Al Qaeda has the sanctuaries it has before.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Then you're going to have to go back and take care of them anyway.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't believe too much in the soldier concept other than, I believe an [Inaudible], you're sort of seeing that over in Libya. You can knock the hell out of them without losing soldiers and losing lives.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Kill a lot of civilians, though.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And arms, and legs.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Kill a lot of civilians.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, not necessarily, we have a good intelligence, you know intelligence is the thing that this country is lacking especially from its...
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> Afghanistan, Iraq. All right. Now final question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When you say Afghanistan. I am as I said the most militaristic person you'll ever find. I'm much more so than anybody. But you have to know what to do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I want to rebuild our military. And I also want to rebuild the United States. I'm tired of seeing China and Saudi Arabia and all of these countries, South Korea where we're protecting them and they're making hundreds of billions of dollars of profit on us, and we protect them and they don't pay anything. I'm tired of seeing it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want to rebuild the United States, so that we start looking like what China is doing. You go to China, you go to Hong Kong, there's a crane on every corner. The places boomtown, you go to our cities. The roads are decaying.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's honestly, Bill, it's very, very sad. We're like a third world nation. You land at LaGuardia Airport, you come out of... one of these great brand new Chinese airports, the Qatar airport, most gorgeous airport I've ever seen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You land at LaGuardia, it's like we're from a third world nation. They have a sign, welcome to New York, it's made of two by fours that are there for 25 years, you know what I'm talking about, on the grass and they're rotting. This is what we have. I want to rebuild this country.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> I got it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to create jobs in this country.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> I got it. Do you have any idea what you're getting into if you do run for president, you going to have to go to Iowa and New Hampshire in the winter?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love the people in Iowa. I love the people in New Hampshire.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Do you know where Iowa is?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> You know, there's no golf courses.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know I almost bought one in Iowa actually.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Of course. So you're willing to slog it through?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Positive> You know, you where the earmuffs, go up to New Hampshire.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do I love it, is that different than [Inaudible].
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Yes, it's different.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Is that different would you say in Palm Beach. Okay. But you know what I love this country. If I can do something to help this country and when I see the gross incompetence that we have running this country, I cannot believe it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay. I cannot believe it.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Who could be your vice president? Who could be...?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know, I don't want to talk about the vice president. It's so far off, but there's a lot out there.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> What am I going to get in your cabin?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You'd be great.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Negative> Where am I going? I'm not going to be VP. I've seen how you...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think you're starting to be too soft to be secretary of defense.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> Yeah, compared to you, Attila, I mean you're going to be sweet, but across... I might be a moderating influence.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know the funny thing is, Attila, you probably have a lot less warfare than the wars we have right now because they're going to respect Attila and not respecting what you have right now.
<Bill O'Reilly> <Neutral> He might be a good campaign slogan. I'm not Attila, but I'm close. How about that on a bumper sticker?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what, I'm not Attila. I have a big heart. I'm going to take care of people. I'm going to make sure that this country comes first.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We don't come first. We don't [Inaudible]. We take care of everyone else but our own, and that's going to change.
<Neil Cavuto> <Neutral> ...are you even considering this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've had so many people come to me and say, "You know, we just want a change. We want to see something different. We want spirit. We want to have a little spirit in the country." And I have really been a victim, in a positive sense, of the polls. The polls have been unbelievable, as you know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...you were just telling me about the ratings, and the ratings that I get, for whatever -- I don't know why, but I get ratings and polls and all of this. And the polls have come out, and as you know, they've been very, very strong. It shows that I would run better than any other candidate against the two major parties, by far, and other such things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...I get criticized because the "National Enquirer" actually came out with a poll that said I'd win, and everyone says, "Oh, it's terrible that you used the 'National Enquirer.'" The truth is, I mean, that's the people.
<Neil Cavuto> <Negative> Polls, as you know, that doesn't place you that high.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was interesting because "Newsweek" did a poll, and the poll -- I didn't like the poll that much, and yet they put me on their cover.
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ...they had one of their biggest sells, so...
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> Do you think your appeal is as much your controversy, as well, that in a way, say what you will, I mean, Donald Trump generates headlines. Donald Trump generates response. Donald Trump is going to be [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it certainly -- I guess I'm a little bit controversial. I don't know that I'm very controversial. I don't think I'm very controversial in business, but I'm very controversial in life.
<Neil Cavuto> <Neutral> ...is that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've never figured it out, but it's always been there, even at areas of my life when I didn't think I was controversial, I actually was quite controversial. So I've never really figure it out. Some day, if you do, would you please let me know?
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> Well, here's where the controversy, I think...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Neil Cavuto> <Negative> ...comes in, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Neil Cavuto> <Negative> Your personal life. You've made no secret of the fact that you like beautiful women. That's what a lot of people relate to, probably a lot of people -- and the -- but that can also come back to hurt you, can't it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it does. I think that -- I love women. I don't drink. I don't smoke. I never had drugs. I never had a cup of coffee. I never had a -- you know, literally never had a cigarette.
<Neil Cavuto> <Neutral> Ever, one drink?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Never had a drink. I've never had a cup of coffee.
<Neil Cavuto> <Neutral> White wine?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've never had white wine. I wouldn't know what it tastes like. So you know, I'm proud of that because I think alcohol is just the worst, and the worst in terms of what it does to people and what it does even to society. And for the lawyers watching, I'd love them to get out there and sue the hell off the alcohol companies because I think they've done actually more damage than the cigarette companies, and the cigarette companies have been terrible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So you know, it is interesting. There is controversy, but generally, it's positive controversy. But I've never made bones about it. I mean, the fact is I respect women incredibly, and I really do. I go out with women. But I'm a single guy. I mean, why shouldn't I go out with women?
<Neil Cavuto> <Neutral> ...right. Now, as you know, it's in the press everywhere, but your former wife, Marla Maples, has come out and said that she thinks it's her patriotic duty -- telling a British newspaper -- to let them know the real Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, there's not too many ex-wives that are in love with their husbands. Or maybe they are in love with their husbands. But certainly, they're not going to say that. And Marla is -- you know, it's just too bad. It's too bad, the venom that she's got. And I thought I was very nice to her. I've taken good care of her. But she's got a lot of venom, and it's too bad. And it's just not becoming of her, but I think she'll probably be more responsible.
<Neil Cavuto> <Negative> Now, her lawyers had argued that you had no right to withhold a payment to her.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...no. We have a confidentiality agreement, and I'm sure that she'll abide by it now. Maybe she didn't know it was there. And I'm sure...
<Neil Cavuto> <Neutral> What is the...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...the judge -- and the judge was...
<Neil Cavuto> <Neutral> What does that say?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...very strong, and the whole...
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> ...confidentiality agreement. What does it say?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, let me explain. The judge was very strong, and the whole group is very strong. I mean, you have a confidentiality -- you're not allowed to talk! And she goes out and says I wouldn't this, I wouldn't that. So I say why am I paying money to somebody that's violated an agreement? But we'll see what happens in the future. And if in the future she continues, I guess I'll have to take very strong measures.
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> Well, here's what I don't understand. She cannot reveal details of her marriage to you, right, but she can still talk about you...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there's a question...
<Neil Cavuto> <Neutral> ...can't she?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...about that. Not the way it's written, in my opinion. And she really can't. I mean, you know, look, you have a marriage. The - I guess the truth is that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. And she felt -- she feels this way.
<Neil Cavuto> <Negative> ...you didn't run into that fury with Ivana.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Ivana was very vicious in her own right, and you know, I went through court for years with Ivana, and I won. I won. But she was very vicious and...
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> ...relations are much better now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're better.
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're better. But you know, it's sort of interesting. When you have an ex, relations are never great. I mean, there's a reason that they're an ex, and relations are never great.
<Neil Cavuto> <Negative> ...do you feel that people seize on that? You know, we talked to Russ Verney, the chairman of the Reform Party, yesterday, Donald, and he leapt at that as a sign. "See? This is what you get if you get a Donald Trump."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's true, and you get a lot of other things. But there's certainly -- I mean, there was no lying, no this, no that. It was just I had a marriage that didn't work out. And you know, I have relationships that do work out. And in life, things work, and things don't work. But in this particular case, I had a marriage that didn't work out, and somebody violated the agreement. But despite that, I said, "Look, let's go and see." And I hope that she's going to honor the agreement now. And I really think...
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> By honoring the agreement, not talking about you, period?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think -- there's no reason to talk. I don't want an ex talking. I don't think it's fair to have that. I mean, whoever heard of such a thing? And to be honest, I think it's really in the best interests of Tiffany, which is very, very important.
<Neil Cavuto> <Neutral> Your daughter.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...to me. Yeah.
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> When it comes to the things that you really, really want to do, day one, President Trump takes office, what do you do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...one thing I'd want to do is energize and give spirit to the country because the country really has lost a lot of its spirit. This last four years has been a disaster with the Paula Jones and the Monica and the Linda Tripp. The worst of all, Linda Tripp. I mean, it's...
<Neil Cavuto> <Negative> ...don't like Linda Tripp. You keep...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...I don't...
<Neil Cavuto> <Negative> ...mentioning Linda Tripp.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't like her. I just...
<Neil Cavuto> <Neutral> What is it about her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I look at her. I don't know. There's something about her. She's the woman from hell, in my opinion, OK? There's something about her I just don't dig.
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> Well, do you think that's part and parcel of a whole Clinton...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It just happened.
<Neil Cavuto> <Neutral> ...experience?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. Where do these people come from? It's just terrible.
<Neil Cavuto> <Neutral> So the people you hang out with, Donald...
