<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald Trump joins us. Nice to talk to you, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hello, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, you practically barbecued the president. I didn't he even read the full tweet. This one got you going.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's one of the dumbest statements I have ever heard by a president. I don't mean just the president of this country. I have never heard a statement like that. I was watching and I heard it, and it was like I can't believe you said it. He just put a big target on Manhattan. I think it's one of the dumbest statements I have ever heard a president make.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know if this man knows what he is doing at all anymore. He was exhausted. He was tired. Looked like he was just exhausted. It was absolutely the dumbest -- I guess I have to say one but maybe I can say the single dumbest statement I have ever heard a president make.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. You talked about being exhausted and tweeted about him being exhausted saying President Obama looks absolutely exhausted in Netherlands. He is not a natural leader. He was never meant to lead. It is tough work for him. You go deeper with him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He is not a natural leader. It is very hard for him to lead. He never did it before in his life, and it is very hard for him to lead. But when he talks about nuclear weapons going off in Manhattan where you have millions and millions of people -- I mean, what you are doing is saying this is a target, do it here.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's so incredible that a president would make a statement like that. I'm not the only one that feels that way, by the way. There are many people. They couldn't believe he said it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You know what I thought when I heard it? I took it a little differently. I thought OK, New York is safe because now all the terrorists are going to know that New York has got like triple, quadruple security. They are going to pick another big estimate in the country. They're gonna pick another big city. I actually saw this the other way around.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I felt just the opposite. I think most people agree with me. I mean, I don't disagree with you much, but I certainly disagree with you. It shouldn't have been mentioned. It's called out of sight, out of mind. It shouldn't have been mentioned. What does he have to bring that up for?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Earlier today, you tweeted something I thought is this a sign that Donald Trump is thinking of running? Is this a tease? You tweeted if you look over the years, I have been right on virtually every issue of Iraq not going in but taking the oil to jobs to China. OK. No one is accusing not having confidence after that tweet but is that a hint?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, I have been right about things. I have been right about almost everything. I have been speaking to you for years. Look at China, the other day they just devalued their currency again. They wouldn't have even done that a year ago -- a year and a half ago. They devalued substantially their currency which is devastating for our country.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, I would say we are going to look and see what happens in '14. I think the republicans are going to have a huge victory because Obamacare is a total disaster, that's hurting a lot of people. I think the republicans are going to pick up a lot of senate seats. After that come January something, where a lot of people are going to make decisions. [End Video Clip]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm certainly looking at it and I will make a decision.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> The Donald has much more to say.
