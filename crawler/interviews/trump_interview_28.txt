<Michelli Martin> <Positive> First of all, welcome to our state.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Great state.
<Michelli Martin> <Positive> Great state.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It is a great state.
<Michelli Martin> <Positive> All right, you understand Eddie Rispone have had a lot of success in South Louisiana --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Michelli Martin> <Neutral> -- with voters turning out for him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Michelli Martin> <Positive> Here at the top of the state, a lot of people backing Governor John Bel Edwards and also Congressman Ralph Abraham. How do you get those the backers of Dr. Abraham to fall in line behind Rispone, especially given the contentious primary race?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it was a tough race. It was a very close race, and Ralph is a very good friend of mine. In fact, he flew down with me, and Ralph Abraham is a special man. He's strongly behind Eddie, and I'm going to introduce Ralph tonight -- a little surprise, but I'm gonna introduce Ralph tonight. But he wants Eddie Rispone to win, and I want him to win, and your insurance is way too high, your taxes are way too high.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Your crime rate, your murder rate is number one in the whole country. I mean, believe it or not, who would even think that? And economic development, as is good, as it is, it could be much better. So, Eddie Rispone is a winner, and John Bel Edwards has not been a good Governor.
<Michelli Martin> <Negative> Speaking of economic development, we're looking at 2015, when John Bel Edwards took office, he inherited a $2 billion deficit. Now, we're looking at a moderate surplus. How would that look underneath Republican leadership at the state level? How does that improve upon that surplus?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I mean, honestly, over the last two years, a lot of the states have developed tremendous surpluses, and, you know, they're developing very much, and you're rated almost at the bottom of the pack for economic development, and we have to change that. I just opened up the big LNG plant. You know that -- a big, a $10 billion plant, and despite all of that, and we're approving other ones, and other things on the federal basis.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But if you had Eddie Rispone as governor, Republican, you just do much better, much, much, better. But remember this: your car insurance, you know, everyone talks about different things, but over here in Louisiana, car insurance is a disaster, and we'll get the car insurance way down.
<Michelli Martin> <Positive> Going back to John Bel Edwards. He's always said that he supported the office of the President, especially since taking office, and, I mean, he's described himself as pro-life pro-Second Amendment, pro-military. In your last rally in Monroe, Louisiana, you refer to him as a radical liberal. Can you tell Abraham supporters and voters out there why he is a radical liberal?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sure, I'll tell you exactly, because he never votes with us. You know, they have a lot of people, especially in a state that I won by a lot -- I won Louisiana by a lot, and when you hear people talking, they sound like Republicans, but they're not, because they never vote with us. So they may like me, or at least say they like me, which they probably don't. But you never see them vote with us, you know, whether it's the Second amendment, which is under siege, as you know, and other things, they're not going to vote for us. I have many, many cases where we have Democrats that pretend they're Republicans.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The problem is -- and they talk good, but they never vote with us, and we need the votes, more important than the talk.
<Michelli Martin> <Negative> Going to the news of the day, a sad day in California. Santa Clarita. A gunman going into a school. At least three people are dead. We see this headline a lot in schools and retail establishments. How do you look at the American people and let them know that you can send your kids to school, and know that they're going to be safe.
<Michelli Martin> <Positive> You can go shopping, and know you're going to be safe. What can you say to them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a tremendous problem, and it's elsewhere too, but it's a tremendous problem, and it is a very big mental health problem. We always have to protect our Second amendment. You understand that. But, if you look at what's going on with the Democrats, they don't think --they're not doing anything. They're not doing the USMCA, which is the big trade deal between Mexico, Canada, and the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're not doing anything. All they do is the impeachment nonsense, and everyone knows it's nonsense, and it's even polling like it's nonsense, and they got blown away yesterday, and that's all they think about. It's so bad for our country. So, when we talk about having meetings on gun violence, or anything else, they're not there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They -- they are doing nothing. It was a big story in The Wall Street Journal today, about Nancy Pelosi. She's getting nothing done as speaker.
<Michelli Martin> <Neutral> All right. We're going to end this on the lightest note possible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Michelli Martin> <Positive> All right. I'm going to act like I know a lot about football.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is going to be the toughest one.
<Michelli Martin> <Positive> It is going to be the toughest one. Okay, so this past weekend, you went to the LSU-'Bama game.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I did.
<Michelli Martin> <Positive> It's a historic rivalry -- rivalry. What was your takeaway? What was the best thing about that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I thought it was a great game. It was -- looked like a blowout, and then LSU, sort of, started to lose it a little bit, and then they got back, you know, in the end, when it counted, they came back. I think you have a great quarterback, and I think you have a great team, and you're rated number one right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, maybe, I was lucky for Louisiana. But you're rated number one of the country right now. Alabama's a great team, always a great team. But LSU took the game, and -- and your quarterback is fantastic, and some other players are fantastic. But, he seems to be a real standout. He'll be, I think he's gonna be tremendous in the NFL.
<Michelli Martin> <Positive> Thank you so much for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Michelli Martin> <Positive> It's a pleasure to meet you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great to meet you. Great job.
<Michelli Martin> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Positive> This is your first Spanish language network interview. Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I think it could very well be. Come to think of it.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Positive> Finally.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's good. That's good.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> You just launched your re-election campaign in front of 20,000 people in Florida. It's going to be a tough fight?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think so. I mean we're -- we're winning everywhere that we see. And we see a lot of fake polls put out by people that put the same polls out four years ago. I think that when you look at the enthusiasm in Orlando last night, you look at Florida, you look at what's going on. We had at least 20,000 in that arena last night.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we sent away thousands and thousands. We had 120,000 requests. No, I think we're doing great. I think we're doing really well in Florida and Ohio. Pennsylvania, I think we're doing very well. I won Pennsylvania last time, first one to win as a Republican in many years. And we brought back a lot of business.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Pennsylvania's having the best year they've ever had as a state. Michigan's having the best year they've ever had as a state. I don't know, I mean, I should do well.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> You've also been very tough on immigrants and just this week the tweet --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When you say that, you mean illegal immigrants?
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> Immigrants who cross --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because I've been very good to immigrants, but illegal immigrants.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> Immigrants across the border, including those who come asking for asylum, for example.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> This tweet that you did this week. Next week, ICE will begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right. And you know many of them are from China many, of them from other parts of the world that you wouldn't even believe. And our laws are so bad. Congress has done nothing about our laws and fixing our immigration laws. They're so bad. The asylum laws are laughed at by everybody in the world that knows anything about it.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Positive> I want to talk to you about the immigrants themselves.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> You've been very tough on them. One of the things that you did was --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And you know my poll numbers with Hispanics? Went up 17 points.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well OK explain that. I've been tough.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> You've been tough but --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And yet my poll numbers with Hispanics have gone way up.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Positive> But the fact is that there is a percentage of Lati -- Latinos the vote of that, no doubt, there is up to 30 percent of the Latino population who have supported you among the voters.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right now it's 50 percent.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Positive> That would make a 70 percent. But let's talk about the --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know but for a Republican, I'm at 50 percent. I went up 70 points. You know why? The Hispanics --
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> I have not seen any poll that says --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we'll show it to you.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Positive> With all due respect.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We'll show it to you.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Positive> -- that you have 50 percent of Latino support.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, we'll show it to you. But let me do it. We went up 17 points, you saw that. I went up 17 points because I'm tough at the border. Because the Hispanics want toughness at the border. They don't want people coming and taking their jobs. They don't want criminals to come because they understand the border better than anybody.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> I understand. So the zero tolerance policy, was that a mistake?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not a mistake. We want to have strong borders. It's not a mistake. But let me just explain something --
<José Díaz-Balart> <Positive> Zero tolerance is a separation of children from parents and border.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, let me explain.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> Thousands and thousands of children separated --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, when I became president, President Obama had a separation policy. I didn't have it, he had it. I brought the families together. I'm the one that put them together. Now, I said something when I did that. Watch. Many more people will come up and that's what happened. But President Obama is the one that built those prisons cells.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Positive> I understand. Twenty-eight hundred, twenty-eight hundred children reunited with their parents in the last year. We don't even know, the government doesn't even know how many children are still not with their parents. They don't know, which I find incredible. My question --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ready? Are you ready? Under the Obama plan --
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> Sir, we're talking about your plan
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No we're not. Because I'm the one that put people together. They separated, I put them together.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Positive> You did not. Twenty eight hundred children were reunited with their parents in this last year after the zero tolerance policy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Excuse me. Because I put em together.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> There's thousands of them.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's because I put them together. Under Obama, you had separation --
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> Under court order, I may add, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I put them together. I'm the one that changed the plan. I inherited separation and I changed the plan and I brought people together. Now when I did that I said watch what happens. More people are going to come up because when you put the parents together with the children when you don't separate. And that's exactly what happened.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I hated to have the separation policy and the prisoners that you saw they called them --
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> Was zero tolerance mistake?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well it was zero tolerance means to me is going to be tough on the border.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> That includes separating parents from children if that's what it takes?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no. I put them together. Just remember that, I put them together.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Positive> Another thing, Mr. President, you said, I remember clearly, you said you spoke directly to the dreamers you said the dreamers will be treated with heart. What happened to that heart? The first thing you do is you try -- you essentially turn back DACA as an executive order.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Ready?
<José Díaz-Balart> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Democrats don't want to make a deal. It's not an executive order, you know, where the Supreme Court right now would be going to be before the United States Supreme Court, sir. And the judges, the justices are going to make a decision. I would have made a decision earlier than that. I can't get Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer to do anything for the dreamers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They will do nothing for the dreamers. They don't care about the dreamers.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> You revoked DACA.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me tell you what I did. I revoked it because everybody said that Obama had no right to do it. But I didn't revoke it quickly. I said let's make a deal. They were unable to make a deal. So now, it's sitting before the United States Supreme Court. I am willing to do something with the dreamers as you call DACA.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, there are different meanings when you say dreamers and DACA there were really a different -- but let's for purposes of this let's call it the same thing call them the dreamers. But that's very much different than DACA. Are you ready? I am willing to make a deal. I always happen. But Pelosi and Schumer don't want to make a deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They don't want to make a deal.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> You also revoked CPS for 200,000 Salvadorans and Haitians, Sudan and Nicaraguans.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We are doing something --
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> People who registered, who participate and work here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And their time came up and now somebody has to make a decision as to whether or not they're going to stay in the country. And I haven't made that decision yet. But we're going to take a look at it. By the way,, somebody has to make that decision. You know, they're supposed to leave --
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> Do you have something against immigrants?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love immigrants. I love immigrants. This country is based on immigrants. Our country is based on immigrants and without it -- In fact I'll tell you, I want people to come in. I have brought so much industry into the country. We have 17 car plants under construction, we have Foxconn coming in to Wisconsin.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have all these massive companies. You know we're doing incredibly well, 3.5 percent unemployment. By the way, lowest Hispanic unemployment rate in the history of our country. Lowest Asian, lowest African-American also. But we have the lowest Hispanic unemployment rate in the history of our country. Hispanics today are --have the average net wealth, the wealthiest they've ever been under Trump not under Obama because under Obama they were going the wrong way.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> Let's talk about another subject that is very recently dealt with, Mexico. Do you consider Mexico an ally or an adversary a friend or a foe.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well this week I consider them a friend. They've been doing a great job, actually. They -- we signed an agreement last week. They have 6,000 people going to their southern border troops and they are doing a really good job. I mean, so far, they've been doing a real good job.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> Is this a week by week [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, they can easily stop if they want to. They can easily stop this tremendous migration to the United States and then we have all these -- the illegals coming in. It's no good. Mexico has been great for the last week and a half. Now, I signed the agreement a week and a half ago but they've been great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They've honored the agreement. They would -- if they weren't great, I would put tariffs on.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> Do you plan to meet with President Lopez Obrador?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I would. I like him. I do. I like him
<José Díaz-Balart> <Positive> You like him. After this agreement, which I think, everybody says, you won the negotiations with Mexico.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think I won it. No, no. Mexico didn't need millions of people pouring through the middle of their country. OK. I think we both won.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Positive> But they have a migration policy which may be different than the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Maybe it's different but they have very strong immigration lawyers, we don't. They will stop them and they can stop them before they ever get to the border.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Positive> So, is Mexico now doing the United States bidding in southern border [Inaudible] --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So far it looks like it is Mexico's doing a great job for Mexico and for the United States. So far, but it's only a week and a half.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> So you don't think, I mean, are you asking Mexico in effect to patrol the southern border to do the American -- the U.S. dirty work.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no, no, no.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> To not let --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not the U.S. airway, to do Mexico's work. People shouldn't be allowed to walk through Mexico into our country. They're not supposed to be in Mexico either. So Mexico is removing those people and they're bringing them back to Honduras and different places Guatemala, El Salvador. They're bringing them back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And so far they've been doing great. And that's why I'm not doing tariffs, otherwise I would do tariffs, and I don't want to do tariffs to Mexico but it would be tremendously costly for me. I don't even know if would be affordable for Mexico.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> And next week or the first Democratic --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> -- debates.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Positive> Ten for two nights, by the way, I invite you to watch it on Telemundo.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Maybe I'll do that.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> What -- who would you prefer as an adversary.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I really -- you know, I've been asked that question, honestly, you never know, you never know. I could comment on different ones but I won't bother too much. I think it's a little bit -- Bernie. Bernie looks like he's had it. Bernie looks crazy but he always did. But it looks like a tired crazy right now and Joe Biden, he looks like he's just exhausted.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know what happened to him but he is exhausted and he doesn't do any work. He's not working. One thing I found out about this job to do it right and I've done it right. You have to work hard. No president in two and a half years has ever done what we've done in terms of tax cuts, in terms of regulation in terms of Second Amendment, in terms of so many different things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's never been anything like it and that's OK. You know what we've done with the vets with choice. They couldn't get choice. They couldn't get accountability and we've got these things passed that have been passed for 45 years.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> A Quinnipiac poll in Florida says that Sanders, Biden, Warren, Buttigieg, right now would beat you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know but Buttigieg, you do believe that? Really? Do you believe it? They also had me losing Texas to Pocahontas. I'm not losing Texas to anybody. We have a tremendous lead in Texas. We have a tremendous lead in Florida. Quinnipiac, I don't respect that poll. They've been calling me wrong for a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, they've been calling me terribly wrong and now I will say I have a good poll with Rasmussen, where I'm at 51 percent and you have to understand I'm at 51 percent. But I've been hit for two and a half years, since I became president, by the fake news and by this nonsense with the Mueller Report, where I win the Mueller report and now they want to do a do over.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know they want to do it again. Let's do it again. It was no good didn't turn out good for them. So they said, "Let's do it again.". But as you know, and you will admit, for two and a half years they've been doing nothing but hitting me and they still are, I'm at 51 percent and I'm winning most of the states that we poll, where we have actual real pollers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Most of the state, not democratic inclined pollers or polls that were bad last time. You know, when I look at some of the polls from my race against crooked Hillary Clinton. OK. And I look at those polls, they were just like this, they were worse far worse. I was going to lose to her a week before the election according to the Washington Post ABC.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was going to lose by at least 12 to 14 points and then we sent a letter of complaint and the next week they changed the poll. That was the day of the election. They changed the poll and it was like even, I said, "How do we go from 12 to 14 points. We sent a legal letter to them and we're even and then we won the election.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Positive> Do you -- is it something that you're basing on your gut, on the polling, internet polling, what do you base this on? Well it's based on a lot of things, I based it on crowd enthusiasm. Look at the crowd last night, that arena is going to have 20,000 seats, it was packed. We sent away thousands of people, many thousands, but we had 120,000 requests.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> We would tell people, "Please, don't come." Now, when Biden goes out as an example we can't get 100 people to fill a little tiny gymnasium. They end up doing a roundtable because it looks so bad. They do a roundtable he walks in, they end up on a roundtable. I think we're doing great.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Positive> Are you -- are you are you looking for the Latino vote. I mean, you're the largest minority in the country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely and I did well in it last time and surprisingly and I think I'm going to do much better this time.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> Why do you think that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because I've been very tough on Cuba, I love the Cuban people from Miami and elsewhere. I've been very, very tough on Cuba. Nobody's been like me on Cuba and we're going to get Cuba worked out properly not the way Obama did it, which was a disaster, which I revoked, but we're going to get Cuba taken care of. Venezuela, who's gonna be tougher than -- than I am.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> What has happened in Venezuela? You recognized Juan Guaidó? In February you said Democracy is on the rise and yet nothing's changed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well you said process, OK, I mean, it's a process. It's terrible Venezuela, where people are starving. This was one of the wealthiest countries and now people are starving, they have no water they have no nothing. We've been very, very tough. Some people say we've been too tough, I say we haven't been tough enough.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I love the Venezuelan people. We're sitting in Dora, this is called Venezuela, a little Venezuela, this area. It's the best area. If a house is for sale around Doral, if it doesn't sell within a week they say there's something wrong. OK. This is a very successful area. The people of Venezuela are a great people but they've been decimated by these two characters that have been so horrible over the years.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> Are you visiting -- are you planning to visit any Latin-American countries, sir?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will. I just, as you know, I have a very good relationship in Argentina. We have a very good relationship in Colombia with the new president, who's doing, I hear, a very good job. I would like to say we're going to soon have a very good relationship with the people in Venezuela. We have to help those people, those people are starving.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have no water. It's run by a dictator. It's a horrible thing going on and if you look at what's going on in Venezuela, it's horrible. And you know who's causing the problem? Largely, Cuba. They've got 25,000 troops, and Cuba does, and we're putting sanctions in Cuba. And I just stopped the cruise ships from going to Cuba.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And Cuba has got to straighten out and I will tell you, I don't even know politically is that good or bad, but the people in Miami, they gave me the Bay of Pigs award just before the election because they loved the job I'm doing with respect to Cuba. The Cubans gave me the Bay of Pigs, did you know that?
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> I did. The -- back to the situation on the economy. And you did bring out the headlines of what unemployment is among the different communities. There are however in those communities people that don't see for example -- for example standards of living going up. Senator Sanders and others say it's time to have a national 15-dollar-an-hour minimum wage, is it time to do that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I've already created a minimum wage because wages have gone up more than anybody in many decades.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> But what about $15 an hour?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me. Wages have gone up more than 3 percent. It's more than the number. The people that I'm dealing with and the people that -- and if you look at the reports, that's a very low number, the $15. And I am actually looking at that but looking at the pie I am I am looking at that.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> You are. You are looking at the possibility.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am looking at that, I will say this. But beyond that, because that's just an artificial number, much more important because I'd like to get people higher than that. Wages have gone up tremendously in the United States since I've taken over. In fact, soon to be record numbers.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Positive> So I have to wrap it up and I have a few more questions if you'd be so kind, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> What would you say -- just thinking out loud of the two biggest mistakes you've made as president.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well a couple of appointments I would have not appointed a couple of people in my life would have been much simpler life, so I could say that but without getting personal, I'll hold that for a later date.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> You can do it now, I don't have a problem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know, I know, I appreciate that. I think my biggest mistakes was I put a couple of people in that I shouldn't have put it.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> Any regrets?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have no regrets. You know, I've done a great job. I've done more than any president in the history of our country in the first two and a half years. I've gotten -- I've taken care of our vets. I've taken care of our military, we've rebuilt our military. This year will be the final year, we are rebuilding our tanks our planes, you have to see.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We had planes that didn't fly. We had planes where they had to go to the desert, they call it the graveyard to get parts. You take a look at what I've done with the Right To Try. Take a look at what I've done with Choice for the vets. Take a look at all of the things -- and accountability for the vets. Nobody's ever, ever thought it was possible to get veterans choice, that's where veterans if they have to wait can go out and see a doctor.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> In one word how would you define your presidency?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well you can't do it in one word. I mean, I can give you a nice beautiful word. I can talk about -- I can say excellence, OK. Excellence and then I leave the interview. But you can't do it in one word. Look, I've worked hard, I've been battling a deep state that is disgraceful. Phony -- phony allegations and the other side is guilty, I mean, actually, when the other side is guilty and despite the whole witch hunt thing, which is now coming to an end, the Mueller report turned out really good.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Of course, they don't accept it still, you know, they want to keep going because they have nothing else to do and that's the problem the Democrats are not getting anything done in Congress, and it's very bad. They have an opportunity to do drug-price lowering. They have an opportunity to do infrastructure, so many different things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> they have an opportunity to solve the problem on the border because we wouldn't need Mexico if they do a couple of things with loopholes and with asylum. But I do respect Mexico, and I want to thank the president and everybody because it's only a week and a half but there's been a tremendous difference on the border.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> It's gonna be a tough race. What is the first lady tell you about running for re-election?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well she was fine with it. She's been a great first lady. They really like her. They really like Melania. You have to see, last night you saw that she walked out she's got a tremendous hand and the people like Melania, she's she's a very good person, she's worked very hard in the opioid problem. That's something that she really took to heart and we've knocked it down about 17 percent in a year and a half, we've knocked it down by being very tough on doctors and medical.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> Going back to the Latino vote. Granted a percentage definitely supports you but there are some who fear, who fear your rhetoric, who fear what's been going on in the border, who fear that you have said that you will be deporting millions of people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They want me to do it.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> Mr. President, they do not.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They do.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> They do not.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're ready? They don't want to lose their jobs. They want to keep their salaries, their wages up, and they don't want crime. When people come through, you have MS-13 coming through.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> That's not the majority, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it's a lot of people
<José Díaz-Balart> <Neutral> It may be some.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If it was one in a hundred it's still many.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> If it was one of the mothers that are coming with their children aren't MS-13. The people who were raped raped in their town and have to leave aren't MS-13.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I agree, but if it's one in a hundred it's too many. And we're taking them out of our country by the thousands and the Hispanics see that their communities that -- that these people these -- these horrible people MSO team and other gang members are being removed from our country.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> Those people are the first ones, they want the MS-13 removed but they do not want to see families separated at the border, they don't want to see [Inaudible]. They don't to see children in cages.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Ready? Obama built the cages. I didn't build them. Obama built the cages, that's No. 1. Obama separated, I'm the one that did a presidential order bringing the parents together. That's a big [Inaudible].
<José Díaz-Balart> <Negative> Mr. President, we've talked about so many subjects, right? I mean, immigration, we've talked about foreign affairs we've talked about the economy. Do you sleep well?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't have much time to sleep. Fortunately, I've never been a big sleeper in terms of hours but I sleep fine. I mean I sleep very good.
<José Díaz-Balart> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
<Ashley Strohmier> <Positive> What importance does your administration place on the U.S. Senate race between Hawley and McCaskill?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm just a big fan of Josh Hawley. I've known him. I've seen him. He loves the people of the state. He wants everything to come back to the state, and he's done a fantastic job and he's run a great campaign. And I can also tell you on the other side, Claire McCaskill has been a disaster for her. She never votes for her. She didn't vote for Justice Kavanaugh, Justice Gorsuch, these are two great people, great intellects for the Supreme Court.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's just going against us. It's very interesting, she's always against me on the border, except today, she said he's right. First time I've heard this she's always been fighting us on the border. She's been fighting the tax cuts very vociferously. She wants to raise taxes, and Josh Hawley is just going to be outstanding. So, we hope people go out and vote for him. He'll -- he'll do a fantastic job.
<Ashley Strohmier> <Negative> And Mr. President, what is the most critical issue facing the country right now, and will be for the duration of your term in office?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think we have a lot of issues, but immigration, you see, that seems to have come up to the forefront. You see what's going on at the border, with the caravan as they call it, with thousands of people think they're going to march into the country, and it's not going to happen. We don't know who they are, where they come from. We don't know anything about them, and we're not going to let it happen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So immigration certainly. And the other one is health care, to me, is very important. And we've done a great job. We got rid of the individual mandate, which was a killer, and people -- that was really the worst part of anything, in terms of health care. Nobody's ever seen anything like it, where you pay for the privilege of not having to pay for bad healthcare. So, we've we've done a real job on healthcare.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think right now if you look, immigration is so important, because we need borders. We have to have a country. Without borders, you don't have a country.
<Ashley Strohmier> <Positive> And Mr. President, this is the final question, and you actually kind of touched on it already. As President, you've recently sent troops to the border to counter the migrant caravan headed from Central America. How much is this going to cost, and why is this money well spent?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the good news is that we already pay them, whether they are on the border or someplace else. You know, the fact is, they're being paid, and it's our great military, and we have -- we can't take any chances.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You saw what happened in Mexico, where they came through the troops, and they hurt the troops. Tough people. They hurt the troops. They were throwing rocks at 'em. They were doing a lot of things, and they burst through the police and the troops in Mexico. That's not happening here. So, we need it. We have to have it. We need our borders, and they're going to do a fantastic job. I have no doubt about it.
<Ashley Strohmier> <Positive> Thank you so much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Ashey Strohmier> <Positive> Thank you.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> And we are joined now by Time's Person of the Year, President- elect Donald Trump. Mister Trump, good morning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Last year when Time did not choose you as person of the year and chose Angela Merkel, you said Time magazine will never pick me as Person of the Year. They proved you wrong. How do you feel about this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's a great honor. It means a lot, especially me growing up reading Time magazine. And, you know it's a very important magazine. And I've been lucky enough to be on the cover many times this year.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So -- and last year. But I consider this a very, very great honor.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Well, I'm -- I'm interested to hear you say that because as Nancy Gibbs has said it this year and in the past, the magazine has always been willing to say it was a person who influenced events for better or for worse. So just confirming, you see this as a compliment, not some kind of condemnation?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, as an example, when you say divided states of America, I didn't divide them, they're divided now. I mean there's a lot of division. And we're going to put it back together and we're going to have a country that's very well healed and we're going to be a great economic force and we're going to build up our military and safety and we're going to do a lot of great things. And it's going to be something very special.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But to be on the cover of Time magazine as the Person of the Year is a tremendous honor.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> You are now thirty days into your transition. You've made a lot of news. Last night you made it official that General Mattis is your choice of secretary of defense. Still open is secretary of state, probably the premiere position in any administration.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> How close are you to making that call?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think certainly close. I think next week will be the time that I announce it. And I've some other big announcements coming up today and actually tomorrow, but we've had -- we've been met with, you know, really very good reviews of the people that I've chosen. I think -- I think that General Mattis is going to be terrific.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's going to be absolutely terrific. It's a little bit outside the box. He's a tough cookie. We need a tough cookie.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's smart, he's brilliant actually, and as a tactician he's brilliant. And I really look forward to him. He's also a very high-quality man. I flew with him last night to North Carolina where we really introduced him in front of a tremendous crowd.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I tell you, the crowd loves him.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Let me go back to Secretary of State for a second. I want to read off some of the names it's been reported you're considering for that position -- Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani, David Petraeus, Bob Corker and Ambassador John Bolton. Have you now crossed any of those names off your list?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I have in my own mind. I don't want to say which ones. But I think I have in my own minds and there's some other. We have a great, great gentleman, the head, the boss over at -- over at Exxon and, you know, he's ...
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Rex Tillerson.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...he's built a tremendous company over a period of years with great style.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Let me go back to Mitt Romney. Is he still under consideration?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, he is.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Does he have a chance to become secretary of state?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, he does. I mean I've -- I've spoken to him a lot. And we've come a long way together. We had some tremendous difficulty together and now I think we've come a long way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But the answer is, yes, he does.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> So this isn't about some case of stringing him along as -- as revenge being a dish best served cold for the comments he made during the campaign?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, it's not about revenge. It's about what's good for the country. And I'm able to put this stuff behind us. And I hit him very hard also, you know, which is very nice that the press doesn't cover that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm very happy about that actually.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> You picked a fight twenty-four hours ago with Boeing about the new Air Force One project and the cost of that project, which you cited at over four billion dollars. And you went on to say this, "I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number."" Now I read that as -- as you saying that you think Boeing is perhaps taking advantage of the American taxpayer. Do you have any proof of that?"
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think the planes are too expensive. I spoke to a very good man yesterday, the head of Boeing, terrific guy, and we're going to work it out. But, you know, that's what I'm here for. I'm going to negotiate prices and its planes are -- are too expensive.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we're going to get the prices down. And if we don't get the prices down, we're not going to order them. We're going to stay with what we have.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> You mentioned the head of -- of Boeing that you spoke to. Your comments about Boeing -- by the way, shortly after you made those comments, the market value of Boeing dropped about a billion dollars in a matter of minutes before rebounding later in the day. But your comments on Boeing came just a short while after an article came out where the CEO of Boeing was critical of your trade policies. So was this in the end about the price of those planes or was this about retribution?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, only the planes because I didn't see an article where he was critical of trade policies. And my trade policies are going to be terrific. And by the way, we're lowering taxes in this country. We're getting rid of ninety percent, maybe eighty-five percent of the regulations which are stifling business.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Boeing is going to be a tremendous beneficiary of that and maybe even mostly regulations. I mean people are more happy about the regulations even though we're massively cutting taxes from business.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> After you -- after you criticized Boeing, The Washington Post has a headline today saying corporations are unnerved in this country. Let me go on to another subject.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I -- I think it's just ...
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...I think that's just The Washington Post because no matter what you do, they'll never say good. And what happens is they're so unnerved that the stock market is seated all-time records since I've been elected. And since I've been -- since I won the nomination, number one, we did well. And after I won the election, you see what happened.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, in the history of our country, there's never been an up this big after an election. So I don't know how somebody said this -- you know -- people are unnerved. It's just the opposite. And frankly, I think we're going to go up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have tremendous room, tremendous margin in our country, but we have to do things right. And I believe in free trade but I don't believe in stupid trade. And stupid trade is when our companies all move out of our country, fire their workers and then come back in, Matt, and sell their product back in with no retribution. I'm just saying very simply if they want to fire their workers, move to Mexico or some other country and sell their product into our country, they're going to be paying a tax.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Your transition team made some news yesterday on a conference call where -- where it was announced, and I want to get your take on this, that you sold all of your stock holdings and you did it back in June. Is it true and why are we just hearing about this now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I've never been a big person for the stock market, frankly. But over the years I bought stock. And I bought them when they were low. I saw what was going on with interest rates were so low, it almost seemed that it was like very easy to predict what was going to happen with the stock market.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Why did you sell all your holdings in June?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because I felt that I was very much going to be winning and I think I would have a tremendous -- a really -- conflict of interest owning all of these different companies.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> So why not announce it back in June when you were under fire for a lack of financial transparency?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I let everybody know. I let everybody know. And I'm not -- I was never a big stockholder but I bought a lot of different stocks. And I had a lot of stocks before then too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And what I did is I sold them. I just don't -- I don't think it's appropriate for me to be owning stocks when I'm making deals for this country that maybe will affect one company positively and one company negatively.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Speaking of ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just felt it was a conflict.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> ...speaking of things that are appropriate, shortly after winning the election you gave an interview and you talked about your use of Twitter and you said that you were going to be much more restrained as the President because you seemed to understand that perhaps having fights on Twitter would not be appropriate for the President. I have not seen you backing off fights on Twitter. In the time since you were elected, you've targeted the cast of Hamilton, the New York Times, China, Boeing, the media and SNL. Is this proving to be a habit that you're finding a difficult time breaking?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think I am very restrained. And I talk about important things. I talked about, you know, as you know recently China and the fact we talked about their devaluation. We talked about their building this massive military fortress in the middle of the South China Sea, which they're not supposed to be doing and other things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And frankly, it's a modern-day form of communication between ...
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Even when you're picking fights with it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...Facebook, Matt, between Facebook and Twitter, I have, I guess, more than forty million people and that's a modern-day form of communication. I get it out much faster than a press release. I get it out much more honestly than dealing with dishonest reporters because ...
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> On that -- on that subject ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...so many reporters are dishonest.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> ...on that subject but on a lighter note, can we agree, President-elect Trump, that at this stage it would be better for you to simply stop watching SNL as opposed to watching it and then complaining about it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I hosted SNL when it was a good show, but it's not a good show anymore. First of all, nothing to do with me, there's nothing funny about it, the skits are terrible.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> So why do you keep watching it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, I like -- I like Alec, but his imitation of me is really mean-spirited and not very good. I don't think it's good. And I do like him and I like him as an actor, but I don't think that his imitation of me gets me at all and it's meant to be very mean-spirited, which is very biased. And I don't like it so I can tweet that out.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> But you can't -- you can't bring yourself to stop watching it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. Look, frankly, the way the show is going now and you look at the kind of work they're doing, who knows how long that show is going to be on. It's a terrible show.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> I think it's going to do okay. Let me end where we started, Time magazine. I mentioned to you that it says Person of the Year, it's got your picture, and then the subheadline is President of the Divided States of America. You referenced that a little while ago.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> What would you have written as the subheadline?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think putting divided is snarky. But again, it's divided. I -- I'm not President yet so I didn't do anything to divide. And I will say this, I've now gotten to know President Obama.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I really like him. We have -- I think I can say at least for myself, I can't speak for him, but we have a really good chemistry together, we talk. He -- he loves the country. He wants to do right by the country and for the country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I will tell you, we obviously very much disagree on certain policies and certain things. But, you know, I really like him as a person. And -- and by the way ...
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> I was fascinated to read in your interview that you say you actually talked to President Obama about some of your possible appointments.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> And the people you would surround yourself in the White House.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Can you tell me specifically who you mentioned to President Obama that you're considering appointing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't think that would be fair to him but I have asked him what he would think of this one and that one. I've asked him what he thinks are the biggest problems of the country, what are some of the greatest assets going forward. And we have a very good dialogue. And -- and I must tell you, you know, I never met him before this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I never spoke to him before this. I really -- I do like him. I love getting his ideas. And I may differ in many cases, I differ very greatly.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Right. Just so quickly though ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In many cases I'm the opposite.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> ...in one of those cases where you went with him -- went to him with a specific person you had in mind for an appointment, did you go with his recommendation?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would say that, yes, I take his recommendations very seriously and there are some people that I will be appointing and in one case have appointed where he thought very highly of that person, yes.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> President-elect Donald Trump, Time magazine's Person of the Year. Congratulations.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Matt.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> All right. We're back with more of Today on a Wednesday morning right after these messages.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Donald Trump is on our phone. Haven't spoken with Donald Trump in a while, good friend of the show. The guy's always out there doing things, making -- but you've got book now. Hey!
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And he's got a book.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hello, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How are you?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How are you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> My man, I miss you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, man. What's happening?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I miss you. It's been too long.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Obviously, you're working too hard.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm working. I'm working, but I miss you guys. And I listen, too, believe me. I listen, but I am -- I'm working harder than ever. I don't know, a bit smarter, though. Probably not. When are you going to slow down, I mean, and smell the coffee? Or...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I can't do it, Howard. It's my view, I can't do it. I want to do it, but I just can't seem to do that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Can't get around here.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What are you working so hard on?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nothing. Then you die and...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Tell me. I mean, what are you working on? I mean, what do you do? The buildings?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Buildings all over -- I'm doing buildings all over the world.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He's got to keep those kids employed now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But at some point, I would kind of be like, you know I got a couple of billion. Why would I give a shit about buildings?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I just read that he's now put out Trump Vodka.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right. I have Trump Vodka...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And you don't drink?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right, a minor little detail. Howard, it is a minor detail. So why do you always have to bring it up?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you hear Donny Deutsch's interview with Mark Cuban yesterday?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Mark Cuban's [Inaudible]. You know, Mark Cuban, put on a television show that was so bad that it was such an embarrassment to ABC. And then ultimately, you know, [Inaudible] flies as you know and he tried to copy The Apprentice. This guy is such a loser and he lives in one of my buildings, you know? In other words he needs an apartment so he buys an apartment in one of my buildings.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, Mark's...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Here's a guy, spends a fortune on a basketball team, tries to buy the best players. He goes to the finals. Hasn't made -- hasn't won. Nobody could have lost, and he found a way to lose. He'll never win it. So you know -- yes, I did hear it and the guy did, too.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I did, too. What did you say, Mark?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I just said, Trump...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Trump puts out too many products with his name on it and he's abusing his own brand. And blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But I mean...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Except everything sells, you know. That's the one thing he doesn't understand because his stuff doesn't sell. Now, I know Mark very well. I mean, Mark is a guy who tries so hard and just doesn't have it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why did you...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you like The Neanderthal, that's Mark.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He wants to be famous like you, you feel?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> He wants to be something. And you know I use him as an example. If he can make it, anybody can. You know, we did this book with Robert Kiyosaki, which is -- just went to #1 on the best sellers list. And I don't know if you heard that, but yesterday it went to #1 after 1 hour. Why? We want you to be rich. And Robert is the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, which is one of the biggest selling books...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, that's a great book. I read that book.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes, [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And [Inaudible] this is the biggest selling business book. And Robert approached me, and we did a book together. And it just -- it went out after 1 hour. It went to #1. And so you know -- so Mark Cuban, you he wants a piece of that stuff but it's never going to happen.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Why can't Mark leave you alone? You're doing fine.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. Every time I see -- because I was watching that show. And every time I see this moron go on television, he always brings me up and he ought to get a life. It's like Martha Stewart. You know she goes on, she puts on The Apprentice, it fails and then she blames me for failing. I have the #1 show on -- my show went to #1. Hers went down the toilet and she blames me.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You made 2 statements on Larry King last night. I was kind of surprised.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I didn't watch...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I did -- someone played me a tape this morning and I was surprised you said 2 things. You said...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What did he say?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He said, number one, Paris Hilton is smart. And number two...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh I think she knows how to brand.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay. All right, that's different.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's different than smart.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's true.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think she knows how to brand. I think she's highly underrated.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And number two, Angelina Jolie is unattractive.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think she's good looking at all.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> That's fine.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I don't think she's good looking at all. I mean, I've seen -- and what she does to that poor pathetic father. I mean, I hate to see the grandkids...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Brad Pitt?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, someday I'll see my grandson.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, you mean Jon Voight.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he starts crying on television. It's like, give me a break.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's a shame.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd like to talk to him. Jon, write her off. It's over. Don't leave her your money. Don't leave her anything write her off.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> If your children treated you the way Angelina Jolie treats Jon Voight, you would cut them off.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, I'd cut them off and probably sue their ass.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What are you going to do it for? Being bad kids?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> For being pains in the ass.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think Angelina Jolie is good looking. Let's get down to it. This is -- we're doing the Howard Stern...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> On a scale of 1 to 10, what is she?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I'll rate her a solid 5.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Only a 5?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did she turn you down once?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Bad skin.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Her lips are fine.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Her lips are fine, but she's not good -- I mean, she's okay. She's fine, you know? If it wasn't Angelina -- she wouldn't be able to get that. If her name -- if she weren't who she was now. When I see her lip...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How did she get to be that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Listen to this, Robin. When I see her lip locked with her brother...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> At the Academy Awards a few years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Yes?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, frenching him. When I see her with Billy Bob Thornton saying, "Oh
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, all of this -- I'm just not a fan of Angelina. Now why Brad Pitt wants her, I don't get it. Now...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Me either.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And Howard, let's get you -- you had me here because you like ratings, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now, let's get to Brad Pitt, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I don't consider him to be Cary Grant. I mean, you know, I don't get Brad Pitt either. Is Brad Pitt really a good-looking guy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, let me tell you something. Brad Pitt is -- we're real men and we love to bang women. So we don't know...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You don't know what a good-looking guy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> The reason we think he's a good looking guy is because he looks almost like a girl. Rather than like a good-looking guy. He's okay.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Now -- yes. And let me tell you something. This guy screws himself so bad he took up with her on a movie. It was exciting.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I thought he thought like for a few months --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's going to be like that all the time.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And go to Africa and be exciting. And now...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now he's dragging around all the adopted kids...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> From different nations.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I mean, it's unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You say that like it's a bad thing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Of course, it's a bad thing. The guy loaded down with children. He's now -- he's pushing a baby carriage. This guy used to get laid all the time. He's that fun. And now he's all saddled down with Angelina Jolie, and she's the real deal. She really does believe in all these do good a cause. And he's not going to have any fun.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know one of the greatest interviews I've ever seen was Brian Williams about 4 years ago interviewing on Life Today Show, Angelina Jolie. Okay?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And he's interviewing her, and she had blood wrapped around her neck in a capsule.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was Billy Bob Thornton's blood. And he said could I touch that? She almost killed him, that he would dare touch this blood.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> And then he said, what happens if you break up with him and all the tattoos you have with his name? She looked at him like are you crazy? That will never happen. 2 weeks later, she caught him with about 15 girls.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Angelina Jolie...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now, this is news. There were 15 girls in a room with Billy Thornton?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know. I heard it was a lot. I heard it was more than 1, but you'd really have to call up either Howard Stern or the National Enquirer.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> If Angeline Jolie is a 5, what is Jennifer Aniston?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'd say, she's a 6 or a 7.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, yes.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> My standards are very high.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who's a 9?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Howard, my standards are very high.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Jennifer Aniston is not high.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Who has higher standards than I? You know, the National Enquirer did a story that Donald Trump has had more great looking -- they said Wilt Chamberlain had the most women, 24, 000.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right. Anybody could have a lot of women. It's a question...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But it's quality, not quantity you're after.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was being interviewed, I think, by Katie Couric a long time ago on the Today Show. He said he wrote a book and the book was terrible, but there was only one statement of the book that was newsworthy that he had -- and he said, I had 24, 000 girls. He used the word girls, and Katie Couric was insulted when he used the word girls. He said, yes, I've had 24, 000 girls. And she couldn't believe that he used the word girls.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> So what about...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I couldn't believe 24, 000, Okay? But he said, I average 5 a day during the NBA days.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know what? I believe him.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What was Lady Di? Was she a 9?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I think she was great. I think she was -- I mean other than she was wacky, I think that she was close with 10.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I don't understand that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's what he says...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And I don't find you see Angelina Jolie has a great body, big boobs, big natural lips and beautiful eyes. She looks just close to like Betty and Veronica...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She got bad skin.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She does.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes, she's got scars all over the skin from removing...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What are you...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Who is living who's that hot? Who's a 9 or a 10?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, actually, you see the problem, and Howard and I discuss this a lot when we're out. Actually, the ones that are most beautiful are not the famous ones.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Really?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The most beautiful women aren't the famous ones.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I could tell you women that are so beautiful that your eyes would pop out but you would have never heard of.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're absolutely right. In fact, you go through the pages of US magazine and you look at some of these starlets and you go they're not that hot compared to some of the really hottest women.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no. I mean, I know people. I know women. Of course, I wouldn't touch them because I'm a happily married man. But I know women...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How's it going by the way?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Howard, she's great.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Melania is in shape.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A fantastic mother and I'm extremely happily married. But I know women that are so beautiful, Howard, that it's not even a contest. If for instance you take the best looking actress in Hollywood, whoever that may be, and there's none. You take the best look. And if she walked into a room next to some of these other women, you know what would happen?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What would happen?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She'd leave immediately because she's having a different class.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I agree with you 100%. By the way, you want to come to scores with us Thursday night? We're having a party.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh boy, I'd like to do that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right? You need to chill out a little.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You know, as a married man, it's a little tough, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. As a married man, you need this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can do it, but you know the havoc that it would...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It wouldn't be worth it. Now, what...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have a very understanding wife. But you know, I would have to pay a big price.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You mentioned the name Katie Couric. Now, what do you think of her bombing? And then just today it was reported she has the lowest ratings of all the 3 networks and essentially she is tanking. What do you make of this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I didn't understand one thing because Bob Schieffer -- and you know he did a good job doing the news, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he was going steadily up there for years and years of suffering with that moron Dan Rather. Dan Rather, I used to say what does he have on the executives at CBS News? He must have something. Is he like an FBI guy or something? Because they kept him on for years and years and he had these terrible ratings, right? If you had ratings like that, they would have canceled you 15, 20 years ago.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So the guys when he was third -- for his whole life he was third. He's a loser. He's terrible. And you know Dan Rather better than I do because there it is. Okay? So -- and he did me on 60 Minutes by the way so I don't like it because he screwed me.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> All right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But Dan Rather was a terrible, terrible newscaster, who by the way was hired by Mark Cuban.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's true.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So now you have 2 losers together.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So you feel losers attract losers?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think losers attract losers.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And what do you make of Katie Couric?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think Dan Rather and Mark Cuban belong together.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is Katie Couric any good?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I hope she's going to be good. I think she's a very nice person. She's a friend of mine. But I did see the ratings aren't exactly Howard Stern-type rating.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No. Why did you not ever buy a professional team like...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I just never really had the opportunity. I like sports.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He was in the football game for a while.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, the New Jersey Generals.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I had a thing where I was sort of more of a lawsuit league than it was anything. When I took a little team, I figured I could get myself into the NFL with a lawsuit, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know, I had -- and I had fun with that. I have a lot of boxing matches. I have a lot of golf competitions. I have a lot of...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, it's fun. Has George Steinbrenner gone soft when he says he's going to keep Joe Torre? Is that the right move?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, because Joe Torre is a great manager. I mean Joe Torre is -- I don't think -- you know -- hey look, I love George. I don't think Joe ever wanted A-Rod. A-Rod is a disaster, okay? And I don't think that Joe ever wanted A-Rod. I think you want to keep Mariano, the second baseman who hit 50 home runs this year.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Do you know why Mark Cuban is jealous of you? I'm going to tell you why.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because he doesn't have good looking women?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> No, it's -- but that could -- that's a part of it. But the truth is, where do you ever see a real estate developer becoming a superstar? It's very, very rare. Now out of all the guys you do real estate, there's tons of guys who develop buildings who are a very wealthy man.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very smart guys.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Very bright guys. You never even hear of these guys.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And Donald...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if you ever put them on television, they choke and they wouldn't know what to say.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right. That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> When the cameras went on and they say you're in front of 24 million people right now, they'd say, mommy take me home.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Exactly.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> They're vicious brutal animals in the office, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So the fact of the matter is that somehow, you've broken through and you've become a household name.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, Donald has a personality, which is what is lacking in many business people.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> No, no, Robin -- and I'm very handsome. I happen to be a very handsome man.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Your looks also get you through the day.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm glad you said that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you would think it if I ever came after you, Robin. You don't have to worry about it.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Are you a 10?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because Robin always attacks me behind my back, Howard.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I beg your pardon?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Robin, is very two-faced there.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What are you talking about?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I used to think -- she always hits me behind my back.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You're out of your mind.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I always try to be nice to her. But when people do things behind my back, I don't like it. One thing about Howard, he likes me to my face and he likes me behind my back.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Donald, I have always been very honest and upfront with you. And if I hit you, I hit you right here. I'm not lying to you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I don't mind. I don't mind being hit. I've been hit by a much tougher believe me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But that's not the point. The point is that I have never said anything behind your back that I haven't said to your face. How dare you to accuse me of being two-faced.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Absolutely. You're two-faced.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don't worry about it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Could you get Robin if you wanted her?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I think I could have her easily.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Easily?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, my goodness.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Without effort?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know. She doesn't like white men generally.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Oh, no. That's not true.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, I don't think so. Her boyfriends seem to be black, but...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They see you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He's black to me, too.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Assuming she has a little bit of open-mindedness to a white man, yes, I can get Robin.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, she is open to all roses.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You know you've insulted me...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Talk to me about your beautiful daughter for a second. I saw her in a spread on FHM. I saw her in a picture in a newspaper the other day.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is she dating Lance...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, they're friends. They just talked on the phone.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You wouldn't want her banging Lance Armstrong, would you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I mean it's not exactly what I had in mind.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Why did the papers say...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Everybody loves Ivanka. She's beautiful she's smart she was a top student at the Wharton School of Finance. She's in business. She's really smart. She was a very top model. And she really is a great beauty. You know, you talk about a great beauty, but she's a great beauty and everybody wants to go out with her. Every guy is calling her and I have to really guard her. But one of the people that calls her consistently and all the time is Lance Armstrong.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Really?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you think is going on there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think she likes him as a person. But I don't think she likes him as a boyfriend. I think she likes him as a person.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> If he's calling her incessantly...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He calls a lot.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He does? Now, did...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He calls all the time.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Are you thinking of calling the authorities?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I'll have him arrested because he's much too old for her. See, I would only allow my daughter -- see, I don't want anybody to take after me. I want my daughter to be with somebody relatively her own age.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want her to be like her father where I go out with girls where there's a 24-year difference.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What if she started dating Mark Cuban?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That would...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Would that kill you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, well that would be like dating The Neanderthal.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So you would say to her, look, if you date...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't think he'd have even a little shot with her.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> If she dated Mark Cuban, would you disown her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would say -- I don't think that's even a possibility. He's such an unattractive guy. She likes -- she really does like handsome people.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who would you prefer her to date?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, that's bad because you know that's probably a personality flaw. But she likes handsome people. He's certainly not a handsome...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who would you prefer her to date if she had a choice between...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do you have anybody in mind for her?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What if you thought of a choice between Mark Cuban or Osama bin Laden?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'd really have to say neither. I don't even...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Neither?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I don't even want to joke about Osama bin Laden because frankly why we haven't been able to capture this character is beyond me.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> All right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> We might have to put you on that job.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Why we have...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's ridiculous.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You should put me on...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Because we're wasting our time in Iraq and you know...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Believe me, Iraq is the biggest disaster ever.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Disaster?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's making Vietnam look like a good war.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Iraq is a disaster. The second really -- how about the police that we are training are now on the terrorist side?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, yes.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Absolutely. They hate us there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The police that we train are now killing our soldiers.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I had a soldier on the other day who says to me they hate us over there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They hate us. I have friends -- I mean, a friend of mine he's a great guy, he's a head of a major company. His son goes over there. It's all gung-ho. He comes back, he's blind. His son is blind.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Oh, no.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know the sad part, the son comes back, he says you know they hate us over there so bad. I don't know he's saying innocently. You know he's a young 21-year old kid. He said they hate us, dad, so badly. I don't know if we'll ever be able to -- I can tell you, they hate us beyond...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It is a shame. Who would you rather your daughter date? Mark Cuban or Wesley Snipes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd much rather -- I think Wesley Snipes is a much better looking guy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right, there you go. That's...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] I'm sure you'd feel that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Absolutely. It's unbelievable that you'd even have to be presenting...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Inaudible] hey, you got to understand. Mark Cuban bought an apartment. When he's looking for an apartment in New York, he goes into my building.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Exactly.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's renting in one of my buildings.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, they know you build a quality building.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'll give you the address where he lives. #1 Central Park West, Trump International Hotel& Tower.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Mark Cuban or Howard Stern for your daughter?
<Sally (Caller)> <Positive> I'd much rather have Howard Stern. You know why? You're better looking than he is.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thank you. Sally, you're on the air. And you can't say that about a lot of people. Sally, you're on the air with Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Mr. Trump, good morning.
<Sally (Caller)> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning, Sal.
<Sally (Caller)> <Positive> I would like to know why you got -- how come you got rid of Caroline?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She just wasn't doing the job, Sal. She just wasn't doing the job. Did you like Caroline?
<Sally (Caller)> <Positive> I thought she was great. I thought she had a great personality.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Maybe you could call her up and maybe ask her out on a date.
<Sally (Caller)> <Positive> I would love to.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What happened? You fired the...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> My wife would kill me.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> That would be no good.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This is a woman who worked with you and...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She was on the first couple of seasons of The Apprentice.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, she was on The Apprentice. You've seen her on the first seasons of The Apprentice.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And you got rid of her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I did. I really got rid of her because I also need people that worked the day job.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. In other words, she was getting too carried away?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She became like George. You know George became a star talent, became a star. I became -- we all become stars, right? But I was a star before this. But she became a star, and I can't blame her, she liked it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Were you jealous of the attention? Were you jealous of...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Inaudible] you?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. Oh, yes, that will be the day.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She liked being a star. And you know what, my attitude is being a star is fantastic, but don't be on my back. You know, you have to -- you have to do the day job, Howard.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right. That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She wasn't doing the day job. So it was one of those...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I'm still back on why Donald thinks I took a shot at him. Was it during the Martha Stewart thing that I was...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, because you defended Martha Stewart and you didn't defend me.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I knew it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Boy, I got to to tell you...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Listen, and I was nice to you for a long period of time. And you defended Martha Stewart. And I said, what do I need...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What did Robin say? I don't even know.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I simply said...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It's okay. Don't worry about it. She's failed on the air and I became I -- have the #1 show and she failed.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I did not -- it was only the...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What did you say?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Viciousness of Donald's attack.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What's the vicious there?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I thought you...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me, Robin. She blames me for her failure and I was the only person she came out of the can. I didn't think she was going to be good on The Apprentice. I didn't like her on the Apprentice. NBC wanted her and Mark Burnett wanted it -- wanted her. So I ceded to them and I didn't have to. They put her on The Apprentice. It was a disaster, okay? And it was a disaster. And then -- and she was a disaster. And then she blamed me for her failure, and then Robin comes to her defense.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I only -- it was when you started attacking her and her relationships with her daughter.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know I'm not a vicious person.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And I just simply said that you -- you know, because you're winning. You're on top. And it was sort of like she's down and she's, you know, flailing around and you can't...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's a wealthy woman. She's doing just fine. She was a friend of mine. I was the one that defended her when she went to jail. I was defending -- I kept defending her. And then she comes out and she blames me when she failed on The Apprentice. And you know what? I didn't mind the first time or the second time or the fifth time. But around 9 times into it, I said we have to stop this.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Let me switch the topic for 1 second. Now I see your daughter is looking more beautiful than ever.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did she...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Did you see her last night on Larry King?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I didn't see her on Larry King, but I saw her in FHM.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know Larry King got very high ratings last night.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I bet. I mean, you're a ratings grabber. But the thing is, did your daughter get breast implants?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> No? You mean that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, she didn't. I mean I would know if she did. The answer is no. Why? Did she look a little more fat?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She looks more voluptuous than ever.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, she didn't get them.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And she got thinner.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's actually always been very voluptuous. She's almost 6 feet tall.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She is some catch.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's been -- you know she's an amazing beauty.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, she's some catch, man. And then you worked your way into that family fortune, my God. You've got a good looking girl. She's got a family fortune.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she's got a lot of things going. But more than anything, she is beautiful but she's very smart. She went to the Wharton School of Finance and she graduated with virtually all As. So she's a very smart young woman.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So now you got a new book.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why we want...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, what is in your book?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why we want...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Why We Want You To Be Rich, and it's written by myself and Robert Kiyosaki. You know Robert Kiyosaki did Rich Dad Poor Dad, which is a -- and he's sitting with me if you'd want me to put him on for a second. Would you want...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, he's not the ratings grabber. You are.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, okay, because I could if you'd want.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who's he banging?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> His wife is very beautiful.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Robert's got a beautiful wife. I can't tell you beyond that, but his wife is beautiful.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who the hell...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You think he's gay and he's banging someone else?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hey, Donald, let me tell you something. If anybody wanted to talk to him, he would have written the book himself. You understand what I'm saying? How old is his wife?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, Howard, that's so cruel. That's cruel but true.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It's the truth. I mean, listen, he needs a Donald Trump name on that book.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Robert -- I put -- I just told Robert to pick up his [Inaudible]. But Robert wrote one of the biggest selling books of all time, Rich Dad Poor Dad.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I read the book.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> 27 million copies.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It's a very intelligent book.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a perennial bestseller, yes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, yes. It's a very good book.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And so when Robert approached me about doing a book together when we were at the Learning Annex, which is a great institution, we're speaking in front of a tremendous crowd of people...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do I learn if I read this book? Give me the one big message of the book.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] nothing because your attention span is about like 3 seconds.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Zero.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you'll find you know really successful people do have a very short attention span.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I don't have time for nonsense.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So you wouldn't learn much. But if a person read this book, they would learn something about life and how to make money and how to have a good life, how to make money, how you can be rich.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Are you happy man, Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I think so.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you need money to be happy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, I like to say I'm a content man because I don't know if I'm capable of happiness.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Do you need money to be happy?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, it certainly makes it a lot easier. You know a lot of people say money doesn't buy happiness. You know the famous expression by a very poor person by the way.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What did you buy personally for yourself within the last month that really made you happy?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Nothing.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Nothing?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No. I don't think -- a golf course. But other than...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A golf course?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You bought your own golf course?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've got 6 of them.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. And you go there...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I buy golf courses. I buy golf courses, other people buy something else, you know? But I buy golf courses...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What is the best thing...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll tell you what I bought. I bought a suit from Macy's, the Donald J. Trump collection which is a great suit.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What is the best thing about being Donald Trump right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, other the fact that I'm married, okay?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But -- and I'm very happy that I have a great wife. But if I weren't married, I'd be able to get all of the girls I want except for possibly Robin.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you think you could now be banging 24-year olds.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, absolutely. I'd have no trouble.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Would you do it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have no problem.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes, do you have an age limit or would you...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I -- no, no. I have no age -- I mean, I have an age. I don't want to be...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> The upper bracket then?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> With 12-year olds.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Can I make a prediction for you? Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I see you have one more marriage in you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's nice. I'm sure Melania would love to hear that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, not against Melania but at one point -- how old are you now? Do you talk about your age?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I just turned 60.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You're kidding.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By the time...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm going to say something very nice. You certainly don't look your age.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now, by the time...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I've been asked to admit it, but I've just turned 60.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> By the time you're 70, you're going to want one more 30-year old.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that could happen.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm telling you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] I actually a really wonderful wife who is very understanding. She gets me a lot. I have this beautiful baby who is extremely...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How old will she be in 10 years, your wife?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she'll be -- she's now 35, so she'll be 45 in 10 years.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And you're 70...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Inaudible] sometime after 40.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You think you're going to date a 45-year old?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, a big fan of yours.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She's married.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> My son Don just walked in.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How's he doing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's doing great.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> He's a nice kid. I like him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good kid and he works hard and his sister. We're just talking about your sister, Don. I'm talking to the legendary Howard Stern and Robin who can't stand me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, here we go.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm talking to the legendary Howard Stern.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Where are you right now? Your office?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In my office.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, you're in your office.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm in my office.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And your other son has come...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> As soon as I hang up, I can get back to business.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Your other son has come to work with you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And now Eric is just here with me.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right. Eric is going to be terrific.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> So many sons to sit and divide the fortune.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's good. That's good.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Before you know...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know 21 years, Barron will join them.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. And that will be nice. Would you ever -- would you frown upon your son? I mean, he's married now but banging one of the women that you banged?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I wouldn't be thrilled with that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I wouldn't be thrilled with that.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Andy Dick was in here the other day high fiving his son because his son banged his girlfriend.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Wow. I don't know. Andy Dick -- I'm not Andy Dick.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're no Andy Dick.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You're no dick. I can tell you that. Well the book is called Why We Want You To Be Rich: Two Men, One Message is in stores right now.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Howard, it just went to #1.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In 1 day. Yes, it came out yesterday and within 1 hour after its launch, it went to the #1 book.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And you published this yourself?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, we publish so the publishers don't make money.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, how do you do that? How do you distribute it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you can only do it -- you only do it in 2 cases, if you have a book that's going to be a monster or if you have a book that won't sell at all. If you have a book where you can't get a publisher, you publish it yourself. 3 people buy it and you can say I wrote a book. If you have money like we do and if you -- you know, I've had #1 bestsellers numerous and Robert has one of the biggest books of all time. And so you know we obviously had every publisher -- every single publisher out there was begging us to do it. But the publishers make a lot of money and they take a lot of money out of it. We've given a lot of money that we make from the book. We give it to the foundation and it's an educational foundation and the kind of thing you couldn't care less about because it's boring.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But the fact is that we give a lot of money to the foundation and this is money that can go to the foundation. So the publisher -- this book will -- I mean, we've already gone out with a million copies.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And it's selling well. What would you do -- this is the final question. Are you ready? You are the president of the United States. What do we do about North Korea?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would be so tough, you have no idea.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What does that mean?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You have no idea how tough I'd be.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You would...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Embargoes?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Embargoes?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I'd go beyond embargoes. But I...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I know the fuckers up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would be so tough but I wouldn't send Condoleezza Rice in to negotiate.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why? Is she bad?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think she's tough enough. I mean, I don't think she's a tough person.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Lightweight?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think she's not tough enough to do a good job.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who will be the next president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to say.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Say it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I can't say it. I don't want to say. I know every one of the candidates and every one of them is...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Who do you think is going to win?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to say, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have some interesting candidates. I think Hillary is going to run as a Democrat.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Can she win?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think she's going to get the nomination.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you think she can win?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I think John McCain and Rudy are going to form together. I think they're going to get the nomination.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> John McCain...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> John McCain and Rudy?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> John McCain...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think John McCain and Rudy, and they really like each other. I think they're going to end up forming an alliance and running together.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Who is a better president, John McCain or Rudy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't want to say because you know...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Say it.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> But I can tell you I know them both. They're both good men, but I really don't want to say. Now I will tell you, I know Rudy very well, he's a very capable guy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What are you going to do...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And is he going to run with somebody you think?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, what are you going to...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I believe so. That's my opinion.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What are you -- I don't think...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It's everybody else's now. But that's my opinion.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think Rudy Giuliani will run. I think he's having a great life. He's making some good money.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you think he has...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] call me up and say I apologize.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, I'm not. Listen, I'm just...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] ultimately it's John McCain and Rudy is a ticket against Hillary and it's going to be a very interesting race. And never underestimate Hillary. She's very smart.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Can a woman win the presidency in this country today?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Absolutely, a woman could win. I think a woman...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> [Inaudible] You think a woman would do a worse job than Bush?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody could do a worse job...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I think Hillary Clinton's sensational. I don't think she would be a bad president at all. But I don't know if Middle America would vote for a woman.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You think we'd be doing worse than we are right now?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> No, I think we'd be doing great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it's really tough.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Where are you now? You're in your office...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In my office.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And wearing one of those suits the whole day?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm working very hard wearing a Macy's suit.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Would I ever see you in a jogging suit at work?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You would. I -- when I carried the torch, I was in a jogging suit.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And that felt okay to you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Not so good because if you're a little heavy they say oh shit Trump is heavy just like everyone else. That's no good.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Who is the most beautiful woman on the planet besides your wife and your daughter right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there are -- I could name 10 but you've...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Name the one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to name any because...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Name one.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> People will say I'm having an affair with her.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, no one will say that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't do that, Howard.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Who is the most beautiful woman on the planet earth right now, famous woman that we know.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Famous woman?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible] famous woman.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't -- I can't do it.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Why not?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Because I know every one of them and I'm going to insult every one when I make...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're not naming anybody as ugly.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Sit down, sit down.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Robin is the most beautiful woman.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, stop it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Sit down and come up with a list then call me back.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I'll let you know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The book is called Why We Want You To Be Rich: Two Men and One Message.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Why do they want to be...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> On sale right now.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Here's my book, I don't give a shit if you're rich.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Why do I care if you're rich?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And why do I care if you're rich by the way?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Howard, this is kind of attention grabber with Robert Kiyosaki. The reason you want to get rich is so you can get laid. It's only sex and money that...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And why do you care if I'm rich?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> If that gets laid.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You are rich.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like the idea that people have a better life, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You do?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You care that people get rich?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I went to the Wharton School of Finance as a very good student. I make speeches in front of 50, 000, 60, 000 people for the Learning Annex. I love to educate and if I can impart some of my, you know, through trial and tribulations, some of what I have on to other people, I like doing it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I don't think you're telling the truth. I think you want all the money in the world. And the more rich people that are on the world, less money for you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, well that's another way of looking at it. But I really do, if I can help people -- you know, honestly, if I can help people, I like helping people.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's nice.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> And I'm helping people by writing this book. And Robert Kiyosaki is a very talented guy who really does this and does it better than anybody.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How big is Robert Kiyosaki's penis.
<Robert Kiyosaki> <Neutral> Oh!
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Robert, are you hung well?
<Robert Kiyosaki> <Negative> No, I'm not.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're not?
<Robert Kiyosaki> <Negative> I'm not like you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you bigger than Donald? You ever seen Donald naked?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I never -- we haven't got that far.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> All right. Well, let's hope you 2 get nude and look at each other's penis all day long. Thank you so much, Mr. Donald Trump, my friend.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thank you. Make sure, Robin...
<Robert Kiyosaki> <Positive> And I hope that Donald and I can mend fences.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, when he comes in, you 2 will make out. And Robert Kiyosaki, thank you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thank you, Howard.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So long, Howard.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Take care, guys.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So long, Robert. Bye bye.
