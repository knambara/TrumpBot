<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Welcome to you, our viewers from the U.S. and around the world. We have Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner for president, joining us on New Day for the very first time. Mr. Trump, can you hear me?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [On Phone] Hello, Chris, I certainly can.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Good morning to you. Welcome to the program. The viewers are excited to have you here. Thanks for doing it for us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good to be with you.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Let me give you an opportunity to deal with so much of what is surrounding you, especially your ideas for the country. But to start off with the politics, this idea of you and a third party run, are you willing to announce this morning that you are going to stick with the GOP, try your luck there, hope for fairness and if it doesn't work out it doesn't and no third party run?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's been so much false reporting, Chris, and you know it probably as well as anybody. You know what's been happening. People are putting out signals and everything else. Look, I'm running as a Republican. I'm leading in every poll. I think you report all these polls. In fact, in the CNN poll, I'm leading very big. Iowa just came out yesterday where I'm leading substantially in Iowa. We are leading all over the place.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want to run as a Republican. I want to be the Republican candidate. I think that's absolutely the best chance for winning, the way it's going right now, I'm being treated nicely. I just want to be treated fairly. If I am treated fairly, that's the way it is going to be.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I want to keep that door open. I have to keep that door open. I have to keep that door open because if something happens where I'm not treated fairly, I may very well use that door. So anybody that says anything -- you know, I hear all of these so-called advisers and I think you know me well enough to know about all of them -- advisers that everybody is talking about that don't even exist.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I will tell you, I will keep the door open but it's not something I want to do. I want to run as a Republican and win as a Republican and take it back for the Republicans, for the country and make America great again. You know, my whole campaign is based on making America great again. It's so simple, but it's hard to do. It takes a certain person to do it. And I'll be able to do it. And I look at my competition, they will not be able to do it.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> I want to talk to you about how. You said something that is interesting here. You said I want to be treated fairly, nicely. You know that those are not the same thing. When you look at what happened with the comments about Megyn Kelly, you say, and we take you at your word, that you didn't mean them the way they were perceived, but why do you think so many people took them as an outright assault on women?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I didn't say I didn't mean them. I said what I said. And frankly, I didn't even finish that sentence and people said he must be have been thinking about this. It was a ridiculous interpretation. Most people agree with what I said. What I said was very simple and I wanted to get onto the next thought.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Frankly, I don't know how it could have been misconstrued unless somebody is a deviant, which in the case of the character that saved me a lot of fuel money, Erik Erickson, who is a guy who's got a very checkered past and lots of checkered stupid statements. It wasn't a big deal, frankly. By the way, he had a revolution out there. He had a riot out there when he announced I wasn't going to be there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So you know, unless you have a sort of a semi-sick mind or a very sick mind, you wouldn't have thought that would have been, you know, that would not be the normal thought process. But, it's sort of irrelevant. There are lots of other things that happen in politics that are certainly a lot worse than that.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> In terms of getting the female vote, it's going to be very important to you. You've said you will be the best ever for women. The comments that Megyn was pointing to, you didn't say, hey, I have proof that she's lying about this, I never said them. Do you think that you owe women, in general, if not an apology at least, some assurance that these comments are not who I am and who I would be as president?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think Jeb Bush owes women an apology. He made a terrible statement about women's health issues. It was a foolish statement, perhaps a stupid statement. It's a statement that should never have come up and should never have been made and I was shocked that he made it. I think that will prove to be his 47 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When Romney did his famous 47 percent, a lot of people said his election is over. I think that when Jeb Bush made the statement on women's health issues that, you know, he wouldn't fund them -- he wouldn't need the kind of money they were talking about, $500 billion, you wouldn't need that kind of money when that actually, relatively speaking, is peanuts compared to the kind of money spent on lots of other things. I think that was a terrible mistake he made. I think he's the one that has to apologize to women.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now I will say this, he has gone back, he said I misspoke. He said, meaning -- not me -- he -- he said that he misspoke. Well, that's an awfully big issue to misspeak. I will be so good to women. I cherish women. I will work hard to protect women.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you what, work hard to protect everybody because ultimately, if you look at what's going on with Iran, with this horrible deal that was made in Iran, this incompetent deal made with Iran, I mean, even if we don't approve it, they are going to get the money. Can you believe that? If the deal doesn't get approved, they still get the money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Iran is going to be so rich, powerful and strong. What we have done is we have set them on the way to -- literally it could be destroying the world. That is one of the dumbest deals. I think that may go down and may ultimately horribly go down as one of the dumbest deals in world history. It will be a disaster.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Let's unpack a little bit of what you just laid out there for us. I'll give you the deflection on whether or not you need to make an assurance to women. You said that you'd be the best for them ever. You don't like what Jeb Bush said. You said it was an epic mistake. Is that your way of saying that you think Planned Parenthood should be funded because of all the health care that it provides outside of abortions to women, especially women of low means?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the biggest problem I have with Planned Parenthood is the abortion situation. It's like an abortion factory. You can't have it and you shouldn't be funding it and that should not be funded by the government. I feel strongly about that. That's my biggest problem with Planned Parenthood because it really -- if you look at it and you look at the work they do, it really has become so heavily centered on abortion. You can't have that.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> They say it's only 3 percent of what they do and the money that does go toward abortions is not the money that comes from the federal government. That they separate the two.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is what I would do, if the time came, I would look at the individual things that they do and maybe some of the things are good, and maybe -- I know a lot of the things are bad. But certainly the abortion aspect of it should not be funded by government.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> So you would take a look at it before defunding it. That's what's being asked for right now. Many in your party are doing the opposite. They're saying defund it, then look. You'd say look at it first?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would look at the good aspects of it and I would also look because I'm sure they do some things properly and good and good for women. I would look at that. I would look at other aspects, also. But we have to take care of women. We have to absolutely take care of women. The abortion aspect of Planned Parenthood should not be funded.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Well, you do know that there is a big political debate on this and that many women believe that you do protect them by protecting their right to choose and that's something that Planned Parenthood allows. Marco Rubio, someone running against you, says he doesn't believe in any carve outs for rape or incest. That there's no abortion on any level, no matter what. Do you agree with that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I disagree with that. I am for the exceptions. You have the three exceptions. I'm for the exceptions. The health of the mother and life of the mother. I absolutely am for the exceptions, and so was Ronald Reagan for the exceptions, by the way. There's nothing wrong with that. You have to do it, in my opinion. Now Marco took a very strong stand. I respect him for that. He believes that. It's just a different thing. I am for the exceptions, yes.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Do you agree with him about when you have a person in the form of the unborn that should have a right to attach to them. He says at conception Roe v. Wade, as you know, says 20 weeks, there are different theories that other people have. When do you believe that the unborn is a person and deserves the right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I certainly think, as the process goes along more and more, and a lot of people are talking about the 20 weeks and certainly there, but absolutely, as the process goes along. But I am a person that feels very, very strongly about, you know, I am pro-life. I'm strongly about pro-life. But I also feel that you go with the exceptions, which, Marco, when I was at [Inaudible] when he made the statement
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A lot of people liked his statement, a lot of people didn't. I was in that room. It was a very strong statement that he made. And I respect him for it, frankly, but I don't happen to agree. I am for the exceptions.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> You said, I'm going to be great for women, I'll do the most that can be done for women. Would you pass an equal pay for women? You know the statistics, you know they don't get paid what men do even if the -- [Inaudible]. Would you pass that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm looking into that very strongly. I was asked that same question yesterday. I'm looking into it very strongly. I will have a position on it in the not too distant future. And one of the problems you have is you get to have an economy where it's no longer a free enterprise economy. You know, everybody gets the same whether they -- The concept of it is good. It's a very complicated -- the whole issue is a very complicated issue.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have to make our -- we have to get this generator going to create the jobs and incentives and all the things we have to create in this country to make it rich again because without being rich again, we are not going to make it great again. We are going to soon be up to $19 trillion. We have to get the engine going.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I'm looking at that very strongly. I feel strongly -- the concept of it, I love. I just don't want it to be a negative where everybody ends up making the same pay. Because that's not our system. You know, the world, everybody comes in, they get a job, they make -- people aren't the same
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now in my case, I have hired -- I have tremendous numbers of women. I have a major company, big company, I built a great company. It's got some of the great assets. Some of the most iconic assets in the world. I have many women executives. And I've always had. When I was back in the construction days, the big construction days, I had women in charge of big developments.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Do you pay them what you pay the men?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I was very, very pro women many years ago. I found they are incredible executives.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Do you pay them the same as men?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They are absolutely incredible executives. So I get the picture better than anybody.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Do you pay them the same that you pay the men?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's something that I'm spending very closely and I will make a decision on soon.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> Do you pay the women at the top of your organization the same way you pay the men?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I do. Absolutely.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Because that's what it comes down to. It's not that everybody is equal. It's that you are equal when you deserve.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, but the [Inaudible] is do you do that -- Like I pay, in many cases, I pay the women more. I mean, I have women that get paid a lot of money and I pay them more. And I'm very proud to pay them more.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> One campaign suggestion for you, you should show those numbers to people and let them see that women don't only make the same, they make more.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I can do that. But, you know, one of the things that I alluded to, one of the things I'm very proud of is, you know, I was one of the first -- I think I was literally the first. I had a woman in charge of the construction of Trump Tower. That was unheard of in the construction industry that many years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I was -- you know, I'm very proud of that fact. I have gotten a lot of credit over the years, especially within the construction industry. You didn't have women at the construction industry at high levels. I think I was the first to do it, in charge of major developments.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Don't tell my boss, but I was hearing what you were saying on Fox News before you were on with us this morning and when it came to tax policy, you were saying there are lots of plans, you got to figure out the plans, you got to make it simpler. You know you're going to have to do better than that as you go forward here in terms of putting out ideas that people can cling to. What do you think should be the top tax rate for someone, let's say, like you who is a billionaire?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Chris, I don't think I have to do a lot better right now. I mean, we are in a very formative part of the campaign. I am also forming. You don't understand. To be a successful person and a business person, you have to be flexible. You know, the boxers say you have to go with punches. You have to be flexible. You can't be just boom, boom, hard and fast.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And a friend of mine who is a very, very successful guy -- you know, one of the people I have spoken to recently, Carl Icahn, is a friend of mine and I said, Carl, if I pull this thing off, I'm putting you in charge of China and Japan. And he laughed, he said, I'll do it. You should call him. Have in on your show some time. He's great. He's a great negotiator. One of the things that a friend of mine told me -- also a very successful guy -- you know, they want me to come up with a 10-point plan, a 14-point plan, a 20-point plan. It doesn't necessarily work that way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When I bought Doral, everybody wanted it. Everybody. I didn't sit down and say let's do a 14-point plan -- I went in and I got it. I took it away from so many people. The old post office on Pennsylvania Avenue, which is under constructive right now, everybody wanted it from the government. The government -- you know, the whole thing. It's a government deal. I got it from the government and General Services Administration. I'll tell you what, and totally professional people, those people.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> But you got to have --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But here is the point, Chris, I wouldn't sit down and draw a plan that tomorrow, I will go and have a meeting. The next day, I'll go and make an offer. I went in and I got it. I went in and I got Turnberry in Scotland. That's one of the great resorts of the world. Everybody wanted it. I didn't wait around to do a 14-point plan. I went in and got it. So a lot of this stuff, you don't want to hear about the plans, you got to get in and you got to get it done.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Yeah, but you know that that's not the way it works. You can't get in there not telling people what you are going to do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Our tax code -- Chris -- Our tax code -- I know every form of tax, believe me, from the vats to the fair tax to -- every single form of tax. Our tax code is too complicated. We can simplify it so easily.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> How?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Using intelligence. By having common sense.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> What do you simplify? You make the top rate go from 30 something to 20 something?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look -- and you've heard me say this before -- I want to put H&R Block out of business. I want to put them out of business. A person with a simple tax return can't figure it out. They have to go out and pay a lot of money to these companies that go out and do your tax return for you. I want to put H&R Block out of business.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Here's what you can do. You can have a fair tax, you can have a flat tax or you can leave the system alone, which is probably the simplest at this point, leave the system alone and take out deductions and lower taxes and do lots of really good things, leaving the system the way it is. And I know exactly what I want to do, I just don't want to announce it yet. But one of the things we have to do, Chris, is simplify our tax code. It's too complicated.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> I don't get what that means, Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump, help me with that. Help me with that because if I was sitting across from you, making you a pitch to do anything for you and I said, look, I got a plan, but m not going to tell you yet. I think I would get an eye roll -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I'm going to say it. I'm just no prepared to tell you right now on your fantastic show that is getting better ratings all the time because you have Trump on so much. OK?
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> This is the first time I've had Trump on, if I may speak about you in the third person.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> When I say Trump, I'm saying Trump or Trump-related. OK?
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> Oh, I got you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Trump-related, definitely.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Well, look, as you know --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you'll have me on again.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> We offer an open forum to everybody. I want you to get these ideas out there. You've talked about the military, you say you'd hand it to ISIS, the Iran deal stinks. People are going to want to know how you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What did you say? I'd hand what to ISIS?
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> You hand it to ISIS. You would give it to them. You know, you would really take them on. You said --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, your definition of hand it is a lot different than mine.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> No, I'm not saying that you would give something to them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would go in and knock the hell out of them. There's no question about that.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> How would you knock the hell out of them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would take the oil away, I'd take their money away, I'd take their source of money way. I'd make sure that --
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> How do you take the oil?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- Saudi Arabia -- and by the way, Iran, which gives plenty of money to is ISIS, I would make sure -- believe it or not, Iran is funneling money into ISIS, too. Iraq is going to Iran just like I predicted in 2004.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> So how do you do it? Do you put troops on the ground?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would go in and take the oil and I'd put troops to protect the oil. I would absolutely go and I'd take the money source away. And believe me, they would start to wither and they would collapse.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> But what about -- You have to get the oil. You know, Iran would say we are actually one of the ones who are fighting ISIS for you in a lot of places. That's why they have some leverage at that deal -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Part of the problem -- [Inaudible] -- deal was such a disaster with Iran. You know, even if the deal isn't approved, if it's not approved, they still get the money. Which is something I heard that the other day. They are going to be so rich, so powerful, so mean, they are going to be so angry.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> But that's not exactly how it works. If they don't do what they need to do, there is a snapback.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's the dumbest deal. It's going to go down as one of the dumb deals of all time. And one of the most dangerous deals ever signed.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> There is a snapback provision, though, that if they don't do what they are supposed to, then the sanctions get back in. I mean, that's one of the things they're protecting --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, but I'm talking about the $150 billion and all the other money they are going to be getting. They are getting a fortune. They are getting tremendous amounts of money even if the deal doesn't get approved --
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> There's no question they are going to get money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- they are still getting much of what they wanted to get --
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> The question becomes what was the better deal? What would you do? You know you can't sit down --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What would I have done?
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> First of all, I would have doubled the sanctions. Then I would have said, before we start, I want our prisoners back, then after that I would have made a good deal and there wouldn't have been 24 days --
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> But your allies aren't with you on the sanctions, they want to do business.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't care -- That's part of leadership, you got to get the allies with you. You got to get them. Of course Putin is not going to -- I mean, the different people that are involved aren't going to be with you. You know why? Because they have no respect for our president.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> But what do you think happens? If you are sitting across from Rouhani or Vladimir Putin and you look at them and you say you get out of Ukraine and he says make me. Now what?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Ukraine is a whole different subject.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> All right, fine. Then stick with Iran.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're bringing up a lot of different subjects. Listen. Excuse me. Ukraine, why isn't Germany and Europe fighting for Ukraine? Why are we involved so much with Ukraine instead of Germany? Germany is a very powerful, very rich country. They don't owe money like we do. They don't have a $19 trillion number on their ballot sheet that's going to destroy them.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> People will say it's leadership, that America goes first. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me just say it. Germany should be involved. Why isn't Germany and all of the European countries -- They are still buying oil and still taking gas -- They're taking everything from Russia and we are standing there fighting about Ukraine.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> But if you're sitting --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Why -- Excuse me, Chris -- Why isn't Germany, which is tremendously powerful and very strong and has probably the greatest leader in the world right now in Merkel -- why isn't Germany fighting Russia? Why is it always the United States? We are like the policemen of the world.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Germany, as you know very well, doesn't have that kind of military capacity that the U.S. has and there are reasons for that as well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they have tremendous economic power. They can crush Russia. They have tremendous economic strength.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> But they have their own interests. Look, I know you know this stuff, Mr. Trump, and forgive me if it sounds like I'm teaching you about the world. You know it and I know you know it. But I'm saying that there's a tendency to oversimplify situations. People buy into that and then you're setting them up for disappointment. There's a reason that Germany doesn't do it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sometimes oversimplification is a good thing. Sometimes we make it too complicated. I'm just saying this --
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Yeah, but when you are sitting with Iran -- when you are sitting at the table -- Give me one second, Mr. Trump. When you're sitting at the table with Iran, and you say, I'm going to double the sanctions, and all of your partners get up and leave because they want to do commerce, and you say you are not getting a nuke -- and the Iranians say we already have it. We could have it tomorrow if we want it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Excuse me, they won't leave if I'm president because they are going to respect our country and respect me. They are going to do what I tell them to do. We have a lot of power over those countries. They won't leave. They will do the sanctions.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Why would you do this deal if you didn't absolutely have to?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the way, the sanctions wouldn't even be long-term. You would bring Iran to the table. Why didn't we get our prisoners back? You know what they said? They said we are not going to ask for the prisoners. Chris, we're not going to ask, because it will complicate the negotiation. And yet we gave back a nuclear scientist to Iran. We gave them back the nuclear scientist that they wanted
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We can't ask for four prisoners that are sitting there. One of them is there because he's a Christian, in a horrible prison. He's there because he's a Christian. I met his wife. She's an amazing woman. She doesn't know what to do. We don't even bring it up. I'll tell you what, I guarantee you that if I were president, this deal wouldn't be made, a deal would be made that's 100 times better. What about --
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> 100 times better. What is the deal that's 100 times better?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Chris, what about 24 days to go and inspect. You have 24 days. And what people don't say is before you get to the 24 days, it takes a long time because you have to start a process.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Right. But look, you're not giving any benefit of the doubt to the fact that they had to negotiate something. Of course you'd rather inspect right away, than with any kind of notice. How do you know there was an alternative?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Chris, they're incompetent. They're incompetent negotiators.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> And why do you say that Secretary Kerry and these guys were incompetent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They didn't real "The Art Of The Deal," obviously. They're incompetent people. We have incompetent people. I watched on Charlie Rose, their chief negotiator, I watched, after watching him for five minutes, I tweeted, I said, do not let Kerry deal with this guy. This guy is too smart for Kerry.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, the Persians are great negotiators. Always have been. The Iranians are great negotiators, the Persians. And I will tell you -- We gave up on every point. We get nothing on this deal.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Well, they would say they negotiated on at every point.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if the deal doesn't get passed, they get all of this money. They still get the money even if there's no deal, they're getting billions and billions of dollars. We are represented by incompetent people. Let me tell you, the sanctions will be doubled because I will convince Germany and I will convince all of the countries that we're talking about --
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> India, China, you know, people want to do business.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll convince them. China -- We have so much power over China. China has gotten rich over us. China has rebuilt itself with the money it's sucked out of the United States and the jobs that it's sucked out of the United States. We have tremendous power over China --
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> Did you ever use Chinese money on any of your project?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me?
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> You ever use Chinese money on any of your project?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I never used Chinese money, but I buy Chinese products because they keep lowering their currency. And today, if you look in the newspapers, "The Wall Street Journal," the No. 1 story is that they're lowering their currency yet again, big league. Because you know what? They're just destroying us.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Our currency is going up, which sounds good, but actually if you look at what it's doing to our country -- and they're cutting their currency, they keep devaluing their currency. They're doing a big cut in the yuan and it's going to be devastating for us. Chris, our companies cannot compete with China -- [Audio Break]
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> I understand that there are challenges there and that's why we need the ideas to figure out how to turn it around. Identifying problems is important. Identifying solutions, more so, especially if you're going to be president.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me ask you something about what's going on at Fox. This situation seems curious from the outside. You talked to Roger Ailes, he says he cleared the air and Megyn Kelly goes on her show, doesn't come at you, says that you're successful. Did you make a deal with Fox?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Roger Ailes has been a friend of mine for a long time. He called me yesterday --
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> He's a good man.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's been a very good friend of mine. He's somebody I have great respect for. I was very angry with the way I was treated and, you know, perhaps justifiably. I think justifiably. But Roger Ailes, who is an amazing guy and an amazing executive, frankly, he called me yesterday and as far as I'm concerned, I'm fine with it.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> So you're over it. Was part of the deal that Megyn Kelly wouldn't go on her show and attack you and keep it going?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't care that -- I mean, we didn't even discuss that. It's not about Megyn Kelly.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> She doesn't come up at all when you were talking to Roger Ailes?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not about that. Look, there was a misinterpretation of what I said. Look, what I said was obvious. There was nothing wrong -- Unless you're a deviant, you don't put those words in. A couple of people tried to make a big issue out of it. That's not it. Roger's done an amazing job at Fox. He called me and I have no problems.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> You know what it was. The reason that people were inclined to see it that way was because of the other things you've said in the past about women, which is why I started this early on about whether or not you wanted to apologize for those.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, maybe that is -- I mean, I don't know what it is exactly but I don't know how you could have been -- Hey, look, I went to the hardest school to get into, the best school in the world, I guess you could say, the Wharton School of Finance, it's like super genius stuff. I came, out I built a tremendous company, I had tremendous success. "The Art of the Deal," The Apprentice, everything. Who would -- Would make a statement like that? I didn't make a statement -- In fact -- Chris, if you think about it --
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Smart men aren't always good to women though. Right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've always been good to women. Nobody will be better to women as a president because I'll take care -- when I talk about health issues, I will take care of women like nobody else can. Certainly Jeb Bush doesn't even know what he's talking about. He admitted that the other day. And believe me, that will be his 47 percent. That will be the statement just like it took down Romney, the 47 percent, his statement on women's health issues will take him down.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Well, it will if somebody else is offering ideas that are so much better than his and they highlight a deficiency. That's a task for you and the other candidates.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Perhaps. But I think you're going to see that come along very, very soon. And you know what? You do have to have flexibility. Remember what I say -- When these guys come and issue these plans and they're hard and fast, you've got to go with the punches like the boxer said.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Right. But you have to have a core set of ideas.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have to have certain flexibility. You have to be able to -- You have to get it through this vast web. Nobody knows politics better than I do. I've dealt with politicians all my life. You have to get this through and passed through a vast web. We can't just keep signing executive orders all over the place.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> Right. But --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I want to have flexibility. I have to.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> But you have to have core principles that people can grab onto and vote for you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will take care of women's health issues and guys like Bush -- and by the way, Hillary Clinton won't. She won't take care of it like I will. Believe me.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> How can you say that? How can you say Hillary Clinton won't take care of women's health the way you will?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because I know my capability and I think I know her capability and I'm much more capable than she is.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> But some would say that for women, just on the issue of being pro-choice alone would give her an advantage.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, some would, but there are plenty of women that agree with me on that issue, with the excepts -- you know that. But there are plenty of women that agree with me on that. We're not just talking about me. Many women agree. That's not just a man issue. That's a woman issue too.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Absolutely. I understand that. But let me ask you one last thing here. I don't want to keep you too long. How you're conducting yourself is an issue that's been a plus/minus for you. This morning, although everything's supposed to be OK with Fox, in "The New York Post" which is, of course, one of their properties, one of their columnists, Rich Lowry, says that you are the most fabulous whiner in the world and that you've shown that if you were to sit across from a Putin or from Mexico or from the Middle East leaders, that as soon as they said something you don't like you would become a whiner, you'd become snipy with them and that you wouldn't get anything done. What do you say to that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think he's probably right. I am the most fabulous whiner. I do whine because I want to win. And I'm not happy if I'm not winning.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Are whiners winners?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I am a whiner and I'm a whiner and I keep whining and whining until I win. And I'm going to win for the country and I'm going to make our country great again. Our country right now is a debtor nation, we have airports that are third world airports, we have roadways that are falling apart, we have bridges that are coming down and that are unsafe. 60 percent of the bridges in this country need work and they're unsafe.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> But how do you pass that infrastructure bill? How do you work with government? You can't just come back at everybody when they insult you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Chris, I've been better at working wit government. I've made -- Hey, Chris, I'm worth more than $10 billion. I've been working with government all my life. That's what I do --
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> But you've also been very rough on people over the years. It's worked for you, but in politics it's a little different.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, sometimes you have to be rough, though, Chris.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> I know. But you can't always be rough.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know you and I know your brother. And your brother is a rough cookie. He's a good guy but he's a rough cookie.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> There's a price for being rough.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he gets things done and you get things done. You're a rough guy.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> You've been rough. You threatened to sue me and my parents for giving birth to me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I would never do that.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> That's exactly what you did. You play very rough sometimes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no. They did a great service for the world. And you know, I'm a huge fan of your mother. I don't know. You know, your mother and my mother know each other.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> Well, she's watching right now, so don't say anything about me. She'll be very upset. You know how she felt about your parents.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm a huge fan of your mother and my mother loved your mother and, you know, they knew each other from Queens. They went to the same beauty parlor together, right?
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> We grew up in the same place. That's right. They did. We won't talk about the styles that they had done to them, but they did go to the same --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm not sure about the style, but it was OK.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Listen, I appreciate you coming on New Day . You know I'm pushing on these solutions because that, at the end of the day, is what makes the difference. A lot of people judge you for what you say because they don't have the policy ideas to test you on and that's going to be something that's going to have to transition for you to be successful in the race.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Chris, I have policy and I know policy better than anybody --
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> But you got to give the ideas, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You can't just go in and say we're going to do -- It has to be flexible. I know policy better than anybody. I know politics as well as anybody. I've been doing it all my life. And I've been doing it from the other side, which in a certain way gives you a better perspective. But you will see what's going to happen. A lot of positive things are going to happen.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> But you know that people to vote for you, they're going to have to have more than a promise. They're going to have to have a central set of ideals about ideas, which way you'll take it, what a top tax rate is, how many people you'd put into these bad places, American fighting men and women --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure, you're going to have that --
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> -- how long you'd leave them there --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Once you get into office it's going to change because you have a big negotiation to go through with Congress. And you will lead Congress to the right place. That's what leadership is all about.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> And if you do that -- You've got to work with them differently than you do --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All I know is I just looked at three polls that came out. I'm leading Iowa big. And another one just came out where nationally I'm 32 percent. So I must be doing something right. I don't know.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> There's inarguable that you have tapped into something that matters with members of the GOP and maybe beyond. But that puts an onus on you, Mr. Trump, to deliver.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think what is arguable, frankly, and I think the thing that I have tapped into is that people are finding our leadership is incompetent and they know that I am far from that. They know that I get things done. They know that I'm a smart guy who gets things done and I want things done properly. And I don't want them done for myself. I made a lot of money. I don't want money. I don't want people giving me money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to do something great and great is to make our country great again. There can be no greater service that I do. That's what I want to do. I want to make our country great. Our infrastructure is falling apart. We need military -- we have to take care of our vets. Our vets are -- It's never been -- You know, two weeks ago on Wednesday they had the longest wait in the history of the Veteran's Administration waiting for a doctor.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> How do you fix it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're waiting four or five days to see a doctor and at the end of the sixth day a doctor goes out and says, I'm sorry, I can't see you, I'm going on vacation.
<Chris Cuomo> <Negative> The problems are open and notorious. The fix has been elusive. Do you have one?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will fix it. Believe me. That's what I do in life. I fix it. I'm not a politician. Politicians are all talk and no action, Chris. I'm the opposite.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Mr. Trump, thank you for coming on New Day . As the campaign continues, we invite you back to discuss the issues and your solutions to them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Chris.
<Chris Cuomo> <Positive> Have a good day, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So long.
<Chris Cuomo> <Neutral> Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> TV star, The number one guy, number one guy. There you go.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He's saying something but we can't hear him.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who can hear him?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Laughs]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Get in front of the microphone so we hear what you're saying, sounds important though.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Everything he says must be important.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How are you?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm -- I'm very well, how are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm very good thank you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Mr. Trump, I was very proud of you. I saw you on a lot of shows talking about the fact that the war in Iraq is going horribly wrong. A lot of people especially in your position; a wealthy guy who could do very well with the Bush administration. You're speaking out because you care that people are dying over there, young people and perhaps for nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's a horror. I mean the war is a total disaster. It seems to me to be almost worse than Vietnam. And I happen to like the Bush policies on taxation, I really believe in him and I -- I -- That's just because you pay less, the fact is you have more incentive to do things, and I think it's good it puts people to work. But the war is a total catastrophe, and if anything brings him down, that's going to bring him down. That, and perhaps you, and the FCC.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. And --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Have Donald put on his headphones, coz he'll never hear what I'm saying.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And stem cell research. Yeah. Robin wants you to put on your headphones on. Because you'll never hear Robin, and if you miss Robin. You've missed it all.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Well, no, I was just going to say that I was thinking the other day, this is a war that George Bush wouldn't have fought in himself.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's the other thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, one of the greatest spin jobs I've ever seen, and I've watched a lot of spin over the years, is what they did with Kerry. They made Kerry, who whether he was a great hero, or a modest hero, or at least just went and got shot at.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He was a brave guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They made him into a guy who was a total war failure and Bush is this great war hero, and you know it's sort of amazing. I thought it was one of, you know, the swift boat.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I thought it was one of the greatest jobs I've ever seen. So they made Kerry, who really went into this whole thing as a war hero, and he's coming out like somebody that's really damaged goods. And, Bush who obviously wasn't a war hero, is looking awfully good. So--
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He's looking like a war hero.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's -- It's sort of interesting.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Bush, Ashcroft, Cheney, all of them. Seven deferments, five deferments for Cheney, seven for Ashcroft, Bush clearly got a privilege from his father, Fine. If I had a father who could give me some privilege I'd admit it and say, 'Hey, I was lucky, I got out of this horrible war, the Vietnam War.' He hasn't learned from history though. He supports the Vietnam War and he says in theory it was a good war.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's -- that's not so good. I mean, most people you have to be pretty hard line to now still support the Vietnam War.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Would you fire Bush?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I love his tax policy and I hate his war, so I guess, you know, we'll have to see what happens.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Stem cell research, what do you think?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> She wouldn't be the first to be.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm totally, totally in favor of it. I'm in totally in favor.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What, environmentally--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I have so many people, they are sick. They're -- I know people that are dying. With proper stem cell research, they could live. I mean it's -- it just doesn't make sense what they're doing.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It -- it -- it's saying, to hell with science, Jesus first, science later, and tha -- that's scary.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a problem, it's a problem.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It is, well look I just --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> So where do you vote if tha -- this is how you're feeling., where would you vote [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't, I don't want to talk about where I'm going to vote.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What do you think he's going to do, he's going to vote for Kerry. Why don't you want to talk about it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I don't because honestly --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You've never been afraid.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Honestly I, no, I'm not at all. Although it's it's a pretty tough world out there right now, I must tell you. In terms of policy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But everyone said under Clinton, a guy like you, a wealthy man would do badly. Did you do poorly under Clinton?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a funny thing. The Republicans are known for business and yet the economy always seems to be tanked with the Republicans. And Clinton, who's a member of one of my golf clubs and who happens to be a really good guy, but you don't think of him as a business guy, the economy was never stronger.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He was a strong president.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, the thing I like about this economy, is low interest rates. But if interest rates go up, the entire real estate market collapses, the world collapses, and, you know--
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Isn't it true, that after the election, interest rates will go up?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think probably that's so. Right now they're very low. You know the real estate in New York as you know from being in New York--
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Is huge right now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's through the roof, it's never been -- I've been here doing this, I'd refuse to tell you how much, because my girlfriend would leave me if I said how many years I've been doing this.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I've been doing this for a long time, real estate. And it's the single best market I've ever seen. And that, to a large extent is that the city is perceived as doing well. I think Bloomberg is doing a very good job.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He's a great mayor.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he's doing a great job. But, beyond that, and I was with him last night, Interest rates.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What were you guys doing last night?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We went to Barbara Walters, sort of, semi retirement party.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I was going to say, she's having more farewell party
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she's had like, she's great though, you know --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Hot chic Sarah, and that's kind enough to pleasure hot chicks
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. And It didn't matter because I was, I was with Melania.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, yeah, I know.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's my hot chick.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. Of course. But you know, I just want to know if there were hot chicks there. Who is -- who's the mayor's chick Is she chick hot or is she not that hot?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's great, Diana. She's great.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I don't even know her.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very smart, very attractive, and she's terrific.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And she's much taller than him
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's taller, she's tall. She's probably six feet tall but she's --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do they have a wild sex life?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think that, I think they do.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> More in the missionary position?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think they really have a great sex life. But you know what, she's beautiful and and he's doing a terrific job. So he has to feel good about himself
<Howard Stern> <Positive> This fiance of yours, Melania. She must be terrific in bed, because for her to hold onto you, all these years. She's got to be doing something special. What's her secret?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well she is terrific in bed. Now, she wouldn't want me to say that, but she is.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is it the amount of position she knows, or is it the oral, what is it? Specifically
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's just overall terrific. I think most importantly--
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Let me ask you this, with all due respect
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But is he going to get married? I mean is she going to be the perennial fiance?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He is gonna get married. He's gonna get married
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> When are you getting married?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well some time early next year
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You set a date?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, we haven't set a date.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Are you playing her or are you really going to marry her? [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I don't have the courage to play her.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But your prenup, is it going to be like Britney Spears? She gets $300, 000 a year for every year that she's with you or the is it going to be less?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We, we're gonna have a prenup. We have to have a prenup.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Have you started working on it yet?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've written too many books, Robin, about prenups not to have one. I say you have to [Inaudible] No. I have mended to destroy it. I have friends, that are very smart, killer people, that people are afraid to even deal with them, and yet, a wife five foot two, 100 pounds, destroys them.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Me too. I know guys who I have known for years and they get married and don't sign a prenup. They are afraid to ask their women for a prenup.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I was just reading in the paper that, one of the Gotti's is having problems with his wife. I said the only people who are not afraid of mobsters seem to be the wives. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By the way, I've seen that many times.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Explain to me, you're a good judge of human character. Why is a man afraid to ask for a prenup? I mean, you would say that Melania, how do you do it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's a very tough thing. Actually, you know, doing business deals is a sort of natural and easiest as far as I'm concerned, doing prenups is a whole different deal.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Because it's emotional.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're in love with someone, you go up to her, you tell her how in love you are, you know, in the case Melania. I love you very much, you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Gorgeous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we're going to be together forever. But, just in case it doesn't work out, would you please immediately sign this. So it's -- it's not, it's you know it's an unattractive instrument [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But wait a second, if Melania says to you, all right what do you propose? And you probably say, Okay talk to my accountant, he's got a proposal for you. But you're not going to get into the nitty gritty with her, are you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm not going to get into the nitty gritty.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And do you tell her to get a lawyer?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have to have a lawyer. If she doesn't have a lawyer, which of course is a disaster, because all of a sudden she'll show up with this killer, but if she doesn't have a lawyer, you know, it doesn't hold up.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So you sit down and you say, ' Okay Melania, I will give you $300, 000 a year, for every year you're with me. If we should have kids, you get a bonus.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> What do you pay for a kid?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What do you pay for a kid, give me a ballpark.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll give them whatever they want. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. So -- so so, and then she comes back and says, not enough, but, is that it. Is that a signal to head for the hills?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's two ways, you know, there are women that won't sign prenup and they have good intentions, and there are women that won't sign prenups and they have bad intentions. Now, I know a woman who is totally in love with a guy, she refuses to sign she said, Our marriage is more than that. I honestly don't believe she's trying to rip him off. She just feels that it's a horrible thing. I don't think my -- [Inaudible
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Should the guy marry her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My father, many many years ago, he was 93 when he passed away. Many years ago, he had a 63 year marriage to a wonderful woman named my mother. Okay?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I heard that he asked her for a prenup. Can you believe this? This is like, you know --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He did, he was way ahead of his time
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's like 70 years ago.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He asked her for a prenup?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The guy was, well he was great. He was ahead of his time. And he asked her for a prenup, and she threw him out of the house. She said, actually didn't even throw him out of the house, because they didn't live together in those days, you know. In those days you get married and then you move in together. But she, he, actually asked her for a prenup and she would say, she had good intentions
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So, you haven't begun the negotiation with Melania yet?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I haven't actually begun that negotiation.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. But she's picked out her lawyer and then that will begin.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, she hasn't even picked out a lawyer, but but let me tell you
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But I admire this, because quite frankly the marriage laws are somewhat archaic. A guy like you, you've built up well, you've worked hard, I see you hustle every day. No reason just 'cause you fell in love and then out of love you should have to give up all your money.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You don't want her to be destitute if you should leave.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure you do.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why not? Let her miss it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have a friend, who's a total brutal killer. He just kills everyone. He's a very rich guy and he's had a couple of horrible marriages.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So now he meets a new woman, and tells me, 'Donald, this is the one.' Now his last one ripped him off about 50. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> The last, the one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, she was married to him for two years, she made him dinner every once in a while. Most of the time she wasn't making dinner because she was out screwing around. And then she gets $50, 000, 000.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Are you kidding, 50 mil --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Who is that guy? I want to meet him. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So now, he calls me. He said, ' Donald, I've met the one, ' because he's told me this now four times--
<Howard Stern> <Negative> How stupid.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I said, ' Listen, I know she's the one, I know she's great. By the way, where does she come from?' She's a Las Vegas showgirl.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, boy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right, All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible]. So I said, 'You're going to get a prenup right?' He said, ' Don, honestly, I don't need it.' This is one. Now here's a guy who's a genius business man but he's a schmuck.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Barracuda.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's a schmuck.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What happened to guys at home?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So, what do you say to him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So what happend, Robin, he married her two years ago, and about a week and a half ago he told me-- I said, 'how she doing?.' That son of a bitch, okay.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible] so late in the month. Its over already.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I said, 'By the way, tell me yes, tell me you had a pre-nup.' He said, 'I don't. I have to go through it again.' So--
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, my God.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I don't know. Something happens to men. I've seen it. Hey look, I happen to love Jack Welch, great business man. He had a very unusual pre-nup. He's married for 10 years to a woman, the prenup expires in 10 years and he leaves her in the eleventh year. And she sues him for $500 million.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why didn't he leave her the year--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know. You would have thought he would have left after nine and a half.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> People speculate.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You got to know something's wrong at that point.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> People speculate that your marriage to Marla Maples, you pulled the plug on it, because you're divorce, your -- your -- your -- prenup kicked into a higher amount, and so you had -- you had to divorce before a certain amount of time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, actually with Marla, it said, it has been written, of course, I would never say this, but I had, Marla didn't want to have a long pre -- she -- And I think for good reason. She thought it was a terrible instrument also, not necessary. But at the, prior to the end of the term,
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There were those that say that, what I did is said sayonara. So unless you pick somebody that's of the quality of your mother, where you have total confidence, I mean you really -- Like the Jack Welch thing, I would be--
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So you pulled the plug in time so you didn't kick into a higher amount of money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't want to say that with respect to Marla and Marla was terrific. You know, she was really terrific. Wasn't right for me, [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Why do you [Inaudible] Excuse me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Robin, Howard destroyed me at my wedding.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I know that. We all know that story.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Worst story.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I knew.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But let me ask you, why did you--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There wasn't a dry eye in the house.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Why did you put these incentives into the prenup. I mean that too, sort of smacks of, trying to build in longevity.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Robin, it is a negotiation. I mean these people aren't morons, okay. You know?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Their lawyers aren't anyway.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And their lawyers are definitely not.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Not morons.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] out of luck. But you know, the prenup, is a very vital instrument. I don't like the kind to terminate, because, you know when you have like a prenup that terminates in three or four years, and I know people to sign three or four years. It means you're getting divorced in three or four years.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Unless the guy is an idiot.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Or if you build in a higher amount, you're getting divorced in nine instead of -- You know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, I had one where a friend of mine had a three year cheap prenup and after three years it kicked into millions.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Like a balloon situation.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But who the hell is going to stay with someone?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he did sayonara at two and a half. Two point nine.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And by the way, I think this marriage of yours will be completely different. I believe it will last six years.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, six years is a little.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I appreciate that.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> That's romantic, that's romantic
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, you have a lot of dating left in you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, but he was wrong on Marla though, he predicted three months. And the sad part was, he predicted it on television, my wedding night. Being a maniac, that I am, I go back to the suite and instead of making love, I decide let's turn on the television because we had more paparazzi that night than you've ever seen.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You had a lot of photographer
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Even by U. S. Standards, that's was a record.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> A record.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There were thousands. I mean you never saw-- So, I say I want to see what it looks like on television and this is not off to a good start. I say, 'Lay in bed. So, I turn on the television and who do they see --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Me
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I say, 'Uh, it's Howard.'
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And first of all,
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What did he say?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All of America said, 'Oh, it's Howard.'
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, he's the worst. Well, I didn't like it. She cried the entire week over what you said. It was true. He said -- He said, 'There wasn't a wet eye in the house. That was written. In other words, nobody was crying [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Right, no sentiment at all
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There was no sentiment at all. And he said, I give the marriage three months. So these were the two statements that I went to bed with with my wife.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> On your first night.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hey, listen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This was not good. But, in the meantime he had a good time. You sat right next to O.J. Simpson.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> O.J. And I had a great night.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You found out that O.J., you know, just prior to killing--
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> O. J's a great guy aside from the fact that he's a killer
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> He is good at a party.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> The wedding put him overboard
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible] O.J. Anymore, do you
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, I'll tell you,
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He's a member of Mar-a-Lago
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know a lot about O.J. He was a member of Mar-a-Lago, he's not a member anymore. O.J. Was perhaps the most guilty human being I've ever seen, okay.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No doubt.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, of the glove doesn't fit-- Here's a guy, puts a glove on, I can do that. So, he takes a glove that obviously fits and he's pulling it, and this stupid Marcia Clark, I mean she has to be the worst--
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Worst of them.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> That's true, they didn't do their job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, I'm not sure that anybody could have convince that particular jury.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right, I agree.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But he takes this glove, puts it on and he starts going like this, 'This, it doesn't fit, it doesn't fit.' And I mean, that was just a whole disgraceful thing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But O.J. Simpson sat right next to Howard Stern, in one of the great pictures that I have, and you know because you used at the back your my book.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You had to get a sign off for Donald Trump.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I did.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] because the book was a big success.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Said I want 10 %.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You gave me that for free.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> Getting away murder?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I -- I actually, I'll tell you a story about O.J. That was interesting. Prior to the killing, prior to the time he killed his wife.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Did he talk to you about it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't belive, every once in a while
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> Prior to the Double homicide.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Every once in a while --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It's hard to believe that that guy, killed someone.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Inaudible] we even talk about. The juice, prior to the killing I was with somebody and O.J. Came up, I was at a table in California, at a certain restaurant, The Ivy, which I'm sure you know very well.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm sitting having dinner and O.J. Came up to me and he was talking -- And I was with very important people, big bankers. Nobody that you know, big big bankers. And I was sitting there, there were six of us. And O.J. Came up and he's talking to us for about three minutes and Nicole was with her mother, I think, and she came over and she started screaming at him, 'Get over to the table what the hell you-, ' she was rough. Okay, in all fairness. So he decided obviously to kill her.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That might have been, might have been right at the Ivy that he just said that
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She was very tough. She came over and she really embarrassed him. She was screaming at him, get over here, She didn't care. And that was before The Apprentice so she didn't give a damn about me. Now she'd be kissing my ass.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You never--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now I'm the biggest star on television she'll kiss my ass, but you know what,
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You would never kill one of your ex-wives, would you?
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> In what order?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I could think about.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It would almost be that absurd to think that O.J. Killed his ex-wife. And like It would be that absurd to think you killed your ex-wife. I've read that in the paper and either way it was out of character it seemed for a nice O.J.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It seemed out of character, other than all of the beatings that were called into the police station and later retracted. There were a number of them Howard, like about six times.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So get back to your relationship with Melania
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, she did call six times and screamed, 'help, help, help, he's beating me up, he's beating me up.' And then the next day they dropped the charges. That's not totally normal that's not Fred and Mary Trump, do you agree?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Go back to -- Yes, I do agree. Let's go back to you and Melania for one second, before we move on to The Apprentice. So you're going to get married and this woman has captivated you. I mean, it's not easy, because she is capturing your heart and you've got to you've got a lot of options.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have a lot of options.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes, she must be something really special because you had, the pick of every body.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> A friend of mine said to me, I know a guy who gets a lot of poontang, not as much as Mr. Trump, but a lot of poontang. And he says to me, 'I'm getting married,' I go, 'What, what what are you, are you crazy? He says, 'Every morning I wake up, she's giving me oral. Now, I said, 'Then I understand. She might be the biggest pain in the ass, but I understand.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, the National Enquirer Howard, did a story on me not so long ago. That, in the history of the world, nobody has gotten more beautiful women, that I have, which is a great compliment. In fact, many years ago I was on your show and you were putting all of them up in posters, you remember?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, I had a chart.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How was this one, how was that one? [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And by the way, I'm sure I missed thousands.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You missed a lot of them.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I did. Actually, some of the ones on the charts, were not victims, understood.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But but you missed quite a few. But that's okay. So that was a great compliment. So, Melania, must have something. And you know what it is? I've been, I believe in the woman behind the man, and the man behind the woman. But I believe in the woman behind the man. I mean, I think women don't get enough credit.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I've never done it with the woman behind me, but go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Take a look at Andre Agassi, he's with Brooke Shields.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Disaster.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Life is a mess, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was the number one player in the world. He meets Brooke Shields, falls in love, marries her. He goes to 292 player. You know about that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> She ruined him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, something happened. I mean they say, maybe an affair, or this, who knows?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who knows?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean who knows? The guy that died on the program, who the hell knows what happened. But he goes from number one to number 292. He's a disaster. I watched him play at the U. S. Open three years ago, three years ago, he got wiped out in the first round. He didn't even get play. It was like terrible. I said this doesn't say he's gotten old.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> All of a sudden, he meets Steffi Graf.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Now he's great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's the number one player in the world. I mean he's, he goes --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, would you want to stay home with Steffi Graf?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, Steffi Graf
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She's probably motivated?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no Steffi Graf is a great girl and she is one of the greatest
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She's not hot, though.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's got one of the greatest bodies out there.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> She's beautiful? [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But what about the face?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Honestly, Robin.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right. Body is a 10, what's the face?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you never get to the face, because the body is so good.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You wouldn't go out with Steffi Graf, she's not hot enough for you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, it doesn't matter. The point is that he --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But you are avoiding the question about Melania.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Here's what happened.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And did it [Inaudible] pit out like never before?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, It's everything. It's not sexual, it's the friendship,
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Is it the oral?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's everything.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Guys always love -- Do you, are you you an oral guy? I'm not a big fan of that. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This show is always a disaster
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You're in a corner now,
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Listen Robin, other than the fact, this guy is a friend of mine, this show is always a disaster.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Be straight me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The last time Howard said, everything gets really like, I always get in trouble on this show. And I try and be as nice as I can, I try and avoid his crazy questions.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible] not often.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you always make -- Let me tell you last time, Howard said very clearly, ' Does Melania have cellulite? Now, Melania is one of the greatest bodies I've ever seen.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I've seen it up close.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's one of the greats. Does she have se-. And I said, 'Melania, doesn't even know what the word cellulite means. ' Now I said that very clearly [and I thought that was wonderful. One of the newspapers in New York did a whole big story on the fact that Melania doesn't know what cellulite is.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Like she's stupid or something.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Like she's a dummy, and she is not a dummy. So I get killed. So, almost no matter what you say on this show, when they analyze everything I've said today, I'm sure there are four or five things [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Is oral -- Let go at it in a different way. Is oral sex important to you? What was that?
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> That was our high pitch [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Seriously, man to man. I mean, I've had this discussion with many men.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's not important to me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It's not.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By the way, you had Kylie Bax on this show.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's a piece of ass I could not [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah that's right. And she was a friend of mine.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Did you do her? Be honest,
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's I don't want to say Look, it was the single worst performance I've ever seen. I mean, I think you destroyed her on this show. When she said she liked the anal, and the this, and that, and that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. You're not into anal.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Did you you that with her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, I'm not into anal. No I didn't do that with her
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You got Kylie Bax, you son of a gun.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No I didn't say that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I want that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But she was a friend of mine and she was a nice girl, and all of a sudden I see her on the show talking about anal and this and Marcus?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> She took a calculated risk, it was wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was on the other night and so I keep playing, keep playing it
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah and you don't hear any more, do you?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It ruined her.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was like, I can't believe it
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She took one for the team. So -- So --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She did, she gave you some really bad answers.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yes. Yes. Talk to me about what's going on now with The Apprentice. You now have three guys. You were the original, but you have two other guys, who I'll say, who are attempting to steal your thunder.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Mark Cuban.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> One of them came in here the other day, Mark Cuban, billionaire. He's got a show on now that's very similar to The Apprentice.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Benefactor.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> With no ratings
<Howard Stern> <Negative> With no ratings.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Doing very badly.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And then you got this other guy coming out, the other billionaire.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Who's that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Richard Branson.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Richard Branson.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He is actually a good guy. I think that show has a better shot. Here is what happens.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> The virgin guy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have a show that, you see the ratings this week?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What was it rated at?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You were number one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We were the number one show.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And in fact, the New York Times did a front page story this Sunday that The Apprentice was not only number one, it was number one since May. In other words it's the number one show since May. The last Thursday.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Gary [Inaudible] who's a big fan of your show says that the 90 minute format, too long, he loves it but he'd rather see an hour. What do you think of that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, what they did is they open to 90 minutes, only for one reason, because it gets good ratings
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it did phenomenally. And frankly, they would like to have it on for two hours. You know on Saturday night to put a two hour version on, and Saturday night is the biggest Saturday night that NBC has had in over a year.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> With that kind of clout, you pressured NBC into paying you more money, did you not?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I did.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So now you're getting what, a million an episode?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Uh, much more than that. But, let me tell you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> More than a million? Is that true?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Listen, Howard,
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> How is that Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let me tell you. Let me tell you, let me tell you the economics and then you'll understand.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You saying you're getting Schwimmer money?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm getting good money, but you know what? NBC, Jeff Zucker, is so smart and so tough and so good that it's very hard to get money from.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, no, no. I'm saying a million dollars, to pay you a million dollars, is not a lot of money if -- Considering what they get in advertising.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They are going to make a billion dollars off The Apprentice.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And they --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But he didn't get a million, go on and tell us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. Let me explain. Let me explain what happened. I signed the first one, everyone thought it would be off and you know, would do fine. It would maybe get a cou -- And you know, then Trump goes back to building buildings in Manhattan and having a lot of fun.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And having a good life. Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know it's good, It's fine. And they paid me peanuts.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But the show went to number one.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And now they said, ' Please we beg you, let's do more. This is very very good. So this was a little bit of a surprise. It opened strong, it opened at number 10, it went to eight and five and four.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Became very popular.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Became two and one. And last show, you know, the live show was 41.5 million people watched, the Super Bowl beat it. Okay, that was it. It was this monster show. So you know, people dropped to their knees and they say, 'Please let's do more.' So --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So you say, 'I want more money.'
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Here's what happened. I said I'll do more. I read an article where the friends people get 2 million dollars an episode. Right, Robin?. So, I said to Jeff Zucker and everybody at NBC, I'll do it but I want friends type money.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. I think that's reasonable
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right. And they said, well maybe we can work something like that out. And he said, they said they get two million dollars an episode, I said no no no. There's six of them.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That get two million dollars an episode,
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> There's one of you
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And there's one of me
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You want 12 million an episode.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, and then I said, there's six of them so that's 12, right. I'm thinking about, I'm taking like Howard thinks coz I hear he is one of the great contracts in history.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh yeah, I'm rolling
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Then I said, They said well, that's ridiculous, how dare you suggest that. Then I said, well, wait a minute, let's go a little further there. My ratings are higher than friends now, by a lot, and the other thing is it's an hour program. In transition it was a half hour.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know who told me that one? I have a golf pro who's mentally ret -- I mean he's like, really not a smart guy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm playing golf and I'm thinking about, what I'm going to tell NBC and this golf pro comes up to me and he tells me, yeah but your show's an hour and F. R.I. E.N. D.S is a half hour. He's obviously F. R.I. E.N. D.S watcher.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And there are six people they say.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So they pay six people two million dollars a piece, for a half hour show. I'm one person and I have an hour show and I have higher ratings than they do.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And you don't even have to have writers.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So I said,
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> I'm saying, I bet the production cost here is [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, what I told them, I said so I should be paid $24 million an episode. I didn't get it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You didn't get 24 million?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I didn't get it. I didn't even get close.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> It's a good starting point.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Mark Cuban is this guy from the other show. I don't even know the name there. What is the name there?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Benefactor.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Benefactor, okay. So he, did you see page six today, he came out he blasted you. He you says you need the money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. Let me, let me about Mark Cuban. I think he needs the money because, this guy just so you understand, and according to Forbes which does the wealth. I'm a much richer guy than Mark Cuban,
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He claims that you lie about your wealth. He says you claim that you're worth 1.3 billion and you're not even worth that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, I claim I'm worth six billion and Forbes I'm worth 2.5 billion. But let me tell you about Mark Cuban. Mark Cuban is trying to get publicity because his show is failing so badly
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it's a disaster.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So, he's using you. He's using you
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Everybody uses his me. Women use me, you use me, Mark Cuban used me.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Oh, stop.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I use you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think I'll take that back.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Stop.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no, I'm a ratings machine Howard's gonna get gr -- great credits.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But now, Mark Cuban, maybe he needs the money, I don't know why he's doing it. Because there's no way that this show can be successful. Now, wait a minute.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But why disparage you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It opened -- Because he gets publicity when he disparages me, everybody does.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But is true that you need -- He claims, this is what he claims. That, Donald Trump --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, let me tell you, wait before you -- Howard -- Howard. Excuse me. Before you say it, he said that Donald Trump's not as good a businessman as you think. Okay. And he mentioned four deals.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> One is Trump Ice. It's the hottest water there is, its Trump Ice it's water, it's not a big deal
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I drink Trump water.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Listen, it's great. It's a very successful thing. It's just, well, she said it's a failure. I said, 'Has it?' The other is, Trump online university. Last week I filed to do possibly an online university.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> So you haven't done it yet.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, he said it's a failure and I said, you just apply. The other thing he said was a failure was Trump World magazine.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Which is just about to launch.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Excuse me, we launch tonight. We haven't even gotten out yet. And it's it's going to be -- And by the way it's going to be a success. So, he mentions this stuff, he doesn't mention my real estate in New York which is through the roof. Which is the big stuff by the way, I'm the biggest -- I'm the biggest developer.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He claimed that you don't own those buildings, he says that you're like a real estate broker. They just stick your name on it. This is what he said me. I was shocked.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Howard, I own the buildings.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Not, first of all, let me explain something --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Do you own all of the buildings that have your name on it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I own large percentages of the building. Let me tell you, not because I have partners put up money. I mean I like people to put up money, why should I put it up?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> But that's fine I just wanted to make that clear.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But, you know.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He said you were the janitor of those buildings. That you were really not the owner.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You really clean the buildings.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You just clean the buildings, you get a percentage.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let me tell you, Mark is the janitor of ABC. Because if you look at what he's doing with the ratings, and actually Page Six which I think is a great page is wrong one thing. They showed the ratings for the first week, they didn't show that they were way down for the second week. His first week ratings were abysmal the second week really went down. So anyway,
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It's a disaster.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Let me ask one thing though, about your business.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Benefactor a disaster
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Let me ask one thing about your business. What is going on with the casinos?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The casinos have been very good to me over the years. I mean, I've made a lot of money in the casino business.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I've given you a lot of money because you know
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Yeah, me too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Over the years Howard, over the years I've made lot of money in the casino business. It's been a great investment for me as an entrepreneur. Now what I'm doing is reducing the debt of the casinos, because now you can't buy land in Manhattan. First of all I have much of it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you can't buy land in Manhattan because it's too expensive. So now what I'm doing is focused on reducing the debt of the casinos, and again, when the casino company was private, I put a lot of financing on. And I took them.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Bottom-line you are worth 2.3 minimally 2.3 billion maybe [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Forbes said 25, but I've always disputed Forbes. But no I just say Fo -- I don't want to talk about wealth but Forbes says 2.5 then Mark Cuban said--
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So you're every bit as rich a Marck Cuban.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he's rated much lower than me.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thank you. All right that's all I needed to know.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> But my question is, how could you say, you know, I think when the bankruptcy, you know, because we've pointed this out the last time you were here. We realized that whatever you do you say, 'It's the most fantastic. It's the greatest thing.'
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's not true.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You started, you start every sentence, with that was fantastic, this was the greatest.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> When do I say that? I don't say that.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I have the greatest Tv show, I have the greatest television --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Excuse me, you know what, I'd say it when it's true. Hey Robin the hottest show in television I have the number one show on television. So why shouldn't say that?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But wait a minute, I couldn't believe it
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's a very negative person.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Oh, stop it. I couldn't believe it though when, you know, I heard that, you know, they were going Chapter 11 that they were wait a minute.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No no, but that's, Robin that's just what we just said, that' called intelligence system
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Take it easy cause, he says, all right you know, [Inaudible] said wow Trump, you know, has about bankruptcy on his casinos in Atlantic City and Trump said yes this is the greatest thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's true, actually it's true. Let me. It's true. It's very much like this, I know what I'm going to say. I only say good, if it's good. But just so you said, the casinos are a very small part, less than one percent of my net worth. But they are important to me because I've been there for a while. I've made a lot of money with the casinos over a 15 year period over a 16 year period. I made a lot of money. But now what I'm doing is making the casinos great. I would be willing to bet. It's less than 1 percent of my net worth, I would be willing to bet in years to come it's going to be a big portion of my net worth. And let's see, because I'll be doing this show for many years until [Inaudible]

<Donald Trump> <Negative> Once I got over the shock. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You know once I got over the horror of it all. [Inaudible] What would be horrible for you see me walking down the aisle with your daughter.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I, I'd be impressed. If you could do that I probably would be very impressed with you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That would be a good move.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But I'm still trying to find out what the will says.

<Donald Trump> <Negative> No wonder the Bush tax plan, Howard

<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But you know. You know can take out, you know you can take out insurance [Inaudible] in the uh, your estate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know if you've ever thought of this, this plan. 20 percent every two years. At the end of 10 years at the during the eighth or ninth and tenth year you pay nothing. You know that, right. Zero. If you die one day later, the government gets all of your money. So they're going to be a lot of billionaires that are killed by their children.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But wait a second, prior to that night.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, prior to 12 O'clock
<Howard Stern> <Negative> With the Bush plan, you got to think of this. Iin 12 years, no country left.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that's a gigger problem.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's a problem, that's a bigger problem. What is it about [Inaudible]
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> You know what we we're talking about last week, we're talking about how on the show there's a lot of uh product placement this season. We're talking, like the first one to tell toys, at the right I think it's crest . And Howard and I we're trying to figure out, what kind of money do you get out of those guys
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Tremendous money. You know it's very interesting. The first Apprentice, again, nobody knew what who it was, anything about it, so we didn't have that. We sold lemonade, we did a restaurant ; This time we have Pepsi-Cola, we have Mattel, we have toys are us, we have, we have Levis, we have crest toothpaste. Tonight, Procter and Gamble is launching a new toothpaste called crest element on our show. They paid a tremendous amount of money. You know the only guy and I'll say this, the only guy that wanted to be on Apprentice one, was a man named George Steinbrenner. I called him up just before the Boston series.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. The end of [Inaudible] The day before, I said George, I'm doing this show. He said, 'What show?' I said, 'The Apprentice' He said, 'All right.' I said lecture the kids on winning as a reward. He said, ' Good, bring them all.' I couldn't believe it. Nobody could. NBC couldn't believe it
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now everybody wants to be on.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, I have the, richest, biggest, most important people wanting to be on the Apprentice.

<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> By the way, did Mr. Trump meet our intern and was he Impressed?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Your intern is very pretty.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She wants you
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> She she was dying to meet you.

<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Dominic.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Dominic he loves you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love Dominic
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, He loves you, he loves you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How did he deal with the weight, he got the little operation. How did he do.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He said or he looks like he looks like a like a helium balloon that they let out all the air. He's he's It's odd to see him walking around thin. He looks hungry.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well has it been successful
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes he has lost the weight. He is thinner.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> He still looks like a fat guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let me tell you about Do -- I've known Dominic a long time. Number one, he's a good attorney, a really good attorney and he's also a good guy. Now he'll probably get on and kill me
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But he looks like a deflated beach ball.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's too bad.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You have to see it.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Looks like all of his [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Come on, Let's find Dominic, let's get
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Mr. Trump, it's always an honor to have you on. I'm fascinated with your success. You're everything Trump, in fact, I even saw in the paper today you're launching a series of Donald Trump talking dolls.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh I didn't see that.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He's even doing things he doesn't know.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. And uh --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a lot of good people that work for me
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It even says 17 phrases, which includes you're fired.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> One of my problems with the show is that now these people won't disappear. One of my problems with reality shows is that the people never disappear once they go through a season.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Especially The Apprentice people. I mean you look at Omarosa, you look at some of these people, that were all over the place
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What an annoying woman,
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They've become stars.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know we had over a million people apply for the second apprentice. We had 215 for the first which is a record, now we had over a million and we have unbelievable people on the show. But you know what happens, I think now they're applying not to work for me. They want to be stars.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, that's true.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm afraid at the end, they'll say, we don't want the job, I want to make movies.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You'll see Donald Trump on the Apprentice tonight at 9 o'clock on NBC. A very controversial show. You fired a guy last week after the guy said, ' I give up my immunity because I know I did a good job, '
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> And you said that's stupid
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You said, 'you're an idiot.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he made a mistake. I mean he walked in we had given him a total immunity. He said, ' I give up, ' as a you know show of bravado. 'I give up my immunity I give it up Mr. Trump My team is wonderful.' I said to myself he's gone
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Good call . All right. Donald Trump, thank you for coming in. Always great seeing you. And I assume I'll be invited to your wedding
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> The next wedding.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> The next wedding.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean we have to [Inaudible] them.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You have to --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You're going to go through that again.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm just going to have a [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He's a good love charm, I would go
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, yeah. He's a a great lecture I'll assume Melania is gonna be thrilled. [Inaudible] You know after hearing this story Howard Stern, believe me, I lit up the last wedding He's not allowed to talk to the press.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I lit up the last wedding.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh yeah. You made all the news cast. Yeah I think Melania likes me.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know the O.J. Thing happened one week after the wedding you know that right
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Was it one week?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It was very very short period after the wedding that he was driving.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I remember that, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Was one of the great scenes in television history was that white van driving down the freeway with about seven hundred police cars in front of him and he didn't look like he had a good chance.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That was the alternate reality show.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Who was the biggest reality star though, O.J. Or Donald Trump?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> O. J still holds the right there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, I'd give it O.J. All day long.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible] you're on the air, quickly because Mr. Trump is very busy making money. Go ahead.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> All right. I happen to know the football player that Donald Trump tried to set her daughter up for.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Who was it?
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> It would be Tom Brady of the New England Patriots
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You want him doing your daughter?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a great guy. First of all, I don't admit to that John C. But you know he is a great guy. He's a member of my golf club. He's a terrific terrific
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You would have approved of him as a son in law?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He wanted him as a son in law.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean you look at this guy, first of all he always throws the pass accurately. He always wins the Super Bowl. He always wins the game.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> White.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's the most, I didn't hear that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Would you let your daughter date a black guy? Like what does she put home Dennis Rodman Rodman
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He's a blue blood.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What's your next question?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Ivanka Rodman
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> My daughter is a very open minded I would say that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Beautiful daughter.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I did I think Tom Brady is a fantastic guy. And you know, one of those
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Dominic What did you want
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Maybe he'll marry Tiffany
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Hello Dominic, Quickly because I have to end the interview. Yes.
<Dominic Barbara> <Positive> Quick. Two things; Number one, the best way to protect your prenup is do it on video.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<Dominic Barbara> <Positive> It's a guarantee
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Do you do [Inaudible]
<Dominic Barbara> <Neutral> I do it all the time.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No, I was asking Donald.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donald, do you do that? Would you video tape your prenup?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's a good idea. A lot of, I do video in other ways but I don't do video necessarily for prenup.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I would put mine out on DVD, CD.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What do you mean you do video another way?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know a lot, of you do a lot of video contracts nowadays, but I don't think in terms of that so much with Melania because like everybody else I say it'll never happen. Nothing bad is going to happen and I really believe that. But I think it's not a bad idea. Dominic, you're right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I would put it on pay per view. So that everyone can see.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's right, I'm afraid the problem with me doing the video I'm afraid somebody is going to get it and they're going to broadcast it on ABC so that ABC can finally get some ratings.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Dominic Barbara> <Negative> And Finally the way you talk a woman into a prenup is that, the year before when you sign a contract with the bank or any of your bank business dealings, you put into that contract, that they you require a prenup then when you sit with them [Inaudible] you say, But wait a minute I had no choice, don't you see, y business partners wanted.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you do that Mr Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Dominic, let me ask you about this, What about giving them the pre-nup about 15 minutes before the wedding ceremony.
<Dominic Barbara> <Negative> Absolutely not, I'd do a video, I've been [Inaudible] for 35 years. And Howard I do not look like a deflated beach ball.[laugher]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It's a one man's opinion that's all. All right, Listen that's Dominic Barbara but Donald Trump, continued success.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And we'd love having you on here. And I don't know who's more successful you, Mark Cuban. But I know you're sexier than Mark Cuban,
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That's what counts.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely. That one is easy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It's going to get [Inaudible] People are going to try and imitate your success. You got to be prepared for it. You've got to be prepared.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They are doing it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Donald Trump, The Apprentice tonight at 9 o'clock on NBC. We'll be back right after these words.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, nice to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hello, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, Donald, big news. You've endorsed Governor Mitt Romney. I'm curious, back in December, when you were going to host a debate, he said that he couldn't make your debate, that his schedule didn't permit it, and you told me that you thought his excuse was far-fetched. So why are you so -- why are you in his corner now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, he called me right after that, actually, right after I spoke to you, and we had a little talk. And frankly, he was very respectful and very good. And I think maybe he would have done it, if I really wanted it. I'm not sure. But he was very respectful, and I understood his reasons for not doing it fully.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What were his reasons fully? Because at the time, it looked like he just didn't want to do it with you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, for one thing, no I don't think so at all, for one, because we were actually very friendly and continue to be. For one thing, he was leading and he figured, you know, Why should I jeopardize a possible lead? And I can understand that. And I did understand that, actually. He called me. He couldn't have been nicer.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I fully understood. And I think he might have done it if I really asked hard.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, but the first -- at first he says it's a scheduling thing, and then he moves to the story -- or I shouldn't say story, but then he moves to another thing to you and says It's not a scheduling thing, the real thing that I was leading in the polls. So he changed it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, this is what I was saying. I was saying that, frankly, from his standpoint, I could understand why he wasn't doing it, and I felt it was because he was doing very well. And what did he need to jeopardize it for? But I think he might have done it, had I really wanted it. But I didn't do that. And then, ultimately, it ended up where I decided not do it for the other reasons, including the fact that a lot of people wanted me to run and polls showed me doing very well, so I decided not to do it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, give me sort of the behind the scenes, how these endorsements go on. I mean, what -- I mean, in -- like, in the past two weeks, do you get a bunch of phone calls from all the candidates and they say, you know, Donald, I really need your help, and you say, Well, I need to know this. I mean, take me back to, like, when this really sort of got going in earnest, your decision-making.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think it really got going a number of months ago when people came up to Trump Tower. And I really developed a lot of good friendships out of it, to be honest with you. And I had a lot of respect -- - as an example, I have a lot of respect for Newt. I think he's a terrific guy. And we really, I think, have a really good relationship.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But it just worked that I watched what happened over the last number of weeks. I loved what Mitt was saying about China and the rest of the world, which is just absolutely ripping us off and trying to destroy this nation with a smile. And I think that Mitt Romney really sees China for what they are. I think he understands OPEC and what's going on with this phony OPEC -- - you could call it a monopoly or call it whatever you want, but what they do is unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Their streets are paved in gold, and we are just -- you know, we're riddled with potholes in our country. And I think, really, he gets what's happening to this country and he sees what's going on with other people just taking the money out of our back pocket.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, besides the positions that you share with him, that you endorsed him for, I'm just sort of curious how sort of the mechanics go. Did you call him, like, yesterday and say, OK, Mitt, you're the guy, or did he call you? Have you been going back and forth? I'm just curious how it works out.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think we've been calling each other. I've developed a very good relationship with him over the last couple of months, and even a little bit prior to that. I see him as a very tough guy and a very smart guy...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But just...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... and that's what we need. He's sharp...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I understand what -- I Understand that you like him and you've endorsed him and for substantive reasons. I'm just trying to understand, like, did you call him up and say, OK, I'd like to speak to the governor, and did you have a private conversation with him yesterday? Because there's sort of a lot of intrigue.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> The media was trying to guess what you were doing last night. We were checking schedules. And I'm just sort of -- I want sort of the behind the scenes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I'd rather not get into it. I don't want to say I called, he called. It doesn't make any difference. I mean, over the last couple of weeks, it was obvious to him and to me where I was going. And I feel very happy about and very really content that I did the right thing. I mean, I think he's going to be terrific.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think he's going to run a great campaign. He'll probably win now, and I think he'll probably beat Obama. Obama's got tremendous baggage, tremendous! If you look at what -- I mean, just today, if you look at the numbers that came out, they think that unemployment is going up to 9.2 percent by the end of the year and that growth is down to 1 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think Obama's got tremendous baggage. Personally -- I don't know where these polls are coming from, but personally, I think it's going to be very hard for Obama to win.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You said earlier that you had a good friendship over the past couple months you developed with all the candidates. One of them is Speaker Gingrich. Did you call him and tip him off and say, Look, you know, I just got to let you know I made my decision, you're not my guy?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I called him a couple of times last night on a number that I have, and there was no response on that number. So I wanted to call him. I did call him. I like him. I respect him. And he's a terrific guy.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. And so -- and I assume now with this announcement, that your plans are you're not going to run as an independent unless there's some unforeseen circumstance. At least, tonight that's your plan, you're not going to run.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, if Mitt Romney wins, obviously, I wouldn't run. Otherwise, you'd really have a story, right? You endorse somebody and then you decide to run. So I don't think that works out very well. But no, if Mitt Romney wins, I would certainly not, and as you know, I can't run during the course of "The Apprentice" anyway, which starts in another two weeks.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So no, I think Mitt is going to do really well. I think he's going to be an amazing candidate. I think he'd going to do great against President Obama.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What do you think the impact of your particular endorsement is? Because there's also some sort of question, like, you know, what do endorsements mean. They certainly get a lot of attention, and to the extent that they replace any having to pay for advertising, you get a lot of attention on a candidate. But I'm curious, yours in particular, what does it bring to Governor Romney?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And who do you -- what voters do you bring along?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think I bring a lot of people. But first of all, I have a great relationship, as you know, with the Tea Party folks. I mean, I love the Tea Party. They've really made this world aware of what's going on with our country. So I have a great relationship there. I have a great relationship with the entire Christian Coalition.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have amazing friendships in that whole group. And I love them and I respect them. And you know, I think I have great, great relationships. I'm a Presbyterian, which shocks a lot of people, Protestant Presbyterian. They say, I don't believe it, Donald. But I have great relationships there. And maybe most importantly, I have great relationships with the people of this country that are tired of being ripped off by China and by OPEC and by everybody else that does business with us. And they're just draining trillions of dollars out of the pockets of our citizens.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I have a great relationship with them. So I really have some very strong relationships with a lot of great people, and I think that carries forward. I don't know. I mean, I don't know if they like me or what I say, but it seems to carry. And I can tell you that people wanted my endorsement. And when you were up at 8 or 9 candidates, most of those candidates really wanted my endorsement.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And you saw what happened today and the hoopla. Well, I think it's hoopla because they do respect my opinion and they do want to see this country stopped being ripped off by virtually everybody that does business with us.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> In terms of the Christian Coalition that you said you have a good relationship with, I think many people think that, you know, to the extent you generalize about what groups go which direction, is that Senator Rick Santorum has a very close relationship with the Christian Coalition, as well as Speaker Gingrich.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Can you peel off those voters that he has, that those two men have, and move them over to the Romney candidate? And are you actively going to go out and try to peel off those voters for Governor Romney?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I don't know. I mean, I'm not sure that endorsements in terms of that -- people like Bob Vander Plaats, who's a fantastic guy. When he gave, as you know, Rick Santorum, the -- when he was in Iowa and gave him the endorsement, that had a huge impact, a very powerful endorsement, one of the most powerful that I've seen.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I have great respect for people like Franklin Graham. And so many of the people that I deal with, I know, I like. Now, as to what -- and they like me. But whether or not that really can translate into Mitt Romney, I really can't say. But I know Mitt Romney. And I've gotten to know him very well. And he's a fine man, but he's a tough man, and he's a smart man, and that's what we need in this country.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, you say that, but then if you sort of rewind back to I think last April, I think you -- I think it was on another network, you talked about Governor Romney and you were sort of less effusive about his business skills. Is that just sort of, you know, talking, or have things changed? Do you all of a sudden have a greater impression about his business skills?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I only got to know him over the last three or four months. I mean, I haven't known him for a very long period of time, and I didn't know too much about him. And certainly, he's done an amazing job and he's put a lot of people to work. And he's really -- I think he's starting to be very proud, to be honest with you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I actually told him, I said, You've done a great job, you put tremendous numbers of people to work. I mean, you know, with a lot of the companies that we're talking about, they would take over sick puppies and make them better in many occasions, not in all occasions because sometimes it just doesn't work.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But they take over these sick companies and make them better.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> How do you convince -- there's a huge or significant Tea Party contingency in Nevada, and they tend to be people who are really sort of tired of the status quo. How do you convince them that Governor Mitt Romney isn't the status quo, that -- you know, that he is really someone who is going to make significant changes?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Because I think these people want bigger changes than just your -- you know, than many other voters.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, first of all, he's not the status quo. And I know him on a personal level and he really is a little bit different. You know, when you get to know some people -- I've been for so many years in politics, and sometimes you see somebody on air and that's what you have on a personal basis. Mitt Romney is a warm, terrific guy, smart as can be, and really, he's got a tough edge to him, which is a tremendous thing because we need a tough edge in this country.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He gets it. He's a great businessman. I think he's a really natural businessman, which is very important. And I think he'll do a great job. And I think the people in the Tea Party, when they really get to know him, I think they're going to really like him and they're going to pick up the banner because he will be a great candidate.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think he's going to out-debate -- you look at what happened those last two debates. He was fantastic. And frankly, Newt admitted that. I mean, Newt was a little bit off. But he admitted it. I mean, Mitt Romney did an amazing job in those debates, the last two in particular. And if he does that with Obama, Obama is not going to look very good, in my opinion.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, there are different skill sets in terms of being a good debater, being a good campaigner, being a good executive, I mean, all different sorts of skill sets. I'm curious -- did your sort of compare and contrast in your selection of Governor Romney? And I assume you looked ahead to see who would be the best president out of the four remaining candidates.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What is it that -- where would Governor Romney be a different president than a Speaker Gingrich and a Senator Santorum and a Representative Paul?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it's a very big question you're asking, and it would take a long time to really go through it. But -- and frankly, I respect everybody. I respect all four. I respect people in politics. I mean, it's a tough life. It's a miserable life, I will say. I mean, I've become -- I've always been in politics.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've always been involved in politics, but the longer you're involved, the more respect you gain for politicians. It's not an easy life. But I just think that he would have the best chance of getting elected. I think he would have...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... the best chance of beating -- because I think he's a very capable guy with a great story to tell. I think that he will do really well. I was so happy to see the last two debates because I think he will do really well in a one-on-one with President Obama. I think he's going to do really, really well. And Obama has a lot of baggage.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's somebody that really has baggage because the economy is bad and probably getting worse. If you look at what the numbers that just came out of Washington, they're predicting a 9.2 percent unemployment by election time. And you're talking about a number -- - and by the way, 1 percent growth. I've never heard of 1 percent growth before! You look at China, they're at 10 percent, 11 percent, 12 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're at 1 percent? So this is what we have. And there are many other things. So I think that he's got tremendous baggage, and I think that Mitt Romney will be a great candidate.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, if someone has such tremendous baggage and if the unemployment level does move in an upward direction, I think everyone -- I don't think anyone doubts that that puts extreme vulnerability -- makes the president extremely vulnerable in November. So I'm just sort of curious if you -- you said to me before that all of them could beat President Obama.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> So I'm just sort of curious. If you look at who you thought would actually be the best president -- and I same that you looked at some factors and made some sort of compare and contrast among them. So I'm trying to understand why you're throwing your weight behind Governor Romney and not the other three.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, first of all, I didn't say they could all beat President Obama. I said that I think that Mitt Romney can beat him. But I never said they could all beat President Obama. I don't think it's going to be an easy election because one thing is for sure, Obama is a good campaigner. I don't think he's as good as people think because if you look at Hillary, he was just limping across the finish line.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She almost won, and she should have won. And if she would have started out a little stronger, she would have won. So I'm not so sure that he's such a great campaigner, but he is certainly known as being a good campaigner. But I don't think they can all beat President Obama. I'm not -- you know, I don't know where you got that from.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, I'm curious, do you think -- this is a hypothetical. Do you think Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would have been a better president, in your mind, than President Obama?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, I do.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> In what way.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think she would have been a better -- first of all, I think we would have had a more unified country. We wouldn't have had a country where the Republicans hate the Democrats. I used to -- I dealt with Republicans and Democrats all my life, and they'd argue and they'd fight and then make deals and they'd go out to lunch together and they'd like each other.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, these people actually are enemies now. I've never seen anything like it. And I know them on both sides of the aisle. I've never seen anything like it. But the country is in turmoil, and the hatred of this country toward other groups is incredible. So the leadership is so lacking. I always thought that Obama was going to be a great cheerleader, at a minimum, a great cheerleader...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What happened?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... and he's really not.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Why didn't he...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Class warfare...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Why didn't you spot that ahead of time?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think what he's doing -- he's done so badly as president, he's been so pathetic and he's done such a bad job as president that the only way he's going to get elected is class warfare, pitting one group against the other. And I think from the standpoint of getting elected, he's doing the right thing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think from the standpoint of the good of this country, terrible.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Are we going to see you on the campaign trail?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, they'd like me to, and I will certainly try and help out as much as I can. I'm very busy and -- but I enjoy it. And I -- most importantly, I love this country. I think that Mitt Romney would really make a great president. And whatever I can do, I will do.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I'm curious, did Governor Romney pull you aside and say, Donald, thank you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, he did thank me, absolutely. Well, he thanked me in front of lots of reporters. That was a big group of reporters out there. That was, like -- they told me record-setting, but I'm not the one that said it, they told me. But that was a big group of people, and he did thank me, yes, absolutely.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What do you make of the battle in Florida of the Gingrich campaign challenging -- at least a number of people challenging the whole issue of whether winner-takes-all or proportional delegates?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, that's a decision that's going to be made. We'll see what happens. I don't know. It's a number of delegates. It's probably not going to make much of a difference in the end. But somewhere, somehow, that'll get resolved probably pretty quickly.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, always nice to see you, and hope to see you soon.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you very much, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Thank you.
