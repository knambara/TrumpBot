<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> I've got to interrupt you. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to introduce the person I am proud to call a friend. He is the 45th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. Mr. President thank you so much. We are honored that you're called.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've known you for a long time, Geraldo, and it's been a lot of good -- a lot of good times.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Lot of good times and I appreciate the -- the friendship. Really. It's terrific. I know because I know what a gut-punch impeachment was for you but I'm not sure that, you know, heart to heart you've expressed that -- that feeling, you know, that -- that feeling of -- of assault, of insult, why don't you share that with us. What -- what was that like for you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's a terrible thing and you know I think of Nixon more than anybody else and what that dark period was in our country and the whole thing with the tapes and the horror show, it was dark and went on for a long time and I watched it. I watched Ronald Reagan, where they were very close with Iran-Contra, and that was very dark.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He went through that for years and never really got over the spell. It was dark but not nothing like Nixon. I would always think what -- every time in the White House I passed this beautiful portrait of various presidents, right. But the portrait of -- of Richard Nixon, I sort of -- I don't know, it's a -- it's a little bit of a different feeling that I get from looking at the other portraits of presidents.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I got impeached for no reason whatsoever. Partisan, totally partisan based on a perfect phone call and a totally appropriate phone call that was even said by the other party to be perfect, the president of Ukraine. And it was a disgraceful act by Nancy Pelosi and these horrible people. And --
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> [Inaudible] as Nancy Pelosi she says that you are no matter -- that you are acquitted you are impeached for life. And she says it in a way that is almost gleeful almost sadistic in a way that you're impeached for life. Do you feel, Mr. President, that you are impeached for life?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. She is a person that started an impeachment and lost. So she goes down as a loser which she is. Nancy Pelosi was -- it was said sadistically. If you watch the way she said that with the hatred and the venom coming out of her ears, you just take a look at that, the hatred that was pouring from her when she said that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> My wife was sitting there and watched it and she said, "Oh my, that was horrible." The way she said it was so bad. It's interesting that you picked it up. Some people did some people didn't. It wasn't just the words it was the -- the craziness. And then to have her sitting behind me at the State of the Union mumbling all night long, mumbling, you know, talking to me but under her breath.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not actually --
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> [Inaudible] Tearing up the copy of the state of the Union.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Tearing it up and I think they lost very big. You know, our poll numbers are through the roof and everything else. But I will say that for my family, it was a very tough thing. Me, I'm so busy that, you know, I literally -- it just made my job so much busier. And yet we've accomplished more than any president in his first year or three years that we've ever had, Geraldo, I mean, you can go to anybody and nobody has done what I've done in three years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I had this all cloud of bad people making up things. I mean, it's terrible and you know, to see --
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Let me get to the bad people in a second but what about the First Lady of the United States, how -- how difficult was this for her, this whole saga that you've been through?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it was hard especially since they knew I did nothing wrong. I did absolutely nothing wrong. Everybody knew it. Romney knew it too, by the way. You know that was a disgrace and he knew it. He was going to vote with us. It was -- everyone is saying, "No, he's good, he's good." Then he went into a cage and he -- he went into a cage with, I guess, they -- they held it. He did an interview with your friend, Chris Wallace, and nobody know -- knew what the interview was about.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it was, you know, previous to the vote and you know he's a wise guy. He did a -- he did a handle. He did a Twitter handle with a phony name on it so he could criticize people without using his name, so he could say things great about himself. He'd tweet about how great he is.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> [Inaudible] about Mitt Romney.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm talking about Mitt Romney. How crazy, you know, how crazy that was. And he got caught. But now that was a disgraceful --
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> You know, think it was his religion. You don't think that was a sincere --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think that at all. They did -- reports said he didn't. They brought up his religion very seldom and all of a sudden he brought up his religion. When did you hear him bring up his religion? They did a report in one of the main papers that he very rarely brought up his religion. No, I don't think so. Look, I got fifty-two-and-a-half votes out of 53. I got fifty-two and a half.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I guess it was the religion, he should have voted for the other half. You know, he was -- he voted on one positively and the other negatively.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He should have probably [Inaudible] his religion. Should have voted on both of you, if you think about it. But no, I know he's just a bad guy. You know, he's a jealous angry person, [Inaudible]
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> You think that was a reaction to your -- you're not giving him the secretary-of-state job?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think we just had our difficulties. You know, I thought he should have won against President Obama in the second term. I thought that should have been easy. I don't -- I'm not a McCain fan, never was. But I didn't think he could have possibly won that one because, you know, he was handed over, sort of a rough time in terms of many different things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And first African-American, I said that the whole thing was really stacked against McCain. And again, I'm not a fan, but I never said he should have won. But the second, the Obama --
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> He just stood up -- the Obama people that say that the economy booming today is because of Obama.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, let me get this first. The Obama first term was a disaster. The Obama's second term was OK. Mitt Romney should have beaten Obama and he should have beaten him easily. And I would have beaten him more easily than I beat Hillary Clinton. As far as the Obama doing, he took over a -- something that was a mess but rather easily fixed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So you can get some pretty good numbers. It's the slowest recovery we've had since the Great Depression under Obama, and now the recovery is a monster. And I will tell you, a big part of our recovery, bigger even than the tax cuts were the regulation cuts, which they would never have done. They were going to put more regulations on. If Hillary Clinton had got elected instead of 30,000 -- we're almost up to 30,000, which is going to be a record --
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> On the dow. Yup.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] On the dow 29,342 as of this moment. So we [Inaudible]. Nobody thought that would even be possible. And don't forget, they're trying to take credit for that big spread. If you look at the spread, when I won, the market went through the roof. Had I lost the market would have gone down tremendously.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But when I won, the market, immediately, you remember that big day right after the victory. Well, you can't really give credit to them for that. That's -- that has to go to me. I say I should get credit from Election Day. But President Obama --
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Are you worried that the boom -- Mr. President, are you worried that the stock market and the big economic boom are in peril because of this coronavirus spreading epidemic and you know China's closing for business, they're not buying cars from Europe right now. They're -- everything -- everybody's in a panic.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> You've got those four people stranded on that cruise ship in Japan. Are you worried about this virus affecting, I mean, obviously you're worried about the virus and people getting sick but what about the economy as you know is another victim of the --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're working on it very closely. I spoke to President Xi two days ago. They're working on it very professionally. It's a problem, we think and we hope, based on all signs that the problem goes away in April because -- which is not too far down the road, because he kills this virus. We think, now we're going to find out, Geraldo, but we think, and they are having difficulty in China but they're working very, very hard.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're working with them. We're sending a lot of people and CDC has been great but it is -- it's a problem in China. Has not been spreading very much. In our country, we only have, basically, 12 cases and most of those people are recovering and some cases fully recovered. So it's actually less.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Did the Chinese tell the truth about this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you never know. I think they want to put the best face on it. So you know, I mean, if somebody -- if you were running it, you'd probably -- you wouldn't want to run out to the world and go crazy and start saying whatever it is because you don't want to create a panic. But, no, I think they've handled it professionally and I think they're extremely capable and I think President Xi is extremely capable and I hope that it's going to be resolved.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Again, the April date is very important. But you know this is a big thing. The April date is very, very important because if that's the case, if he does, in fact, kill that's when it starts getting hot and this virus reacts very poorly to heat and dies. So we'll see what happens.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> What about, you know, closer to home, you know, talking about behaving professionally, you threw out Colonel Vindman and his -- and his brother. You know, I've been in the West Wing and my -- my feeling, just the vibe that I got him, from what I hear, is the whole places -- You know it's a nest of vipers and snitches and backstabbers and rats.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Why do you tolerate it, you know, you know -- How many --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I inherited -- I inherited a place with, you know, many different administrations and they worked there for years and with civil service and with unions and all of it. You can't do what you'd like to do. In addition, you want to give people chances. You know the fact that they come from Obama or they're Never Trumpers from Bush or whoever it may be, you know, and then you go back and you -- you have people you have Clinton and you want to give people time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, but Vindman -- if you look at what his person said about him, Morrison, who I think there's a very good man. He said terrible things about Vindman. No, I didn't want him in. I watched his testimony. Don't forget he was the one that thought my goal was bad and he ran in and started saying, you know, terrible things about the call and then when I released the transcript that call was perfect and I say it again, it was perfect.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was totally appropriate. And it wasn't one call it was two calls. They were both perfect appropriate calls and nothing earthshaking there --
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Why was so many people allowed to listen to your phone calls anyway?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's what they've done over the years. When you call a foreign leader, people listen. I may end the practice entirely, I may have -- I may end it entirely. Sometimes you have 25 people. Now, you have a [Inaudible] You have Secretary of State versus Mike Pompeo, was on the call, he found the call to be perfect.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He found the call to be absolutely fine with many people on the good. The only one, this guy ran and said he didn't liked the call. First of all, there's very insubordinate. Why wouldn't he go to his is immediate, you know, he went to Congress or he went to shift or he went to somebody. But Vindman was a guy that when we took him out of the building the building applauded.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know if you heard that.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> I didn't.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's the whole building that a lot -- many of the people in the building started applauding. No I'm not a fan of Vindman. I'm not a fan of what -- I've never -- I don't think I've ever met him, by the way, just so you understand, many of these people I've never met but I'm not a fan of Vindman, no question about it.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> You know, one person may --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And even if I just based it on what Jim Morrison said, I would not be a fan.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> We -- we both have known Roger Stone for decades. To me, I always thought it was kind of a pain in the ass, to tell you the truth. But I was very disappointed at his conviction and I was horrified at the proposed seven to nine-year sentence. I just heard from a guy who heads the PBA here in Cleveland. He -- he just had a guy shoot someone in the head.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> They got seven years. Roger Stone didn't heart -- hurt anybody, didn't steal a dime. He's looking at seven to nine-year sentence. It was it was terrible. It was really an overreach. But was it appropriate for you to get involved then? Are you worried that the independence of the Justice Department is threatened?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These are Mueller people. The whole Mueller investigation was a shakedown and a disgrace. It probably should be expunged because, to be honest with you, the dossier now, everybody knows it was fake. Everything was based on the dossier, the dossier now is totally fake. They used the dossier knowing it was fake to get Pfizer warrants.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That means they got Pfizer warrants illegally. That was where they did the whole situation with the Mueller report. Much of the Mueller Report and even these attorneys, I know at least a couple of them were Mueller people. What they did to Roger Stone was a disgrace, in terms of everything, right from the beginning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Twenty-nine FBI agents loaded up with the most powerful rifles and machine guns, they attack him early in the morning. His wife has a tremendous hearing problem, virtually no hearing. They barged into their bedroom. This is early in the morning. CNN following them. So they were obviously alerted. You know nobody has been able to figure that one out and they should be able to figure it out, it is really easy to figure it out if they wanted to. CNN was following them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> CNN taped it all and how would you like to be Roger Stone. And yet, if you look at Podesta's brother, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, look at the brother -- Was it Tony Podesta?
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But look at the brother. He -- he was Paul Manafort on steroids. He was the biggest one or one of the biggest in Washington. They found him doing many bad things, he was forced to leave his firm. He was going to be -- I don't -- it was going to be a very serious day the following day after he left his firm, you understand what I mean by that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very bad day for him. Nothing ever happened to him. Nothing ever happened. And then you see that they put a guy like a Paul Manafort in solitary confinement. Al -- Al Capone --
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> It's disgusting. It's awful.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Listen to this, Geraldo. Al Capone, you say he was about as tough as they come, right?
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Al Capone was never placed in solitary confinement. El Chapo, I don't think was placed in solitary confinement. But Paul Manafort was put in solitary confinement by the judge --
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Why don't you -- Why don't you pardon him and Roger Stone?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't want to talk about pardons right now but I think it's very unfair what happened to a lot of people, a lot of people. In the meantime, James Comey is walking around making book deals and if you read that report, 78 pages of scathing, scathing horrible words about him, done by a man who is, you know, in all fairness, a Democrat named Horowitz.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> The inspector general of the Justice Department. Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And a very bad recommendation for Comey and I don't know what's happening. Maybe they're using that report for something because I've stayed away. I have no obligation. In fact, I could totally be involved in this investigation and some people have told me I should but we'll see what happens. But Comey is walking around.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at McCabe, who is a bad, bad guy. He's walking around making --
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> John Brennan, the former head of the C.I.A. They're called pundits.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> John Brennan's walking around. And frankly, Obama knew everything, OK. Obama knew everything. I mean, does anybody have any doubt about that? Obama knew everything. But how about --
<Lee Conklin> <Neutral> Mr. President, you were here three times in Toledo in 2016 --
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> So you're saying that President Obama --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Listen to this, Geraldo. How about Strzok? And how about the lovers, Strzok and Page? Two lovers and they're walking around.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> That was the most ill-fated affair in the history of the world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They did. That was the worst cover-up.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> I just have to -- Let me ask you about Robert Mueller. A lot of people thought that he was past his prime to be kind and some other things about him. But I never heard anyone call him a liar until you did a couple of days ago. What did he lie about?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he said it in Congress that he never applied for the job of the FBI director and now it's been proven that he did. He came into my office along with numerous other people including Chris Ray. They all came into my office over a two-day period. I think there were five people, maybe more. But around that number, and Robert Mueller wanted to go back to the FBI.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He came in as director. He wanted to be the director again. And I told him, basically, you've had enough time, and then within a very short period of time, he was appointed special prosecutor. I don't call him special counsel because special counsel is not -- it's not an accurate term, it's a special prosecutor.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because what he and his 13 angry Democrats, all horrible, just horrible people. What they did to destroy the lives of people that you know -- but to destroy the lives of many, Geraldo, should never be forgiven, should never be forgotten and something has to be done about it. So he went in with this 13 angry Democrats and they went in for Barr.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They went into destroyed people.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Lee Conklin> <Negative> -- leading up to the election there. You're back to start out 2020 here, to start off this campaign really in earnest -- although you were in Battle Creek not long ago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, that's right.
<Lee Conklin> <Neutral> So you're in Toledo. Why are you starting it here, this year?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's Ohio, and it's been a special state for us. This is our first rally the -- of the year, and really, the first rally since we go into the new -- the new push for 2020, and Toledo has been great. Toledo, Ohio -- I have so many friends, but here -- here, but it's a great place, and it's been a little bit lucky, as you say.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we're, yeah, probably three times we were here. It's really great.
<Lee Conklin> <Negative> USMCA, it looks like it's going to pass the full Senate in the not too distant future here.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> They absolutely -- I agree. They had that destruction in mind. I guess the -- exclusively, the president of the United States, my friend, Donald J. Trump, Let me ask you, brought up Democrats, Bernie Sanders looks like he's -- very hard --hard to stop. You know, first of all, what do you think about the prospect of running against Senator Sanders?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I like it. I'd like him. I'd like - I like any of them. I mean, I think, would be good with anybody. I think, frankly, my first choice would be Mini Mike. I think it'd be easy because I've seen in debat --
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> With all the money he has, easy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. He's got money but, you know, they spent $2 billion on me, Hillary Clinton, and mostly negative ads and I won and I won really easily if you look at -- You know the Electoral College I won some states that were won by massive numbers. She spent $2 billion. I mean, they had a two-billion-dollar campaign.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He won't have that much. And frankly, he's so deficient in so many ways that I think he'd be easier than Bernie. Bernie has a group. And I also think this, if a guy came in and bought the election if they bought the Democratic nomination, I really think that you'd have a revolution within the Democrat Party.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You had a mini -- You had a mini revolution last night. But you would have a real because they took it away from them last time or at least it was perceived. She actually, you know, she got more votes than him and everything else so I view that differently. But a lot of people perceive that they took it away from him but this time they would be taking it away.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If a guy came in to buy it and took it away from Bernie, I think you'd have a revolution within that party.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> You know you've got a situation with the former Vice President, Joe Biden, fading terribly and in the process in Iowa and in New Hampshire he's desperately going to South Carolina right now. Do you think that, ironically, the Democrats moving to impeach you and in effect impeached Joe Biden with all the Hunter Biden, Hunter Biden, you know, day after day?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Lee Conklin> <Negative> Tell the people of northwest Ohio -- the farmers here who has struggled, the auto worker, the manufacturer in -- in Dundee Michigan, Defiance, Ohio, Toledo, Ohio -- that USMCA will help them. How will it do that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's gonna be tremendous -- tremendous for the farmer, tremendous for the auto workers. You know, we have a whole special thing for the auto workers with Mexico, and we're not going to be taking companies out of our places anymore. It's one of the reasons I ran, if you want to know the truth. I would sit back and, as a civilian I'd say: why are all these companies leaving, going to Mexico -- some to Canada, but in the auto case, mostly to Mexico.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The tariffs that they put on your farmer were so ter -- your farmers were so terrible -- up into Canada, and all of that goes away. We have an unbelievable situation. People won't be leaving us anymore. The companies aren't going to be moving down. We have a system that is just -- it's an incredible deal, and if it weren't great, if it weren't something that I want, I would've put on tariffs, and I would have said "forget it." But when they heard that they said, we'll give you the points.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So this is phenomenal for the farmers. You see what's happening with the farm prices. They're starting to go up now. Now, plus, in addition to that, we just signed -- we're going to be signing, on January 15th -- I think it'll be January 15th, but shortly thereafter, but I think January 15th -- a big deal with China, one of the great deals with $50 billion being purchased in terms of farmers, and we just signed one with -- for $40 billion with Japan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> South Korea is done, and we have a couple of big ones, but USMCA is going to be fantastic for the farmers, for the auto, for the manufacturers generally.
<Lee Conklin> <Negative> I want to go back to Tuesday night, about 5:30 local time here in Toledo, Eastern time. If you can, take us back to what you were thinking about 5:30 when bases with U.S. troops had been attacked by Iran. What were you thinking before you heard, Mr. President, about the possibility of American casualties or damage. What was going through your head?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I thought it was a probability, not even a possibility. We had heard that, initially, it was 11, and then 12, and then 14, and then ultimately, 16 missiles were sent in. We knew pretty much where they were going. We had a lot of great intelligence, frankly. But we knew where they were going, and there -- they were big and they were fast, and I tell you what: we were very happy when we learned, not only weren't any -- nobody was killed, but nobody was even hurt, and they landed in areas that were very good, as far as I was concerned.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Did -- did that destroy the former vice president's reputation and his status in standing?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, there's a quote that was put in the Wall Street Journal that she aimed at Trump and took down Biden and that's having to do with Nancy Pelosi. She -- she aimed at me, there's no question about it. And she always wanted to impeach. You know there's this theory that, oh she didn't want it. You know she's this great political pundit.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's just great political mind, she's not. She lost the House once before. I think she's got a good chance of losing that again and the party is not run by her, it's run by the left. And you see that even in the presidential, you see it with Bernie. Bernie's, you know, beyond socialist, in my opinion, but we'll have to talk about that at the right time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But no, I really think that -- And just to finish out on this subject, I have to say, I really believe that we are going to have a very interesting election. I think Biden is shot. He was shot from the beginning. I used to call him "One Percent Joe". Remember, one percent, because two times, but really it was three.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But two times, when he really gave it his best. He was at less than one percent.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> Running for office.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. And if you look, running for high office, he's for president. He was at rush. So I'd call him "One Percent Joe" and he's going to be back at One Percent Joe. You know it's amazing that it faded fast but you know he had the whole thing of the vice presidency for eight years and I thought, you know, in a certain way he was a good vice president because Obama got along with him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think one of the biggest things that happened, one of the big telltale signs of trouble was when Obama wouldn't endorse him early on. And that was a strange -- to me it was strange. I understand sometimes they don't but to me it was strange.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So you had 16. I think four of them didn't reach the location and the other -- the other twelve were -- they didn't hit, perhaps they didn't want to hit, or something happened, but there was nobody hurt nobody injured, and I think I was very happily surprised.
<Lee Conklin> <Negative> If Iran were to strike again, or threaten to strike, would you consider going to Congress -- consulting with Congress about authorization?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you have to keep presidential power, so we'll decide, maybe should that happen. I don't see that happening, but we would -- we have to have a position where we can do what we have to do, if we have to do it. So, we're talking right now to Congress. We're negotiating with a lot of different people. But we have to keep that presidential power.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have to be able to make a decision, I mean literally, sometimes, on a second, on a dime's notice. So, we'll be seeing what's going on, I think we're getting some very good --
<Lee Conklin> <Neutral> You're considering it, though?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, we're getting some very positive responses from Congress right now. They know what we have to do. As an example, if you look at that, I was -- I acted very quickly. We had the number one terrorist in the world -- should have been killed a long time ago. He should have been taken out, really, a long time ago, by other presidents.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, they -- long -- he's been there for a long time, 20 years, probably more than that. Killed a lot of people, killed a lot of Americans. His big thing was roadside bombs, he loved them, and we have so many young men and women walking around without legs and without arms, where the roadside bomb -- he was the king of the roadside bomb, and then they got bigger and more powerful, to a point where they could take out tanks, and now, he had to go and he did go, and that was a very fast decision, and you have to be able to make a decision like that as President.
<Lee Conklin> <Positive> Yesterday morning, before you greeted the -- the press, you said: "as long as I'm President, Iran will never have a -- a nuclear" and -- and greeted the, the country, I should say.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Was it strange this then Rudy Giuliani to Ukraine, your personal lawyer, you sorry you did that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Not at all. Rudy was a great crime fighter. You know that may be better than anybody.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Of course, yeah. I interviewed him --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And Rudy is probably on his game. Rudy is on his game. Rudy was a great crime fighter. You covered him for many years and he was the greatest mayor in the history of the city of New York, far better than Bloomberg. Bloomberg took over what Rudy gave him. Rudy was a far better mayor than Bloomberg. Tough and good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what Bloomberg did with a -- with Stop and Frisk, Rudy used it and he used it sparingly and really brilliantly. And Bloomberg came in and he multiplied it times 10. If you were a black person walking down the street you were going to be stopped and frisked under Bloomberg. And that's why they had a revolution in New York because of what he did.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Rudy did it very sparingly it was very, very, very sparingly and very smartly and it had an incredible impact on, you know, on guns and shootings in New York. Incredible. Rudy was a great mayor. Crime went way, way down. Then Bloomberg came in and he said, "Well, you know what, this thing is so good. I'm going to stop every black person." And if you were a black person in New York you would stop two times a day three times a day.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You couldn't go to your house. They were stopping every day. What Bloomberg did to black -- to the black community was a disgrace. And then he gets up and he cries in a church and he discards everything that he stood for. And if he gets elected I would be surprised and I would be very surprised that when the word gets out to the black community, where I'm doing extremely well, by the way, beyond what any Republican has done, I guess, it's looking like.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I would be very surprised if the black community can support him. But what he did is he took Rudy horribly. They took Rudy's Stop and Frisk, which was done very gingerly very smartly very, you know, really a very smart job. And he made it so vicious and so violent and they would stop it. And honestly, if you were a black person you'd be stopped two, three times a day.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> I hear that and I wonder, it sounds like you know you made a big point at the State of the Union and I've watched you and Dr. Darrell Scott, Pastor Scott, I hear --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great guy. Great Guy. Yup
<Lee Conklin> <Negative> You said: "Iran will never have a nuclear -- a nuclear weapon." How can you promise that, guarantee that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I started the speech with that, and then I said good morning, right? So I mean, I wanted people to understand -- because it is about that: we can never allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon, and frankly, it's the biggest threat to the world. We can never allow that to happen. The deal they had was a horrible deal, the JCPOA, the -- the deal that was made -- the original nuclear deal -- didn't cover the right locations.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It expires very soon. I mean, if it was to run out -- we terminated it, but it expires very soon. You need a lot of length, as the countries, you know, we're talking about is not -- you're not renting to a candy store in a shopping center, and so what happened is, I terminated it, and I think we're making a lot of progress.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're making a lot of progress. But we took out the number one terrorist in the world, the number one terrorist for decades, and everybody knew it. Nobody wanted to do it, and I did it and they hit us, and nobody was hurt. Now, you have to understand, when we took him out also, it was not only for what he had done in the past, but in the very immediate -- a week before, an American was killed, and a number of other people were very badly injured.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They were badly, badly hurt and this was the work of him also. Plus he was going after, in our opinion, our very intelligent opinion, he was going after our embassies, and things could have happened. We had the exact opposite to Benghazi. Benghazi was a disaster, and they didn't have the right, you know, response, and we had rapid response.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When I heard that they were surrounding our embassy in Baghdad, I had people there really quickly, and they put it out. They put out that fire. So I think we gave a great response to that. But he was leading the charge, and we took him out.
<Lee Conklin> <Negative> You said yesterday, you told the American public, that you believe the military threat had lessened. Iran was standing down, and with that, we're getting warnings from Homeland Security, that the cyber threat is up. What -- what is the administration doing to guarantee the safety of our systems? Our banking systems, our -- our grids, our computer systems in this country?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's a great question. Cyber is a whole new thing. It's a whole new field. We have some tremendous people. We're better at cyber than anybody else in the world. But we weren't really using that power, that intellect, on cyber. We weren't doing it, and now we are, and we have -- I have -- incredible people in charge of cyber.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Big supporter of yours. It sounds, really, as if you are reaching out to the African-American community. I joked on Hannity's show that you're almost campaigning like a Democrat in terms of the minority community. You really, you -- Do you see an opening there? Do you -- do you foresee a real change in the racial dynamic of American politics?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I think I do and I think, you know, I have -- I have polls that show 32%, 34%. Romney got 4%, and I have polls that are showing numbers that are unheard of. And why? Lowest unemployment in the history of our country for Black-Americans, for African-Americans, lowest in history by far, not even close, by the way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I took care of -- What they have is they have black colleges and universities, right. And they're always coming up looking for money. Always every year, for three years. I said why do they always come. It's very demeaning to them. And I got to know a lot of the principals of these schools. They're great people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The deans and the heads of the schools. I say, "Why do you always come up?" He said, "Well, they told me we have to because we have no bill, we have to come up." And one man said, "I feel like a beggar." And for years they come up and I worked it out. So they have now long-term financing. Nobody else would have done that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then opportunity zones. I worked with Tim Scott of South Carolina, who's fantastic, by the way. And we did opportunities zones, and then we did criminal justice reform. They couldn't get it. Van Jones came to my office asking me for help. He had no chance of getting it. He came in asking, "Oh, I didn't give me the credit that he should have but that's OK, I never get credit." But what happened.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He came in. He needed five senators, they happen to be Republican. He needed some senators to locate a little bit because they were very much against it. I was able to work it out. I got senators and I got some guys that were not in favor to let it happen. The great guys and I very much appreciate what they did.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have great support of the Republican Party, it's doing great. And there's really tremendous unity other than Romney there's tremendous unity. And so you look and you see, and it's really amazing. And I got criminal justice reform. So for -- and not only for African-Americans for Hispanics for so many people that was so badly -- like Alice Johnson.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Geraldo, she was in jail for 22 years, she had another 20 years left for something that, today, I mean, would have been -- it would have -- in many cases, they wouldn't have even prosecuted her.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Right. It could've been a misdemeanor. Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If we ever get hit, we'll hit very hard. We'll be able to hit very hard But it's a new form of war -- warfare, and I think we have it very well under control.
<Lee Conklin> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Lee Conklin> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great honor.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She was in jail for 50 years, she was going to be in jail. And I let her out and she's an incredible woman. And I said to her the other day I said, "How many people are like you in jail that you know?" You know when you're -- where you were, because she was there for a long time. She said many. I said, "Are they all like that?" She said no, you have some very bad people too, but you have many people that are really great people that should be let out.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I said give me a list. Give me a list.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> I think that you -- What you did there is very honorable and necessary, and I totally applaud it. I've got a million questions, they're just going to -- I got to circle back to Rudy Giuliani. Why don't you give him a title? Why don't you make him like your presidential envoy to --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, two things about -- Two things about Rudy. You have to understand where I'm coming from. I was illegally spied on by Comey and Brennan and all these sleaze, the sleaze of the world. And you know when people talk about Clapper -- when people talk about, you know, the intelligence agencies well. I was not given a very good first glance at it. I had Comey, I had Clapper then we saw Lisa Page, and we saw Strzok, and we saw all of these people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, by the way, how about the people that fix the -- the documents? How about the person that forged and changed the documents before putting them into the Pfizer [Inaudible]
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Should be in jail. Should be in jail.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Where is he? Why isn't he in jail?
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> It's a lot like a one-sided thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. Oh, to me that's 10 times worse than what [Inaudible] did. And by the way, you know Randi the -- the post, he's a radio guy and he's good too. He was -- he was the one that they said Roger Stone intimidated. When he heard that Roger was going to prison, he said, "What are you talking about? I didn't know you're sending him to pri --" He didn't know what the hell they were doing.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> It's ridiculous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he said, "I don't want him to go to prison." And supposedly, they told him we don't care, we're doing it anyway. This is the kind of treatment that was given. What happen --
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> I'm really happy four high-level prosecutors quitting the case. Why they even have four high-level prosecutors on that stupid case?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think they quit the case. I think what they do is they felt they got caught, you want to know the truth.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think they quit for moral reasons. I think they got caught in the act by me. Now, what am I going to do sit back and let a man go to jail maybe for nine years when murderers aren't going to jail. Look, you have some of the most serious horrible rapists and everything else. They don't go to jail for nine years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at -- you look at schedules. You take a look. Some of them go to jail for nothing, for no -- for no time. And then this guy is going to go to jail for nine years?
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Well, you know they're doing that to get to you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're doing it because they're bad people.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> To hurt you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're doing it. So when you tell me about Rudy. So here's what -- Here's my choice. I deal with the commies of the world and/or I deal with it. In other words, I was given a very bad taste of our intelligent department -- departments because I see it. They spied on my campaign illegally. Hopefully, they're not going to get away with, we're going to find out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hopefully, they're not going to getaway. It should never happen to another president but they spied on my campaign. Everybody knew it, including President Obama. That they spied on the opposite parties campaign, the party that was in power and they used everything they could, their intelligence agencies and beyond.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So when you tell me, "Why did I use Rudy?", and one other thing about Rudy, Number one, he was the best. Best prose -- You know, one of the one of -- the very best prosecutors and the best mayor. But also, other presidents had him. You know FDR had a lawyer, who was practically, you know, was totally involved with government.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Eisenhower had a lawyer. They all had lawyers. Bill Clinton had a lawyer. You know he had a very good lawyer, you know that was. They all had lawyers and they do things for him. And it's really circumventing but very legally and maybe getting things done faster. But Rudy is a high-quality guy, who by the way has a treasure trove of information and he's working with the Justice Department from what I understand.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> All right. Let me -- let me leave the Rudy situation will be resolved. Just quickly on the Attorney General Barr. Do you ever wonder what your life would have been like if you picked William Barr instead of Jeff Sessions? When you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. My life would have been a lot easier.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> A lot of the country loved this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yep. My life would have been a lot easier but I might have been less popular. You know it's a funny thing. Somebody told me the other day.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> Why would you be less popular?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because they say they liked that I fought it. They liked that I won. They like that my base is much more energized. Let's assume none of this stuff happened and we had a nice boring presidency, right. I don't think I'd have nearly the energy the Republican Party that we have right now.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> That -- That may be so but what a ride. What a crazy ride you are on. Quickly, is there --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My life would have been a lot easier. Bill Barr's a very good man, doing a very good job but my life would have been much easier. There's no question about it.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Much easier. Is there a tentative peace plan with the Taliban as the New York Times is reporting?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We are working on one and we'll see if we can get one. We'd like to bring our troops back home. They're really -- they're law enforcement as opposed to soldiers to a large extent. And we shouldn't be there. It's time to come home. We're having a very good dialogue, we'll see and we'll know over the next week or two.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> You know they just think they can outwait you. The longest war in history, the Taliban. They think that we'll give that give yes a week of relative calm and then we'll start withdrawing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they'd like to make a deal too. You know what they'd like to make a deal too. Look. No matter how -- and they're good fighters, and we're good -- We're the greatest fighters in the world. We could win that war if I wanted to kill millions of people. I could win that war quickly if I wanted to kill millions of people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't choose to do that. I'm not going to kill millions of innocent people to say, "Hey, we won in Afghanistan." It's a -- 19 years they've been in there but we can't use our real weapons, our power. We have tremendously powerful weapons and I'm not even -- I'm not talking --
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> Is there a tentative deal?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm not even talking about nuclear. I'm talking about -- We have tremendous power.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> No, I hear you. I hear you. I did a lot of assignments there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to start killing.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Is there a tentative deal? I just did a - Yes or no on that? Is there a tentative deal? Is there a tentative deal?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very close. I think we're very close. I think there's a good chance that we'll have a deal and we'll see. I mean we're going to know over the next two weeks that doesn't mean we have one, but we'll know over the next two weeks. Let's put it this way, nobody else has been able to get one and this is -- And there's also a chance that we'll get one between Israel and the Palestinians.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The toughest deal of all time, right. They always say that that's the toughest deal of all time.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> You're -- You've been such a loyal friend to me. I appreciate you so much. I just want you to know that even when I disagree with you I -- I appreciate your sincerity and I think you're doing a great job and the economy shows. But two quick follow -- last questions.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> With the Pensacola Florida attack by the Saudi Air Force pilot revealed to be, you know, a terrorist attack. So you got the Saudi involvement there. You got Khashoggi, the the journalist that they carved up in their embassy. You got the 9/11 hijacked the Saudi, Saudi, Saudi. You know, I know that you think Iran is the evil-doer in the Mideast.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> But is it possible that we have the wrong bad guy, that it's not Iran, that Saudi Arabia is really the one that's -- that's sticking it to us?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know there are Saudis were involved in the World Trade Center more than anybody else. You know when President Bush attacked Iraq, there were no Iraqis involved, there were Saudis and they went to Afghanistan to be trained. OK. So you know, I know -- I know what we have. And frankly, this guy was caught and I'm -- I'm not -- You know, I -- I like the idea of opening up cell phones and finding out who and some very good people in New York like that idea too, I will tell you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> and some very good people like that idea and I'm for it and I'm working on that, you know, encryption or whatever you would call it. But when you open up the phone because we should open and we, probably, will open up his phone because we'll find out how many other people involved if anybody how many other people were involved in that horrible attack.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Do you think you've addressed Bin Salman, the crowned prince? These people legit or do you think they're playing this, you know, they're funding all these madrassas, these religious extremists and so fort?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yep. I know exactly what you say. I have a very good relationship with them. They buy billions and billions and billions of dollars of product from us. They buy tens of billions of dollars of military equipment, which we use, which we actually use. They are paying us now and like past presidents, you know, I have a different theory but they have nothing but money, nothing but cash and they pay us now for services and protection, and other things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Like for instance, when they were attacked by Iran, they needed help and we sent but they're paying, they're paying billions of dollars for that help. Nobody ever -- You never heard those words.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> They're not -- they're not bad people. Double dealers, though.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but you have -- you have an ideology and you have some bad ones, you have some bad ones all over. Don't forget in Iran they kill many, many people. You know the protests, they kill people, they shoot people with snipers.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> What did you talk to them? Why did you talk to Iran?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because, in my opinion, John Kerry has made it very tough because -- and I think he's totally violated the Logan Act. John Kerry has made it very tough because he's telling them or he has told them, I think, now he knows that we're looking at the Logan Act with respect to him. He's told them don't make a deal, don't make a deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Maybe Trump will lose and you'll make a deal with a stiff. You'll make a deal with a Biden or somebody because it -- Just don't make a deal because -- Just wait, wait, because it makes him look bad if they make a deal, that's most of it, in my opinion. But he's -- in my opinion he's violated the Logan Act, and violated it seriously.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And we'll see what happens on that.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> So you don't think that you could even the backchannel to Iran?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I have plenty of back channels. Look. They are desperate to make a deal. Their economy is crashed. They're not funding terrorism like they were. When I took over they were -- they were a terror. They were -- there were 18 sites of confliction. Now they just want to survive. Their economy went down 25% last year.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Their GDP is down so much. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. They should talk. They don't know how to go about it. We're going to find out. But I think they want to try and wait it out till after the election hoping that some stiff gets elected and they can have their way. I don't think that's going to happen.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> I got my final question. You and I were together in Puerto Rico. After Hurricane Maria, you were criticized. Every newspaper, front page, you are responsible for thousands of deaths in Puerto Rico.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> And now you have a parade of local officials, either resigning or going to jail for corruption.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yep. I was right.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> They discovered warehouses that were unused. I want to apologize on behalf of, you know, any extended that my folks, you know, helped to slander you. It wasn't your fault but the island still needs help.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> Can you take a second look at over the --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am. I love the people of Puerto Rico. You know that. What they did to me over there when I -- Remember I was passing out towels --
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> It was terrible. I was with you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And everyone started screaming.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no. And we were having fun. All of us. And they were all screaming in the back, "Throw us here." Throw -- You know, the -- the crowd was tremendous, right. The room was packed. You were there, you were laughing. We were all laughing.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> Of course.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I was throwing them towels in the back. You know like taking basketball shots, soft towels, you know, big things of towels were thrown back. And they said, "Oh, it was terrible the way he was -- " The people were loving it. They're having a good time and frankly, they just got wiped out. Their homes. Everybody's laughing and we're all having a good time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There was love in that room and when I got home I saw like I was throwing like I was demeaning them by throwing towels. They're all saying, " Over here, Mr. President. Over here. Over here." You were there. Everybody was having a good time and they needed a good time. Their houses were wiped out. They were in terrible turmoil and stress.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So you know. No, I love the people of Puerto Rico and we are working. But I also said the corruption at the top level, I told you that while we were there, is -- is enormous. I'll tell you what, the best friend that Puerto Rico's ever had, Geraldo, is me. They'd gotten $93 billion over a fairly short period of time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's not a state in the union that's gotten that much money, not even close.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Why shouldn't you make a mistake? What do you advocate for Puerto Rico becoming a state?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, some people want that and I guess they're talking about that. I want to get -- I want to get things fixed first. But Puerto Rico is -- has been very, very poorly run by Democrats. Very, very poorly run.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Two quick final questions. Will -- Would Americans vote for a gay man to be president?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think so. I think there would be some that wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't be among that group, to be honest with you. But I think that, yes, I think that it doesn't seem to be hurting Pete Buttigieg, as you say, as you would call him. It doesn't seem to be hurting him very much. And -- But there would certainly be a group.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know this better than I do. There'd be a group that probably wouldn't. But you know you're -- you and I would not be in that group.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> We would not. Now I would I just want to circle back to where I started the First Lady of the United States. I know, with conversations that we've had, how hurt you are that the American pop-cultural establishment has not embraced her. She's not on the cover of Vogue and Cosmopolitan, as she should be, Bizarre Town and Country.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> What do you -- What do you think about you know the fact that they are boycotting the First Lady the United States, and one those beautiful ever, most stylish ever, and yet a she's so almost disrespected by the fact that they ignore her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So when I met her, considered to be one of the most beautiful models in the world by everybody. One of the most beautiful, one of the most elegant and the thing I liked about her, she'd always go home at night everyone else was out partying all night. And some people said, "Oh, that's not nice." I'd say, "No, I think that's great." She'd like to go home at night.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know she was a very solid person and she was very successful, and really, I mean, really, successful but very successful and she got a great heart. And yeah, I see that she -- she was on covers before she became First Lady, and now it's like one of those things. It doesn't bother her. She's very, very solid.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's an amazing -- She's very confident in herself. Somebody that wasn't would say, "What's going on here?" And I'll tell you what, our people know it. I got -- I go to a rally in Ohio, I go to a rally in Pennsylvania, I went to one the other -- What did too. I mean, the one in Iowa was unbelievable, the one in New Hampshire was unbelievable, you see what's going on. Tens of thousands of people can't get in. They have so many signs honoring our First lady, "We love our First Lady.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We love our First Lady." The people love Melania. They love her. Absolutely love her. But the press is crooked. You know it's very unfair, it's fake. It's fake news and they've -- they've really gone down into hearts and minds of people. But the people love our First Lady and she works very hard.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Well, I send her my best wishes and to you and to the rest of the -- Oh, is Don Jr. going to run for president, 45th -- 46th president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think so. I think he's just really working hard now. He -- he does like politics, I will say that.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> He does. He and Kimberly are, you know, rocking around the country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And Eric likes politics and, you know, Ivanka is like so natural at it. I don't even know if she likes it or not. She just did, you know, what she does. She's gotten 15 million jobs. Training that's what she does. She goes to the big companies, gets them to train people. Wal-Mart, a million people, different companies, millions of people but she just stopped.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She was -- she had a goal of 500,000 jobs when she started at the beginning and she -- she beat that in about two months. And now it's 15 million jobs that -- She does a great job. She's another one. She doesn't get credit for what she does and she doesn't want it. She just wants to make people happy.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> She's -- she's an elegant and highly competent person and I'm delighted to know her and Jared.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She already is.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> The peace plan. You know, I remembered [Inaudible] But the peace plan, you know, I admire the fact that you put something together. But I -- you know, I did a lot of time over there and I don't think the Palestinians are ever going to go for a deal in which they have to surrender the Jordan Valley and so much of their territory.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, most people agree that the deal won't happen. Most people agree with you and you know, when I'm doing this I'm giving it a shot because I'm good at it. I do it well. I have very capable people. David Friedman is unbelievably one of the most successful lawyers in New York by far and he's the ambassador to Israel.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And Jared, you know how smart Jared is. And you know there's a group of people that we're giving it a good strong shot. There are those that say it can't happen, in other words, just it can't happen. Historically, the mindset of -- of them plus the Jewish people, it's just never going to happen. You know it's interesting, whenever you have a deal when I was in the private sector, I'd have a deal that was really a tough deal, you'd use an expression.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is tougher than Israel and the Palestinians getting together because that was known as like, the impossible deal. So I'm here. That's what I've done really great over my life. I'll give it a shot. You know, let's see what happens. If you look the other day, they withdrew from the -- a committee in the United Nations.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The Palestinians withdrew something and said very good statements about me, not necessarily the deal but about me. That was a big -- that was a that was very telltale. And I think Israel -- I know Israel would like to do a deal, and I think the Palestinians are going to want to do a deal.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> I like the idea of an American embassy a full-blown embassy with an ambassador in East Jerusalem or somewhere else in the Palestinian territories. I think that'll be a good sign.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, something's going to happen. So I think we have a real shot at doing and not -- I'm not going to guarantee this one. Some -- some deals I can guarantee, this one I can't. But you know, we have a good shot at doing something, we'll see, we'll know in the not too distant future. We were delayed by the election.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, the never-ending election.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> The neve-rending election in -- in Israel that the third time's the charm. Finally, if I don't ask you about climate change, my kids will be really mad at me. Why not you have a czar or appoint someone to check out the carbon emissions and you know, see what's true and what's not true/
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we could but we really have great people. And you know, I always say it, we want the cleanest air, the cleanest water. You know we have our cleanest numbers in many years this year, just got released, the cleanest numbers on carbon, on water, cleanliness on air, purity on air, cleanness. I want to cleanest air.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want crystal-clean water, and we actually are very much into it. What I don't want to do is give trillions of dollars away on Paris accords that go to other countries, that we don't even know where it's going. I don't want to do that. And that hurt our businesses, where we have to close our businesses because of it. But we're going to have the cleanest air.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We now have -- We now have the best, like, we're the best we have ever been right now at this moment. And the environment means a lot to me. We're the best we've ever been, right now.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> And finally, you know we started here --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, how many times, Geraldo, this is you. I have to [Inaudible] It's very subject -- And I'm doing this because you [Inaudible]
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Are you OK? I love you. Are you OK? Are you OK after this thing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, and you just said, "And finally, and finally, and finally, --"
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> You're going to shake off -- You're going to shake off this impeachment nonsense. You're going to move on.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's a victory. I think it's a total victory.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think you do too. Geraldo, I think you do too. It's a total victory for us.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> I absolutely believe that, and I appreciate your friendship, by the way. I really do, bud.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I appreciate yours. You take care of yourself, Geraldo.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Thank you very much, Mr. President. Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Bye.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Mr. President thanks for this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> You just recently hours ago met with the Chinese President, Xi Jinping.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I did.
<Tucker Carlson> <Neutral> Are you closer, do you think after that meeting to a trade deal?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so. We had a very good meeting. He wants to make a deal. I want to make a deal. Very big deal, probably, I guess, you'd say the largest deal ever made of any kind, not only trade. We got along very well. We understand each other. He is going to start buying a lot of farm products, which is great for our farmers while we negotiate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm going to not increase tariffs, which I could do -- we have a lot we can do. And we're going to put our teams together and continue a great negotiation. I think we can -- I think we can do something that will be historic, but we'll see. I mean, we're going to see. I'm in no rush. We have a situation that works very well for us, and I'm sure he is happy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What we're going to do is they're going to buy a lot of farm products. We're not going to increase tariffs at this moment. And we'll see what happens with the negotiation, but we had a very good meeting.
<Tucker Carlson> <Neutral> Do you think your political opponents in the U.S. are on your side in this negotiation?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think they are actually. I think they like the fact that we charged tariffs. You know, look, China has been beating us badly for many years. President Obama did nothing meaning, "O'Biden." I don't even think I have to say that anymore. He did -- they did nothing. And neither did in all fairness to President Obama, nobody did.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was crazy. And we had a deficit last year of $506 billion -- billion with a B. You almost say, "You mean $500 million? Don't you know?" $506 billion, and this has been going on for years and years and years. We've rebuilt China and they did a great job. I give them a lot of credit. I don't -- I don't discredit them for what happened.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I discredit our people that should have been doing what I'm doing right now. And it's not pleasant. Our farmers have been incredible. They are great patriots and it's going to pay off big for our farmers.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> You came very close to sending the U.S. military to strike Iran. You pulled back at the last moment. You were criticized by neo-cons in Washington for doing that. They wanted you to strike Iran. Why do you think they wanted that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was given a lot of credit by most people. A lot of people gave me of credit.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> The public was on your side for sure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A lot of people said that was a great presidential moment, which was, you know, rather shocking to hear. So they shut down and unmanned drone.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they claim, it was over their territory, which it wasn't, but they would say that, so on top of it, they'll say, unmanned and over their territory, then we go in. Before I sent them out, they had to give me everything I wanted to know by seven o'clock. They walked in, they gave me everything but they didn't tell me how many people would die.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> How many Iranians -- I know a lot of Iranians from New York City, and they're great people. They're all great people. Were all great, right? Iranian or not. I said, "How many people are going to die?" And they said, "At least 150." I said, "So let's get it. They shot down an unmanned ..." not a brand new exactly thing either -- the drone -- they shot it down and we're going to now kill 150 or many more people, you never know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Once you start doing what we'd do or what they'd do, and nobody does it better than us, you don't know how many people are going to die. So I said, "I don't like that. I don't like it." And I stopped it before. I did -- we didn't send them out, you know, there was a little incorrect reporting. It was like we sent them out and we pulled them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we didn't do that. I didn't -- I made the final decision not to do it. I built up a lot of great capital, and if something should happen, we're in a position to do far worse by not doing it. But hopefully, we don't have to do anything. Iran now, since we terminated that horrible deal, which was a truly horrible deal, and, you know, you and I aren't so different in terms of fighting, we want to have peace.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We want to build our roads and build our schools and build all the things we want to build. But we can't let Iran have a nuclear weapon. And you may even agree on that because I know where you stand. The show is great. I watch it a lot. But you can't let Iran have a nuclear weapon. And you can't let certain other countries have nuclear weapons.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's too devastating. So they're having a lot of difficulty in their country right now. And hopefully, at some point, they'll come back and they'll say, "We're going to make a deal." Let's see what happens.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> Two American servicemen killed in Afghanistan this week. How much longer do you think our troops will stay?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll tell you. I've wanted to pull them out. And you know, I have pulled a lot out. We were at 16,000. We're down to about 9,000, which a lot of people don't know. In Syria, as you know, I've pulled most of them out. We've defeated the Caliphate. Now when you say Caliphate and defeat, the Caliphate's land, it's an area we've taken back a hundred percent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But these people -- ISIS -- they're stone cold crazy. So that doesn't mean somebody is not going to walk into a store and blow up a store, which they do. So I never say defeated them, but they were decimated. And this went on for a long time and other people didn't do what I did. We did it. We did it very effectively.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Our military, there's no military like our military in the world. I don't want to have to use it very often. But we took back the Caliphate. With Afghanistan, it's 19 years and we should not have been there 19 years and if we were, you know, it would be nice to fight to win. But it's just 19 years. They're building hotels -- we are.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, we had a Holiday Inn that cost numbers that would be 10 times what it should have cost. They built a gas station, a pretty famous deal where it costs like $80 million to build a gas station.
<Tucker Carlson> <Neutral> It's Lawford gas station.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Maybe more. Okay. They probably did. If they report 80, that means more. And we have the greatest fighters in the world. But when you're 19 years, you're really becoming like a police force. So we have pulled it back. We're actually negotiating with various people. But we want to get out. We want to get out of a lot of areas that we're in. We shouldn't be there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We shouldn't be there. We're the policeman for the whole world. You know, if you look at Russia, Russia doesn't police the world. Russia has -- you know, they police Russia.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at China. They don't police. They don't have troops everywhere. What they have is, they have people taking out the minerals out of the ground. They don't have troops. We have a case in Afghanistan where we have troops on one mountain, it's a very mountainous country, rough country, beautiful country, actually in a lot of ways.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we have troops, and on the other mountain ridge, China is there with big excavating equipment, taking out minerals. They don't have people. Now, it's pretty dangerous for them, because their people tend to be shot as they're operating the machines. You know, it's not exactly the safest place. So we've reduced the force very substantially in Afghanistan, which I don't talk about very much, and that's okay.
<Tucker Carlson> <Neutral> Could you see getting out entirely?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you the problem is, look, I would like to just get out. The problem is, it just seems to be a lab for terrorists. It seems -- I call it the Harvard of terrorists. When you look at the World Trade Center, they were trained. They didn't --- by the way, they attacked the wrong country. They didn't come from Iraq, all right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They came from various other countries. But they all formed in Afghanistan, and it's probably because it's at the base of so many countries, but they all formed and it's rough mountains and you get a lot of -- you know, you get a lot of good hiding places. But I would leave very strong intelligence there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have to watch because they do -- you know, okay, I'll give you a tough one. If you were in my position and a great looking central casting and we have great generals, a great central casting general walks up to your office, I say, "We're getting out." "Yes, sir. We'll get out. Yes, sir." I'll say, "What do you think of that?" "Sir, I'd rather attack them over there, then attack them in our land." In other words, them coming here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's always a very tough decision, you know, with what happened with the World Trade Center, et cetera et cetera. When they say that, you know, no matter how you feel, and you and I feel pretty much very similar. But when you're standing there, and you have some really talented military people saying, "I'd rather attack them over there than have them hit us over here and fight them on our land." It's something you always have to think about.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, I would leave and will leave -- we will be leaving. Very strong Intelligence, far more than you would normally think because it's very important, and we can do it that way, too. But we have reduced the forces very substantially in Afghanistan.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Google, by some measures, the most powerful company in the world -- all information flows through it -- they're against you. They don't want you reelected. Can you get reelected if Google is against you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So you know, I've been hearing that about Google and Facebook and Twitter.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Yes, that's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. I won. They were totally against me. I won. Hillary --
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> They didn't think you were going to win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they fought me very hard. I mean, I heard that and they're fighting me hard right now, which is incredible because I think the Democrats want to shut them up and frankly, so do a lot of the republicans want to shut them up. If you look at Twitter, I have millions and millions of people on Twitter and it's -- you know, it's a very good arm for me. It's great social media.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they don't treat me right. And I know for a fact, I mean, a lot of people try and follow me and it's very hard. I have so many people coming up that they say, "Sir, it's so hard. They make it hard to follow." What they're doing is wrong and possibly illegal. And a lot of things are being looked at right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you're right, Google is very powerful, but I won. And a poll just came out today I'm at 54 or 55, and they do say you can add 10 to whatever poll I have, okay? And I never get good press. I mean, I haven't had a good story. I used to get the best press in the world. You remember the old days when I was an entrepreneur, I used to get great press.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, I get -- because of what I stand for and represent and nobody has ever had, I think 93 percent -- it came out the other day, 93 percent, and I'm talking about stories that should be good, they make them bad or should be great, they make them like neutral. And yet I won, and I'll win again. So when they say it's the most powerful, it may be, but they were against me. Facebook was against me. They were all against me. Twitter was against me. Twitter -- I've been very good for Twitter.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think Twitter would be the same without what I do on Twitter. But they just have this crazy disposition. They have this philosophy, and yet, the Democrats are very much opposed to them in so many ways. It's sort of an amazing thing.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> So you just said that what the tech companies are doing maybe illegal, is there a role for the Justice Department in finding out?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they could be and I don't want to even say whether or not they're doing something, but I will tell you, there are a lot of people that want us to and there are a lot of people -- all you have to do is pick up a newspaper and read it or see it or watch Fox or watch some other network. There are a lot of people that want us to take action against Facebook and against Twitter and frankly, against Amazon.
<Tucker Carlson> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Amazon also. A lot of people want us to take action.
<Tucker Carlson> <Neutral> Are you going to?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can't say that, Tucker. That I can't say.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> You've come to where we are now Osaka or Tokyo and the cities are clean. There's no graffiti. No one going to bathroom on the street. You don't see junkies.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's very nice, isn't it?
<Tucker Carlson> <Neutral> Very different from our city.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Well, no, some of our cities --
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> Some of our cities, but New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles - they've got a major problem with --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's very sad.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> With filth. Why is that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a phenomena that started two years ago. It's disgraceful. I'm going to may be and I'm looking at it very seriously, we're doing some other things that you probably noticed like some of the very important things that we're doing now. But we're looking at it very seriously because you can't do that. You can't have what's happening -- where police officers are getting sick just by walking the beat.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, they're getting actually very sick, where people are getting sick, where the people living there living in hell, too. Although some of them have mental problems where they don't even know they're living that way. In fact, perhaps they like living that way. They can't do that. We cannot ruin our cities.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you have people that work in those cities. They work in office buildings and to get into the building, they have to walk through a scene that nobody would have believed possible three years ago. And this is the liberal establishment. This is what I'm fighting. They -- I don't know if they're afraid of votes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know if they really believe that this should be taking place. But it's a terrible thing that's taking place. And we may be -- You know, I had a situation when I first became President, we had certain areas of Washington, D.C. where that was starting to happen, and I ended it very quickly. I said, "You can't do that." When we have leaders of the world coming in to see the President of the United States and they're riding down a highway, they can't be looking at that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I really believe that it hurts our country. They can't be looking at scenes like you see in Los Angeles and San Francisco. San Francisco, I own property in San Francisco, so I don't care except it was so beautiful. And now areas that you used to think as being, you know, really something very special, you take a look at what's going on with San Francisco, it's terrible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we're looking at it very seriously. We may intercede. We may do something to get that whole thing cleaned up. It's inappropriate. Now, we have to take the people and do something. We have to do something.
<Tucker Carlson> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, you know, we're really not very equipped as a government to be doing that kind of work. That's not really the kind of work that the government probably should be doing. We've never had this in our lives before in our country. And it's not only those few cities, it's a couple of other ones.
<Tucker Carlson> <Negative> No, it's a lot of cities.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> At the same time, most of our cities are doing great. But if you look at some of these, they are usually sanctuary cities run by very liberal people and the states are run by very liberal people. But the thing that nobody can figure out is do these governors or mayors, do they really think this is a positive?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do they really think this is okay? Because it's not. It's destroying their city. And it's destroying a whole way of life, and it's not our country. It's not what our country is all about.
<John Delano> <Positive> Mr. President, welcome to Pittsburgh.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Jon.
<John Delano> <Positive> You know, sometimes it seems as if you're here all the time, and that we should give you a voter registration card. What is it you most like about Pittsburgh?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I love the state and the place, and I also love the fact you have really, in terms of legacy, the greatest steel place in the world and we're bringing that back, and a lot of other things are happening in Pittsburgh. We are very proud of it.
<John Delano> <Positive> Do you think you fulfilled those promises, or is there more to do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I've more than fulfilled them, but we can still do a little bit more. Some of them are statutory -- where we need certain -- where you have to wait 180 days and then you have to wait six months, and, you know, et cetera et cetera. But we have a -- we have a -- a pipeline now, in terms of regulations, approvals, approving certain pipelines, actual pipelines.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have things to do that are great. But I think I'm way, way ahead of schedule.
<John Delano> <Negative> You know, there are protestors outside, now they are concerned about fracking, and climate change. What's your message to them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, we have a wealthy country. We have things that we're doing, and that we want to do, that can only be done if we let our great factories operate. If you want to close down half of your wealth, and half of your factories, if you want to close things up and go with wind -- which, by the way, kills the birds, and has lots of other problems, and I'm not even knocking it, but it's not enough for this country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We are doing so well right now, and, if you want to close it up, and if you want to put everybody out of work, I guess you have to vote for her, or somebody else on the other side.
<John Delano> <Negative> And, I'm just wondering if you think that this administration, and this Congress, have done all that they could have done to prevent this kind of tragedy from ever happening again?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, It's a tremendous mental illness problem, let's face it. This person was just terrible, and, this is what happens. These are sick people, very, very sick people. I was here, I saw, and we all suffered together. I've never seen anything like it. I was a -- and you, at the same time, you had some incredibly brave people that really stopped it.
<John Delano> <Negative> Do you think there is more we can do as a country to stop this, to even prevent white nationalism, and the like, from happening?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, and we have to stop it all, and other countries do have problems and somehow, I think, the problems they have, they don't get talked about the same way. But, we are doing a lot to stop it. A lot does have to do with mental health. You look at so many, so many -- they talk about they've been flagged.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They know they have problems, and nobody does things about it. And, you know, as an example, in the school shooting in Florida, we knew how sick that person was, meaning the police, could have done something about it. So many different signs. But we are working very hard on it, very, very hard.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> It is 35 minutes past the hour. You have the Rick and Bubba Show. As promoted, and we're thankful to all who made this happen, the 45th president of the United States of America, Donald Trump, is standing by. President, welcome to the Rick and Bubba Show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you, both, very much. I got to meet Bubba the other night. We had, I guess, a record-setting rally. Couldn't have been one that was more crowded than that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was a great evening.
<Bubba Bussey> <Positive> Mr. President, it was an exciting and electric night. It was a pleasure to meet you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, great meeting you. And Bubba, that was great to meet you.
<Rick Burgess> <Negative> Well, he worked the crowd into a frenzy. We've watched the video, I mean, the place was in a frenzy. And I told you that if things don't go the way that you're hoping they'll go concerning the Senate race, you can blame that on Bubba.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm going to, I expect to. Luther, who's a really great guy, he's a fantastic guy. And he was sort of unfairly labeled. They have him as best friends with Mitch McConnell.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He doesn't even know Mitch. I mean, he met him a few months ago. When he came into Washington, he got to know him a little bit. But he virtually doesn't even know him, but they tried to put that tag away.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Politics is a dirty business. You guys might have figured that out by now.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Oh my goodness.
<Bubba Bussey> <Neutral> We've heard that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And Luther Strange is a -- is going to be a great senator. He already has, and he already has helped me. You know the story I told is 100% true. He wanted to give me his support. And I just didn't forget it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was a different kind of a support. It was without -- it's just a support that was a very beautiful thing to watch happening, the way it formed, and he really was helpful. And he's helpful right now, actually. So we hope we can keep him in the Senate. He's -- he loves Alabama. I tell you what, he loves the state and he loves the country and he's a solid guy. And very important, fellas, to me very importantly, is that he will absolutely win against the Democrat.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Whereas Ray's going to have a hard time, you know that. It's going to be a hard race. You've seen those races go very bad over the years, whether it's Harry Reid's race or whether it's a couple of others that I won't even mention, that were tough and they were not victories, and Luther wins automatically. If Luther wins tomorrow, the Democrats will hardly fight. If Ray wins, they've got to pour in $30 million like they did in Atlanta.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I had to bring her -- we brought her over the line. We did a great job. But Karen, we had a -- we had a very, very, very tough race, taking -- fighting for Tom Price's seat in the -- in Congress. And they spent $32 million on that race because they thought they're gonna win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It ended up that we won by five points. The good news, I'm five and 0.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Yes, right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. And these races will last a little while. And I want to keep it. I want to make this one, six and 0. This is an important one, so I want to make it six and 0.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I'm doing it really for the country. I mean, he is a good man. We can't lose him.
<Rick Burgess> <Negative> So you -- President, you said, obviously, and it was Roy Moore. I know you were saying Ray. But Roy Moore and -- but I wanted to clarify that for the audience who you were talking about. Obviously, this would not be somebody that we would be against as far as who he is.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> But when you're talking about the strategy, and I think you're right, if Luther doesn't win this, there's a shot that he's kind of -- Roy's done a great job as a judge. But when it comes to a senator and some of the things he's been part of, whether it's right or not, the Democrats are going to try to turn this into something they think they have hope in. And is that part of the motivation? And I know you said it was them. But when you tell people right now about Luther, you also think with -- right now, with every single vote that counts, you just feel like this is somebody that's going to push your agenda through without hesitation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that Luther will be absolutely fantastic in terms of agenda. He wants the wall. He's very, very tough on crime. Remember this that if Luther didn't run, if he would have -- in other words, if he weren't appointed, let's say, he was Attorney General and he stayed Attorney General, etc., etc., and then he ran, nobody would even run against him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He would have been -- but because he was appointed by a little bit of a controversial guy, I guess, as I understand it, now, it makes the race tough. If he would have done nothing and just run now against -- and it might be that Roy Moore, as you say, because I don't know Roy Moore at all.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I think it's perhaps indicative when somebody doesn't even know his name, you know?
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know this great controversy and there's a lot of angst, but I don't know very much about Roy Moore. Luther is going to be -- Luther was one of the most popular people in Alabama. I mean, he was really a popular guy, and he would have won that race had he not been appointed. It turned out to be -- really, appointing him turned out to be difficult.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> At the same time, I'm glad it happened because he's really been helpful.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And again, it's so important because, as you know, Mitch is not, polling-wise, the most popular guy in this country. And they like to label him because he happened to be there for a number of months with -- in the Senate, so they like to label him as [ Mitch's ] best friend. But he's not, and he hardly even knows him. And he'll be fighting Mitch.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know he's going to fight him on that ridiculous filibuster role, where you need 60 votes instead of 50 or 51. That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. So that means we need eight Democrats, and the Republicans could end it. I know that Luther came out the other day very much opposed to that, and that's -- and Mitch wants to keep it, which is ridiculous, by the way. But Mitch wants to keep it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And how do you get votes? That means you have to get eight Democrats every time.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Yeah, I don't get it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It is absolutely insanity to keep it. But Luther's very, very strongly opposed to that. He wants 51 votes and the Republicans have a very, very slim march. And the fact is in '18, we have to get -- we have a chance to get more senators.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But good things have to happen, so Roy Moore is going to have a very hard time getting elected against the Democrat. And Luther, they won't even be fighting. They won't be sending money because he's a guy that they understand and you check out the polling. But they understand, he's going to do very -- he's going to win a very easy race against a Democrat.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's a big difference. People forget this is the end. This is this getting the nomination, and then you go into the race against a Democrat and the Democrat is not an unpopular person. And frankly, it's going to be a very, very tough race for Roy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it's going to be a no-contest for Luther. That's a big factor.
<Bubba Bussey> <Negative> Mr. President, I thought one of the most unfair things in this that Luther has been painted, as you said, and you saw the ads that have run as an insider. He's only been in Washington as a senator for, what, four or five months. I know he worked there one time, too. But I just -- I think that's very unfair characterization of him, don't you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So Luther is a man who is very independent, a man who loves his state, who loves the people of Alabama, and he loves the country and they painted him as also -- they do the same thing with me. They paint me as everything you could imagine. I mean, you've seen that. And yet we just have new polls today, we're doing great because we're accomplishing a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have over 50 legislative pieces approved already, approved by the legislature, which is very hard. We have -- I've reduced restrictions and regulations at a rate that has never taken place in history. We have the Supreme Court judge, not just nominated, or -- I mean, it's confirmed, Judge Gorsuch, which is going to save you a Second Amendment. And now hopefully, at some point, we'll get another one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we're gonna save your Second Amendment. Had Hillary won, your Second Amendment was gone. You might as well turn in your rifles and turn in your guns, but we're going to save you a Second Amendment now. And I've done a lot, I think, and I've said this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And other people have said it, too. I think I've done more. I think we've accomplished more than any other president in nine months. I don't think any president has accomplished what we've accomplished, and yet I'm always bucking the system. I'm fighting the system. I'm fighting Republicans as much as Democrats. And sometimes, recently, in order to get the tax cuts, I made a deal with the Democrats because you can't make them sometimes with Republicans, which is unfortunate that's why I need a guy like Luther, but I made a deal with Pelosi.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Can you believe that?
<Rick Burgess> <Negative> No, I can't.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Schumer. I mean, yes, but what did we get? We got debt ceiling put off. We got the CRs put off. We got the military put off down the door because I want a lot of -- a lot of money is being spent on the military at my behest. And I want to say -- I don't want to complicate the tax cuts because we're doing massive tax cuts, massive.
<Bubba Bussey> <Neutral> Now, I know you're going to roll those out this week, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're going to roll them out on Wednesday. And I think people are going be -- it'll be the largest tax cuts in the history of our country.
<Rick Burgess> <Neutral> What you will say gets all of this.
<Bubba Bussey> <Neutral> So do we have the votes to get it through already?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll let you know. I mean, health care, I've been watching for seven years. Because don't forget, I've only been doing this for two.
<Bubba Bussey> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I've been watching now for seven years, repeal and replace by the Republicans. And yet McCain votes against, and we have others -- couple of others that are going to vote, looks like Susan Collins and some others will vote against. And don't forget, when we have 52 senators, so you lose two, you're out. Now we get the vice president, who, by the way, is coming to Alabama today to campaign strongly for Luther.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But so you -- we don't have much of a margin. We don't have any margin.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Well, and I don't understand, and pardon me for interrupting, because we take calls in this show almost every day. If we get to talking about health care, people are in desperate situations.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Horrible Obamacare.
<Rick Burgess> <Negative> They're -- yes, I mean, and so what I don't understand unless they just didn't tell the truth, how can they say, "Well, we don't have both houses, so we give them the Senate, we give them the house." Well, if we just had the president, wouldn't American people go out and give them the President? And then we go out, you got everything you need, repeal it, and they won't. And the American people are incredibly frustrated by that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They should be. It's disgusting. When I ran, I was told I'd have a bill on my desk, got signed at day one and they -- the Republicans repealed and replaced was at sixty one times? But it didn't matter because Obama was in office, so nobody cared because they knew he wasn't going to sign it, wasn't going to get through the Senate anyway, because they had the majority.
<Rick Burgess> <Negative> Yes, which made them like they were pandering that they were not [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, no, what happened is they just kept -- hey I'd take those bills right now, those bills. But now, when it matters, because you have a president who's actually going to sign it, they don't do it and they pander and they grandstand. I mean, you look at McCain. What McCain has done is a tremendous slap in the face of the Republican Party, tremendous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was good to go all the way up until one or two o'clock in the morning when he voted no. I mean, he was good to go. All week long, all month long, he was good to go. Then all of a sudden he goes thumbs down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you can call it what you want, but that was a -- that's the only reason we don't have it, because of John McCain. Nobody thought he was a negative vote. When I was given the negative votes, because remember I was given 10 people. I told you in the speech, I was given 10 people, and I turned every one of them around. I mean, the ones I spoke to, I turned them around. We had all the votes. And then John McCain someplace after one o'clock in the morning, late, late, late in the evening, he all of a sudden goes thumbs down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We said what happened with that? Without John McCain, we have -- we already have the health care and it would have been very good, by the way. What had come out -- what would have come out of that committee would have been very good. Now we have it where we're sending it back to the states, which is really a Republican thing. The states can manage it better than the federal government.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Amen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it would be a -- it's a great bill. Luther is for it 100%, by the way, but it would be a great bill. But we've got, as I told you, we have 52 votes so we can't lose any votes, I mean, practically. So we're going to lose two or three votes, and that's the end of that. But for seven years, you and I -- both of you and I and everybody listening, and I do hear you have the biggest show in Alabama so I have to see right, let's see how Luther does.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Basically, so if I don't -- if we don't win, I can blame you guys and your shows. I'll say, "Well, not enough people listen to that."
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's OK.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Definitely.
<Speedy Wilburn> <Neutral> That won't be the first time.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Well, I know we need to -- quickly, because I know we need to get to a break unless we have another segment with you, which I assume we don't, It's not everyday you get two segments out of the president. But.
<Rick Burgess> <Neutral> I think it's the first radio show. Honestly, I think this is the first radio show I've done as president.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Well, we.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But that's OK.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> And we appreciate that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's a great compliment to you, and I thought you were great the other night when I met you two.
<Bubba Bussey> <Positive> Well, thank you, sir. We appreciate it.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Thank you very much. You don't ask the president for a liner.
<Bubba Bussey> <Neutral> Ask him, Rick.
<Speedy Wilburn> <Negative> Yes, yes, you stop the bad acting for a liner.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Mr. President, what I'm about to do right now, if it's not class, you just say, "Burgess, I can't do that for you." But if we could have you say, "This is Donald Trump, president of the United States, and you're listening to the Rick and Bubba Show," we would appreciate it. But if you don't think you should do that, we understand.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will. I should definitely not do it, but I will do it. Are you ready?
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> Yes.
<Bubba Bussey> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is Donald Trump, president of the United States.
<Rick Burgess> <Neutral> I love the state of Alabama, and you're listening to the Rick and Bubba Show and enjoy it.
<Bubba Bussey> <Positive> Thank you, Mr. President, so much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, fellas.
<Speedy Wilburn> <Positive> Thank you, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, both, and good luck to Luther. Luther is a -- he will make a great, great senator. I hope the folks at Alabama agree. And I love the folks in Alabama.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So just have a good time, have a good day, and I appreciate it. Good luck tomorrow.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> All right. Thank you very much.
<Bubba Bussey> <Negative> Praying for you, sir.
<Rick Burgess> <Positive> There he goes, the president of the United States, Donald Trump. We'll be right back.
