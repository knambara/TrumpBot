<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Morning glory and evening grace, America. It's Hugh Hewitt. On a day of huge headlines from Capitol Hill and from polling around the country, Donald Trump has surged to a commanding lead in the Washington Post/ABC poll. He's ahead in the Bowling Green University poll in Ohio, and in fact, he leads every poll I've seen except one with Iowa. We'll talk about that, but Donald Trump, welcome back to the Hugh Hewitt Show, great to talk to you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great to be with you, Hugh.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Let me begin with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Have you had a chance to watch any of today's hearings?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I want to get your input, because I actually watched her first five minutes, and then I had to go, because I had a big meeting. And I thought her opening remarks really looked bad, but I don't know. I have not been hearing positive things. How is she doing?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Terribly. There are smoking guns all over the place. It's an armory of smoking guns. Let me play for you one exchange.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> This is Congressman Mike Pompeo talking to her, Donald Trump, about security at the embassy.
<Mike Pompeo> <Positive> Do you know how many security requests there were in the 1st quarter of 2012?
<Hillary Clinton> <Negative> For everyone or for Benghazi?
<Mike Pompeo> <Negative> For, I'm sorry, yes, ma'am, related to Benghazi and Libya. Do you know how many there were?
<Hillary Clinton> <Negative> No, I do not know.
<Mike Pompeo> <Neutral> Ma'am, there were just over a hundred-plus. In the 2nd quarter, do you know how many there were?
<Hillary Clinton> <Negative> No, I do not.
<Mike Pompeo> <Negative> Ma'am, there were 172ish. Might have been 171 or 173. That's...how many were there in July and August, and then that week and a few days before the attacks, do you know?
<Hillary Clinton> <Negative> There were a number of them. I know that.
<Mike Pompeo> <Positive> Yes, ma'am, 83, by our count. That's over 600 requests. You've testified here this morning that you had none of those reach your desk. Is that correct also?
<Hillary Clinton> <Neutral> That's correct.
<Mike Pompeo> <Positive> Madame Secretary, Mr. Blumenthal wrote you 150 emails. It appears from the materials that we've read that all of those reached your desk.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> What do you make of that, Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Wow, that's unbelievable. That sounds pretty amazing. So these were requests for protection, essentially?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Wow, that's not good. So hundreds and hundreds of requests? I would say that doesn't sound so good. I mean, I just saw, you know, it was very interesting, because I did have to leave, and I watched maybe five or six minutes, maybe ten minutes, her opening remarks, and the way she was reading them, it sounded terrible. The whole thing sounded terrible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I thought, I was very, I was so looking forward, and I am looking forward, actually. You know, I'm going to Florida. I'm doing a big thing at Doral tomorrow, like thousands of people, and we're going to have 15,000 people in Jacksonville, Florida. I said I have to go back upstairs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to watch this hearing. But I can get, from you, I'll get better than watching it. That's the thing I like about you. So you think that, I mean, you think that she is not doing well?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> I think she's doing terrible, and there's one aspect I want to go to your Art of the Deal experience.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> She has listened to the [Congressmen] with her hand on her face, with her head, you know, cocked to one side contemptuously throughout hours and hours of testimony. When you see that at a negotiation, Donald Trump, what does that tell you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think she's trying to feign boredom, but I think she probably wants to just get out of there. It really, you know, sort of indicates two things. But she's trying to feign disdain and boredom. And it just sounded to me, I have other friends that have been watching it very studiously today, and they are really surprised.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, when I watched Trey Gowdy on, I think it was Face The Nation this weekend, it sounded to me like he was not going to go after her that much, Hugh, because he was sort of saying well, we have other people, and she's just a small part of it. It sounded to me like he was pulling back. But as I'm hearing it today, they're not pulling back at all. They're really going into it, and I'm just hearing she's looking very bad.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Maybe Biden did the wrong thing getting out yesterday.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Maybe he did. Here is a second, the smoking gun exchange. This is Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan with the former Secretary of State.
<Jim Jordan> <Negative> In that email you sent to your family, here's what you said at 11:00 that night, approximately one hour after you told the American people it was a video, you say to your family two officers were killed today in Benghazi by an al Qaeda-like group. So you tell the American people one thing, you tell your family an entirely different story. Also, on the night of the attack, you had a call with the president of Libya. Here's what you said to him.
<Jim Jordan> <Negative> Ansar al-Sharia is claiming responsibility. It's interesting. Mr. Khattala, one of the guys arrested and charged, actually belonged to that group.
<Jim Jordan> <Negative> And finally, and most significantly, the next day, within 24 hours, you had a conversation with the Egyptian prime minister. You told him this. We know the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack, not a protest.
<Jim Jordan> <Neutral> Let me read that one more time...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Now Donald Trump, Lindsey Graham has called these the smoking gun emails.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, well, it's...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> What do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...certainly a part of it. It's certainly a part of it, and it's so different than what she's been saying for so long. So that's a problem for her. Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very interesting.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Do you think when you lose...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You must be, you must find this very interesting, I would say, as a student. You must find this very interesting.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Oh, I think her credibility is shattered, and I wonder, once you lose credibility, how do you get it back, Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's very hard. It's very hard, especially when you lose it in such a public forum. You know, a lot people are watching and want to watch it, and they're going to be going home tonight, like me, and they want to devour it. And they want to see what's going on.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I mean, just from the little bit that you've played for me. And plus, there's a level of, you know, the questions are tough. They're tough. The way they're put is very tough.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Let me ask you this. This is also occurred to me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's amazing.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> ...as appropriate for Donald Trump. Lots of people want to get to you. Obviously, you've got hundreds of thousands of people want to get to you. They want you in their deals.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> They want your name, etc. If someone like Sidney Blumenthal gets through to you 130 times, and you respond to them, does that person have standing? Should we as an outsider say that person has standing with Donald Trump, or in this case, with Hillary?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, that person, that person has great standing, and Blumenthal obviously had great standing. Most people are not able to get through. I'd say 99.9, most people are not able to get through to somebody like Hillary. He gets through, and from what everybody tells me, this is not a good person.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And this is not a person that she should be dealing with. And I think the President, as I remember from seeing it a long time ago, didn't they even request that she not deal with him? They don't like him.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They don't want him dealing with her? So she's doing that behind the President's back, and in theory, she's working with the President and for the President. So I think that's amazing, and I noticed how much he seemed, the access he seemed to have to her. And has that come up, yet, today?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Oh, yeah, quite a lot. Sidney Blumenthal is in this hearing more than Ambassador Stevens is in this hearing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Wow.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> And it just goes to the fact that he basically owns a private channel. And does anyone have that to you, Donald Trump? If you're the president of the United States, does anyone have a back channel to you that we should know about going in?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would say Ivanka, Ivanka Trump, okay?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> (laughing)
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Maybe nobody else. You know, it's amazing, and what really amazed me is the level of hatred and I think distrust and everything else that the President had for Blumenthal. You know, it's really surprising that she'd do that, because she actually, I thought somewhere along the line, sort of indicated like she wouldn't be dealing with him much anymore.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> She did. Let me talk to you about secret servers, because the CIA director's email's been hacked. She had a secret server. These emails are now appearing.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Are your emails at the Trump operation, and your servers' protected? Does the private sector have an advantage here over government contracting?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're in theory very secure, but you know, honestly, my emails are so boring, I would release them tomorrow. My emails are not exciting, and I'm not a big fan of the email stuff. You know, I've seen so many people have problems because of emails. I've watched it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know, going a step further, I'm not sure, I have a son who's 9 years old. He's so good with computers. And I'm not sure with computers that you know, as wonderful as they are in so many different ways, you know, we're talking about technology. In the old days, when you wanted to attack, you'd have a courier with armed guards, and you'd have an envelope, and you'd give it to the general, right?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, you send it to the general, and you don't have, you have no idea how many people are watching and reading, they're, you know, they're hacking your messages. It's really pretty, I think MacArthur would not like the whole concept of computers. You understand what I mean. There are so many brilliant people out there that understand the innards of these machines, and when you look at heads of agencies that have been totally hacked, and I mean totally hacked, and I guess there was one yesterday or the day before where some young kid was hacking top people in different agencies.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Yup.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, that's pretty sad stuff. I'm not sure that you could stop it, to be honest with you.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> So are you going to, are you assuming that everything...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think computers are very, when you talk about lack of security, I think there's a great lack of security with computers, I'll tell you.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Are you assuming that everything that you put on an email, or you put into a direct message, is public?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I assume that.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, that's a good rule.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it's totally illegal for people to do things about it, but I assume that when I send out emails, and when I sent, which are very seldom, frankly, I'm not a big believer. I like to do it as little as possible. But I assume that they're being looked at by other people.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> All right, let's move to the polls. As I said at the beginning, and I was on CNN this morning with Chris Cuomo, you're ahead in the Washington Post poll by a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Not insignificant, by a lot. You're ahead in everything except this Iowa Quinnipiac poll. Why is that the outlier? What's going on in Iowa?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I was very surprised to see it. You know, I was in Iowa last night. We had 4,000 people. It was packed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was great. It was a lovefest. It was amazing. And I was actually surprised, I'm not saying that a thing like that can't happen, but I was very, very surprised to see it, because I think we're doing well in Iowa.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a feeling we're doing much better in Iowa than the polls are showing, if you want to know the truth. But we had an amazing crowd, I'm sure you saw it, because it was all over television.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> I did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, I left there literally at 10:00 in the evening last night. I got home at 12:30, and I saw it on television, and everybody saw it. It was a big thing. It was really amazing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was, the level of love in that room, and love for the country in that room, was absolutely beautiful to watch. And I was very surprised. I saw the poll. I was leading in Iowa, and not by a huge amount, but I was leading in Iowa, and I was very surprised to see that I wasn't.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's the only one I've had that I'm not leading. And you know, Massachusetts came out, I think it's 48-12 or something like that.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yes, it's huge.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And so many have come out...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> The Emerson poll.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I was very surprised, I was really very surprised to see Iowa. It's fine, but I was very surprised to see. I'm not sure I agree with it, and we'll see what happens.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Now polls are often wrong. They were wrong in Canada this week. They were wrong in Great Britain. They were wrong in Israel.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> They were wrong in the United States in the fall of 2014. Let's talk about Canada. What do you think happened up there? Why did it go from a red with Stephen Harper to a deep blue with the young Trudeau boy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Harper was there for a long time, and you know, when you're there for a long time, a lot of times, people want to see change, not Obama change, you know, but they want to see change. They want to see something, somebody different. And he looks to me, I know very little about him, he's on the liberal side, but he looks to me to be attractive. His father, I knew his father, actually, and his father was, you know, quite a character at the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he's an attractive, young guy, and somehow he resonated. You know, it's all about if you resonate. Let's see, and he did resonate. There's no question about it.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Yeah, I shouldn't have called him a boy. I meant son. I mean son, the Trudeau son, not the Trudeau boy. He's 30-plus.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> He's not a boy. He's a man, but...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Have you spent much time in Canada? Do you know much about Canada?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do. I know something about some of the major cities in Toronto and other places.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> So what's your opinion of that country? I mean, they've made a U-turn. It's a big change.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love Canada. I think it's an incredible country. It is heading in a different direction than you might love or I might love, but we'll see what happens. He's not overly liberal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, he's, but he's certainly a lot different than what you had in there before. There are many countries going that way. And there are a couple going the opposite way. I find, and have you watched this stuff just over the years, Hugh, you see the countries going, a lot of times they'll go one direction and then boom, they swing back, and they usually go the opposite way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it was very interesting to see that happen.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> They have a very open immigration policy there, and as you know, some of the 9/11 attackers came into this country from Canada.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Do we need more control of the Canadian border in the way that you've talked about controlling the Mexican border?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the Canadian border is a much, much longer border, and it just doesn't seem that, and certainly you can have problems up there, and I know one of our brilliant candidates said let's build a wall on the Canadian border. I actually thought he was joking when he said that, but I guess he wasn't, and maybe that's why he's not in the race anymore. But we have to just, we need vigilance all over. Let's face it, we need vigilance all over.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have to have people watching all over. On the Southern border, I think we have, I definitely feel we have to have a wall, and we can have, and walls do work, by the way. Walls do work. But on the Southern border, we need a wall.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, now I ask you every time I see you in person at the debate or on the phone if your military/national security team is ready to be rolled out, yet. Have you gotten close to rolling it out, yet?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've had meetings with people, and I felt very strongly about, you know, that whole subject for a long period of time, long before this, long before this run. I've felt very, very strongly about it. I think there's nothing more important. And you know, another thing that people don't ever bring up, and they literally never bring it up, I bring it up all the time, is the way our vets are being treated, because they are being treated horribly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm seeing more, and you know, I get to see, on the trail, I now go on the campaign trail. I would have never thought I would have said that, because I've been a politician for three months now. But on the trail, I meet so many vets, and they are being devastated by what's going on at the Veterans Administration. It's incredible, but I do have a great group of people, and at the right time, I'm going to roll them out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think you'll be impressed. I think even you will be impressed, Hugh.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Is there a Kissinger among them? Is there a Zbieg among them? Someone who is going to stand out and really guide the Trump worldview?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think there are people that are highly-respected. I don't want to use, you know, necessarily the names that you just used, but I think they're people that are highly-respected, and people that when they hear the names, people will be impressed, people that know, like yourself, will be impressed.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Now I've talked to you before about military spending, and you've assured this audience you are going to be very robust in spending money. The F-35 is the aircraft of the future. It's already $160 billion dollars over budget. We were supposed to sell 3,100 of them to our allies and to ourselves, and Canada's going to drop its order now.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> A program like this, are you down into the weeds, yet, on the F-35 or the Ohio-class replacement? Or are you going to let other people brief you up on that as you get closer to the White House?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I do what briefings, but I do hear that it's not very good. I'm hearing that our existing planes are better. And one of the pilots came out of the plane, one of the test pilots, and said this isn't as good as what we already have. And to spend billions and billions of dollars on something that maybe isn't as good, but, and I don't know if you've heard that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Have you been hearing that also?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Well, there are big problems with the F-35, yes, absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, well, I mean, big problems. They're saying it doesn't perform as well as our existing equipment, which is much less expensive. So when I hear that, immediately I say we have to do something, because you know, they're spending billions. This is a plane.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There's never been anything like it in terms of cost. And how about, you know, we're retooling with planes that aren't as good as the ones we have, and the test pilots are amazing people. They know better than anybody, okay, and I think you would accept that.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When they say that this cannot perform as well, as the planes we already have, what are doing, and spending so much more money?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, now I'm close to the end of my time, and I always get hit by my audience for not asking you any fun questions, so here's some fun questions. Do you watch college football?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Who do you cheer for other than The Ohio State University Buckeyes?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I do, I have a lot of respect, I have a lot of respect for that coach, wouldn't you think? I mean, look what happens every place he goes. I used to think it was his great quarterback in Florida that caused all of this, but I mean, here he has three quarterbacks last year and he did so well. So I do have great respect for that team. I certainly have respect for the Notre Dame program, you look at it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I find it amazing to watch different programs. You look at what happened to Texas, how bad that's gone, and I look at, you know, things like that, too. I like to see the good, the bad, ugly. I like to see what's happening.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you have some very interesting, you have some very interesting teams. I think Alabama is looking stronger and stronger.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> So by the way, is there...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But with all of that being said, I don't get to watch too much, because I am doing pretty much what you and I talk 95% of the time about. But I do find it, I love all sports, actually.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> But you don't, you don't have, your heart is not sold to any club like mine is to the Buckeyes? You don't have a number one affection?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, not to that extent. I like watching it. I watch it a little bit from afar. I don't have a lot of time to watch it, but I certainly enjoy it.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> And if you're president, will you fill out the NCAA brackets like President Obama has made a habit of doing every year? Or do you think that's a silly exercise of time?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd rather spend my time doing other things. I think it's fine that he does it, but you know, honestly, I'd rather spend my time, we've got a lot of problems. We've got $19 trillion in debt. We have our horrible, that terrible deal, one of the most incompetent deals of any kind that I've seen with Iran.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have so many problems in this country, I'd really rather, I have no objection to him doing it. He wants to play games. But I'd really rather spend my time doing more important things.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Now you do play a lot of golf, though, don't you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I used to. I haven't been very much. I used to play a lot of golf. I mean, a lot of golf, I'd play once a week or twice a week.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I own some of the greatest clubs in the world. I own Doral, the Blue Monster. I own Turnberry in Scotland, home of the British Open.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Oh, I know. I've got...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> One of the greatest places in the world, but I don't get to use it.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> I've got a Donald Trump IOU for Turnberry. I get to play Turnberry. But what's your handicap?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've worn a lot of club championships, and I would say that now, it would be four, because I'm a good golfer.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Oh, gosh.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would say four, but I've worn many club championships where you have to beat scratch golfers. So I've been a good golfer...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> You know, you're not going to win a lot of votes if you go out and tell people you're a four handicap. Everybody above four is not going to like you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know. No, well, I haven't been playing very much, but I think I'd be okay at four. But I haven't been playing very much. I would say now, I'm averaging one round every two and a half weeks.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Can you believe that? Two and a half, three weeks. That's terrible.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> That's terrible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know, I'm all over the place. And honestly, it's so exciting what I'm going. I'm having such a good time doing it that I'm not thinking in terms of golf. Does that make sense to you?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> It does.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's just like too exciting.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> My last question has to do with your access in the media. You let Mark Leibovich, who is one of the world's great writers, come fly with you on Trump One back and forth across the country. And Mark is a friend of this program, he's a friend of mine. He's a great writer.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Are you doing a lot of that? Are you saying come on in, people, and follow me around, you'll get the real Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't really, you know, mind. I did, I liked Mark. He's a nice guy. I was disappointed in the cover.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a cover in the New York Times magazine, and they put, like, I don't know, they had some artwork. And inside, they had one of the best pictures I've ever seen of myself. I loved the picture, but it wasn't on the cover. So anyway, they didn't put the kind of picture that you would normally, it was a cover story, actually, but they didn't use the good picture.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think Mark's a terrific guy, actually, and I do open it up to people. And I think you have to, I think you have an obligation. You're running for office, you have to open it up. But I'm on the cover of so many magazines.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm on the cover of the Forbes 400. I'm on the cover of Time Magazine. I'm on the cover of People Magazine. I'm just looking at my desk.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have covers all over the place. So...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> So these are the last two questions. Do you think Hillary will ever allow that kind of access to her that you gave to Leibovich? Or does she have too much to hide?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think she will, unless it's to a very friendly person.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> And then finally, a lot of people like you because your kids are all great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> And they opened up in People. And of your kids, have any of them caused you problems or angst? Or have you just hit the golden win streak here?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think, you know, there are certain problems, but nothing like, you know, I have friends that have tremendous problems with their children, and I see what they go through, and it's a very sad thing with drugs and different things. And they haven't caused me that kind of problems. They've been very good, and they've been good students. They've gone to good schools, and they've bene very good students, so I'm proud of them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And now the three older ones are in the business with me, Ivanka, Don and Eric, and we're very proud of the job they're doing. So I really think, certainly little chugs along the way, but overall, I'm very happy with them. I'm very proud of them.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> And they like the campaign life? They like being out there with dad on the...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They enjoy it. They love seeing what's happening. I mean, you know, in Jacksonville...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Oh, interesting....
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think we're going to have 15,000 people on Saturday night, 15,000, and it could be much more than that. But I mean, when I say 15, I like to use the lower numbers so that we can always, but I think we're probably talking about 15,000 people, and Doral, in Florida, which is tomorrow night, we're going to have thousands of people.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Have a great trip. I've overstayed my time. Tell Hope I'm sorry, and I'll talk to you next time, Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Don't worry, I look forward to it. Thank you very much, Hugh.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Thank you, be well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So long.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Right now, Donald Trump. You just heard him he went to Iowa. He ripped President Obama and blasted more than one potential GOP presidential candidate. And Donald Trump joins us. Good evening, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hello, Greta.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Well, two big verbal punches, one to Governor Romney and one to Governor Bush. And to Governor Romney, you said he is not a closer.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He is not a closer. He was not able to close the deal. He should have been able to. We had a president that was doing terribly, as bad as you are going to do, and he should have won. And many Republicans would have won. And he was not able to close the deal. And certainly, the Republicans cannot be so stupid as to give him a second crack because honestly he choked.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He wasn't able to get it done. He should have been able to get it done. There is no excuse for it. And you cannot give that person a second chance, unfortunately.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. Governor Bush, you criticized him and said we don't need another Bush. In all fairness, he should not get extra credit for being Bush but he should also not lose some credit for being a Bush. He should be measured by himself.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's a huge negative. The Bush name is not exactly hot right now. I think it's a very, very big negative. He is very weak on immigration. He is for Common Core, which, for is a Republican, I can tell, it is not a positive thing. I think he wouldn't get elected. I don't think he would beat Hillary or whoever it may be.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. You describe President Obama as either grossly incompetent or has a completely different agenda than you want to hear about. What do you mean by a completely different agenda? What's he got that we don't want to hear about?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, he wants to change us around to a different system than what we are supposed to be in this country. He wants to go very different route. And I said that very strongly. And I got, as you know, more standing ovations by far than anybody else, and that was one of them. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He is either grossly incompetent or he wants to go in a different situation. He wants to give away the free enterprise system. He wants to have a system that does not mesh well with what we are about, and certainly what the Republicans are all about.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Are you saying he is anti-capitalism? Is that sort of code for that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Socialism and anti-capitalism and lots of other things, yes.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right. And you also said in an interview to "Breitbart," "I can make America great again." And you also said that you're seriously considering about running. What are the odds you're running?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am very, very seriously considering it. I could make America great again. We have tremendous potential. We're not using it. Politicians are all talk, no action. I have been watching them for years. I was doing well last anytime. I could have done something. In a way, I have a regret. I did what I had to do when I backed Mitt and Mitt let us down and that was very unfortunate.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I can tell you this. We have tremendous potential as a country. We don't use it. We are falling behind. China is now the one -- the number-one economic engine, economic country, which is unthinkable if you go back 10 years. Unthinkable that a thing like that could happen. And, again, we have the ability in this country to truly be a great one again.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right now, we are falling so far behind.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, how you can walk away from your businesses? And I looked at the numbers from Miss Universe last night. I know how "The Apprentice" is doing. Could you really walk away from all of that to run for the presidency?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would be willing to do it. "The Apprentice" is doing fantastically well. Miss Universe, last night, is doing -- you saw the Nielsen ratings. They were through the roof. And all of that. But obviously, the country is far more important. And I can do things that other people can't do. I can do things that the other Republicans candidate and, frankly, the Democratic candidates can't do. One of the things we have to do is stop with this tremendous flow of people just walking right into the country.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We don't know who they are, where they come from. They just walk right across our southern border. And who builds a better wall than Donald Trump? I build the best buildings. [Laughter] Walls are easy. And believe me, I would build a wall that is not penetrable. That would be a wall that they are not going to be stepping over.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And we have to do that. We have to stop this influx because it's killing our country.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, thank you. And I hope you come back. And I hope you come here when you make up your mind whether you are going to run or not. Thank you, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you very much.
