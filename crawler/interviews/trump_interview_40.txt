<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> It used to be the president's town. He used to work here full time. He had his own building, his own tower.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Yes.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Remember those days? Now he moved.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> He did, indeed. He's gone down to the 202 area code and the president of the United States is going to be calling in very shortly. We've got all sorts of things to talk about. This has been one of the craziest days we've ever done on "Fox & Friends." Not only is it Summer Concert Series Day today with -- we had a great performer for almost an hour and a half, but also it was the anniversary of the Army, 244 years, and it's Flag Day, and it is the president's birthday as well.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> The president is turning 73 today and he is joining us by phone right now. Good morning to you, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Happy birthday. How do you plan to celebrate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I'll just work, if you want to know. And when you say celebrate --
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> No -- come on you've got to --
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Doesn't surprise us.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> You've got to have a cake or something.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't have time to celebrate.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> What about a cake.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, we'll have a little piece of cake tonight, but in the meantime we're doing a lot of things. We're doing a lot of good things. A lot of things that are turning out to be very good for our country. I enjoy that doing more. That's better than taking it easy. There's always going to be plenty of time to take it easy, I guess.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> And, if you don't mind, I'll -- on the note, "Esquire" magazine did this story and they say, well, that President Trump, the truth is, according to insiders, he likes running for president but he hates the job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I love the job. Well, it's the fake media. You know, they're just so fake. You don't even respond to them anymore. No, I love it because I don't think anybody's accomplished so much in two and a half years, what we've done. You know, I watched Natalie Harp --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That young, beautiful woman, who was --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Cancer.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They made some kind of a medical mistake a long time ago and she's lived a tough time. And I watched her. I think she's one of the best guests you've ever had. She was so -- her spirt was so incredible. And it was about Right to Try. And I've got Right to Try approved. They've been trying to get it for 44 years approved and they couldn't and I got it done, where people that have a real problem, people that are terminally ill in many cases that only people really at -- at a certain level, they couldn't go and use any of our great medicines, any of our great genius that we have, and we have the greatest in the world medically, and in other ways too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think she was just one of your great guests. I -- I thought it was amazing.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Well, just to confirm, Mr. President, if anyone missed it, Natalie Harp's got this rare bone cancer and they basically were just getting her ready to die and try to give her opioid to make the pain less and she didn't want to. And you became president. She had the right to try. She tried some experimental drugs and she's living with cancer, back to work, out of pain --
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> Out of her wheelchair.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> And -- and she has a shot at -- at a great live.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> She says she's alive because of you, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she's got a great shot. And, you know, many other people are like that where Right to Try has helped them where, you know, they used to go to Asia, they'd go all over the world looking for a cure. Now they can stay home. And we have the best medicines, but they're being -- you know, in a line, where you have to wait.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It has to be approved and you wouldn't be able to give it to anybody. Now we're able to do that. And it was a complex process, believe it or not. But for 44 years they tried and they couldn't get it. We got it.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Gotcha.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And there's so many people like Natalie, but I thought she was just an incredible person.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> All right, let's, Mr. President, talk about something in the news today. We've seen those images of the oil tankers on fire out in the gulf and Iran says, hey, don't blame us for this. We didn't do it. We think it was an accident. I know Mike Pompeo has blamed Iran. What sort of evidence do we have that they've done it and what are we going to do about it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Iran did do it. And you know they did it because you saw the boat. I guess one of the mines didn't explode and it's probably got essentially Iran written all over it. And you saw the boat at night trying to take the mine off and successfully took the mine off the boat.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that was exposed. And that was their boat. That was them. And they didn't want the evidence left behind. I guess they don't know that we have things that we can detect in the dark that work very well. So we have that. And know you put it on. So, no, it was them that did it. And, look, President Obama made a deal --
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> So what are we going to do about it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> President Obama made a deal that was an outrage. The Iran deal, which, frankly, in five or six years of a short period of time they'd be allowed to make nuclear weapons. They cannot have nuclear weapons. They understand they're not going to have nuclear weapons. We -- we have enough problems with nuclear weapons, which is one of the great difficulties, frankly, if you look forward, one of the great difficulties of the world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not going to happen with them. And we'll see what happens.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> But we had, they think, four tankers, sir --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We are being very tough. Yes, we're being very tough on sanctions. When I came into office, they were a -- an absolute terror. They were all over the place. They were in Yemen. They were in Syria. We have 14 different sites of conflict. They were in charge of every single -- every single place. And they really are.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're a nation of terror. And they've changed a lot since I've been president, I can tell you. They were unstoppable and now they are in deep, deep trouble. They -- you can't -- you can't -- they don't have anything.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> But how do you stop this action? How do you stop these outrageous acts with 30 percent of the world's oil comes there?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we're going to see. We're going to see. We're going to see how to stop. I don't think they've talked the same way. When President Obama signed that agreement, they were screaming "death to America," "death to America."
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They were having a good time at his expense and he's given them 150 billion and he's given them 1.8 billion in cash, cash, nobody ever heard of a thing like that, and all of that money and they're screaming "death to America." They haven't screamed "death to America" lately. So we'll see what happens. But we don't take it lightly, that I can tell you.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> The Strait of Hormuz is a critical shipping lane. And we're watching it carefully. If they try to close that, is the United States obligated to try to keep it open?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they're not going to be closing it. It's not going to be -- if it closes, it's not going to be closed for long. And they know it. And they've been told in very strong terms. And we want to get them back to the table if they want to go back.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm ready when they are. But whenever they're ready, it's OK. In the meantime, I'm in no rush. I'm in no rush.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> I'll just give you a quote. They said, Iran's president -- because Abe is over there. He's a good friend of yours, Japan is friends with Iran. The Iranian president says you're not worthy of even a return message that he brought over about possible talks. What's your -- what's your reaction to that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm glad he likes me so much, but no reason why he should like me. Look, I came in. They were -- they had all the money. They had everything. They were doing just fantastically, threatening everybody. They were bombing the hell out of countries. They were killing people all over the Middle East. And now, all of a sudden, they're pulling back.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're pulling back from everywhere. They're pulling back out of Syria. They're pulling back out of Yemen. They're pulling back -- if you take a look at what's actually happening.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm not looking to hurt that country, but they can't have a nuclear weapon. It's very simple. And if you look at the Iran nuclear deal, how bad it was, we gave them all that money and in six to seven years, which, for a nation, is no time. That's like one second. In six to seven years, they would be able to legally start making nuclear weapons.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're not going to have it.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Mr. President, let's talk about -- early this week you granted ABC and George Stephanopoulos great access. You spent a couple of days with him. And one of the sound bites that they ran over the last 48 hours is essentially you'd say there -- there is nothing wrong, in your estimation, with accepting dirt from Russia or any foreign country.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> You've taken a lot of heat from the Democrats regarding that since then.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't…that. I think it was accurately stated and I've had a lot of support in this and --
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Well, then clarify it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. I mean I've had a lot of support. First of all, I don't think anybody would present me with anything bad because they know how much I love this country. Nobody's going to present me with anything bad. Number two, if I was -- and, of course, you have to look at it, because if you don't look at it you're not going to know if it's bad.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> How are you going to know if it's bad? But, of course, you give it to the FBI or report it to the attorney general or somebody like that. But, of course, you do that. You wouldn't -- you couldn't have that happen with our country. And everybody understands that. And I thought it was made clear. In fact, I actually said at the beginning, I think I said I'd do both.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But how are you going to -- if you don't hear what it is --
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're not going to know what it is.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean how can you report something that you don't know?
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> How do you know it's bad if you don't listen to it?
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> So, Mr. President, how --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, they say, oh, he would -- he would accept it. Well, if I don't listen, you're not going to know. Now, if I thought anything was incorrect or badly stated, I'd report it to attorney general, the FBI. I'd report it to law enforcement, absolutely.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> So -- so -- so if we're --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now, one thing that's --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> One thing that's different with the president, I had dinner with the queen. I had -- I met with the prime minister of the U.K. I was with the head of France. I was with the head of all these nations and I constantly am, constantly talking to them. And, you know, that puts us in a different -- we -- we have many, many conversations.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm just thinking, gee, if they say, we don't like your opponent, am I supposed to put -- you know, the president of France, am I supposed to report him to the FBI? You know, I'm in a little bit of a different position than a lot of other people.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> But -- but, Mr. President, I think that's a good point, but what if that person -- if -- if a leader leaned over and just said, listen, I -- x -- this candidate that you're running against, he did some dicey things in x, y, z country and I got some proof of it. What do you do in that scenario? Do you back off?
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Do you say, I don't need it? Do you say, show it to me?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Like I said, Brian, the president of the United States, no matter who it is, whether it's me or anybody else, is in a much different position because I hear things that, frankly, good, bad or indifferent that other people don't hear, just in normal conversation.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Right.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But nobody is going to say bad things to me. They know that I'm a very straight player. They know one thing about me, I love this country more than anything. I love this country. That's why I'm doing this.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I do -- and, by the way, I do love doing it. And the reason I love doing it, because we're doing a great job. You're doing -- there hasn't been a job like this. You look at China, you look at the way that's working out, you watch what happens.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> You've got a lot going on. No -- no doubt about it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look at what's happening at the border. Look at what's happening -- look at what's happening at the border of Mexico. A lot of good things are happening. Things that they've been trying to get approved, Brian, for 25 years. I got them done in one day. I put the tariffs on and we got them approved. And Mexico's been terrific.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, you know, it's really slowing down. But I watched Lindsey Graham, and he's right, we have to get help from Congress. The Democrats in Congress. So I'm not giving up hope. And we need help from Congress.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Right, they're really not. Going back to the -- the topic about the dirt. If you did call the FBI with dirt on a political opponent, though, Mr. President, wouldn't the Democrats accuse you of using the FBI to investigate political opponents?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, absolutely. Look, here's the bottom line. They spied on my campaign and they got caught, OK. They spied on my campaign and they got caught. Whether it's the insurance policy that just in case Hillary Clinton loses we have an insurance policy essentially saying to take him out, this is probably the worst or certainly one of the worst political scandals in the history of our country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they've hurt --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Well --
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> It's actually a double standard. It's such a double standard because they actually did it. If you trace that dirty dossier, it goes back to the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign. But, still, Nancy Pelosi's out there saying, you participated in criminal behavior or what you said was criminal. Listen to this.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> And, action.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> And here's Nancy Pelosi.
<Nancy Pelosi> <Negative> [Begin Video Clip] We are honoring our oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Yesterday, the president gave us once again evidence that he does not know right from wrong. It's a very sad thing. A very sad thing that he does not know right from wrong. I believe that he has been involved in a criminal cover-up. [End Video Clip]
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Mr. President, was there a criminal cover-up?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know what, I'll -- I'll go with what Mark Levin said, because nobody could say it better, it's a fascist statement, it's a disgraceful statement. I call her "nervous Nancy." She's a nervous wreck. And I'll tell you what, for her to make a statement like that is outrageous. Her party got caught spying.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean if you look at what happened, Hillary Clinton, with the money that ultimately went to Russia for the fake dossier, that total fake pile of stuff, that money gets paid -- and, by the way, the amount of money that was paid and was paid by Hillary Clinton and the DNC and it went to Russia, that's the criminal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And when you look at -- when you look at what happened in terms of the campaign, when you look at what happened in terms of the spying, she never mentions that. Isn't it amazing that constantly every day somebody gets a letter, come into Congress, come into Congress, because, you know, it's like death to a thousand wounds.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I will tell you, it's so unfair what they are doing. And I really think that people are wise to it. But when Nancy Pelosi makes a statement like that, she ought to be ashamed of herself. It's a disgrace.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> And she spent most of her time condemning you in her press conference. What else is new? Meanwhile --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, probably the big --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The big thing though is they spied on my campaign. That's probably one of the great criminal acts of all time. Now, let's see what happens. Let's see what happens.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> You know, Mr. President, it was kind of interesting, Andy McCabe -- Andy McCabe, who was all over this, was asked that question. They say, hey, didn't you get Christopher Steele to go get his sources in Russia to find out information on that? He -- this is what he said is the difference between the two events. Listen.
<Andrew McCabe> <Negative> [Begin Video Clip] There's no equivalence between those two examples. To say -- to openly invite foreign intelligence officers, representatives from a hostile foreign government to -- to steal information, to acquire opposition research in any way, in any illegal way that they might do that and to present it to you is one thing.
<Andrew McCabe> <Positive> To -- for a campaign to hire a law firm, an American law firm, who then turns around and hires an American research company, who then contracts out with a foreign individual, that is not illegal. [End Video Clip]
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> It sounds terrible, even the way he tried to minimize it, but what do you think about his moral equivalency?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Brian, Andy McCabe is a disaster. Andy McCabe, with what we have and with what he said and with the lies and the cover-ups and all of the leaking and all of the things and -- and the Strzok and the Page, who report, you know, Strzok and his lover Page, the FBI people that reported to Andy McCabe -- and, by the way, Andy McCabe reported to Comey -- with what they've done and with everything that we have and, of course, I can't go much further because I guess it's being looked at very, very seriously.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We'll see. But the bottom line is, they spied on a campaign of another candidate and another party. And this is one of the most serious things in the history of our country. There's never been anything like this. And they used the intelligence agencies to do it.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So this is big stuff. We'll see how it turns out. But when Nancy Pelosi makes a statement like that, she should be ashamed.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> All right.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> And, Mr. President, that's why over a year ago you tweeted out that -- that the Obama administration had wiretapped you in Trump Tower, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, now it's turning out that that's minimum. Look at what they've done with Page and with -- with all of these -- these people where, you know, the FISA -- we have to see what's going on with the whole FISA, but I -- I assume all of that's being looked at. I hope it's being looked at. And, you know, you're going to have a very interesting period of time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But why -- why isn't Congress, you know, oversight, why aren't they looking at the e-mails that were deleted from Hillary Clinton? Nobody can understand 33,000 e-mails request from Congress.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> James Comey cleared her.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> After they get the request -- because, you know, to me there's been a lot of criminality, in my opinion, but I -- I don't say it with -- I have to say subject checking it. But when you look at it -- here's something that to me is so simple, Congress requests the e-mails, OK. She deletes all of them. Everything deleted.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And she's -- this is after they get the request from the United States Congress. She deletes 33,000. Now, that's only 33,000. And what about the one with her friends almost mayor of New York, and thank God that didn't happen, OK. Thank God that didn't happen.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Anthony Weiner. Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So you have Anthony Weiner, who is -- got a lot of problems. But they used his laptop and all of the information that went through his laptop, I mean, they put people in jail for doing one slightly little confidential, which is a much lower level of confidential.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Gotcha.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it's -- it's -- there's been so much corruption and so -- and nobody ever looks at it.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Well, they are.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No one has.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> You -- you've got a U.S. attorney. You've got Michael Horowitz with this inspector general --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And now -- now I hope they are.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, again, I stay uninvolved. I -- maybe I shouldn't. Somebody else would say, oh, he's involved. I say, we have a great attorney general. He's doing a great job. They're putting him under tremendous pressure. They're doing things that they have never done before. They're playing a very rough game. But they never look at Hillary Clinton's e-mail deletions.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Gotcha.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a really -- it's a disgraceful thing that's going on. But, in the end, it's going to all work out. I will just leave it at this, it may be the single biggest political crime in the history of our country. They spied on the opposing party's campaign using the intelligence apparatus of the United States.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Never happened, a thing like that before.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> And -- and, Mr. President, for that -- you know, for you to make that statement, if that is true, you would think it would be a bigger story on all the channels and in all the papers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. Well, the fake news doesn't want it. Now, at some point, the fake news is going to be forced to do it, you know.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Things happen that are, you know, like the McCabes of the world, they act like these little innocent people. They're not innocent. These are very, very dangerous people.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Well, McCabe's on a criminal referral. I have no idea what he's doing. But, meanwhile, you had a big announcement yesterday, not only with the -- with the second -- with the criminal justice reform, but before that you introduced Sarah Sanders.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Yes, Sarah Sanders made the announcement last night that she was going to be stepping down at the end of the month. Any word on who you're going to put in that position?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I have a lot of people that want it. And there are a lot of great people. And it's the -- sometimes you have so many that it makes it more difficult. But we have some great -- but Sarah was fantastic and she is fantastic and she's going to have a tremendous future. She's been with me three and a half years, close to four years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And she has been a warrior in a sense. No, the news has been very, very -- you know, I -- I saw that you had a guest on before who talked about the unfairness of the media.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If -- if I were a Democrat liberal, I think I'd say I was the greatest president in history. You know, it's just one of those -- with all that I've done. Like, as an example, Right to Try, like tax reductions, the biggest ever, biggest in the history of the country, like regulation reduction, like straightening out the VA and getting the veterans choice and accountability.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right. Would you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, you couldn't fire anybody in the Veterans Administration if they were -- you know, terrible. For 50 years they've been trying to get it's called accountability. I got it passed. I got VA Choice passed. In other words, the veterans don't have to wait in line for six weeks trying to get a doctor.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> That's --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If they have to wait, they go outside, get a private doctor. All these things we got done. If I were the liberal Democrat, they'd be saying he's the greatest ever. But that's the way it goes. That's OK with me.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Still, we heard Stephanie Grisham, who works with the first lady, now is a contender. And what about Anthony Scaramucci. He said he wouldn't turn it down if you went back and tried to give him a 12th day.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I like Anthony, and he's been very nice and all but I think Anthony -- he should stay where he is right now.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> All right, bye.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's doing a -- he's --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Stephanie --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he's doing a good job and let's -- let's keep it that way for a little while. But -- but Anthony really is a good guy. Stephanie is terrific. We have a lot of --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have a lot of great people. We have a lot of people to choose from.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Well, one of the people on your staff that we're all curious what's going to happen with is yesterday the Office of the Special Counsel, and this is not the Mueller special counsel --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Recommended that you fire Kellyanne Conway because she has repeatedly violated the Hatch Act, where she has essentially -- the Hatch Act, let me explain for the folks, prohibits government employees from engaging in certain political activities while on the job. They say, the special counsel's office says, she disparaged Democratic presidential candidates during TV interviews and social media.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> She was a repeat offender. And now they're calling on you to fire her. So our question to you is, what are you going to do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I got briefed on it yesterday and it looks to me like they're trying to take away her right of free speech. And that's just not fair. They asked a question. If her -- I think one of them was involved with your show. But you ask them a question, or you ask a person a question and every time you're supposed to say, I can't answer, I can't answer.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean she's got to have a right of -- of responding to questions. She -- it really sounds to me like a free-speech thing. It doesn't sound fair. So I'm going to look at it very carefully.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> So you're not going to fire her? Mr. President, you're not going to fire her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I'm not going to fire her. I think she's a terrific person. She's a tremendous spokesperson. She's been loyal. She's been -- she's just a great person. I would certainly not think -- based on what I saw yesterday, how could you do that? They have tried to take away her speech. And I think you're entitled to free speech in this country.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Right. Yes, they just say, if you're going -- if you're working for the White House, you shouldn't be involved in criticizing other candidates or other politicians, and she has. Will you encourage her not to do that going forward?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, but it doesn't work that way because let's say that I think Biden was one of the people that she was accused of criticizing, but he criticized me and we then criticized him --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Or she criticized him. And it's not -- it's -- she's making a point. She's trying to make a point. And how could you do this? Basically you'd have to take a person off. A person wouldn't be able to express themselves. And I just don't see it. Now, I'm going to get a very strong briefing on it and I'll see, but it seems to me to be very unfair.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's called freedom of speech.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right. So --
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Let's talk about immigration. There's a crisis, obviously, at the border. What deals are on the table? What's the status of the wall?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So the wall is going up. It's going up rapidly. We're going to have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year. The wall is very important. It's hard to breach it. It's high. It's strong. It's powerful. And it's going up at a much lower cost than the wall that was planned prior to me getting there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a much better wall, too. We have -- you have to see what they build. It's a disgrace. And we're actually fixing it and in some cases we have to take down fairly new wall because it was so bad. But we're going to have over 400 miles of wall built. And that's going to be in the most important areas. And we're going to have all of it built before you know.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But this is despite tremendous --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Headwinds.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Obstacles that have been put in front of me by the Democrats.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> So --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have no idea.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Mr. President, you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we just won the lawsuit on the wall. We won a big lawsuit on the wall. Brought by Nancy Pelosi. This one was brought by Nancy Pelosi. And maybe that's criminal that she's allowing drug dealers and gang members into our country. Maybe that's criminal when you talk about it because what's happening on the border is -- we're getting it straightened out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a tough -- you know how easy it would be to solve it. If we met for 15 minutes with the Democrats --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Well --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You could solve the asylum problem and the loopholes in 15 minutes, and they know it.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> So -- so Lindsey -- you mentioned you saw Lindsey Graham downstairs. We just talked to him. So he had a conference yesterday. You know his plan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> You've said you backed his plan to make those changes that you just talked about --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> About the Flores Amendment, stopping kids with minors for only being held for 20 days.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> It's very simple. And it turns out afterwards, on camera and off, Dick Durbin showed indications that he wants to deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Would you bring them back because you can't do it without Democrats. If he understands that the Border Patrol is drowning, like they are, and it's not even up for debate whether it's a crisis, would you bring them back and try to get something done?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Of course I would. I want to get something done. They know I want to get something done but they think it's good politics not to do anything. And I think it's bad politics from their side.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Oh, it's terrible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's good politics from our side. I think by them not doing it, it's good for us, but I don't want good for us, I want good for the country.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And, frankly --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> But would you -- would you bring them back and do your negotiating? That's one of your -- one of your great strengths?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You bet I would.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure I would. I -- I'd negotiate with them gladly. The problem we have is we have an election coming up and they think open borders and crime and drugs and everything else are good. I mean, if you look at it, open borders mean crime. It just means crime. It means anybody can pour into the country. Now, I have to say, with all of this being said, the deal that I made with Mexico, they put 6,000 soldiers, paid for by them, they paid -- put 6,000 soldiers at their southern border.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The stoppage is unbelievable. And I got reports yesterday, it's like day and night. Now, with all of that being said, we still want to get -- and we -- it's -- it's really incredible what's happened and all because of the tariffs and because of relationships. But, again, for 25 years they've been trying to make a deal with Mexico.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They've never been able to do a deal like I did.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I did it in two days because I was serious about -- we were putting major tariffs on Mexico that following Monday. And we did it. On Sunday it was finished and we have everything.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, with all of that being said, we still need to fix asylum and we have to fix things from our country.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I said the other day, Mexico's doing more for us on the border than the Democrats in Congress.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Well, it would be nice to change the laws to make the jobs easier for our men and women on our southern border. But, Mr. President, isn't the incentive for Mexico to really crack down -- and you say they're cracking down right now -- is because --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are cracking down.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> The way -- part of the -- the negotiations that took place and were agreed to a week ago were that if it doesn't -- if Mexico cannot stop the flow of migrants toward the United States, then, you know, your -- your plan b is going to kick in, and that would involve a safe third country situation. And Mexico doesn't want that.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> So they're going to pull out all the stops because they don't want that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's exactly right. I mean it's exactly right. That's what's going to happen. And they've -- they've got 45 days. They're doing really well. They're doing, frankly, better than projected. They have 6,000 soldiers. I know "The Times" wrote a phony story. You look at that "New York Times." It's a disgrace to our nation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Times wrote a phony story that I had the deal done two months ago and I could have announced it. I didn't have the deal done. I could have never gotten a deal done. Until I used tariffs, there was no way to get a deal. Mexico's been talking about that deal for 20 years. And longer.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right. OK --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But they --
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They wouldn't do a deal. And it was only recently that I said, look, on Monday we had it and on Monday either we do it or our country is going to collect hundreds of -- billions of dollars, by the way, hundreds of billions of dollars. All of the car companies -- you know, long before I got here, we lost 32 percent of our car industry, our automobile manufacturing business, to Mexico.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're made in Mexico. And tremendous amounts of money are made by Mexico on cars and everything else at the border. And I said, look, we're going to tax all of your product coming into the United States or you're going to help us with this horrible situation. The reason that people are coming, by the way, is because our country is doing so well, our unemployment numbers are the lowest they've ever been in many categories, ever been historically.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you take the worst number, it's the lowest in 51 years.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So our numbers are so good, our economy is so strong and doing so good that people are pouring up to our country. But you have to come in legally and you have to come in through a merit. That's the way we have it.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> It's -- it's definitely a big issue and it's going to be an issue on the debate stage. The 2020 debate stage is now set. There are 24 candidates that want your job that are going to be running against you -- or one's going to be running against you, but they're trying to get that -- that nomination. And there were 20 that were selected.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> They were able to participate in the first debate. There are going to be two different debates and they're drawing names to see who's going to participate. Joe Biden has been out there. He's been in Iowa. He mentioned your name 75 times. It looks like this is a glimpse of what's yes -- yet to come in 2020 if the polls are correct and if he is going to get the nomination.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, everybody knows that Joe Biden does not have what it takes. OK, he doesn't have what it takes. Everybody knows that. You watch him --
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> What does that -- what does that mean?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you -- it means mental capacity. It means a lot of different things. He doesn't have -- never did have what it takes. Until Obama took -- he ran two or three times. I used to call him 1 percent Joe because he never got more than 1 percent. Then Obama came along and surprisingly he took him off of -- I say the trash heap -- and ran.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But everybody knows Joe is -- is -- doesn't have it. Now I see that Pocahontas is doing better. I would love to run against her, frankly. I see that Bernie Sanders is not doing well at all. I would have, frankly, liked to have run against -- I think it's probably those three. I don't see the other ones -- I really don't see it. They talk about Kamala.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't see Kamala. I don't see -- I think it's probably between the three of them.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> Mayor Pete?
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Mayor Pete, I don't see at all. I think that's a joke, Mayor Pete.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Mr. President, they say, like Ronald Reagan at this point, and like Bush 43 at this point, you're trailing in a lot of these battleground states. As you gear up for re-election --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's incorrect polling. Yes, it's incorrect.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> What do you -- it wouldn't be -- it wouldn't be unprecedented for in -- for a sitting president, running for re-election, to be trailing. Having said that, what -- if at the very least it's close, what's going to be the difference as you formally announce on the 20th?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the polls I see, we're doing great in Pennsylvania. We're doing really good in North Carolina. Florida, I'm winning by a lot. Ohio, I'm winning by a lot. I just left Iowa. We're winning that by a lot. And every poll that I see and every poll that we have, I'm winning by -- we're doing well. I think we're going to do very well in Michigan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Traditionally it's Democrat, but I won it last time because I have ten car companies building plants in Michigan and bringing back the automobile business to Michigan.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I think we're going to do well there. I was up in Wisconsin recently. I think we're going to do very well there. You know, I think -- I think we're going to do great.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Mr. --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, look, we're going to have a competitive race. It's always -- it's always tougher for the Republican because, you know, I don't know, people -- people never cover this, but the Electoral College is very much steered to the Democrats. It's a big advantage for the Democrats. It's very much harder for the Republicans to win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think we're going to do very well. I think we're going to have a great election because of what we've done and what we've accomplished.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> And you have detailed some of those accomplishments during our 32 minutes with you. Mr. President, Barack Obama said he's not going to endorse Joe Biden at this point. If Mike Pence runs for president in 2024, does he have your automatic endorsement?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's far to -- look, I love Mike. We're running again. But, you know, you're talking about a long time. So you can't put me in that position. But I --I certainly would give it very strong consideration.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a very, very outstanding person.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right. Just to back --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we're going to be announcing on Tuesday, we have a tremendous -- we're announcing in Orlando on Tuesday and we have over 100,000 people trying to get seats. One of the problems I think Biden has, he can't get crowds. I mean he -- nobody goes.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He can't get 100 people.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Well, he's flip-flopping. He flip-flopped on --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have 100,000 -- we have 106,000 people applying for 22,000 seats in Orlando, Florida. So, I don't know. I -- you know, you can't -- if you can't --
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> So what -- what did you make of him flip-flopping? He flip-flopped on the Hyde Amendment. He flip-flopped on China.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he -- he flip-flopped.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> And then you heard what he said about Amazon.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right. Yes, no, he flip-flops, there's no question about that. And --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's got -- whether it's the Hyde Amendment, so many different things, he's flip-flopping. And I'm not sure that that's a good thing for him to be doing. Maybe he knows. Look, the Democrats have become a radical left party and he probably figures he can't win, but I'm not sure he's even thinking about it. I think he has other people doing his thinking --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because he's having a hard time thinking lately.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> So, Mr. -- Mr. President, right now you have so many open positions. You have 125 formally nominated people for positions and waiting for confirmation. You have 131 positions with no nominee at all, so that's on you guys to put somebody forward. And, overall, we're still wondering about the acting director of secretary -- the acting secretary of -- secretary of a -- of Shanahan.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> We don't know if he's going to get the job or -- or McAleenan. Do you like those two and what about these other positions?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, let me just tell you about the positions. First of all, you don't need all these positions. It's government. You have so many positions. Many you don't need. But, more importantly, Schumer and the Democrats are holding people up for a year and a half and two years. We have ambassadors that are phenomenal people, phenomenal, absolutely and you can't get them through because of the system, because Schumer won't approve people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it's taking us long -- we have 200 people waiting in line to be approved and you can't get them. And we have focused, Mitch McConnell, myself and the Republicans have focused on judges because judges are a primary focus. We're running government great. We don't need all the people they want to give us.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have seats that I say don't even put them in. You don't need them. As I say, save the money for the taxpayer. But we do have people that have been waiting for -- ambassadors in particular waiting for a period of over two years because Schumer won't do it. Now, what we have focused on, frankly, is judges.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We just have the 107th federal judge, two Supreme Court judges, and I'm going to have 145 federal judges, it's going to soon be setting records because when I took over, for some reason, President -- and it hasn't been covered -- but President Obama --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Have to move…
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know why, but he gave me 138 judges empty when I took over. It's never happened before. No president's ever taken over with --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He didn't get the job done. Obama didn't get the job done.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Well, and what we just -- just -- just to follow up on Secretary Shanahan, is he going to get the nomination, Secretary Shanahan? And are you going to put McAleenan --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He got the nomination. Well, no, no, he's gotten -- look, he's -- he's been recommended. Now he has to be approved by Congress. So we're going to see. We're going to see. Pat Shanahan has been recommended for the job. McAleenan, he is doing a very nice job. We're going to see. I've got to get used to him because it's a very important thing to me, the border.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We need strong people at the border. And if people aren't strong, they're not going to do a good job.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> So not yet.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's very simple.
<Larry O'Connor> <Positive> It's now a distinct honor and privilege to welcome to The Larry O'Connor Show, the 45th president, President Donald Trump. Thank you for joining us, sir.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Not yet on McAleenan?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, no, I haven't -- I haven't put in the final recommendation. He's acting. I put him as acting. And he's working very hard. And we have some great people, as you know, we have some fantastic people that just went in, Mark Morgan and --
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we're going to have, I will tell you, Tom Homan, who's a great man, who's been on your show many times. We have a lot of people
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> What is he doing? What is Tom Homan doing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ah, we have Ken Cuccinelli. Ken Cuccinelli just took over. He's fantastic. He's tough as you get and smart and he's doing much of the legal work and --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you very much, Larry. And I greatly appreciate the nice things you've said. I very much appreciate it. Thank you.
<Larry O'Connor> <Positive> I'm glad it got back to you. You know...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It does. It get better. You have a big voice, I will say that.
<Larry O'Connor> <Positive> I know that today you're very excited about the launch of the Opportunity Zones, the big event that you've got. You can show some real progress here. But I want to take you back to that day in Detroit, when you were running for president, and you said to mostly African-American crowd in a church there, "What have you got to lose?" What -- how have the Democrats been treating up until now?
<Larry O'Connor> <Positive> How does the Opportunity Zone initiative fit into that campaign pledge?
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we're -- we're -- we're putting in some great, strong but fair and good people.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> But you're bringing Tom Homan back?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Tom Homan's coming back. Yes, Tom Homan's coming back.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> What will his role be?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we're getting wealthy people to go in and companies to go in and spend a lot of money on developing areas of this country that a lot of people have and they've really forgotten about. We talked about the forgotten men and women. These are areas that have been forgotten about by governments, both Republican and Democrat.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we got together with a great group of people including Tim Scott, who's been very active from South Carolina, a senator, a great guy, and came up with a plan for Opportunity Zones and a tremendous idea. The impact that we're having in such a short period of time is amazing wages are up by 8% in those areas.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Values are going way up for the people that have houses and so many things are happening but most importantly it's jobs. We've created a tremendous number of jobs, and we're healing parts of cities and usually cities but cities and other areas that have been just decimated for many, many years.
<Larry O'Connor> <Positive> Mr. President, when you when you talk about these kind of investments that have been made before this administration and past administrations, whenever they use the term investments it always was a euphemism for federal tax dollars being spent from Washington. These investments are very different aren't they?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> These are private dollars that are going in and the people are doing it right and there's better leadership that way. And you know they have something to gain and they want to make sure that the property is being built properly on time, on budget. And just so much work is being done and so many jobs are being created.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say that would be announced next week except I'd rather announce it now. So Tom Homan's coming back and he's very much --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> To do what?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's going to be very much involved in the border, that's what he wants to be involved with. And, again, a big difference in the border between now and this time last week. Mexico has been doing a -- a terrific job. Hey, 6,000 soldiers.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if it doesn't work out, then we go back to very strong measures. And I don't want to have to do that.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> And you go to -- you go to plan b.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> We'll have to go to plan b as well because Tom Homan is currently a Fox News contributor.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, where we have the best job numbers that we've had in the country and fifth in over I guess 51 years and African-American and you've heard me say this in speeches African-American unemployment is the lowest it's ever been in history. Hispanic employment and unemployment is the lowest it's ever been in history and you take women, you take Asian, you take any group.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's better than just about ever before it's been an incredible thing.
<Larry O'Connor> <Negative> You know that 2017 tax cut was -- before it even was passed, people were deriding it saying it was crumbs. I think Speaker Pelosi said -- now Speaker Pelosi said whatever tax cuts would go to the wealthy. How important is it that these opportunity zones, these initiatives were baked in to the cake of that tax cut so that those tax cuts actually go right to the people who need it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right. One of the big things in the tax cuts and the money is not only that the extra money that people have they're going home with thousands of dollars more money than they would have had before the tax cuts.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Yes, we had him on the show tomorrow.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, well, I'm sorry. He'll have to re -- he'll have to get back .
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> So what's the -- what's the job going to be again? What's the job going to be?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he'll be a border czar. He'll be very much involved in the border. He'll be reporting directly to me. He'll be probably working out of the White House but spending a lot of time at the border. And he's a good man. He's a good man. Done a good job.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Mr. -- somebody who did a good job for you for a number -- for a period of time was Admiral Ronny Johnson -- Jackson, rather. He was your former doctor.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> You nominated him for promotion to a two star admiral in January and then you --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Larry O'Connor> <Positive> You've been reading the New York Times this week, who finally figured that out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They finally, it took them a long time but it's had a big impact, tremendous impact on why we're doing so well as a country. Our GDP is at 3%. We haven't hit that number in 15 years. We are doing great. I mean, all over the world we're the envy with the hottest country in the world economically.
<Larry O'Connor> <Negative> Can I ask you we've been covering as you know the Spygate story and all the things that happened during the 2016 campaign and there are a couple of concerns. I know that you've been talking about it quite a bit in terms of saying this should never happen again and it's not just about a presidential candidate but American citizens here.
<Larry O'Connor> <Negative> What are we doing? What's happening right now to ensure that it doesn't happen again?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I appreciate that question because this should never happen to a president or to this country again, what took place. And you'll see a lot of very strong things come out tomorrow. Attorney General Barr is going to be giving a press conference, maybe I'll do one after that, we'll see. But he's done -- he's been a fantastic attorney general he's grabbed it by the horn.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What's happened, you've been watching yourself. I mean, what's happened is unthinkable with Struck and Paige, and Comey, and McCabe and all of these characters, and Brennan and Clapper, and you know, you look at what Comey did as the director of the FBI, it's a disgrace, it's a disgrace to our country. And I think that I'm going to maybe -- I hope I'm going to be able to put this down as one of my great achievements actually.
<Larry O'Connor> <Positive> I've got to. As you know mentioned all of those people in the apparatus of the Justice Department the intelligence community and you've been president for over two years now. You know how things operate. You know how the chain of command works. Is there any doubt in your mind that President Obama at least had knowledge of everything that was going on?
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Because the last Congress did not act. And it looks like he's being held up in Congress as well. What's going to happen to him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Ronny is not -- I did, I nominated him for VA. And it was sort of very sad, actually. Great reputation. He was President Obama and President Bush's doctor. He was my doctor. An excellent guy. An admiral and a doctor. And I said to him, how would you like to run the VA? And he said, sir -- he didn't want the job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He said, sir, I'll do whatever you'd like to do. So I threw his name out. Didn't really put him out. I threw it -- and the Democrats just absolutely went after him and were so unfair what they did to him. I said, welcome to the world of politics. Welcome to the world of living in Washington. And they went after him so viciously.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, ultimately, we put a man there who has done a fantastic job, been approved. He's been great. We, you know, again, we've got VA Choice, we've got VA Accountability approved. And it was quite a while ago with Ronny. No, but Ronny's doing very well right now, Ronny Jackson is doing very well. But he's not -- he's not going to the VA.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd rather save that for another interview with you and I, and I will do that. But it's --
<Larry O'Connor> <Positive> Do you promise that it's me that you say that...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because it is such a big statement to make but there are those that say how is it possible, and I would -- how is it possible that he didn't know. And I guess you have to put yourself in that category. And I can put myself in that category. I mean, we're talking about pervasive horrible things that were happening and it would certainly be hard to believe that he didn't know what was going on but we're going to leave that for another day.
<Larry O'Connor> <Positive> Understood. Last time we spoke, by the way. You got a lot of attention that I asked you if you're going to go to any other restaurants around town other than Trump Tower. I'm gonna ask you one more I know you're a football fan. You're gonna go to a Redskins game at all? It's pretty fun out at FedEx.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I will and actually the owner is a he's really a good guy. He's he's been a supporter and he's -- he's done a very good job. You have a good team you got to make sure that quarterback is gonna be healthy. It's really it's a game of quarterback. You -- you see these teams that all of a sudden when they hit goal they get the right quarterback, and be nice to pick a Tom Brady in the sixth round but it doesn't happen, that would never happen that way before but you -- the Redskins have a very good team.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> No, I think -- no. I -- you re-nominated him to become a two-star admiral in January and Congress has not picked that up. So let's see what happens.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we're going to take a look. It was very sad what happened. His son just graduated from Annapolis at -- with very high in his class. He's an outstanding person. I feel very guilty having thrown his name into a ring. If I threw you guys -- if I asked one of you to -- you know, maybe Ainsley would do it. I think maybe I'd be better off with -- Ainsley, she'd go by sail -- she'd go by swimmingly, OK --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But, I would --
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> I was --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They -- they need the solidity of the quarterback. I mean unfortunately I think they had a really good quarterback who got hurt.
<Larry O'Connor> <Negative> It was devastating, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Devastating. And I'll -- I'll ask you, is he coming back? He's...
<Larry O'Connor> <Negative> Not this season.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was that bad of an injury. You know it's funny because he went through many seasons of football. I think he's a really underrated quarterback. It's like they always sort of had somebody standing behind him.
<Larry O'Connor> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we'll take -- hey, Steve, let's take Brian and ask him to serve in any capacity, and watch what happens to Brian. Brian, you wouldn't be happy for a little while.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Oh, believe me, I'm not -- I don't love Googling my name now. It will probably get a lot worse.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Hey, Mr. President, we got a chance to sit down with Alice Johnson when you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> When you released her from prison, her life sentence, or a non-violent crime. Kim Kardashian was very involved in that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he had take San Francisco, he'd take wherever he were, he'd do really well. And then they always sort of had a backup that took over. I think he's a very underrated guy. It's really too bad that he's not coming back because I think he's a very good quarterback.
<Larry O'Connor> <Positive> President Trump, always great to speak with you, sir. We've got to cover a lot of things, and we're looking forward to seeing at the Redskins game.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well thank you very much. I look forward and we'll go together.
<Larry O'Connor> <Positive> It's The Larry O'Connor Show.
<Unidentified Speaker> <Positive> Yes it is. And by -- you got...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Jared Kushner was involved in that. I know Ivanka now is involved in prison reform.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Tell us – tell us what – because it’s a bipartisan issue. It’s something that democrats and republicans are praising you for. Yesterday, Kim Kardashian was back at the White House. What were the talks with her and what does criminal justice reform look like going forward?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the whole criminal justice reform’s been amazing because it’s been very, very conservative and very, very liberal. Everybody got together. It was unbelievable bipartisan. Nobody could get it done. They all said it was impossible. People like Senator Grassley and Senator Mike Lee, you know, very conservative people and very liberal people, everybody wanted to see that they could get something done and yet nobody got it done, for again, many, many years they didn’t get it done.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This – they had a crime bill put in by President Clinton which turned out to be a disaster for – especially for certain communities, and they were very angry about it. Very, very angry. She had a lot of problems last time with it when she ran, frankly. And it’s been incredible what we’ve been able to do, and you’re right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Kim has been wonderful, and Alice Johnson. So she was in for 22 years, a lovely woman. She spent 22 years in jail and she had another 20 years left, and nothing’s minor and there’s nobody tougher than me. I want strong sentences especially for drug dealers and all of this, but she was caught up in something that was today they – it would be – unfortunately it would be a slap on the wrist.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She knows she did wrong, but she was in for 22 years and she had another 20 to serve, and it was so unfair. We let her out and a really beautiful scene. And I saw you cover it, Ainsley. It was so beautiful the piece you did.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> She’s a wonderful person. She did bible studies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She came out of prison –
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> You know what she told me, Mr. President, that about one-third of the people she knew in prison were in there for long sentences and they shouldn’t be because she learned –
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know. I know.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> – their character, she learned who they were.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know. There are many Alice Johnsons right now in prison and we’re seeking them out. We’re seeking them out.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Well, thank you for doing that for her.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When she came out of prison and her family grabbed her – her family grabbed her and they –
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> I know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> – started hugging and kissing and crying and everything else, I mean, that was a beautiful moment. That was really an unfair situation. So criminal justice reform, the Trump administration got approved. It’s like right to try and the VA choice. All these things we’re getting approved. Now, nobody writes about them, OK, because they don’t want to write about them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Somebody said, “oh, this is going to be great.” You know, The Times barely covered it and yet if I were a liberal democrat and I did criminal justice reform, it would be the biggest story in the history of The New York Times, OK?
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Yes, but – yes, but the bottom line is you made and impact and made a difference. And lastly, your next big hurdle – and there’ll probably be a bunch in between – is the G20 where you’re going to sit down.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> The world will be watching we hope with President Xi who just –
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> – called Vladimir Putin his best friend as they formed this new alliance. You say you get along with him. You know a lot’s on the line. He has not committed to show up yet. Where does that stand? What if he doesn’t?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It doesn’t matter. If he shows up, good. If he doesn’t, in the meantime we’re taking in billions of dollars a month, Brian, from China. And by the way, they subsidize their industry, so our people are not paying. You know, there’s this big thing about tariffs. Oh, our people pay. It’s a lot of nonsense. You what happens really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They – companies move back. For instance, if I put tariffs on Mexico, 20, 25 percent, started it with 5. We never even got there because we made a deal.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But if I put tariffs on, as an example, Mexico, you know what would happen? 25 percent. All the car companies would move back to the United States because they don’t want to pay the 25 percent, OK? Our people aren’t going to pay for anything because in a short period of time all of that 32 percent that I told you about – we lost 32 percent of our car industry stupidly over the last 20 years because of NAFTA, which is a terrible deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Which by the USMCA, the new deal with Mexico and Canada, I hope that Nancy Pelosi approves it because it’s a phenomenal deal for our country – hundreds of billions of dollars and jobs and everything else, so I hope they get it approved. I hope that doesn’t get caught up into politics. Everybody wants it –
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> But not that there are any –
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> But how would there- how would there be another round of talks? The world waits to see if you guys either are going to break up or you’re going to do a deal?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we’re going to see. Eventually they’re going to make a deal because they’re going to have to. Look, they’re paying hundreds of billions of dollars. I have 25 percent on $250 billion, and they subsidize it, Brian.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> No, I hear you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They’re manipulating their currency in order to pay for it. They’re manipulating their currency lower. Eventually that’s going to hurt them very badly. And they’re also giving money to these companies, but what’s happening is hundreds and even thousands of companies are now moving out of China so they don’t have to pay the tariffs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, eventually – you know, we had a deal with China and then they tried to negotiate the deal at the end, and I said, “sorry, we’re going to put tariffs on you. We’re not going to do it.” We had a – we had a great deal with China, and at the very end they came to us and they said, “no, we want to take off three points.” And I said, “you’re not going to take off.” And they were big points.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said, “we’re not going to take off anything.” I believe they have to make the deal, but we’re going to see. You know, we’ve gone up in value $14 trillion or $15 trillion. They’ve gone probably $20 trillion. When I took over, they were going to, you know, really catch us on the economy. They were going to catch us very soon.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now they are so far behind you wouldn’t believe it. So we’ve gone up a lot. The stock market’s up almost 50 percent since the election, and this is putting on tariffs, this is with a Fed that’s been –
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> – the interest rate’s too high, you know, and frankly it’s – he made a mistake and he –
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Well Mr. President –
<Donald Trump> <Negative> – and the interest rates are too high, so we’re doing well. We’re doing well.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> I know it’s your birthday and you got a country to run, but lastly on North Korea, do you know if they’ve killed the negotiation team that failed to do a deal with you? Have they killed them because that’s congressman –
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I know they didn’t kill the top person because I saw a picture of him in the paper. I don’t know whether or not they did. They said he was unhappy with the result of the meeting, but that’s because I’m going to draw – you know, I’m – I want to have a deal. I could have made a deal there very easily, but I want to make a deal that means something.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I could have walked out with a deal with North Korea, and I have a very good relationship. And just remember this, though, Brian. I’m in no rush. They’re not testing nuclear. They’re not testing anything. They sent some short-range –
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> – missiles out that everybody else does, too. They’re not testing –
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> They’re breaking the sanctions, though. They’re braking the sanctions and doing those oil transfers at sea. You’ve already taken one vote –
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Brian, everybody tries to – I know, but everybody tries to break sanctions, but the sanctions are hurting them badly. We never took the sanctions off. We have a good relationship. We’ll see what happens, Brian, but when I took over, there were nuclear tests, there were missiles going up, they were being sent – remember Guam and remember Japan, right over the middle of Japan and off – you don’t see that now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You don’t see it now. We’re in a much different position and we do have a relationship, so that’s important. I’m in no rush. We’ll take it nice and easy. You know, the papers couldn’t believe when we had the first meeting. They couldn’t believe when we had the second. You know, we’d never had meetings. We’re going to end up in war.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I wasn’t president, you would right now be in a major war with North Korea, I can tell you that. You would right now be in a major war and I don’t see that happening. It could happen, but I don’t see it happening.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Hey, Mr. President. I saw a clip earlier this morning. Are you sure you want to do a new paint job no Air Force One? It’s been so iconic for so long.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know, but you know what? It’s been a long time and it fits the plane better. You know, it’s a very different plane even though it’s a 747, and I like the concept of red, white, and blue and the classic, and I think it’s going to look much better actually. You know, the baby blue doesn’t fit with us. And people get used to something, but – and it was Jackie O., and that’s good, but we have our own Jackie O. today.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It’s called. Melania – Melania. We’ll call it Melania T. OK. Thank you.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> And she’s doing – and she is doing a great job and does not get a enough credit.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And by the way, people love her. People love her.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Yes. Perfect –
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She gets no credit from the media, but she gets credit from the people. When I go and speak in front of these big crowds – we have tremendous crowds – and so many people are holding up banners, you know, we love our first lady. A lot of them say for whatever they say, we love stilettos and, you know, the high heels.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Times News said she walked in high heels to a... No, she likes to look elegant in the White House –
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> – but she had the sneakers – she’s carrying sneakers for when we get off. But you know, the people really do the job the first lady’s done.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> No question she has –
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> And were you amazed how you connected with the queen?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I had such a great relationship and we were laughing and having fun. Her people told me she hasn’t had so much fun in 25 years. Now, then I got criticized for it because they said we were having too much fun. It doesn’t matter, but we have a great relationship and I had a great relationship with Charles, and honestly I have a very good relationship with a lot of the foreign leaders.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think – I think what we’re doing – you know, we were taken advantage of by many, many countries. If you look at the NATO countries, $100 billion now they’ve agreed to pay. We’re paying nothing. $100 billion meaning of the interest. They’re going to pay $100 billion more toward NATO, toward protection. We were paying for NATO.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, I said, “folks, we’re protecting you. You’ve got to step up. You’ve got to pay,” and they’ve agreed to pay. And if you take a look at the last 15 years, it was terrible what was happening. Nobody was – some of them were totally delinquent as we used to say. They were totally delinquent. Hey, look, we've done a good job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we've done a very good job. Foreign relations wise. But we do have some situations. We have Iran. North Korea continues. But I'm telling you, if I weren't president, you would be in a major war right now with North Korea.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Well, we appreciate you going over to Normandy. The D-Day celebration was just beautiful to honor our troops.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Today is Flag Day. It's the birthday for the Army. It is your birthday today. And you are painting Air Force One red, white and blue. Thank you so much for joining us, Mr. President. Happy birthday.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Thank you.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Appreciate it. Thanks so much.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> All right, we thought that interview might go 10 minutes. It went 50 minutes and 20 seconds. So --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Right.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> We appreciate the president taking time out to explain all of that stuff to all of you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How is the business of the news? We're keeping you busy?
<Question> <Positive> Yes, sir, you are.
<Question> <Positive> Thank you for doing this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What are you going to do in 6 1/2 years with a normal boring person here?
<Question> <Positive> It has certainly been a busy two years.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's going to be different, going to be different.
<Question> <Negative> We're hoping to cover a lot of topics today, but before we get started on some other things, we want to talk news of the day first. Obviously, the Saudis and the missing writer. AP is reporting that police searching the consulate found evidence that Jamal Khashoggi was killed there. What did the crown prince tell you today, exactly, and what is your intelligence telling you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I just put this out, I guess you saw it. I just have it here. I spoke to the crown prince, so you have that. He said he and his father knew nothing about it. And that was very important. And I spoke to him with Mike Pompeo there. And the crown prince. I spoke to the king yesterday, the crown prince, today wanting to know what was going on, what was happening, and he said very strongly that he and his father knew nothing about it but they are starting a major, they've already started a major investigation to find out.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And so the answers will be forthcoming.
<Question> <Negative> Did they raise this idea of rogue killers in any of those conversations?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the concept of it, I guess. Yesterday, when I spoke with the father, not so much today, but when I spoke to the father, it just sounded to me like he felt like he did not do it. He did not know about it and it sounded like, you know, the concept of rogue killers. But I don't know. I think the investigation will lead to an answer.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they're going to do a very thorough investigation. I believe they're working with Turkey.
<Question> <Negative> But he didn't bring up that? That was something you came up with after the conversation?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Just the concept of it. No, that was just from my feeling of the conversation with the king, not with the crown prince but with the king.
<Question> <Positive> Do you believe, sir, do you believe the king and the crown prince? I mean do you find them... do you find them sort of trustworthy here? And there's been a lot of talk, including from Sen. Graham, who I know is an ally of yours in many ways, that this is the moment that perhaps the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia should be re-evaluated, that things should be done differently going forward. What do you think of that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think we have to find out what happened first. You know, here we go again with, you know, you're guilty until proven innocent. I don't like that. We just went through that with Justice Kavanaugh. And he was innocent all the way. So I was unconcerned. So we have to find out what happened and they are doing a very major investigation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So is Turkey. Plus, they're putting themselves together and doing it. And hopefully they'll get to an answer as to what happened. But I will say they were very strong in their denial about themselves knowing.
<Question> <Neutral> Did they give you any sense of the timetable?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say within a week. That's my impression. He said two weeks. But they're going to try and do it in less than a week.
<Question> <Negative> So moving to the midterms, you're hitting the road for Republicans, obviously.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A little bit.
<Question> <Negative> And the White House political office has said, and you have said, that Republicans face headwinds this fall, it's a tough year for Republicans historically. If Republicans were to lose control of the House...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a tough year... The midterms are very tough for anybody the opposite of president, for whatever reason, nobody has been able to say.
<Question> <Negative> So my question is, if Republicans were to lose control of the House on November 6th — or a couple of days later depending on how long it takes to count the votes — do you believe you bear some responsibility for that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I think I'm helping people. Look, I'm 48 and 1 in the primaries, and actually it's much higher than that because I endorsed a lot of people that were successful that people don't even talk about. But many of those 48, as you know, were people that had no chance, in some cases. We look at Florida, you look at Donovan in Staten Island.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was losing by 10 points, I endorsed him and he won. I could give you a long list of names. Look at Georgia governor of Georgia. And many, many races. And I will say that we have a very big impact. I don't believe anybody's ever had this kind of an impact. They would say that in the old days that if you got the support of a president or if you've got the support of somebody it would be nice to have, but it meant nothing, zero.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Like literally zero. Some of the people I've endorsed have gone up 40 and 50 points just on the endorsement.
<Question> <Neutral> Eight years ago, Barack Obama said he got shellacked, so you know, taking the outcome of the election as a referendum on himself.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I think we're going to do well. Look, it feels to me very much like "16. I was going out and making speeches and I was getting tens of thousands of people. And I was getting literally tens of thousands of people, also, more than Hillary in the same location. And I said, "Why am I going to lose?" I mean, I go out, I make a speech like I have, you know, 25 times more people than she gets.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I didn't need Beyonce to get them. I didn't have to have, you know, entertainment and entertainers to get them. And then they'd all leave before she made the speech after the entertainer was finished. Honestly, it feels very much like it did in "16.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, I'm not sure that that's right. And I'm not running. I mean, there are many people that have said to me, "Sir, I will never ever," you on the trail when I'm talking to people backstage etcetera, "I will never ever go and vote in the midterms because you're not running and I don't think you like Congress." Well, I do like Congress because I think, and when I say Congress I like the Republicans that support me in Congress.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We've had tremendous support. I mean, we've got the taxes with 100 percent Republican votes and we don't really have much of a majority. You know when you say majority, I always say, "If somebody has a cold, we have to delay the vote." So I get along, you know, very... people have no idea how low how well I get along with Republicans in Congress.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I get along well with a lot of the Democrats in Congress, but I'll never get their vote.
<Question> <Negative> You just mentioned Justice Kavanaugh. And I know, we've all been to your rallies, and you've suggested that fight was as hard as...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will say, that fight because he was treated so viciously and violently by the Democrats. That fight has had an impact on energy, and it's had an impact on the Republican Party, a very positive one in terms of getting out and voting. I think, but I'll let you know in three weeks.
<Question> <Positive> Along those lines, in the days before the actual vote was held, former President George W. Bush made a number of calls of senators also sort of lobbying on Kavanaugh's behalf. Does he deserve any of the credit here? Have you spoken to him, have you given him a thank you for that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I did speak with him, I did. No, I didn't say thank you, per se. But I did speak to him before it and we had a great conversation about Kavanaugh, what an outstanding person he is, which is what he told me. And we had a very pleasant conversation, a very good conversation.
<Question> <Positive> There are a number of phone calls that you got from folks in that critical period. Did you hear from anyone who serves in the Supreme Court who serves alongside now, the justice?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I didn't. Nobody called from the Supreme Court. It's a very august body. It's a group of people that, once you're elevated to that level, you really tend to be in a different place, in a different world. No, I didn't, I never got a call. As an example, I did not get a call from Justice Gorsuch, who would be the most likely, or Justice Thomas.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Or Alito. I've got no calls.
<Question> <Positive> Are you prepared for what will happen to your presidency if the Democrats do take back the House?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure.
<Question> <Negative> How will you handle investigations, impeachment prospects?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I'll handle it very well. I'm handling already. We have a witch hunt now going on, and I handle it very well, and there was no collusion. Everyone knows it. It's... People laugh. People are laughing at the concept of it.
<Question> <Negative> What if they go after your tax returns? Is that something that would...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have to do whatever they do, and I'll do whatever I do. But I've had the most successful two years. I would say, without question, first two years of office, I've had the most successful two years in the history of this country as a president. And we're not even close, actually, if you think about it. It's not until Jan.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> 20 so we're not even really close to two years. And, would get me the list? Would you get me the list, please?
<Question> <Positive> Do you think you have the legal team necessary?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have the most successful. Nobody has done what I've done, and nobody has come close in the first two years of office. And that's despite the fighting, the Democrats" obstruction.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> I have extra copies...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Here, these are just some. I just put them down rough. But take a look at that. You all set?
<Question> <Positive> Yeah, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, you go point after point, each point is a major event, but you just take a look. Confirmed more circuit court judges than any other new administration. Soon it will be than any administration in history. Who is the one, who's the one president that percentage-wise has done better than me? There's only one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> George Washington — 100 percent. [Laughter] Nobody has gotten that yet.
<Question> <Positive> That is a good piece of trivia. On another topic: Michael Cohen was your personal attorney for many years. He testified under oath in federal court that you directed him to commit a crime. Did you, sir?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Totally false. It's totally false.
<Question> <Negative> So he's lying under oath?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, absolutely he's lying. And Michael Cohen was a PR person who did small legal work, very small legal work. And what he did was very sad, when you look. By the way, he was in trouble not for what he did for me; he was in trouble for what he did for himself. You do know that? Having to do with loans, mortgages, taxicabs and various other things, if you read the paper.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He wasn't in trouble for what he did for me; he was in trouble for what he did for other people. He represented me very little. It's a very low level. And what he was is also a public relations person. And now if he wants to try and get a little bit lighter sentence for what he did... Totally uninvolved.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I wasn't involved and he had other clients, No. 1. And No. 2, he was a contractor to a large extent. But Michael Cohen, if you take a look at what he did, this had to do with loans, and I guess the taxi industry is something that I have nothing to do with, he did this on his own time. Go ahead.
<Question> <Neutral> You were tweeting today about Stormy Daniels...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I won a case yesterday, a big case. They sued. Got thrown out. And not only did they get thrown out, but I get legal fees, which is quite unusual, because the case is so obnoxious and so wrong. And I give tremendous credit to the judge. And not only that, we go by Texas law. Texas law says you get every penny that you spent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Texas law is very tough for the legal fees.
<Question> <Positive> Sir, as the president of the United States, is it appropriate to call a woman, and even one who is making serious allegations and who you are in litigation against, to call her a horseface?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what? You can take it any way you want.
<Question> <Neutral> How should we take it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Did you see the letter? She put out a letter. I had nothing to do with her. So she can lie and she can do whatever she wants to do. She can hire a phony lawyer. You take a look at this guy, a stone-cold loser. Take a look at his past. They can say anything about me. I'm just saying, I just speak for myself.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You take a look, and you make your own determination.
<Question> <Negative> There's two cases with Stormy Daniels aside from the one yesterday that the judge invalidated, but the hush-deal case continues. Did you ask the lawyer to invalidate the agreement?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you'd have to speak to the lawyers. I don't even know what the lawyers are doing, but they are very good lawyers. They'll figure it out.
<Question> <Negative> In your interview with "60 Minutes" over the weekend, you were asked about climate change, and you said you believe it, but that also, it could go back. And one of the things... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said the worst hurricane was 50 years ago, far worse than what this one was. Then, in 1890, they had one that was even worse. This was No. 3 or 4 or 5. We had worse hurricanes in 1890, we had worse, a worse hurricane 50 years ago. We've gone through a period, actually, fairly recently, where we have very few.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I live in Florida to a large extent and spend a lot of time in Florida, and we had a period of time where we went years without having any major problem. And then you have a problem and it goes in cycles, and I want absolutely crystal clear water and I want the cleanest air on the planet and our air now is cleaner than it's ever been.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very important to me. But what I'm not willing to do is sacrifice the economic well-being of our country for something that nobody really knows. And you have scientists on both sides of the issue. And I agree the climate changes, but it goes back and forth, back and forth. So we'll see.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, you know, I am a person that believes very, very strongly in the environment. I am truly an environmentalist. I know some people might not think of me as that, but I'm an environmentalist. Everything I want and everything I have is clean. Clean is very important — water, air. But I also want jobs for our country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if we would have, as an example, entered certain agreements with other countries, I actually think that we're doing it so they could have an economic advantage. Because we would have had a tremendous— we would have been at a tremendous economic disadvantage if we entered into certain agreements.
<Question> <Negative> But scientists say this is nearing a point where this can't be reversed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no. Some say that and some say differently. I mean, you have scientists on both sides of it. My uncle was a great professor at MIT for many years. Dr. John Trump. And I didn't talk to him about this particular subject, but I have a natural instinct for science, and I will say that you have scientists on both sides of the picture.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, what's next?
<Question> <Positive> Sir, you mentioned, you mentioned more than once that your inclination is not to interfere with the Department of Justice as the special counsel probe continues.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the probe is ridiculous. OK. That that probe was even started. Jeff Sessions should have never recused himself. He did it for... and he did it immediately. He should have told me that. And he recused himself. And even people that are not my friends say that was a horrible thing that he did to the president, a horrible thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He should be ashamed of himself for doing it. He should have told me that beforehand. And if he would have told me that beforehand, I probably would have put somebody else in the Department of Justice. But Jeff Sessions should never have recused himself.
<Question> <Negative> I mean, you can fire him now. Would you want to do that? Will you do that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I haven't said I was going to fire him or not.
<Question> <Negative> You could, I'm saying.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I could fire him whenever I want to fire him, but I haven't said that I was going to.
<Question> <Neutral> Why don't you, sir?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just haven't said I was going to fire him. We'll see what happens. But if you ask me: Am I thrilled? No, I am not thrilled.
<Question> <Negative> You've said in the past, also, on the probe, that you felt like there were certain lines that it shouldn't cross. How concerned would you be if it perhaps crept close on targeting your family, perhaps your eldest son?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I can say this. I knew nothing about the meeting that you're talking about. My son's a good young guy. He did what every other person in Congress would do if somebody came up to them, said, "Hey, I have information on your opponent." I don't know of any politician. And I think I can speak for the people in this room that would have said, "Oh, gee, information on my opponent and it's bad information?" Name me a politician that would have turned that down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There is no such thing as that kind of a politician. So that's what they heard. They heard it was about Hillary Clinton. They had a meeting or he had a meeting with some people. The meeting became about a different subject and they couldn't get out of the meeting fast enough.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now here's the important thing. After the meeting, nothing happened. It was like, "Hey, let's get together next week. Let's get together tomorrow. Let's get together." Nothing happened out of that meeting. Absolutely nothing. He did absolutely nothing wrong. And there's nobody harder on my son than I am. And I would tell you, the press has made a fake news deal out of that meeting.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If he did something wrong, I would have been livid. I could never really blame him because I've had people come up to me, senators. I've had a lot of political people say, "Your son didn't do anything wrong. That was just a meeting. It was called oppo research." A lot of the politicians would call it opposition research.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There was nothing wrong with that. But here's more important. Nothing from the day of that meeting. It ended. And if you listen to people, it sounded like it ended like they couldn't get out fast enough. There was nothing wrong with having an opposition research meeting and nothing happened from the meeting.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If that meeting went, "Oh, let's have another meeting next week or let's have a meeting tomorrow or let's start doing this or that or a hundred different things," that's different. That's totally different depending on what they were going to do. But nothing happened.
<Question> <Positive> The special counsel has submitted written questions to your lawyers. Have you read those questions? Have you been involved in drafting the response?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I won't respond, but you're right — we are looking at certain questions having to do with the word collusion. Of course there was no collusion. So we are looking at that, and we'll make a determination.
<Question> <Positive> Would you prefer to have an in-person interview or do it this way?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We'll see how that works out. You know that's in process. It's a tremendous waste of time for the president of the United States. To think that I would be even thinking about using Russia to help me win Idaho. We're using Russia to help me win the great state of Iowa or anywhere else is the most preposterous, embarrassing thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I will say that the Democrats know it and they wink. They're all laughing. And you know if I often hear that Russia likes to sow discord. The word is sow, an old English term. They like to sow chaos and discord. Well, if that's the case, you gave it to them on a silver platter because this is ridiculous.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This was an excuse made by the Democrats for the reason they lost the electoral college, which gives them a big advantage — a big advantage. Very different than the popular vote. The popular vote would be much easier to win if you were campaigning on it. You know, it's like running the 100-yard dash versus a 10-mile run.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You train differently. Nobody explained that to Hillary Clinton, by the way. Someday she'll figure it out. But winning the electoral college is a tremendous advantage for the Democrats. And this was an excuse for how they lost the election. How they lost an election they should have won. And one of the reasons they lost because I happened to be a great candidate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And another reason they lost is that Hillary forgot to campaign in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and I guess she needed a lot more time in North Carolina, a lot more time in South Carolina and a lot more time in a place called — a beautiful, sunny, wonderful place— called Florida.
<Question> <Negative> If I could turn to immigration and the families separated at the border.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure.
<Question> <Negative> There are children who have now been reunited with their families who are now showing signs of trauma from their separation experience.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, many of the children — and this is unfortunate, I covered it so nicely on "60 Minutes," but they only put on pieces of it, and they were fine but you know they cut, cut, cut because I guess they have so much time, although I heard that they did very nicely on the show. Did they do well?
<Question> <Neutral> They just put out some ratings.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So congratulations to them, but I wish they would have left the entire answer. When people enter our country illegally, there are consequences to pay. But despite the consequences, you have many children that, sadly, are there without parents. Then you have people that grab children and use them as a prop and it's a disgrace.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they come in with a child and they don't even know who the child is five hours before. And that's a shame. That's a terrible thing what they do.
<Question> <Neutral> There are also children whose parents have been deported.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They take children and they use them to try and come into our country. There are many, many bad things going on on the border. We have the worst laws in the history of the world on immigration, and we're getting them changed one by one. We've made a lot of progress in the last couple of weeks even, but we're getting them changed one by one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you have children that we're taking care of, that don't even have parents at least anywhere within hundreds of miles of the border, and we're taking those children, caring for those children, and in many cases sending them back to their parents in countries where their parents didn't even make the journey up with them, incredibly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And some of those children are really young. And we are, actually, in fact, today there was a beautiful statement put out by the Washington Examiner congratulating us on the great job we do with children. Now President Obama had the same law; he did the same thing. And, in fact, the picture of children living in cages that was taken in 2014 was a picture of President Obama's administration and the way they handled children.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They had the kids living in cages. They thought it was our administration and they used it and then unbeknownst to them and the fake news, they found out, "Oh my God, this is a terrible situation." This was during the Obama administration.
<Question> <Negative> Do you have any regrets or any remorse about how this has impacted children, though?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Here's the thing. I think we've done an incredible job with children. As I just said, we've taken children who have no parents with them standing on the border. We've taken many children, and I'm not talking about a small percentage, I'm talking about a very large percentage where they have no people, no parents.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In addition to that, we're separating children who are just met by people that are using them coming into the border, not their parents. They are using them coming into the border. The one thing I will also say is that when a person thinks they will not be separated, our border becomes overrun with people coming in. So that's another problem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> With all of that being said, we're getting the laws changed so that catch and release, so that visa lottery, so that chain migration and every other form of incredible stupidity can be taken out of our system.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders: I'll send you guys the DHS report that has the numbers that show that, like, 75 percent of the kids were actually self-separated. Their parents chose to go back and signed the paperwork to leave their kids behind.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The parents would sometimes come up with their kids, leave them at the border and go back. So we're in this position where we have an innocent young child at the border; there are no parents. We take them in, we care for the child and then we get horrible publicity. We should be getting great publicity, and the Washington Examiner did a great piece today on the fact that we've done a great job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And President Obama had the same law. And, by the way, he separated children and there are many pictures of jail cells where the children were separate from the parents.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We should be getting credit for the job we've done.
<Question> <Neutral> Turning to foreign policy, you ran the campaign on bringing American troops home and the America First policy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Question> <Negative> But today there are more American troops serving in Afghanistan and in Syria and Iraq, in Africa, in harm's way than when you took office. How do you explain to people at home?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The main thing I have to see is, I have to see safety at home and — not a vast difference, by the way — but a little bit more. But it's not a lot more, it's a little bit more. I have to see safety at home. And if I think people are likely to do some very bad things in faraway places to our homeland, I'm going to have troops there for a period of time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we've done an excellent job. We've defeated ISIS. ISIS is defeated in all of the areas that we fought ISIS, and that would have never happened under President Obama. In fact, it is going the other way. And I think we fought extremely effectively on everything I've wanted to do. Now there will be a certain point where that takes place.
<Question> <Negative> John Bolton, though, told us, told my colleague Jon a couple of weeks ago that troops aren't going to come out, aren't going to leave Syria, until Iran is fully out of Syria.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to see what happens. We're going to see what happens. I want, No. 1, the safety of our country. And if that means knocking the hell out of them, of terrorists, long before they can ever get here, that's OK with me. And if I could help Europe and other places by doing it, that's OK with me. And they're starting to pay us for that, by the way, much more substantially than they ever paid before.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You understand that's an important thing because it's unfair that the burden is all on us. As it has been. But we are... we've made... we've had tremendous success there. We've had tremendous success in North Korea, tremendous success in North Korea.
<Question> <Negative> On the subject of American soldiers and military overseas, why have you not yet visited a military base in a combat zone like in Iraq and Afghanistan?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I will do that at some point, but I don't think it's overly necessary. I've been very busy with everything that's taking place here. We have the greatest economy in the history of our country. I mean, this is the greatest economy we've ever had, best unemployment numbers. Many groups are, you know, we've never even been close to these numbers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm doing a lot of things. I'm doing a lot of things. But it's something I'd do. And do gladly. Nobody has been better at the military. Hey, I just got them a pay raise. I haven't had a pay raise in 11 years. I just got them a substantial pay raise. "They" meaning our military people. I just got them new equipment.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They have stuff that was so old that the grandfathers used to fly it. I have done more for the military than any president in many, many years.
<Question> <Positive> Can you give us any update as to the plans for your next meeting with Kim Jong Un?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, we will have one, but it is going to be after the midterms because I want to stay around here.
<Question> <Positive> Will it be here, in the United States, sir?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want to stay around and help people get elected.
<Question> <Neutral> Do you think that meeting would be here? In the U.S.?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think so. I mean, we haven't set it up yet, but I would think not yet. At some point, that will happen, too.
<Question> <Negative> You saw the numbers, the coverage in the last couple of days about deficits. That the projected deficit is a trillion dollars. You railed on President Obama over deficits.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me. No. 1, I had to take care of our military. I had no choice but to do it, and I want to take care of our military. We had to do things that we had to do. And I've done them. Now we're going to start bringing numbers down. We also have tremendous numbers with regard to hurricanes and fires and the tremendous forest fires all over.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We had very big numbers, unexpectedly big numbers. California does a horrible job maintaining their forests. They're going to have to start doing a better job or we're not going to be paying them. They are doing a horrible job of maintaining what they have. And we had big numbers on tremendous numbers with the forest fires and obviously the hurricanes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We got hit in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, Georgia. Georgia was hit very hard this time. Nobody even, you know, treats that one fairly. The farmers got hit very, very hard.
<Question> <Negative> Mitch McConnell said he wants to consider entitlement reform.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Wants to consider what?
<Question> <Positive> Entitlement reform — changes to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That I haven't heard.
<Question> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I haven't heard that. I'm leaving Social Security. I'm not touching Social Security.
<Question> <Negative> I know we are quite short on time. We were looking to do kind of a lightning round.
<Question> <Positive> You've spoken about security clearances. Do you have any plans to take any more clearances away any time soon?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I do.
<Question> <Neutral> From whom?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People I don't trust.
<Question> <Neutral> Any updates on the White House counsel?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. I've made a decision. He's... you've been reading a little bit about it. A very fine man, highly respected by a lot of people: Pat [Cipollone].
<Question> <Neutral> And for the U.N. perm rep? For Ambassador Haley's job? Have you made a decision?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have many people that want the job. I have such a good relationship with Nikki. And I've talked to her about it, too. I will be talking to her about it. But I have many people that want the job, and I would say I'll be making that decision over the next week or two. They're going to work with Nikki for a little while.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She going to go till the end of the year, and they'll be working with Nikki.
<Question> <Negative> You've been very critical, the last year or so, of the NFL. This year, actually, rating are up a little bit. What do you make of that? What does that say about...?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, look, I did the NFL a big favor. You know that, right?
<Question> <Neutral> By calling attention to it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. You didn't know this? You didn't know this?
<Question> <Neutral> Tell us, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So the NFL was having a tremendous problem with Canada on the Super Bowl and advertising and all sorts of things — very complicated subject. And in about two seconds, I got, in about 30 seconds, I got that one fixed up for the NFL. They're going to make a tremendous amount of additional money because of what I did for them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was a favor for them and it wasn't for NFL, it was that this is a great American company. I was negotiating against Canada. And one of the things, I said "I want the NFL fixed," because it had to do with them keeping revenues from advertising and for not allowing the NFL to advertise in Canada. And it was very unfair and everybody knew that and Canada knew it, too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Canada plays a very tough game. So I said I want that fixed and nobody wrote a story about it because why would they ever write about it? And, by the way, Commissioner Goodell called me last week and he, "thank you very much." But I settled that for the NFL. It took me literally about a minute because that's a small deal compared to the big deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And Canada knew it was the right thing to do. So I helped a great American corporation. You have to understand, I like the NFL. I want the NFL to do well. I have many friends that are in the NFL, owners and others. I want them to do very well. I also want them standing for the American flag, not kneeling, but I just helped the NFL settle a problem that they couldn't settle for 15 years or something.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This has been going on, a vicious battle with Canada, for years. I settled it. And not one person has written about it. Why don't you call what you call Commissioner Goodell and ask him. Roger. He called me last week. I thought he was calling me about the flag to say "ceasefire." But he didn't. He called me just to thank me, and I said, "That was very nice." It was a very nice phone call.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You should do something about it if you want.
<Question> <Positive> Do you plan to pardon Paul Manafort?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Who?
<Question> <Neutral> Paul Manafort.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I never even was asked about it. I haven't thought about it. But, you know, I think it's a very sad, sad situation. And there's another thing that had nothing to do with me. That was from years before. You do understand that, right? Do you understand that? Do you know these Russian hackers you're talking about from Moscow?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have nothing to do with me. How many people are they? Only 28 people? They have nothing to do with me. They were hackers from Moscow. Some of them supported Hillary Clinton. They had nothing to do with me. You look at all the stuff, it's just nothing to do with me.
<Question> <Positive> Knowing what you know today, is it still appropriate for Secretary Mnuchin to be going to Saudi Arabia next week?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it depends on what we find out over the next couple of days. He doesn't have to make that determination until Friday, and I think we'll also be guided by what other countries are doing. You know, we'll look at that.
<Question> <Neutral> What's your responsibility?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do think this. I do think that they have ordered billions, one of the largest military orders in the history of the country. I think that we hurt ourselves far more than we hurt Saudi Arabia when we cancel an order like that.
<Question> <Positive> You've seen American business leaders, though, pull out of that conference. Do you endorse that move?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Too early to say. I have to find out what happened. Once they find out what happened, I'll be able to tell you exactly.
<Question> <Positive> Would you only serve one term, Mr. President, if you felt like you had done everything you set out to do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. Because the other term... first of all, there's always things to do. Actually, it's a very nice question because I have done so much. People have said that, "You've done so much. You may have it all put back together. And our country: Make America Great Again." And they do ask me that question. So if you do all of the things that you're doing and you're given another two years, which is a lot of time because I've done this in far less than two years, and those papers pretty much say it, they do ask that question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's always something to do. And you know, the new motto is Keep America Great. I don't want somebody to destroy it because I can do a great job. But the wrong person coming in after me sitting right at this desk can destroy it very quickly, if they don't do the right thing. So no I'm definitely running.
<Question> <Positive> Is there someone in particular you'd like to run against?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So far, all of them. So far, all of them. I don't see any talent. No talent.
<Question> <Negative> No one you're worried about?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I see no talent.
<Question> <Negative> Vice President Biden? Or Sen. Warren? Or anyone?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Biden ran twice and actually a lot of people think he really ran a third time, but he was so low in the polls that he never registered. But he ran twice. And I call him One Percent Joe because you know he did very poorly and then Obama took him off the trash heap and made him vice president.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And in a sense he did a good job as vice president, in my opinion, because Obama liked him, and if President Obama didn't like him, you would have been hearing about it. So in that sense, he, I think, he did actually a nice job because the president of the United States felt very comfortable about him. Like, I like my vice president very, very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's an important function.
<Question> <Positive> Thank you very much, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you all.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> And with us now live, the man who is currently in the lead in the New Hampshire polls, Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi, everybody.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Donald. [Applause]
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right. So let's --
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> How are you feeling?
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Let's get this straight. You were there last night and flew straight here. How many hours sleep did you get?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not too much. About an hour and a half.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> About an hour and a half. So you're rested and ready to go.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What I do for you folks.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> It's unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm doing it for them. [Applause]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Oh, Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's all right. That's right.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right. Let's dive in.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Let's dive in on the debate last night. How do you think the debate went?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I thought it was great. I thought the moderators were fantastic. You go from that to what we had a few weeks ago which wasn't good talking about football, fantasy football. I thought the three moderators did a fantastic job. Not only really a good job, it was elegant. It was an elegant debate. Now I don't know if that's going to be as big as it would have been, let's say No. 1, we had 24, 25 million people for No. 1 and I would think that over a period of time maybe just naturally it goes down but they were terrific moderators last night.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Who, other than yourself, who do you think had the best performance?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think anybody did poorly really. I really don't.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> The quality seems --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Normally I should say they were all terrible, everybody, right? They were horrible.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> But didn't you notice the quality of all the candidates seem to be getting better.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> How did Ben Carson do?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I thought he was good. They didn't ask him that many questions. He didn't have a lot of air time, but I thought he was good. He was right next to me. I thought he was good.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> I'm curious. You were very critical of Ben Carson on the campaign trail last week, went after him. But last night seemed to keep the gloves off. Why is that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to be critical. I like him to start off with. I do. I like him. I don't want to be critical. Last night they were asking questions. Ben and I have gotten along very well over the period of time. I've actually become friends with a lot of the people that are up there. Some very good people up there actually.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Is Ben Carson qualified to be president of the United States?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't want to say, Joe -- That's not for me to say. You know, look --
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Would you let him run one of your companies?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would let him operate on a friend of mine, not necessarily me, but a friend of mine.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> But would you let him run one of your companies?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure, if you're talking about a company, sure.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> You would never let him run one of your companies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't say -- You are really critical.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> No, I'm just curious. You're being nice this morning. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am being nice. I'm trying to be - You know, I read where one of the folks said some nice things about me in some place. It didn't happen to be here, but actually, Katy Tur, what happened? She was so great. I just saw her back there and I gave her a big kiss.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She was fantastic.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But on one of the --
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> I don't even know what to say about that. [Crosstalk]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> I thought I was the only one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She was so positive about my performance last night, so it was great.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Let's talk about policy. Big battle over what the United States should and shouldn't do, the Republican Party obviously has been run by neocons over the past decade. You had Marco Rubio on one side of the debate who wants to spend a trillion dollars more on national defense and wants to be - Well, he's a neocon. Then on the other side you had Rand Paul. Where exactly do you stand between those two polar opposites?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say I'm the most militaristic person on that stage. But I also know when to do it. You know, you saw that. In fact, I tell the story about you where you almost fell over when in my book that was written in 2000, prior to the World Trade Center coming down. I was talking about Osama bin Laden is going to come onto our shores and do some bad stuff, we better be careful.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Joe asked, when was that book written? It was written before the World Trade Center came down and you couldn't -- remember, you said, whoa, that's pretty amazing. It depends on what we're talking about and where. We have to be top of the line military. We have to spend a lot of money. It's a great expenditure. The more we spend the less we're going to have to use it, the way I look at it. People are looking at us right now as weak, ineffective, we don't know what we're doing, we don't have strong leadership. They have a lot of bad things going and --
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> But you say that the United States should not be the world's policemen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. Joe, we owe $19 trillion.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Does that put you in line where Barack Obama is as far as leading from behind?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think I'm a little bit more on the let's go side than that. But at the same time, I love the fact that Putin is bombing the hell out of somebody and the people that he's bombing right now have to be ISIS to a certain extent. They just probably just blew up his airplane. That was a Russian plane and it went down and I assume it was a bomb. I think they don't want to say it. But it looks like it was a bomb. And having Putin dropping bombs on ISIS is a very positive thing. We don't have to do 100 percent of the bombing.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Jeb Bush says that that's reckless and irresponsible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's irresponsible for us to get bogged down in Syria and maybe let's end up with World War III over Syria where we don't even want to be in the first place and you have a migration with millions of people coming out going all over the world. Nobody knows what's happening. Frankly, Assad is a bad guy. We're backing people we don't even know who the hell they are.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is another Libya deal. We're backing people that we don't even know who they are, Joe, and giving billions of dollars worth of stuff and they're getting the hell knocked out of them anyway because now Russia is taking care of that one. But we have no idea. I spoke to a general two weeks ago, he was really up on it, and he said Donald, we have no idea who those people are that we're giving all this stuff to.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So if Assad got knocked off, let's say they get knocked off, he gets knocked off, what do we have? We don't know if it's going to be worse than Assad? So what are we doing? In other words, what are we doing? We shouldn't have gone into Iraq and we destabilized the entire Middle East by doing it. ISIS now, we have ISIS because of that. We have ISIS. Look at Libya with Gaddafi.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we have Libya, we have Gaddafi, he's not there, it's 10 times worse than it ever was when we had Gaddafi. Now we have the same thing. We owe $19 trillion. We have -- bridges are falling down, our roadways are falling, our airports. You know, I travel all over the world. I see airports the most beautiful things you've ever seen, like cathedrals.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Singapore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Anywhere. I can name 20 different places and then you land at LaGuardia and you have potholes in the runway. The place is falling apart.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> But there is a beautiful Trump airplane at the end of the runway every time you land at LaGuardia. No, I'm not being - it is funny. Every time you land.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Listen. When it comes to the infrastructure we have that's falling apart. There's so much that needs to be done here and last night I heard you say you would keep the minimum wage as is, you would not raise it. Explain how that is necessary.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a very tough thing.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Because $7.50 an hour, Donald, nobody can live on that and there are people living on that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Mika, we're becoming a noncompetitive country. That's the problem. We're becoming noncompetitive. I would love to say make it $50 an hour, I think it's great --
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> I understand you can't do that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know what? It's a tough position politically. The best thing for me to say, I'm running for all of a sudden for the last four months, first time in my life I'm a politician. I can't believe this. I'm a politician. I never respected politicians. Now I'm a politician.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> But Donald, do you have people working for you making $7.50 an hour? No.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, probably, maybe I do somewhere along the line. I got thousands of people. But you know what? We have to become competitive with the world. Our taxes are too high, our wages are too high. Everything is too high. We have to compete with other countries and if we're going to just say hey, I just seen in New York where they made it $15, well you're going to --
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Our wages are not - I mean, you can argue our wages are flat.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Listen to this. What's going to happen is now people are going to start firing people because they're going to - You know, the old story. It's happened a hundred times. It's always happening. But I'm not even saying from that standpoint, Mika. We have got to do something to compete with the rest of the world. Our country is not competitive anymore. That's why we're losing all of the manufactures.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, it's currency manipulation and all of those things that I talked about last night. A lot of currency manipulation. They're going it brilliantly in China. China is a tremendous abuser of the United States. I said the other day, in the history of the world there has never been a greater theft than what the United States has, you know, we've been taken care of by China. China has - it's one of the great bank robberies of all time.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Explain that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well China has manipulated their currency, taken our jobs, our base, our manufacturing. They've taken so much out of us. Hundreds of thousands of companies. We have lost hundreds of thousands of companies and millions and millions of jobs.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> But isn't that better, though, for the consumers that, yes, maybe China can build something cheaper? But it comes back to us at the end of the day where we --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what? It's better for China, not better for us. We're losing our jobs, we're losing everything. We're losing our manufacturing, our base, we're losing everything. Now, we can change it.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Would you -- [Inaudible] protectionist?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Last year -- let me -- No, I'm not a protectionist. I'm a free trader. But we have to have better deals. Last year and this year will be almost $500 billion imbalance with China. $75 billion U.S. trade when you talk about an imbalance with Japan. $55 billion with Mexico. So we're going to lose 55 -- It's not actually a loss, but it really is a loss. They'll tell you it's not a loss. It really sort of is. $55 billion trade imbalance with Mexico. You can go right down the line.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> So you've ridiculed --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will take care of that better than anybody.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> '-- trade deals that the Obama administration has made. Are there any good deals that this administration --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not too many.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Okay. Can you name one?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can name one. Look at the Iran deal. Maybe the worst deal I've ever seen negotiated of any kind and I'm not talking about between countries. Maybe the worst deal I've seen negotiated. The Iran deal, they get 150 billion, they get everything they wanted. We caved point after point after point - We don't even get our prisoners back.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> But what do you do on day one if you're president of the United States? You've said before Obama has made the deal, Trump has to live with the deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The biggest problem with the deal is they're getting now the 150 billion -- I can't get it back. No matter how good I do, the money will be gone. I hate that the money is gone. I've always liked money. I hate that the money is gone. $150 billion will be gone. So hopefully when I get there, oh, I'll do such a good job, Mika. You'll be so proud of me.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the money is gone.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Okay. So let's talk about money. You have talked about using United States laws to further your business. You've used bankruptcy laws and often to your benefit. What happened to those investors after you filed for bankruptcy? You were --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Wait, wait, wait. Let's go back. Every major person that you've had on this thing in terms of business has done the same things.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> No, I don't disagree, Donald. I'm not arguing that. I'm just wondering what happened to others in those deals?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible]. I've used the laws of the country to make good deals for myself and also, I've had hundreds and hundreds of companies. Three or four times I've restructured so people could keep their jobs, among other things. I've used the laws like other people do. I'm not going to mention names, but almost every person that sits in front of you has done the same thing. Unfortunately, I get more publicity when I did it. I did one deal where I bought the company, it was a terrible accompany, the guy made a terrible deal, I bought - he was a friend of mine.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was just down and out. I bought it, immediately threw it into a chapter, beat the hell out of the banks - oh, those poor banks -- and made a good deal out of it. That's called good business. You know, now I'm in a different world. But that's called good business. And you do those things. You use the laws of the country, the laws of the land, and I did. So have -- and I could go one, two, three, name the top ten business people you know, I can tell you most of them have done the same thing.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So let's -- Also, some major companies, whether it's Delta or other companies that have done the same thing. Let's talk about --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When you take a look at Atlantic City, almost everybody is in bankruptcy in Atlantic City. Caesar's just filed for bankruptcy. Who would think Caesar's? But Caesar's just filed for bankruptcy.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Thousands of jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, Leon Black, you know smart guy. But Caesar's just filed for bankruptcy. Many, many top business people, and I mean the top. And we do it because it's good.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Let's talk about immigration. Last night you got pounded from all sides, mainly from John Kasich, though, and Jeb Bush saying that your plan to deport illegal immigrants was not realistic. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it's very good -- First of all, we have a country, we're a country of law, we have to abide by certain things. You need borders. I will build a wall and get the wall to be paid for by Mexico. And - you know, they did that little skit --
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> They did the skit on Saturday Night Live. They did the skit on...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Did you see that? Where the president of Mexico walks in, I have a check --
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> And how exactly do you do that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They gave me a $20 billion check even though it's going to cost 7. I said it's too much, Enrique. It's too much. No, no, no.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So how exactly - We'll get to SNL" in a little bit -- How exactly do you get Mexico to pay for the wall? So how exactly - We'll get to "SNL" in a little bit --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's so easy. I just told you - trade imbalance of between 45 and 55 billion dollars. They're also - you're talking about, you know, they were going to spend $12 billion on the wall. I'm going to spend seven or it's going to be bigger, better and nicer. I know how to build, okay?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> But - okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But Mexico has got to pay. When you're losing -- we give billions of dollars to Mexico. Billions. You need the wall. You need it because - and by the way, walls do work. All you have to do is call up Israel and say how's your wall working? 99 percent.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> How do you deport 12 million? How do you deport 12 million illegal immigrants?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You do it. You do it. Because they're here illegally, you do it. Now remember this. In 1952 Dwight Eisenhower, who was a nice man, right, I mean, whether people like him, don't like him, people thought of him as -- remember the expression, I like Ike" -- like mine's "Make America great again." I still like that one better. We could go "I like Donald" but it doesn't work
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> So we're going to dig deeper on that after a break. Just to close out, I have a question for you. The new prime minister of Canada has pledged to hire 50 percent women -- 15 men, 15 women in his cabinet. And he was asked why and he said because it's 2015. Will you make a similar pledge? Will you have women in your cabinet?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think you know a lot about my accompany. And --
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> I do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> '-- I have many, many women in my company.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> I know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Probably more than almost anybody proportionally. It's just about 50 percent, might even be more than 50 percent. So I'm not one that has to make a pledge, and I wouldn't want that, because I will tell you, I want the best person at each position. OK? And I think you'd want to hear that. I want to get the best. Carl Ichan endorse me. I'm going to get Carl involved in China. Carl's a great business man. I'm going to say, Carl, watch our trade deal. It stinks with China. All of a sudden we're going to say, wow, you know, things are getting really good with China. I'm going to get the best people for the job.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right. We're going to take a quick break right now, but much more with Donald Trump live from New Hampshire. [Applause] [Break] [Begin Video]
<Jeb Bush> <Negative> To send them back, 500,000 a month, is just not possible. And it's not embracing American values. And it would tear communities apart. And it would a send a signal that we're not the country that I know America is.
<Jeb Bush> <Positive> And even having this conversation sends a powerful signal. They're doing high-fives in the Clinton campaign right now when they hear this. That's the problem with this. We have to win the presidency, and the way you win the presidency is to have practical plans. Lay them out there. What we need to do is allow people to earn legal status, where they pay fine, where they work, where they don't commit crimes, where they learn English. And over an extended period of time, they earn legal status. That's the path -- a proper path to [Inaudible].
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> [End Video] OK, our conversation here in Manchester, New Hampshire continues with Donald Trump. And, Donald, to Jeb's point there politically as well in terms of where we are as a country, I mean, you talked about Ike and you talked about the possibility of moving a large number of people. I'd like to dig deeper in the how here. We have racial tensions in this country. We do represent something about ourselves that's different than around the world. Did he have a point there and how exactly would you send these people back home? Physically how?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everybody has a point. Look, we have to do what we have to do, and Ike did it and other people have done it. And in Mexico, you want to go into Mexico, you're not outta there, you get thrown out. I had friends that were there the other day, they stayed -- they overstayed by a day. They knocked on the door by the police, but you're over by a day. By the way, that's the way a country is suppose to be run. Whether you like it or not.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Why aren't we run this way? Why are other countries -- you made the point last night. Why are other countries --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have bad leadership. I mean, we really do. We have bad leadership. Look, the whole thing with the anchor babies, all right. Now, in the Fourteenth Amendment, you know, that really covers it. You need an act of Congress. You don't have to go through a new amendment or anything, a new constitutional amendment. But anchor babies. A woman is pregnant; she goes over to the border, has a baby on our land, now we take care of the baby for the next 85 years. It's not that way. I must tell you -- and I said it wasn't that way and the legal scholars have now said I was right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not talking about the television scholars. The legal scholars say I'm right. If that happened in Mexico, we had a baby in Mexico, the baby -- Mexico would throw you the hell out. Mexico is the hardest country in the world, just about, to become a citizen of. But they send people over here. And I'm not just talking Mexico; they're coming in from Asia. They're coming from all over the world.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> OK, conceptually, I understand what you're saying and what you're describing. But still tell me the how. Are you going to have a massive deportation force?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're going to have a deportation force, and you're going to do it humanely and you're going to bring the country -- and, frankly, the people, because you have some excellent, wonderful people, some fantastic people hat have been here for a long period of time. Don't forget, Mika, that you have millions of people that are waiting in line to come into this country and they're waiting to come in legally.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I always say the wall, we're going to build the wall. It's going to be a real deal. It's going to be a real wall. There was a picture in one of the magazines where they had a wall this tall and they were taking drugs over the wall. They built a ramp over the wall and the truck was going up and down. They were using it like a highway; the wall is like a highway. It's not going to happen. It's going to be a Trump wall. It's going to be a real wall. And it's going to stop people and it's going to be good. But your friend Thomas Friedman called me and said, hah, there should be a big door. I said going to be a big door. I love the expression. There's going to be a big beautiful nice door. People are going to come in and they're going to come in legally.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we have no choice. Otherwise, we don't have a country. We don't even know how many people. We don't know if it's 8 million or if it's 20 million. We have no idea how many people are in our country. And then you see what happened with Kate in San Francisco. You see what happens with all of the things going on, all of the tremendous crime going on. It costs us $200 billion a year for illegal immigration right now. $200 billion a year, maybe $250, maybe $300. They don't even know. We're going to stop it. We're going to run it properly and we're going to stop it.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> So people will face ramifications that they don't leave, if they harbor them --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Will people will leave.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> How are you going to pay for this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very inexpensively.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Are they going to get ripped out of their homes? How?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Can I -- they're going back where they came. If they came from a certain country, they're going to be brought back to that country. That's the way it's supposed to be. Now they can come back but they have to come back legally. They can come back, but they have to come back legally. And I have to tell you, so many are in love with it. The loudest applause last night at the debate was when I said this. Even I was surprised. But I mean, the place went wild. Now, I'll tell you the other thing. The people that like it more than anybody are the Hispanics that are here legally.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There's a radio host in New York who was on the other day; they wrote a story about him. He says I can't believe it. The Hispanics love Trump. Because he's talking about his listeners. They came here legally, they went through all of this long process. They came here legally, and he's talking about all the people that call up. It's a Hispanic station -- they love Trump.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> You look -- your opponents would say though, you look at the polling numbers and you do worse among the Hispanics than -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, but in the meantime, I'm leading everybody. I'm beating everybody. We just had a poll come out this morning which is phenomenal and I'm beating Hillary Clinton in numerous polls and I'm beating her substantially. So I don't know, I mean I just don't know what to tell you. If you look at Romney, now Romney choked, OK? He choked like a dog. He should have won that. That was an election that should have been won. He choked. But, frankly, had he energized the base -- because the base didn't go out and vote. You understand that. Which is shocking, because they're not fans of Obama. And he, for some reason, they didn't go. Had they gone out and voted, the people that sat back and didn't get up and vote, which is hard to believe, he would have won the election.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> How do you unify the party though? And get everybody together?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> One of the reasons --
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> How do you unify the party if -- you've said some very tough things about Jeb Bush, about Marco Rubio, about Ben Carson. How do you then --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Did I stick up for Jeb last night? He couldn't talk; they wouldn't let him talk. I said let Jeb talk.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> He really appreciated that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Was that a nice thing?
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Yes, he really -- why didn't you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Somebody said I only said that with Carly. That's false. I said it with Kasich, because -- who's also a nice guy. You know, honestly --
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> But he doesn't -- John Kasich doesn't seem to like you or your policies. I think he likes me. And I think he's a nice man. I mean, I actually think he's a nice guy. I have no problem with him. I have no problem with anybody. OK.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> OK, we're going to -- we've got a --
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> We've got a lot more.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> I have some follow-ups, but we're going to have Mike Barnicle and Sam Stein and Michael Steele join us still ahead with their questions. And in a moment another MORNING JOE first. Donald Trump, [Inaudible] and Eric will join the conversation. [Applause] [Break] We are back with presidential candidate Donald Trump. And let's bring in Mike Barnicle, Sam Stein, and Michael Steele into the conversation. Just reading a Washington Post" story about Ben Carson. I want to ask you about Dr. Carson He actually meant that these things happened in his life and faith turned him around. Is it fair the way you're characterizing those two events and how important is faith for some who wants to lead a nation?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think faith is very important and, you know, I'm a Protestant, I'm a Presbyterian, I think faith is very important. And I don't want to really get into it with Ben because I have a very good relationship, but he wrote a whole thing about, you know, with the hammer and going after his mother with a hammer and hitting people in the face with locks and things like that --
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> It was about finding his faith.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I know. I know. But they're pretty severe. I never went after my mother with a hammer, that I can tell you. And if I did, I was in big trouble. I was in big trouble. hit anyone in the head with a hammer. If I did, I was in big trouble. No, it was the whole thing. Ben understands. He wrote about it. I'm not telling anything new. But I thought it was sort of a strange situation.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Does Ben Carson have trouble with the truth?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know, Joe. You know, I don't want to really get into that because I have a very good relationship with him. Sort of amazing. Some of these guys you would think like Marco last night - were like best friends. Even with Jeb, he couldn't have been nicer. I have really a very good relationship with some many of these people. Last night, it was amazing because the lights went on, you never know what's going to happen. Are you going to be attacked and do you go for the kill, right? There was not - really necessary. And I have to tell you, I give so much credit to the commentators last night. The three folks. They did such a good --
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> It was very well run.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Mike Barnicle.
<Mike Barnicle> <Negative> Donald, last night you and the others on the stage spoke about issues of global importance about the future of this country and the future of our role in the world. For too many families in this state and in other states, the future is like this afternoon due to the drug crisis in New Hampshire and otherwise heroine, an overflow of heroine.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Heroine in particular.
<Mike Barnicle> <Neutral> So treatment facilities are necessary in this state and other states. Treatment facilities cost money, cost less than incarceration. What is your view on how we get more treatment facilities in this state and other states?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You do have to have that - And you know, it's amazing. I've gotten -- As you know, I'm up here a lot. In facet from here I go and make a speech at a certain place and we're going to have a lot of fun. I'm in New Hampshire so much and I'm doing great in New Hampshire.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm leading in the polls by a lot and we're having a lot of fun here and I've gotten to know the people and have a lot of friends. People don't realize the heroine product, you know, it's so incredible what's going on in terms of heroine addiction in New Hampshire. You don't think of New Hampshire that way. And most people -- I was surprised when I learned about it to the extent a couple of years ago. One of the things about the border is, you know, it's coming over the border. I mean, this stuff is coming - it's pouring right over that border. The same border that I'm talking about. And other places. But for the most part, the same border that I'm talking about. We have to stop it from coming in. But you have so many people that are already hooked and it is a really strong hook and we have to do clinics and do something to help them. New Hampshire has an unbelievable problem, I guess more per capita than any other place. It's incredible.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right. [Crosstalk] Just follow up and then we'll go to Sam. You would be willing to spend money to pay for the treatment?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Drug treatment facilities.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have to. It's not like would I be willing to?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Mental health.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have such a problem here. It's incredible. And I don't know what it is. New Hampshire seems to have a bigger problem than other places. But - because you go to other places, they don't talk about it. Up here, I think it's maybe the No. 1 question I get is the heroine.
<Michael Steele> <Negative> The problem is it's cheap and it's coming in from places like Boston and Philadelphia.
<Sam Stein> <Negative> I would like to broaden this out a little bit. The three of us -- five of us, actually -- were in Wichita last week and we were sitting down with people - the Koch brothers network -- about criminal justice reform. And the underlying premise of it was that we need to rethink our concepts of the drug wars, incarceration, we need to rehab people in prison facilities. I'm wondering, you know, you are a tough on crime guy. You have been a tough on crime guy. Notably in the '80s and '90s. Have you had an evolution like a lot of the country has on this? Have you rethought some of you positions on this at all?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Sam Stein> <Negative> No?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm tough on crime.
<Sam Stein> <Negative> Okay. What about sentencing and - [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, I'm a believer in --
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Zero Tolerance.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> '-- being tough on crime. I really am. I'm tough on crime and we have to stop crime. You look at what's going on in the inner cities right now, it's unbelievable where you go to places like Chicago. And it's all in one little section and it's -- but boy, it's like the wild West.
<Sam Stein> <Negative> But like the three strikes, you're out stuff, the criminalizing marijuana.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you can [Inaudible] and marijuana you have to start looking at very strongly because people are being hurt very badly by marijuana and then you have some states where it's totally legal. So you're going to have to start looking at that. Absolutely.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Michael.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Michael Steele.
<Michael Steele> <Negative> The exchange last night between Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, for me, was probably one of the most important exchanges for the National Republican Party. It exposed, I think, a very deep fissure. What is your view of that fissure, that tension that exists right now between the traditional view of cutting the spending and getting control over our debt and deficits and wanting to expand as a lot of the neocon hawks want to do, you know, military engagements as well as defense spending?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, my view is you have two sections of the party. I will say for the most part people in my party, the Republican conservative group of people you know very well, I mean, we're more for -- we want to strengthen up. We have - we need strength. The world is looking to kill us. The world is looking to blow us up. We have a lot of problems. And so for the most part, people would not be on the Rand Paul side of that equation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But there's a big faction that feels, look, we got to get our house in order. And I understand it. And I actually think we can do both. I'm very much into the military but I also want to bring back our jobs, I want to make great trade deals. I want to bring the commerce back to our country. We don't make things anymore. You take a look -- Look at Caterpillar stock, look at some of these companies, Komatsu is killing them and other companies are killing them. We have to bring our jobs back and we can have both.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right. Still ahead this morning, we have presidential candidates Chris Christie, Lindsey Graham and Mike Huckabee. But first, it's a family affair. They say you can tell a lot about a person by their children. Don Trump, Jr. and Eric Trump join their father here on set, live in Manchester, New Hampshire. Stay with us. [Break] Joining us live from Manchester, New Hampshire, we have Donald Trump's sons. Executive vice presidents for development and acquisitions at the Trump Organization, Donald Trump, Jr., and Eric Trump. It's great to have you both. Mike Barnicle wants to start off, though, with a follow up for Donald first.
<Mike Barnicle> <Negative> Donald, today is Veterans Day. And if you live in northern New Hampshire or western Iowa or real rural places, it could take you hours in a car to get to a VA facility to be treated. Would you be in favor of implementing a program beneath the umbrella of the VA where local veterans could go to a doctor or a hospital nearest to where they live, get treated and the federal government would pick up the tab?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Totally. Now I came out with a plan last week --
<Mike Barnicle> <Neutral> It'd cost money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it's probably less expensive than the money they're spending right now, Mike. It's so good. I came up with that plan last week. We did a policy plan. They wanted policy, I gave them policy. They're waiting now six, seven, eight days in a reception room and people are dying waiting for a doctor that, you know, with a little operation or a pill or something they can live a long life.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The vets are being treated so horribly. I have a plan and it's going to be implemented if I win and it's going to be so good and it's going to cost less money than anybody knows. Instead of waiting, they're going to go to a local doctor. If they have a seven day wait, they're going to go to a local doctor, a local hospital, they're going to go in, we're going to pay for it, they're going to get better and everything's going to be good. I get a standing ovation from the vets. I'm getting tremendous support from the vets. They do polls where the vets like me more than anybody else in the world and they should because my plan is something -- I feel so badly the way the vets are treated.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, they're our greatest people, they're being treated so badly. And what you said it right. You know, by the time they build hospitals and everything else -- we have hospitals that are half empty. Private hospitals, public hospitals, doctors. They'll go to the doctor and they'll take care of it and we're going to pay the bill and they're going to be -- it's going to be perfect. They love the plan.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> So let's bring in your sons. In the break we were talking about golf. I don't know if your dad has told you about my golf experience.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Donald -- You've seen it?
<Donald Trump Jr.> <Neutral> She's been up at the club a couple times.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She hit one shot. Not bad.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Yeah, no --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is true. Should I say?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> It was really big.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Should I say?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Please.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She hit one shot, it was over a lake and it has rocks in the lake, it's this beautiful lake, and it was the worst shot that you'll ever see it, right?
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Yeah. It was horrible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it hit a rock, hit another rock, hit another rock -- It must have hit nine rocks. I've never seen it happen before and it ended up in the green. I said that's amazing. [Crosstalk]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> I planned the whole thing, okay? [Crosstalk] Exactly.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So let's talk about your dad running for president. What's the biggest misconception about your father?
<Eric Trump> <Positive> Well, he's an amazingly funny guy. I mean, he's a guy who is incredibly personal, he loves family, he's out there, he's incredibility funny. But he's also incredibly pragmatic. I mean, he's a guy who believes in cutting through red tape, stopping nonsense, getting things done. And that's real world. That's the real [Inaudible] world that we all live in, that we work in every single day.
<Eric Trump> <Positive> How do you get a project from A to B. How do you get it built. How do you get it completed. How do you do it on time. How do you do it under budget. That's really the man he is. And I always say to people, you know, what would he be best at? I think infrastructure. He would be the greatest infrastructure president. He'd be an amazing, amazing builder for this country or quite frankly, a rebuilder of this country.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> You've heard about your dad running for president for some time. He's talked about it a lot - No, but he's talked about it through the years. I mean, since 2000. Did you really think he was going to take the jump this time?0 And why do you think he's been mowing this over? What have you seen up close?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he's fed up with what's going on. He's got a great life. He's got a great job. I think it's great that he trusts us to perhaps run the business because this is something that's taking 100 percent of his time right now and it's really important for him to see the country get back on track. You have people making deals who have never made other deals ever in their lives and these are the deals that our kids and their kids behind them are going to have to live with forever and he's fed up.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's fed up of the waste, the inefficiency and frankly, the stupidity that's out there. So it's great to see him in there. It's great to see him so passionate about it. And it's great to see the people's reaction to him. They realize now on the campaign trail, he's not this corporate juggernaut kind of guy. He's a guy like them. He's an American and he's a patriot.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Have you ever seen him give a little in a conversation, like -- I'm trying to envision him working with Congress and with some difficult people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think you'd be surprised.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Really? Have you seen it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If it makes sense, he'll give. It has to make sense, though. He's not going to give if it doesn't make sense.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Did he give to you guys? Let the curfew go a little longer?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Yeah. Ever give a little? Ever give a little?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Every once in awhile.
<Eric Trump> <Positive> He was an incredible father. He made us earn it. We worked from a young age, we started very young, we learned the building blocks of our company. But he made us work and I think that's what a great father does
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> How young were you when you started to work?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was 14 working away from home. So I was living away from home during my summer vacations doing that and -- starting at the bottom. Now, of course, listen, we're the sons of a rich guy. We'll never get full credit for that. But it was so important for him for us to understand the value of a dollar. To work there, to be in the trenches so that eventually one day if we're running the company and we're doing this, we not only can tell someone what to do, but actually have done it ourselves so we know when we're getting a [Inaudible] of goods that ain't there.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> What about you? When did you start working?
<Eric Trump> <Positive> Yeah, about that, 11, 12. I literally started bulldozing walls and then we were on construction sites, we were running wire, we were laying marble. He really ingrained us with construction teams in our company and those really are the building blocks we use every day.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> So, Donald, I've talked to a lot of people that have become very successful and one of their greatest frustrations seems to be the very thing that drove them to be a success: they don't see their children because their children are too spoiled or too soft or too whatever. Your three children, everybody talks about how they're hard workers, they work right with you, and I always talk about Howard Stern because -- a kind of tough audience. He's talking about your kids, how - he said whatever you say about Donald Trump, he must be a great father because his kids are really something. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People - Howard is a great guy. People don't understand, but he is. He's actually a really nice guy and a good guy. But look, they're wonderful kids. They went to great schools and did well. They're intelligent. Ivanka, you know very well. Those are my three older children. I have five altogether. The three have been now in the business and they've done a fantastic job. They love doing it. I'm very proud of the job they're doing. Eric just got back, he's doing Turnberry in Scotland, and Don is doing 40 Wall Street and so many other things. We're building jobs all over the world, actually. You know, we have a big one going up right between the Capitol and the White House.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> [Inaudible] But how did you keep them close? How did you ingrain a worth ethic in them?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> [Inaudible] made them work.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, No. 1, I think they liked it. I mean, you know, honestly, I think they liked it. Now maybe that was a little bit of me. But if they didn't like it, I wouldn't have asked them to do it because they wouldn't be good at it. I always tell people, you know, a lot of times they see my children and I hope - knock on wood - you know, it's good. But I always said no drugs, no alcohol, no cigarette.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Well, if they're lucky --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would tell them that.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> '-- I'll teach you guys some golf moves. Okay?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We'll take it.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Donald Trump, thank you very much.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Thank you, guys. [Crosstalk]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Donald Trump, Jr., Eric, thank you as well. Great to have you all on board. Very interesting today.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> President Putin -- thank you for speaking with us. I am going to get to some specifics about the summit in a moment, but let's begin with the big picture.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> President Trump said in his news conference that our relationship has never been worse but that changed a few hours ago. How has the relationship, big picture, between the U.S. and Russia changed today?
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> Primarily, I think we should be grateful to our staff and our aides who spent several months working with one another and not just in the preparations of this summit.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> I'm referring to the effort of our agencies across the board who worked in even the very sensitive areas, sensitive both for Russia and the United States. Primarily I refer to the counterterrorism efforts.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> Today talking with President Trump, we agreed that terrorism is the greatest threat than it seems at first. Because God forbid if something happens, if there is a direct attack using the weapons of mass destruction -- if they get weapons of mass destruction -- it may have a devastating ramifications.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> So our military, our special agencies do establish cooperation in this particularly important area. A case in point would be our cooperation in Syria. Although there are some understanding missing to some extent, especially in terms of broader picture but this cooperation is going on between the military, between the special services. That is our counterterrorism effort in the general sense of the word.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> But then in 2021, the New START treaty is about to expire, so what are we going to do next? I reassured President Trump that Russia stands ready to extend this treaty, to prolong it, but we have to agree on the specifics at first because we have some questions to our American partners. We think that they are not fully compliant with the treaty, but this is for experts to decide.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> We also discuss the Iranian nuclear program. We discussed what we can do to improve the situation with North Korea. I pointed out and I will point out again that I think that President Trump contributed a lot and he did a lot to settle this issue.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> But in order to achieve complete denuclearization of the peninsula it will take international guarantees. And Russia stands ready to make its contribution to the extent what will be necessary.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> So we can say that there are several issues of crucial importance for us. Based on some others we are starting to achieve some understanding, which gives us sufficient ground to say that some things -- a lot of things change to the better during today's meeting.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> But do you see this summit as a turning point, and end of the effort by the West in recent years to isolate Russia?
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> I think you will see for yourself that this effort failed and they were never bound to succeed. I mean take a look at the scale, the sheer size of it, the importance of it in terms of international security and the economy, its contribution to the global energy market. It's too big to be sanctioned and isolated.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> Speaking of the things that do unite us though, and the things that require our joint efforts, it brings us to the idea that such attempts to fight one another should be ended and rather look for ways to address common differences -- to address common issues and challenges; how to overcome this -- how to address this common concerns.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> So I think this is the beginning of the path. This is a start. We did make a good start today.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> Mr. President -- one of the issues that is standing in the way of more progress, as you know, are the allegations of Russian interference in the U.S. election. You have repeatedly said, and you said again today that this was not the action of the Russian state, that if it was anything, it was patriotic Russian individuals.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> I have here the indictment that was presented on Friday from the special counsel Robert Mueller that says that 12 members of Russian military intelligence, the GRU, and they talk specifically about units 26, 165 and 74-455. They say -- you smile, let me finish -- they say that these units were specifically involved in hacking into Democratic Party computers, stealing information, and spreading it to the world to try to disrupt the American election.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> May I give this to you to look at, sir? Here.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> Well, let me start answering your question with something a little bit different. Let's have a look at it this way. People are talking about interference of Russia with the election process in the United States.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> I have mentioned this in 2016 and I want to say it now again and I really wish for your American listeners to listen to what I say.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> First of all, Russia as a state has never interfered with the internal affairs of the United States, let alone its elections.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> But sir, this is the indictment. It shows -- I have 12 names here. It talks about specific units of the GRU, Russian military intelligence. Is the GRU not part of the Russian state?
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> I will get to it. Just have a little bit of patience and you will get a full answer to your question.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> Interference with domestic affairs of the United States, do you really believe that someone acting from the Russian territory could have influenced the United States and influenced the choice of millions of Americans?
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> I'm not asking if they influenced -- I'm asking whether they tried.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> I'm about to answer. This was the first point that I'm trying to make.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> If you have some patience, you will hear the entire response.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> I said this in 2016 and I say it now -- the idea was about hacking an e- mail account of a Democratic candidate. Was it rigging of facts? Was it some forgery of facts? That's the important thing that I'm trying -- point that I'm trying to make. Was there any false information planted? No, it wasn't.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> These hackers that are being discussed -- I will get back to it, just bear with me for a moment. As we're getting told, they hacked a certain e-mail account and there was an information about manipulations conducted within the Democratic Party to incline the process in favor of one candidate and as far as I know the entire party leadership resigned.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> They admitted the fact of their manipulation, so that's one thing. Manipulation of the public opinion should stop and an apology should be made to the public at large -- [Crosstalk]
<Vladimir Putin> <Neutral> -- instead of looking for those responsible or the party at fault.
<Vladimir Putin> <Neutral> And now to the mentioned things -- As I said in the press conference --
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> But Mr. President, may I just say, you are indicating that they stole real money, not counterfeit money. So are you saying it's ok because of the fact that they took from the DNC, from John Podesta. It was their real e-mails, so it's ok to hack and spread this information out and interfere with the election?
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> Listen to me, please. The information that I am aware of, there's nothing false about it. Every single grain of it is true and the Democratic leadership admitted it, first point.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> Now the second point, if you don't like my answer, you can give it to me straightaway, and I'll just keep silence. And if you want Americans to listen to my opinions could you just wait for a little bit?
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> And now for the specific accusations. First of all, special counsel Mueller has accused a certain private company in Russia that is not even a very big enterprise. The core area of competence is a restaurant. And now this company hired American lawyers and defending its integrity and reputation in American court.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> So far, American court has not discovered any trace of interference whatsoever. Do you know it or not? Millions of Americans know about it.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> And now do the individuals from the indictment act. We with the United States, we have a treaty for assistance in criminal cases, an existing treaty that exists from 1999. It is still in force and it works efficiently. Today I referred an example of its sufficient work. [Crosstalk]
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> And I'm not trying to interrupt --
<Vladimir Putin> <Neutral> Why would Mr. Mueller --
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> I'm not trying to interrupt -- be disrespectful --
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> Well, let me finish. Just let me finish. You are trying to interrupt but I will finish. Why wouldn't special counsel Mueller send us an official request within the framework of this agreement? Our investigators will be acting in accordance with this treaty. They will question each individual that American partners are suspected of something.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> Why not a singular request was filed? Nobody sent us a single formal letter.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> Let me just say, I don't want to interrupt. And I want to ask one question -- I'm trying to move on to other subjects.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> Why do you think Robert Mueller issued this indictment three days before you and President Trump met here at the summit?
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> I'm not interested in this issue a single bit. It's the internal political games of the United States. Don't make the relationship between Russia and the United States -- don't hold it hostage of this internal political struggle.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> And it's quite clear to me that this is just an internal political struggle and it's nothing to be proud of for American democracy to use such dirty methods and political rivalry.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> Do you think they were -- do you think that Mr. Mueller is trying to sabotage the relationship?
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> I don't want to make any assessments about his operation. It is for Congress that appointed him to do this, to assess his performance. And I think court actually had some doubts about the due procedure about appointing special counsel Mueller to the post that he now held.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> I think that American court now believes that it was done stand with the infringement of the American legislation, but that's none of my business. Please address it to yourself.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> [Crosstalk]
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> Actually, Congress didn't appoint them. The Justice Department did.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> [Crosstalk]
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> May I move on, sir? I thought the news conference today, my opinion was a bit curious because President Trump spent more time criticizing the Democrats and asking about the Democratic server than he did in criticizing Russia and asking about the GRU.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> There are many theories in the United States about why President Trump is so reluctant to criticize you, and I would like to ask you about a couple of them. One is that you have something on him -- kompromat.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> The other is that as a skilled politician and a former KGB officer, you know how to play him. You use phrases like fake news and deep state. And my question is, do you find President Trump easy to deal with?
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> Well, the first point I'm about to make is why did we talk about like polite people? Why should this come as a surprise? Was it worth going all the way to Helsinki, going through the Atlantic to just insult one another? It's not exactly the diplomatic standard in the world.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> There's no need to go and meet personally if you just want to insult another person. We met to try to find a way for improving our relationship and not aggravating it or destroying it completely.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> The second part of the answer is whether we have something on him. We don't have anything on them and there can't be anything on them. I don't want to insult President Trump when I say this, and I may come as rude. But before he announced that he would run for presidency, he was of no interest for us.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> He was a rich person, but there is plenty rich persons in the United States. He was in the construction business. He organized the beauty pageants, but it never occurred to anyone that he would think of running for president. He never mentioned his political ambitions.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> It sounds like it's an utter nonsense. I just mentioned this in the press conference. St. Petersburg Economic Forums was visited by 500 businessmen. Pretty much every one of them is a major industrialist tycoon on a greater scale than President Trump.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> Do you think that our special services actually organize surveillance on each and every of them? Well unlike you and unlike like the United States, we don't do this. We don't have enough resources. We don't have enough manpower to organize the total state of control.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> That's not part of our plan and it's clear that we did nothing of that kind against Mr. Trump.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> I would like to ask you a couple of specific questions about NATO. If NATO were to move to add either Ukraine or Georgia to the alliance, how will you respond?
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> Well, negatively. The situation around NATO is going along those lines. I have a pretty clear understanding of how their decisions are made.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> I know about the consensus rule, but before the consensus-based decisions are made on the organization-wide basis, there is an opportunity for bilateral contacts with member states which was done with Poland, with Romania, which now station and deploy elements of the strategic anti- missile defense of the United States for us to want to direct an immediate threat for our national security.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> So according to -- moving this NATO infrastructure towards our borders would be a threat and the reaction would be extremely negative.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> Secondly, there are two major NATO exercises later this year -- Anaconda and Trident Juncture. Did you and President Trump discuss those? And did he give any indication, as he did with Chairman Kim of North Korea, where he agreed to stop participating in war games? Did he give any indication that the U.S. might not participate in these two NATO operations?
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> No. We haven't brought this issue up although it is a concern for us since NATO is expanding its infrastructure and facilities, the number of servicemen is on the rise in the regions where they shouldn't be. They increase the manpower to the tune of 10,000 people.
<Vladimir Putin> <Neutral> This is in compliance to the treaties between Russia and NATO and this is a destabilizing factor which we have to factor in, but we haven't mentioned this today with President Trump.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> I want to ask you about Russia's involvement in Syria. According to independent monitors, since the civil war began in 2011, more than a half a million people have been killed and Russia has bombed civilians in Aleppo and Ghouta. No qualm about killing innocents?
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> You know, when there is warfare going on -- and this is the worst thing that can happen for the humankind, victims are inevitable. There will always be a question who's to blame.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> I think it is the terrorist groups who are to blame, who destabilize the situation in the country -- the ISIS, the Jabhat al Nusra and the like. Those are the true culprits.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> And that's exactly the answer that American military give us when they hit military -- civilians object in Afghanistan or other countries. And it might seem dubious to some people, but in fact it is true.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> In terms of Syria, America aviation bombed the city of Raqqa, bombed quite heavily, and today we discussed the need for humanitarian operations to be put in place, and I hope we'll make progress in this area. We would really like for the plans that we discussed today to be carried into life.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> But the U.N. commission that is investigating Syria says, and I quote their words, there was deliberate targeting of civilians by Russian pilots flying SU 24 and 34 military aircraft.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> All of it can be verified and assessed, but I just want to get back Raqqa.
<Chris Wallace> <Neutral> You can't talk about Aleppo and Ghouta?
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> Well, we can discuss both, but should we also throw in Raqqa for good measure? We shouldn't take things out of the context and completely forget about others.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> I don't think that there has been the bloodshed in Raqqa that there was, the hundreds of thousands of people that were killed in Aleppo and in Ghouta and in the entire civil war, half-a-million people. By some estimates, 20,000 children have been killed by the Assad regime and his supporters in Moscow. Are they terrorists?
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> You are completely deceived and I'm very sorry that you do not know the real situation about Syria. A huge proportion of civilian population of Raqqa died. It was erased from the face of the earth. It reminds Stalingrad from the World War II, and there is nothing good about it. And I reiterate, the blame is on those individuals who take guidance from those terrorists and use the civilian population as its hostages.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> At the G-7 summit, President Trump reportedly told the other leaders that Crimea might as well be Russian because everybody there speaks Russian. Did he give you any indication that at some point, not today, but at some point he might recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea or lift sanctions, or move to bring Russia back into the G-7, now the G-8, all of which happened as a result of the annexation of Crimea?
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> First of all, I would like to make a correction. The joining of Crimea to Russia is not an annexation. In democratic governance, the free manifestation of a person's will is a referendum, and the people of Crimea went to referendum and voted for joining Russia. If this is an annexation what is democracy then?
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> Secondly, we are aware of President Trump's posture that Crimea is part of Ukraine. He told me this today. I responded with the words pretty much similar to what I said to you, and I think we should leave the discussion at that.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> All right, we are running out of time anyway. Let's move on.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> Last year, Defense Secretary Mattis said that Russia is the greatest threat, Russia is the greatest threat to the United States, and he has since made it clear, an even greater threat than terrorism.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> In March, you introduced a new generation of Russian missiles, including what you called in invincible missile you said that could evade, defeat all of our missile defenses, and you even released a video that showed the super missile flying over the United States and hitting Florida very near where President Trump's estate is at Mar-a-Lago. Aren't you escalating the arms race, and aren't you being deliberately provocative?
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> As far as the footage is concerned, they did not specify that the missile is about to hit the United States. You have to look at it more carefully. Secondly --
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> It shows Florida.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> There was not sign Florida. There was not a caption saying Florida. Take a more careful look at it. It was never a caption Florida.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> No, but you can see it on the map.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> It was clear it was flying over the eastern coast of -- no, no, no it couldn't be seen on the map. Just take a closer look. And I'm not trying to scare your population with make believe threats. I'm pretty sure I can give you as a present this footage.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> And now to the offensive weapons. They were not born out of nowhere. They were born as a response to the unilateral withdrawal of the United States from the ABM treaty. From the very beginning we've been warning our American counterparts that we aren't going to join the global antimissile system, we see no purpose for it, but we'll do everything to have means to overcome it.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> Well, the response of our counterparts was that the United States designed this antimissile defense system because it is not designed to be guided against you. In 2003 or 2004 I think I mentioned one of those systems, and there was no response from our American counterparts.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> So what we did now, we just demonstrated that we do have means to overcome the system. It's just a negotiating item. I do hope that in terms of strategic stability, we will be able to find a mutually acceptable solution for both sides, and that applies to the INF treaty under the intermediate and shorter range missiles as well.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> I have limited time. I'd like to ask you about the alleged INF violation, but I want to move on and ask you three final questions about Vladimir Putin. When you were first elected in the year 2000, you were portrayed as a democratic reformer. You talked about the value of European culture, and you did not even rule out coming apart of NATO. What happened?
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> Nothing changed about me. I am the way I am. I am the way I was. I was elected the president of the Russian Federation as an adult man. And in this age, your preferences, beliefs and attitudes towards life does not change that much, but we have to react to what's going on around us.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> Take the NATO expansion to the east. When the Soviet Union was withdrawing troops from Germany, Russians should know -- we were told that Russians should know one thing, that NATO would never extend beyond the German borders. Within two ways it happened. Despite our principal posture, nobody gave a damn about our posture.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> We didn't want the United States to withdraw from the ABM treaty, but they did despite our request not to do it. All the requests were denied. And the examples abound. Take the events in Yugoslavia. You know that President Yeltsin was completely against this conflict, and the only legal way to use the force is through the sanction of the Security Council of the United Nations.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> Examples abound, examples of events that deteriorated the status of our relationship. Or take the application of U.S. legislation extraterritorially beyond its borders. It was not us who made these steps. You asked me about Crimea, you asked me about Ukraine. It was not us who organized a military coup in the country that completely ignored the constitution.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> It was not us who given prize on the city squares. It is not the way to deal with such issues, and when it happened, it happened exactly by our border. So nothing happened to me. What happened to you is what I want to know? What happened to the west?
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> You say nothing happen to you, but I need to ask you, domestically, not internationally, domestically inside Russia, why is it that so many of the people that opposed Vladimir Putin end up dead or close to it?
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> Former Russian spy and double agent Sergei Skripal, the victim of a nerve agent attack in England. Boris Nemtsov, a political opponent, gunned down near the Kremlin. Investigative reporter Anna Politkovskaya murdered in an apartment building. Why is it that so many people who were political enemies of Vladimir Putin are attacked?
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> Well, first of all, all of us have plenty of political rivals. I'm pretty sure President Trump has plenty of political rivals.
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> But they don't end up dead.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> Not always, well, haven't presidents been killed in the United States? Have you forgotten about it? Has Kennedy been killed in Russia or in the United States? Or Mr. King? And what happens with the clashes between police and civil society of several ethnic groups? That's something that happens on the U.S. soil. All of us have our own set of domestic problems.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> But going back to what happened in Russia, yes, we do have crime, and, unfortunately, there are some crimes. And to some extent Russia's statehood is maturing. And there are some side effects, and we prosecute people responsible for these crimes.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> But since you have mentioned the Skripal case, we would like to get at least some sort of a document and evidence about it, but nobody gives it to us. It's the same thing as the accusations with meddling in the election process in America. We've recently heard that two more people suffered from the same nerve agent that is called Novichok. I have never even heard the last names of these persons. Who are they?
<Chris Wallace> <Negative> Supposedly they picked up the bottle that was used to attack Skripal. May I ask you one last question, sir?
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> No, no, let us seal this issue first. What kind of package, what kind of bottle, what is the chemical formula? Who got it? Or maybe there are other reasons, maybe reasons within the United Kingdom, but nobody wants to look into these. Now we just see the ungrounded accusations. Why is it done this way? Why our relationship should be made worse by this pretense? We have to build them with the U.K. as well.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Finally, I know one of the reasons he wanted to do this interview was so that people in the United States and the west could get a better understanding of the real man. You are often portrayed as a strong man, and autocrat, a person who is a symbol of Russia's strength. Are those fair characterizations of you, sir?
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> I'm not laying claim to be this kind of a strong man that I am being portrayed. But from the point of view of legal symbols, flag, all of them symbolize the country. And it's the same for any country. The anthem, the national flag, and the institute of the presidency, they portray Russian values and what it's ready to go for, what it's ready to stand for in order to build a relationship with such a great country as the United States.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> I've mentioned economy before and I mentioned this fact to President Trump. Let's look at our market, for instance. Europeans sell hundreds of billions of dollars worth and about 1,500 billion Euro of services. The number for China stands at $57 billion. And what about the United States? It's $12 billion for the United States and $5 billion worth for services. So that's the direct result of these policies, including the sanctions.
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> In fact the United States have driven off their companies from the Russian market, so they left, and this vacuum was filled by their rivals, their competitors. Some of them lost their investments. What was that for?
<Vladimir Putin> <Negative> We are interested in developing our relationship in the area of security, of strategic stability, economic challenges, strategic challenges, and any other challenges that we have. I think that today with President Trump we made the first step in this direction.
<Chris Wallace> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you. Thank you for talking with us.
<Vladimir Putin> <Positive> Thank you.
