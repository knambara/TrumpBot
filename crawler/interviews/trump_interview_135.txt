<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> The bailout -- what's your thought on the federal government lending money to the big three?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's very interesting, because the financial guys go down and they get these hundreds of billions of dollars. And the manufacturers having certainly a hard time -- you know, when they make them drive in a Chevy Impala, or whatever it is, and you see the head of General Motors driving for two days down from Detroit, it's pretty demeaning for him to be in that position and to be put in that position.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But certainly the model hasn't worked. It hasn't been working. A lot of people want it to work. I've watched the head of the unions -- I think he's a very impressive guy. And you listen to him, and it's 10 percent of the cost, the unions. But I notice that nothing's ever said too much about the unions, but they're attacking every other front.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think you have to try and save the companies, and I think you can easily save the companies. But I would really say, and I've used it over the years -- not personally, but I've used it for different companies -- you throw it into a chapter, you negotiate your deal, you make some new deals, you keep some deals the way they are, and you just make it better.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You make it work. And I don't understand why they've gotten away from that model. You see Tribune Company just went in, so many companies. They're going bankrupt all over the place. The country is a disaster. The world right now -- I guess they're trying to blame this country -- but the world right now is in disastrous shape financially.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I can only say it's a very interesting period of time.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Well, you talk about throwing it into bankruptcy, and you've only done professionally, not personally. But the CEOs and the companies are resisting this. What is their -- they say that their products could be tarnished. I think their products are already tarnished by their behavior. But why do you thing they are resisting this so much?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the "B" word is a bad word. It's not a word that people like, but actually it's a word that's getting used more and more. If you look at the number of bankruptcy filings, they are up higher than probably any time since 1929. But it's just something that would work. And even somebody like me -- if I have a really bad company -- you have them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You do hundreds of deals, and all of sudden you have one that doesn't work. You can use that word, and people don't look down on people if they have to use that word. And look at what happened with the airlines. I don't know how they're doing now. I know they were getting killed by fuel, and now fuel has come down somewhat.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you look at the airlines. Do you ever say you're not flying on United or you're not flying on Delta on or a certain airline because they went Chapter 11? I think I would rather buying a car than flying in something that I don't have confidence in. So it will be very interesting to see what happens --
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> But are they delusional, these CEOs? They are saying the products won't be bought, that it's terrible thing to put them in bankruptcy. Bankruptcy has worked. It's another form of restructuring. What is wrong with these CEOs that they are so resistant to this as an option?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, actually, the interesting thing is that the government can put in $25 million or $30 million or $50 million of what we call "dip financing." which would be totally secured financing. They would absolutely get it back. Without the bankruptcy, I don't know necessarily whether or not they'll ever get the money back.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I heard as of today all of a sudden they're having some problems. It looked like they weren't going to get it. Then yesterday it looked like they were absolutely going to get the money. And now it looks like there's probably a 50/50 chance one way or the other. But if the government would think in terms of what they call "dip financing," where they would absolutely get their money back, and you'd be able to renegotiate everything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And that's what they need, because they have such legacy costs, meaning costs that, you know, people that made cars 20 years ago are being paid today. How do you compete with foreign competitors when you do that? I also happen to think that the American product is very good. I bought a truck yesterday for one of my projects.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the truck is beautiful. As good as any -- they really make a good pro duct. I think part of the problem of these executives is they don't talk about the product that they make. Now, they were making the wrong product and they weren't going with the fuel-efficient things, and I think they'll do that. But it's a very difficult thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They don't like the "B" word. I think they probably should use it. I think they can make much better deals.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What do you drive?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I drive a lot of different things. But I do drive also American cars. And I have many of my vehicles. In fact, I sort of insist you buy American, generally speaking, in my company. I like when you buy American. But the Cadillac is a very good car. The Buick is a very good car. The Dodge trucks, the Dodge Ram trucks -- I bought one of them yesterday through a friend of mine, [Inaudible] in Palm Beach, Florida.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a great company.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You drive both foreign and American.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do both.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> But do you think American is a good idea to buy?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I see very little difference between the foreign, and nobody says that. but I see very little difference between the American and the foreign.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Is it fair to blame a lot of this on the CEOs as captains of the ship, because they're the figureheads? We see them driving the car, flying the corporate jets or driving the cars down to Washington. I mean, is it fair to say, look, you just -- you didn't do the job?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, first of all, two of them haven't been there very long.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> They knew what they were getting into, though.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The gentleman from Ford, who actually I met at one of my golf courses a long time ago, and he's a talented guy. He's just gotten there. He's been there a year and a half, two years.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> But that's the curious thing is that Ford, in order to hire him from Boeing, paid $12 million extra. So you're seeing shareholder money, that $12 million could do a lot, but they couldn't find some better CEO that they didn't have to pay an extra $12 million for?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they paid A-Rod a lot more than that, and they haven't done very well since they got him. The fact is the Ford gentleman is a very talented guy. I think he's doing a very good job. But you can't blame him for what took place 20, 25 years ago, because this is years and years of some mistakes. Not all mistakes, but some mistakes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now Cerberus and the gentleman who used to run Home Depot --
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Bob Nardelli.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's not there a long time either. Wagoner at General Motors, I guess he has grown up in that culture. He's been there much longer, but he hasn't been running it that long. I don't know. I can't tell you what to say other than you have three guys that are trying very, very hard.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Up next, the banks. Don't forget about them. Donald's not happy about the government using your money to bail out some failing banks. Why? Because the banks that got your taxpayer money two months ago from your government may be pulling a fast one on you. Donald will tell you. And, later, what in the world is Illinois going to do about filling that Senate seat?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> That may be easy to answer. Their governor may be charged, but he sure is not convicted. So, guess what, he could pick tonight. A full report is coming up. [Commercial Break]
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Now you go back to Trump Tower with none other than Donald Trump. Now if the big three auto CEOs were on "The Apprentice," would Donald give them the boot?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> I don't dispute their good will, that they're good men, that they try hard, that they want the best. But if they were on "The Apprentice," would they be fired?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would fire their ass. No, I am only kidding.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Would they be fired?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, if you look at the results, the results are not so good.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> So would you fire them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me. They haven't been there that long. I'd have to look at how long they've been there. Wagoner has been there quite a while. The other two really just got there. Perhaps you would fire the gentleman from Chrysler because why the hell did they buy it in the first place? That's ruined it. They spent billions of dollars to buy this company, and when they bought it, I and other people said, why are they doing this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Daimler got very lucky when they got that taken off their hands. So his bigger problem is why did they buy it in the first place, because it is a tough business. And nobody would have known we were going to go through this kind of a problem with the economy.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Let me talk just briefly about these corporate golden parachutes. Bob Nardelli, who is CEO of Chrysler, was the CEO of Home Depot, got pushed out and got handed $221 million as he left. I don't know why $15 million or $20 million wouldn't have been enough for someone that's getting pushed out, but whatever.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Your thoughts on that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I thought that was terrible. Now, I don't really know him. I spoke to him once or twice. In fact, I said you should put Trump product into your stores. He chose not to do it. Maybe that's why Home Depot didn't do as well as it should have done. But he did get pushed out, and he did walk away with over $200 million.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's ridiculous, but that's what they chose to do.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Isn't more than ridiculous, though?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In my opinion, it's more than ridiculous.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And then Chrysler --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There's a difference. If you do a great job --
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> Agreed. If you succeed --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There are some that did great jobs over the years, and I think they should become rich people, because that's really hard. But when you do a poor job and you walk away with hundreds of millions of dollars, give me a break. I read where a major bank got billions of dollars. They went out and they just bought a bank from China for $6 billion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They spent $6 billion buying a bank from China. When they gave them that money, that money was supposed to be loaned to me and other people to go out build buildings or buy apartments --
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> How about buy cars?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Or buy cars. How about you take $6 billion, a big chunk what they got and they go, and they go out the following week and buy a bank in China? I don't understand it. They're knocking the hell out of those guys because they traveled by jet. But why don't they say something about a bank that's handed billions of dollars and then they take a big chunk of it and buy a bank in China.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What good does that do us in terms of getting people working?
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> What about the Congress that gave them the money, or lent them the money to do that, without saying that you should do -- you should keep that money here at home? You shouldn't go out and buy a Chinese bank.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have a bigger problem with that.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, what about that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have a much bigger problem. The banks are not lending. You can be the richest guy -- me, anybody -- you can be the richest guy. If I want to borrow two cents -- if anybody wants to borrow money today, you can't. You can't. By the way, you make a nice salary. You can't borrow money. If you go to a bank today, the banks are closed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hundreds of billions of dollars have been given to the banks. You know what they are using it for? They're using it to buy other banks. And you know what you're going to end up in this country, one big bank. It's going to be a giant bank. We'll call it the National Bank of America. It will be one bank. You have very few banks.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You used to have many banks all over New York. Now you have a few, and most of them have practically busted anyway. But with all of this money -- to me that's a bigger problem. And also --
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Couldn't Congress have done something about that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You are talking about many times the size of $35 billion, by the way. You and I think, are on the same thing with the cars. I say they have to chapter, they have to get rid of all their bad contracts, they have to start all over. But keep the people working. They're great people. I think they're making good products.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The products are going to get better. They're going to get more environmentally friendly. All the things they that have to do- -fuel efficient. Of course with now oil going down, people start thinking about --
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> The appetite changes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Lots of bad things happen. Frankly, there should be a tax on oil. There should be a tax on oil so that it stays at a certain level, and that hundreds of billions of dollars could come in. Because the one problem -- I love seeing the oil go down and I love seeing what it does to OPEC, because it just absolutely kills them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The problem is all of the alternate energy -- all of a sudden you are not hearing about the wind and the sun --
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> The incentives changed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They stop thinking about it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Negative> Could Congress have done something about those loans to those banks so that we don't have the problem you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they should start by saying you cannot use this money to buy other banks, you cannot use this money to buy other banks in foreign countries. Excuse me. Buying other banks is bad. Buying a bank in China for $6 billion, explain that one to me.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Why did Congress do that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Inconceivable. There is no answer to it. Inconceivable. Why did the people that are running the money allow a big bank to buy another big bank from China? Explain it.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Positive> Is it because the American people don't pay that -- they're so busy trying to put food on their table they don't pay attention in some ways to what Congress is doing when it comes to things like that? It's so astounding --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What is interesting to me is, the car companies, whether you like what they're doing or not, they're trying to kill these guys with restrictions. With the bankers, for much bigger money, they don't put any restrictions on them. They almost have no restrictions. How do you go out and buy other banks instead of loaning money to people doing deals?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is -- we're supposed to get the economy going again. Now, I think it's wonderful for China. You buy a bank in China, you force some people -- the whole thing is crazy. So with the car companies, they want restrictions. With the bankers they don't. Credit is the worst it's been since 1929. You can't get credit.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's no such thing getting a loan from a bank. With hundreds of billions of dollars being put into bank, how come you can't go out? If Rupert, if anybody wants to go to a bank right now, the greatest people, the best, and they want to borrow money, zero. You can't get it. And yet hundreds of billions of dollars has been given to the banks to loan.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You explain that to me.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> This is the first time I have seen you in person since the Miami debate. Congratulations.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> You're the nominee.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I told you.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> You did. You did. I want to get your reaction to Speaker Paul Ryan endorsing you. It took him a few weeks. It's interesting. When he told me in early May that he was not ready to endorse you yet, it seemed like he was suggesting he wanted you to change your behavior in some way before he endorsed you. But I can't see any evidence that you've changed in any way, so, ultimately, did he blink?
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> Why did he...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, he didn't blink. Look, he's a good man. He wants what's best for the party. And, you know, when you get right down to it, no matter how you cut it, it's very easy to figure. In the history of the primaries, the Republican primaries, I got more votes by millions. We have still five states to go. We have California.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have New Jersey. We have Montana. We have New Mexico. We have some big states. And I'm going to win all those states by a lot. And I will tell you what. In the history of the Republican primaries, I have gotten millions of votes more than Ronald Reagan, who we all love, and Dwight D. Eisenhower. Again, you go back, and I think he sees that, and I think a lot of other people -- you know...
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> So, the winning is more important than whatever concerns he might have about you as a candidate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a party. The people voted. And that's millions of votes, when we have 17 people, don't forget. So this isn't like, you know, we had two people. Like Hillary Clinton, sometimes says, well, I got a little more votes than Donald Trump. She had one person. I had 17 people. So, I mean, I blew out everybody.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think they see that, and I think that's very important, Jake.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> Ultimately, that's the most important thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know the other thing that's really nice about that story? The Republican Party has millions of more people, like, millions of more people that voted in the primaries. I think it was because of me. I hope it was because of me. But millions of people voted in the primaries, some of whom never voted before.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> So, Hillary Clinton -- around the same time that Paul Ryan was making his announcement, Hillary Clinton was giving a speech. She had some very tough things to say about you. One of the things she said...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She wasn't giving. She was reading a speech that was written by other people, OK, but go ahead.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sound bites. [Crosstalk]
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> One of the things -- one of the things she said was: "This is not someone who should have the nuclear codes. It's not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into war because someone got under his very thin skin." What's your response to that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all, I don't have thin skin. I have very strong, very thick skin. And when somebody's right about me, I always -- if you do a report, and it's not necessarily positive, but you're right, I never complain. I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong. But I have a strong temperament, and it's a very good temperament, and it's a very in-control temperament, or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I have been able to do in life, I mean, number one bestsellers, one of the bestselling books of all time, tremendous television success.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> But I don't think anyone...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have been successful. Well, wait a minute, Jake. I have been successful in every business I have been in, if you think, real estate, one of the most successful, television, "The Apprentice," which is -- forget it. I mean, NBC came to me. They wanted to renew so badly, you have no idea. [Crosstalk]
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> But what does that have to do with temperament? You're very successful, there's no question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, it has a lot to do -- you can't -- oh, you can't have that success without good temperament. And I will say this. I was thinking about the word temperament, and we need a strong temperament in this country. We have been led by weak people, weak, ineffective people. Countries have taken advantage of us, whether it's militarily or otherwise.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have been taken advantage of by everybody. We have people with weak temperaments. I have a very strong temperament, but I have a temperament that's totally under control. And, you know -- she mentions that I will bring us into war. She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq. She raised her hand. She didn't know what the hell she was doing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She raised her hand. I said, I don't want to go into Iraq. Iraq is going to destabilize the Middle East, and I was 100 percent right.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> Can I just say one point on that? I have looked so long and hard for any evidence of you...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I will give it to you. 2004, they had newspaper articles.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> But -- but -- right, but the war started in 2003.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It did. And -- but you know what? You look at -- I did an interview with Howard. And that interview was the first time I was ever asked the question. Don't forget, I was an entrepreneur. I'm a real estate person, asked me the question.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> But didn't you -- didn't you say to Howard that you thought it was a good idea?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I -- this was before the war started, long before the war started.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it was a very like, well, I don't know. First, nobody ever asked me the question. You know, when you're doing what I did, nobody was talking about a lot of the questions that you ask me today. And I was -- I sort of said, like, well, I don't know, maybe -- I don't know. By the time that started, I was totally against it. And from 2004 on, there's a lot of proof of that, because, as you know, there was articles in magazines.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There was a lot of articles.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> Yes, a year after the war started.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, but I was against it from before it started.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> All right. But...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And if you go back and look at that interview -- and I will get it for you, if you want -- but that interview was substantially before the war started. It was the first time I was ever asked the question. And even that, it wasn't like, oh, yes, we should go in. It was a very, yes, maybe, you know?
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> The only thing I would say, and then we don't have to belabor this point, is, if there is evidence of you being against the war strongly before the war actually started, I would love to see that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, but I think there is evidence.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> I just haven't seen that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think there is evidence.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. I hadn't been asked that question before. Nobody said that to me before. I think there is evidence. I will see if I can get it.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I will say, from the beginning of 2004, I mean, I have had articles, and there are magazines. [Crosstalk]
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> 2004, no question.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK?
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> No question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I was against the war a long time ago, and it destabilized the Middle East. And that's exactly what I said was going to happen. And I also said Iran will take over Iraq, because we ruined the balance of those two militarily. We destroyed -- we knocked out one of the two balancing prongs. And Iran is taking -- as sure as you're sitting there, Iran is taking over Iraq.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're taking over the oil. They're taking over everything.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> There's no question about a lot of Shia influence in Iraq. But let's move on to something, a criticism you made of Secretary Clinton about her speech. At a rally in Sacramento, you accused her of lying about your foreign policy as it relates to expressing support for Japan being able to get nuclear weapons.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A hundred percent.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> Well, let me just read from you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A hundred percent.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> And you explain to me. This is from an April 3 interview with Chris Wallace of Fox News. You said: "North Korea has nukes, Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea." And Chris Wallace says, "With nukes?" And you say, "Including with nukes, yes, including with nukes." So...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, but what I -- here's what you don't have. Every time I have ever said anything about Japan defending themselves -- and, again, they're going to have to defend themselves with whatever they are going to have -- we right now defend Japan. Japan pays us a small fraction of the cost, a very small fraction.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want them to pay us at least the cost, because we don't have... [Crosstalk]
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> It's about 50 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's actually less than 50 percent. But a general got on and said 50 percent recently. But, even if it was 50 percent, why aren't they paying us 100 percent?
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> You want it to be 100 percent?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Of course they should pay 100 percent. You're talking about -- you're talking about billions and billions of dollars, and you're talking about worse than that. You're talking about World War III. Somebody attacks Japan, and we end up in World War III? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, by the way -- by the way, no, listen to this. If we get attacked, Japan doesn't have to defend us, OK? That's pretty bad. Whenever I talk about Japan and defense and NATO and defense and Saudi Arabia and, by the way, Germany -- a lot of people don't even -- until I got involved in this, most people didn't even know we were defending Japan and Germany.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They knew about Saudi Arabia. I mean, Saudi Arabia's got more money than anybody. Why aren't they paying us, OK?
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> We have bases. We have military bases... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. And, you know, we pay rent on those bases. We pay rent. And do you know, we pay rent in Saudi Arabia? We're defending them, and we're paying rent.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> But, anyway, my only point is...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, what I'm saying, though, Jake, is, how can this be possible? Why aren't they paying at least the cost? And don't forget, that cost, then we have tremendous backup and other things. I mean, we're providing a tremendous service. Our country is stone-cold broke. We owe $19 trillion. It's going to be $21 trillion very soon.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have Obamacare, which is a total disaster. You saw yesterday in Texas 60 percent increase with Blue Cross/Blue Shield through Obamacare, 60 percent increase. It was -- I mean, it should be a scandal, but nobody's even reporting it. It's hardly being reported. So, whenever I talk about Japan or Germany or Saudi Arabia, I always say, no, no, if they don't make us whole, they may have to defend themselves.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> And that's -- that's where the nukes would come in, if they don't make -- if they don't pay for... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's up to them. It's not up to me. It's up to them.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know what I think is going to happen? You have to be prepared to walk from a deal. You can't go in there saying -- like Hillary said, we will never let our partners down. We will never, never, never. OK, that's wonderful, except, you know what? If I'm Japan, I say good. We'll keep paying the 50 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's actually less than that. We might even keep paying -- you know, just keep paying what we're paying, which is a fraction of the cost. You have to be prepared to walk. If you aren't prepared to walk, you're never going to be able to able to -- these are very smart people we're dealing with, OK? They've been ripping us off for a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I love Japan. I have many friends in Japan.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> These are U.S. allies, I mean, major U.S. allies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's got to work two ways.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They never talk about the economics. They never talk about the cost -- big factor, big factor. They always say, Donald Trump -- so, she says, Donald Trump -- I could take that speech, and almost all of the lines, but certainly more than half, it was just written by professional people. And then she read it. I mean, you tell me. That's presidential, OK? But she read it. So much falsity in there, I mean, so many things wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I could take that speech -- and I actually will be doing it. I think I'm going to re -- I think I'm going to go to give a little retort to her speech.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> Mm-hmm.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Maybe I will do it on Monday before the election. And most of the things, many of the things that she said were absolutely wrong.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> I want to get your response to some violence we've seen outside events of yours, violence committed by people opposed to you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By thugs.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> What is your message?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By thugs.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> What is your message?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The people that burn our American flag, they're thugs.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> What is your message to these people committing these acts of violence?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would be very strong if I were the police. I think Sheriff Joe Arpaio would not have let a thing like that happen, I will tell you, because we had a potential of some violence. He walked in there, and they just split up like you have never seen.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> So, you think the police forces have -- have failed?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No, I think -- well, they didn't have too many. But I will say there's -- no, no, I'm the biggest fan. They have to be able to do their job.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> No, no, but you don't think they were aggressive enough?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think they have to be able to do their job. I think the police forces are being treated very unfairly in this country. They're afraid to do anything, because they don't want to lose their jobs. They don't want to lose their pensions. They don't want to be criticized. And people -- things are happening.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let me give you an example. We had a tremendous crowd, as you know, last night. It was a lovefest inside, no problem whatsoever. It was a lovefest. It went on for an hour. I spoke for an hour. The people were cheering and standing ovations. I mean, it was an amazing thing.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Outside, there were probably 150. Some of those people are -- they go to every rally. OK, they're -- in my opinion, they're paid agitators. But you can figure that out better than anybody. When my people walked out, they're peaceful people. Eggs were thrown in a woman's face.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> It's not acceptable. I don't...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> My people didn't start it. Eggs were thrown in somebody's face. You know, it was very interesting. Last week, I was in San Diego. I had a massive crowd, and many of them were Marines and they were Navy SEALs. They were tough, because San Diego is very much of a military area. And these people walked out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they saw what was happening, and, man, was that problem over with pretty fast.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> Let me ask you about comments you made recently.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it's very important, though, that I say the people that are causing that problem, they're not my people. They're people that are outside. They're thugs and they're agitators. They're bad people. I think they're sent by the Democrats.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> Do you have evidence of that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they have the Bernie signs. They got a lot of Bernie signs.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> So they're Bernie supporters?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they have got the Bernie signs. And they're the Bernie signs, the same people -- the same signs that they use at their rallies.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> I want to ask you about comments you made about the judge in the Trump University case.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure. Sure.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> You said that you thought it was a conflict of interest that he was the judge because he's of Mexican heritage, even though he's from Indiana.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK. Yes. Yes.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> Hillary Clinton said that that is a racist attack on a federal judge.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, she's so wonderful. You know, I mean, here's a woman that should be put in jail for what she did with her e-mails, and she's commenting on this.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> But what about the substance of the...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let me just tell you. Let me just tell you. It's very simple. I have a case where I have thousands of people have taken this course, and thousands and thousands of people have said great reviews, great reviews. Fortunately, just about everybody that took the courses have signed a review, an evaluation, they call it. And it's gotten tremendous marks, thousands.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't mean like two people. I mean thousands of people.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. I have a situation where the woman that brought the case brought the case. She's the plaintiff. She was deposed. She was found to be a disaster for them as a witness, because she gave an evaluation that was like the best evaluation you've ever heard. Wait just one second.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And she did a tape like front from your camera saying that this school was fantastic, it was fantastic. They went to the judge and they said: Your Honor, we don't want her anymore to be our plaintiff. So, we said, let's dismiss the case. That's OK. Let's dismiss the case. And he said: No, I won't dismiss the case, and she doesn't have to be the plaintiff.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let me tell you.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> But what does that have to do with his heritage?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will tell you what it has to do. I have had ruling after ruling after ruling that's been bad rulings, OK? I have been treated very unfairly. Beforehand, we had another judge. If that judge was still there, this case would have been over two years ago. Let me just tell you, I have had horrible rulings. I have been treated very unfairly by this judge.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, this judge is of Mexican heritage. I'm building a wall, OK? I'm building a wall. I'm going to do very well with the Hispanics, the Mexicans. [Crosstalk]
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> So, no Mexican judge could ever be involved in a case that involves you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, no, he is a member of a society where -- very pro- Mexico. And that's fine. It's all fine. [Crosstalk]
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> Except that you're calling into question his heritage.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think he should recuse himself.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> Because he's Latino.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Then you also say, does he know the lawyer on the other side? I mean, does he know the lawyer? And a lot of people... [Crosstalk]
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> But I am not talking about that. I'm talking about... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, that's another -- that's another problem.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> But you're invoking his race when talking about...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Here's what... [Crosstalk]
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> ... whether or not he can do his job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Jake, I'm building a wall, OK? I'm building a wall. I am trying to keep business out of Mexico. Mexico's fine. There's nothing...
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> But he's American. He's an American.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's of Mexican heritage. And he's very proud of it, as I am of where I come from, my parents.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> But he's an American. You keep talking about it's a conflict of interests because of Mexico.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Jake, Jake, Jake, are you ready? I have a case that should have been dismissed already. I have thousands of people saying, Trump University's fantastic, OK? I have a case that should have been dismissed. I have a judge that never, ever give a -- now we lose the plaintiff. He lets the plaintiff of the case out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So why isn't he canceling the case? So, we thought we won the case.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> So, you disagree with his rulings.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> I totally understand that. But you're...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not me. I have had lawyers come up to me, say, you are being treated so unfairly, it's unbelievable.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> Isn't...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know that plaintiffs in the case have all said wonderful things about the school, and they're suing? You know why they're suing? Because they want to get their money back.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> I don't really want to litigate the case of Trump University. What I...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have to because, because if he was giving me fair rulings, I wouldn't say that.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> The question is...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Jake, if he were giving me fair rulings, I wouldn't be talking to you this way. He's given me horrible rulings.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> But I don't care if you criticize him. That's fine. You can criticize every decision. What I'm saying is, if you invoke his race as a reason why he can't do his job...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think that's why he's doing it.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> But... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think that's why he's doing it.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> When Hillary Clinton says it's a racist attack...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hillary Clinton is a stiff. If Hillary Clinton becomes president... [Crosstalk]
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> But Paul Ryan today -- Paul Ryan today said he didn't care for the way that you were attacking this judge.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, I'm just telling you, Paul Ryan doesn't know the case. This is... [Crosstalk]
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> Isn't it the...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I should have won this case on summary judgment. This is not a case -- this is a case I should have won on summary judgment. Do you know the law firm paid Hillary Clinton hundreds of thousands of dollars to make speeches? Do you know the law firm has...
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> I do. And we've reported it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, you do? Oh.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> We've reported it on my show, in fact.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, good. Well, I'm glad. You're the only one.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> The only ones...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The law firm -- wait a minute. The law firm paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to Hillary Clinton for speeches.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> Before either of you were president -- were running for president.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She wasn't worth it. Everybody fell asleep during the speech, OK?
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> Before either of you were running for president, they did. But here's the -- just the fundamental question.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do you know that they have contributed tremendous amounts of money to her campaign?
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do you know that they contributed a lot of money to Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general?
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> Here's my question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. Do you know that?
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> I did not know that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do you know that these people went to every attorney general, practically, in the country that they could, and do you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general, from Texas to Florida to many of these states?
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> Is it not -- when Hillary Clinton says, this is a racist attack -- and you reject that -- if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think so at all.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> No?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. He's proud of his heritage. I -- I respect him for that.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> But you're saying he can't do his job because of that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, he's proud of his heritage. OK? I'm building a wall. Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> He's a legal citizen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics? Because I'm going to bring back jobs, and they're going to get jobs right now. They're going to get jobs. I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. But we're building a wall. He's a Mexican. We're building a wall between here and Mexico. The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment. The best lawyers -- I have spoken to so many lawyers. They said, this is not a case. This is a case that should have ended. This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now I say why. Well, I want to -- I'm building a wall, OK? And it's a wall between Mexico, not another country, and... [Crosstalk]
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> But he's not -- he's not from Mexico. He's from Indiana.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In my opinion -- he is -- his Mexican -- Mexican heritage. And he's very proud of it.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> But you're not from Scotland because you have Scottish heritage.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me. Hey, you know what? I'm not building a wall between Scotland and the United States.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> I have two more questions. I'm being told we're running out of time. I interviewed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has endorsed you. And he just wrote a book, and in the book, he talks about how he did not vote for Barry Goldwater in 1964 because Barry Goldwater voted against the Civil Rights Act.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> And he thought that that destroyed years and years of great work the Republican Party had done for civil rights, and it alienated blacks from the Republican Party for generations. He is worried that you might do the same thing for Latinos.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think so. I don't think so. Look, he's worried about a lot of things, I guess. But I don't think so. I think I'm going to do very well with Latinos or Hispanics. You know, I employee thousands of Latinos. I employ, over the years, thousands of Mexicans. They're great. They're great. I deal with them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I sell them apartments. I deal -- you know, I deal with them. And, by the way, I deal with China. I have tremendous relations, business relationships with China, including having the largest bank in the world of a tenant in one of my buildings in Manhattan.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And selling lots of condos. I get along with all these countries, by the way. And I don't blame Mexico, and I don't blame the leadership of Mexico. I don't blame the leadership of China. I blame the leadership of the United States, because they're doing stupid things. They're doing -- they're -- I don't know, are they stupid people?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I guess the answer is yes, or they have bad intentions, one or the other. But you look at what's happening to our country, and, you know, you congratulate me before on winning.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I told you I was going to win. And one of the primary reasons I felt so confident was that the people of this country are smart. And when they see the stupidity going on with the Iran deal and these trade deals -- trade deals that are just sucking the blood out of our country -- they're sucking the jobs and the money out of our country -- I felt I would win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I turned out to be right.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> Last question, a fun one for you. If you win, or, in your construct, when you win, you're going to move into the White House, yes?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Yes.
<Jake Tapper> <Neutral> Will you redecorate it Trump-style? [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I wouldn't. I would -- I just want a place -- honestly, look, it's a very special place. It's a very special building. A lot of people say I'm going to move into the hotel that I'm building two blocks away. No. The White House represents something so important.
<Jake Tapper> <Negative> So, no big Trump sign on top of the White House?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's going to be clean. It's going to be beautiful. It's going to be well-maintained. It's going to be just like it is. I'm going to be working. I'm not going to be decorating. I'm going to be working. We're going to make new deals with China, new deals with Japan, new deals with Mexico. We're going to make great deals for the country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to make the country rich again, and we're going to make our country great again.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> Mr. Trump, thanks so much for your time. I always appreciate you taking my questions.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Thank you, Jake.
<Jake Tapper> <Positive> Thank you so much.
