<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> Well, if you were looking for a little economic pick-me-up, nothing like nabbing a big bad guy, longer term. That's what my next guest says, real estate titan, Donald Trump, who joins us on the phone from California. "The Donald"" on the capture."
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> Donald, good to have you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi, Neil.
<Neil Cavuto> <Neutral> What do you make of the market's kind of tepid reaction?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think it is really insignificant, frankly, as far as the timing is concerned. It's one day. It's going to be a great thing for the markets, it's going to be a great thing, and it is a great thing, for this country and for every other country. He was a bad guy. They said they were going to take him out and they took him out.
<Neil Cavuto> <Negative> What if it this had happened today, Donald, in the middle of the trading day? What would the reaction have been then?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I think it probably would have been even more positive. But ultimately, over the next year, two years, 10 years and 20 years, this is just a great thing for the free world.
<Neil Cavuto> <Negative> What if we got ahead of ourselves, though? What if, for example, the concerns of continued attacks in Iraq do not abate, that that's still a factor with us and maybe drags on for some time?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, you have a lot of questions and a lot of people questioning the whole concept of going in, in the first place, Neil. But we are in, we went in, you had to find him. If he was alive, you had to find him. And you know, they fulfilled the pledge of finding Saddam Hussein.
<Neil Cavuto> <Neutral> If you are the president's opponents, what do you do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you have two mixed bags. I mean, you have Mr. Dean, that's going to say we shouldn't have been there regardless. And you have others that are saying, well, we are there and we have to do the best.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, we are there, regardless of what should have been done. Some people agree and some people don't agree, but we are there. And if we are there, you have to take down Saddam Hussein. And they have done that, and they did it maybe not as quickly as they thought in terms of finding him, but they found him. And that is a huge day for this country.
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> Donald, you were head of many, many business titans with whom we chat on this show, noting the economy's strength long before it became conventional wisdom. What do you say and see now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it is tougher than people thought. The war turned out to be easy, the initial phase of the war. But now we're still in the war, and it certainly is a war of attrition. It just seems to be something that, we are there now, we have to stay, we have to win, otherwise we just won't have the same respect. But we do have other problems.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, you have North Korea. They are building nuclear weapons, and, what are you going to do about that? You have to do something about, in my opinion, North Korea, and you have to do it quickly.
<Neil Cavuto> <Negative> But the economy and the underpinnings that you cited before a lot of other folks did, I mean, are you worried now, did we get too far ahead of ourselves now? The really estate market is, by some people's math, a little too hot. What do you see happening now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think very important is keep interest rates low. Mr. Greenspan has done an amazing job in keeping them low. He has to keep them low. You lose a lot of the economy if interest rates start drifting up, and they are starting. You have to keep interest rates low so the economy, real estate and other aspects of the economy continues strong.
<Neil Cavuto> <Negative> But what if he doesn't move and the market moves for him? In other words, those interest rates back up in the medium to long end, and all of a sudden we are facing a double-whammy?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Then he's going to have a problem getting reelected. It will be a very, very difficult thing. It happened to a wonderful man, his father. I mean, the economy really hurt. It was a combination of Saddam Hussein and the -- and his father, and the economy. It really hurt his father. The interest rates, Neil, have to stay low, or at least moderately low, or the economy will falter badly.
<Neil Cavuto> <Positive> All right. Donald Trump, the president of Trump Organization, out in California. Thank you, Donald. Good having you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Neil.
