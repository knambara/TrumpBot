<Philip Rucker> <Positive> Thanks for taking some time with us. We wanted to start with a couple topics in the news today. Afghanistan, three troops were killed overnight in that roadside bomb. Can you explain why 17 years later we're still there? Why are Americans still fighting there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're there because virtually every expert that I have and speak to say if we don't go there, they're going to be fighting over here. And I've heard it over and over again. We're in the process of doing some -- you know, as you know we are talking about peace over there with the Taliban, with the group of people that have a lot to do with it. They would like to see it after all these years, and we'll see what happens.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A little bit too early to say what's going to happen. But we are talking about things. But it's a very sad situation when I look -- we have incredible people, incredible fighters. But we're going to see what happens. We're going to see what happens. But it's very sad. I just heard about the three people this morning.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Terrible.
<Philip Rucker> <Neutral> Are you going to make it over there to Afghanistan?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> At the right time I will.
<Philip Rucker> <Neutral> Before Christmas, you think?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Trump speaks off the record]
<Josh Dawsey> <Negative> Last night, Mr. President, the special counsel's team charged Paul Manafort with saying, they accused him at least of saying more lies, and ended his plea deal. People around you have told me you're upset about the way he's been treated. Are you planning to do anything to help him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me go off the record because I don't want to get in the middle of the whole thing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Trump speaks off the record]
<Josh Dawsey> <Positive> Is there any version of that you're willing to give us on the record in answer to that question?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd rather not. At some point, I'll talk on the record about it. But I'd rather not.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> [Trump speaks off the record]
<Philip Rucker> <Negative> Mr. President, everyone in Washington is talking about whether there is going to be a shutdown by the end of the year and what you would do to have a deal -- what kind of terms you would set. And we're wondering, what would you accept from McConnell or offer to McConnell in order to get some border wall funding before the year is over?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We think we need it -- we don't think; we desperately need a wall. --
<Philip Rucker> <Neutral> But what would a deal look like?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that's been shown better than ever in the last short period of two weeks -- that we need a wall. I see the Democrats are going to want to do something, because they understand too. Those pictures are very bad for the Democrats. We're not having a wall because of the Democrats. We need Democrat votes to have a wall.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, if we don't get it, will I get it done another way? I might get it done another way. There are other potential ways that I can do it. You saw what we did with the military, just coming in with the barbed wire and the fencing, and various other things.
<Philip Rucker> <Negative> So it's the Democrats' fault that -- what's happening at the border over the weekend with the tear gas and the families trying to rush over?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's the Democrats' fault that we don't have a wall, because they never gave us the vote. They just wouldn't give us the vote. We almost had a deal, except when -- I mean, actually, it wasn't their fault, wasn't our fault, it was on DACA. We almost had a deal, and then the judge ruled shockingly in favor of Obama's signature, when even Obama said what he's doing is not legal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Essentially, he said, it's not going to hold up. But when the judge ruled, all of a sudden it was like, that's the end of that deal. But we were very close to having a deal -- $25 billion for a wall and various other things on the border. And DACA. And when the judge shockingly -- you know, the Democrats never thought they were going to win that, and then you had another couple of judges rule, and then you had judges rule the other way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's going to be settled I assume in the Supreme Court. But we were close to having a deal on DACA until that ruling.
<Josh Dawsey> <Negative> Is there anything specific that you would take from McConnell for -- to end this fight?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's not a question of take from McConnell. McConnell is a friend of mine. We get along great. We've had a fantastic relationship. We've had a big success. We've had a lot of success. Hopefully today we'll have another success]; we'll see happens.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I did 4'oclock, 9 o'clock and one in the middle. Based on the enthusiasm we saw there I think we're going to do very well, but we'll see. I know one thing: If she loses, I'll be blamed, and if she wins, I'll be given no credit. That's the only thing I know. But anyway, do you guys want something to drink?
<Josh Dawsey> <Positive> We're okay, thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Josh Dawsey> <Negative> You said yesterday when you were leaving that you were skeptical of a climate change report that the government had done. Can you just explain why you're skeptical of that report?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> One of the problems that a lot of people like myself -- we have very high levels of intelligence, but we're not necessarily such believers. You look at our air and our water and it's right now at a record clean. But when you look at China and you look at parts of Asia and when you look at South America, and when you look at many other places in this world, including Russia, including -- just many other places -- the air is incredibly dirty.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And when you're talking about an atmosphere, oceans are very small. And it blows over and it sails over. I mean, we take thousands of tons of garbage off our beaches all the time that comes over from Asia. It just flows right down the Pacific, it flows, and we say where does this come from. And it takes many people to start off with.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Number two, if you go back and if you look at articles, they talked about global freezing, they talked about at some point the planets could have freeze to death, then it's going to die of heat exhaustion. There is movement in the atmosphere. There's no question. As to whether or not it's man-made and whether or not the effects that you're talking about are there, I don't see it -- not nearly like it is. Do we want clean water?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely. Do we want clean air to breathe? Absolutely. The fire in California, where I was, if you looked at the floor, the floor of the fire they have trees that were fallen, they did no forest management, no forest maintenance, and you can light -- you can take a match like this and light a tree trunk when that thing is laying there for more than 14 or 15 months.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it's a massive problem in California.
<Josh Dawsey> <Negative> So you're saying you don't see the --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Josh, you go to other places where they have denser trees -- it's more dense, where the trees are more flammable -- they don't have forest fires like this, because they maintain. And it was very interesting, I was watching the firemen and they're raking brush -- you know the tumbleweed and brush and all this stuff that's growing underneath.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's on fire and they're raking it working so hard, and they're raking all this stuff. If that was raked in the beginning, there'd be nothing to catch on fire. It's very interesting to see. A lot of the trees, they took tremendous burn at the bottom, but they didn't catch on fire. The bottom is all burned but they didn't catch on fire because they sucked the water, they're wet.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You need forest management, and they don't have it.
<Philip Rucker> <Neutral> Mr. President, there's a lot of economic news, too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, we've got a lot of news there.
<Philip Rucker> <Negative> The gains from the past year in the stock market, many of them, there's been a correction. GM is closing some of its plants, laying off a lot of their workers. You said when you campaigned in Michigan that none of the plants would close and now one of them will. --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no, but we have plants moving in, too. We do.
<Philip Rucker> <Negative> -- So what are you going to do about this, and are you nervous about a recession occurring?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm not because what I'm doing is I'm doing trade deals. The trade deals take a little time. The fact is I think -- I disagree with the Fed. I've been open about that. I think the Fed is a much bigger problem than China. I think that China wants to make a deal very badly. I think we'll either make a deal or we'll be taking in billions and billions of dollars a month in tariffs and I'm okay with either one of those two situations.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I can tell you that China wants to make a deal. I can tell you that other countries want to make deals because they know that I'm not playing around. The USMCA was a very well-received deal. That got done and a lot of people said it wouldn't get done. We're making great trade deals. We lose $800 billion a year with trade.
<Philip Rucker> <Negative> So who should be held responsible? You mentioned the Fed, but when Harry Truman sat here he had that sign that said the buck stops here. --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I'm not blaming anybody.
<Philip Rucker> <Negative> -- But Mr. President, it doesn't seem to stop with you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm not blaming -- look, I took recommendations. I'm not blaming anybody. But I will tell you, at this moment in time I am not at all happy with the Fed. I am not at all happy with my choice. I think we have to let it go. You know, if you look at -- China is being accommodative. The Euro and Europe is being accommodative.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're not getting any accommodation, and we're also paying $50 billion, we're paying down our liquidity, is -- you can make the case it's a positive thing in one way, but another thing it snaps your liquidity. So I'm doing deals and I'm not being accommodated by the Fed. I'm not happy with the Fed. They're making a mistake because I have a gut, and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me.
<Philip Rucker> <Neutral> But you're the president, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm not blaming anybody.
<Philip Rucker> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm just saying, I'm not happy with the Fed. So far, I'm not even a little bit happy with my selection of Jay. Not even a little bit.
<Josh Dawsey> <Neutral> Mr. President, you're --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm not blaming anybody, but I'm just telling you I think that the Fed is way off-base with what they're doing, number one. Number two, a positive note, we're doing very well on trade, we're doing very well -- our companies are very strong. Don't forget we're still up from when I came in 38 percent or something.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, it's a tremendous -- it's not like we're up -- and we're much stronger. And we're much more liquid. And the banks are now much more liquid during my tenure. And I'm not doing -- I'm not playing by the same rules as Obama. Obama had zero interest to worry about; we're paying interest, a lot of interest.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He wasn't paying down -- we're talking about $50 billion lots of different times, paying down and knocking out liquidity. Well, Obama didn't do that. And just so you understand, I'm playing a normalization economy whereas he's playing a free economy. It's easy to make money when you're paying no interest.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's easy to make money when you're not doing any pay-downs, so you can't -- and despite that, the numbers we have are phenomenal numbers.
<Josh Dawsey> <Negative> Mr. President, your national security team is going to the Hill tomorrow to brief senators on Saudi Arabia and Jamal Khashoggi. I've heard from Senator Graham, who I know you were with yesterday, and others, that they want stronger punishment on Saudi Arabia, tougher sanctions. Do you want them to impose that or do you think that would be deleterious to our —?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm going to listen to what they say. They're all friends of mine and I get along with them great. I'm going to certainly listen to what they have to say, Josh. In the end, though, they're spending massive amounts of billions of dollars. If you look at Iran and what they do, and you look at many other countries -- I don't have to embarrass other countries by saying it -- if you look at what they do, it's a rough part of the world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a dangerous, rough part of the world. But they've been a great ally. Without them, Israel would be in a lot more trouble. We need to have a counterbalance to Iran. I know him. I know him well, the Crown Prince. And, by the way, never did business with them, never intend to do business with them. I couldn't care less.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is a very important job that I'm doing right now. The last thing I care about is doing business with people. I only do business for us. Somebody said, well, maybe they're an investor in one of his jobs. The answer is no. But I just feel that it's very, very important to maintain that relationship. It's very important to have Saudi Arabia as an ally, if we're going to stay in that part of the world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, are we going to stay in that part of the world? One reason to is Israel. Oil is becoming less and less of a reason because we're producing more oil now than we've ever produced. So, you know, all of a sudden it gets to a point where you don't have to stay there.
<Philip Rucker> <Negative> Sir, do you hope to meet with the Crown Prince when you're in Argentina at the G-20 later this week?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's not scheduled, but I certainly would. But it is not scheduled.
<Philip Rucker> <Negative> And why have you taken his denials for ordering the killing of our colleague, Jamal Khashoggi --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I haven't taken anything.
<Philip Rucker> <Positive> -- over the evidence that the intelligence community has gathered?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Phil, I haven't done that. If you look at my statement, it's maybe he did and maybe he didn't. But he denies it. And people around him deny it. And the CIA did not say affirmatively he did it, either, by the way. I'm not saying that they're saying he didn't do it, but they didn't say it affirmatively. I'm saying this: We have $52-a-barrel oil right now and I called them about three months ago, before this whole thing happened with Khashoggi, and I let him have it about oil.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We were up to $82 -- probably two and a half months ago -- we were up to $82 a barrel and it was going up to $100 and that would've been like a massive tax increase and I didn't want that. And I called them and they let the oil start flowing and we're at $52. In fact, now I'm being blamed for traffic jams.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This was the greatest. Actually in the Palm Beach Post, they had a thing that I'm causing traffic jams because they have the --
<Josh Dawsey> <Positive> I wondered what paper that was. I saw you tweeted that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's the Palm Beach Post.
<Sarah Sanders> <Neutral> Guys, we have just maybe one more question.
<Philip Rucker> <Positive> Sir, you just said, maybe he did, maybe he didn't, but are you getting the best advice and the best information from the intelligence community and on the climate issue from your experts in the government, because you're doubting what they're saying?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Phil, I'm getting advice. I'm the president of this country. I have to do what's the best for our country. We have a very important ally in Saudi Arabia. We have an ally that has tremendous oil reserves, which are -- frankly they can make prices go up and down, and I want to keep them down. We have an ally that's investing billions and billions of dollars in our country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They could very easily invest $110 billion, $450 billion overall over a period of time, fairly short period of time. $110 billion in military. Russia and China would love to have those orders and they'll get them if we don't. They'll have no choice, but they'll get them if we don't. So I take everything into consideration, and again, he totally denies it, and he denied it to me on three different occasions, on three different calls, and a lot of other people deny it, too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Did he do it? As I said, maybe he did and maybe he didn't, but in the meantime Saudi Arabia's spending billions and billions of dollars in the United States, and I want them to spend it here. I don't want them to spend it in China and Russia.
<Josh Dawsey> <Positive> You're scheduled to meet again with Vladimir Putin at the G-20. Do you think he was within his rights to challenge the Ukrainian ships? Do you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am getting a report on that tonight, and that will determine what happens at the meeting. I'm getting a full report on that tonight. That will be very determinative. Maybe I won't have the meeting. Maybe I won't even have the meeting. We're going to see. But depending on what comes out tonight, we should have a pretty good indication on exactly what happened tonight at about 6 o'clock.
<Philip Rucker> <Negative> Should that aggression concern people here?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't like that aggression. I don't like that aggression at all. Absolutely. And by the way, Europe shouldn't like that aggression. And Germany shouldn't like that aggression. You know they're paying 1 percent, and they're supposed to be paying much more than 1 percent.
<Philip Rucker> <Negative> So are they not doing enough?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're absolutely not doing enough. Germany? Absolutely not. Many of those countries are not doing enough toward NATO. They should be spending much more money.
<Philip Rucker> <Positive> I know we're short on time, but we would just love to get your thoughts on the Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker over at the Justice Department.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a fine person.
<Philip Rucker> <Neutral> Has he been fully briefed on the Mueller investigation, the status of that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That I don't know.
<Philip Rucker> <Neutral> And has he talked to you about it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can tell you that Matt Whitaker is a respected man. He's doing an excellent job. We're looking at possible attorney generals right now. And within -- I will tell you, within the Justice Department he is a highly respected person, and he's doing a very good job. I also think he's a very good person. I think he's a very good person.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he had a reputation for being, I think he was six years in Iowa as the U.S. attorney. He had a reputation for being very strong, very smart, very good.
<Josh Dawsey> <Neutral> Has he talked to you about the Mueller investigation at all?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We don't talk very much. I mean, I haven't spoken to Matt very much. I put him there. But we speak really very little. The Mueller investigation is what it is. It just goes on and on and on.
<Philip Rucker> <Positive> Would you commit right here to letting Mueller continue his work until the investigation concludes?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This question has been asked about me now for --
<Kellyanne Conway> <Negative> A thousand times.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- almost two years. And in the meantime, he's still there. He wouldn't have to be, but he's still there, so I have no intention of doing anything.
<Sarah Sanders> <Positive> Alright. Thanks, guys.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay? Thank you, fellas.
<Charlayne Hunter-Gault> <Positive> Yesterday the United States Football League filed a $7 million breach-of-contract suit against ABC. The league charged that the network reneged on its agreement to pay in full for the rights to televise the games this season.
<Charlayne Hunter-Gault> <Negative> ABC had no comment on the suit, but the network reportedly was trying to renegotiate a lower fee because the league failed to keep its promise to maintain teams in seven of the top 10 television markets. This was just the latest problem in what has been a troubled season for the USFL. Special correspondent Mike Lupica has this report.
<Mike Lupica> <Positive> It seemed perfect three years ago. A spring marriage born of love and money, something that really belonged on one of those prime-time soaps like Dynasty or Dallas. Americans love football. Rich Americans love to own football teams. And the union of this love and all that money was called the United States Football League.
<Mike Lupica> <Negative> [Voiceover] Now in its third season, the USFL is beset by problems. Declining television ratings and ABC's withholding of payments are just two of them. Several teams, like the L.A. Express, are on the brink of financial collapse, while the league as a whole has lost almost $100 million.
<Mike Lupica> <Negative> [Voiceover] Since last season the USFL has shrunk from 18 to 14 teams, losing franchises in several key cities. In a dramatic effort to save itself, the USFL is giving up on its founding notion that what this country really needed was spring football.
<Harry Usher> <Positive> I'd like to run through what happened at the owners' meeting today.
<Mike Lupica> <Neutral> [Voiceover] At the end of April, Commissioner Harry Usher announced to the press the final decision of the USFL owners.
<Harry Usher> <Neutral> All teams, with the exception of two, reaffirmed the decision for the USFL to go to the fall in 1986.
<Mike Lupica> <Negative> [Voiceover] As a consequence of this vote, the league will not be playing next spring, waiting until fall 1986 for its sports season.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I believe in going to the fall because the fall is first class, the fall is when you're supposed to play football.
<Mike Lupica> <Positive> [Voiceover] The point man all along for a move to fall play has been Donald Trump, owner of the New Jersey Generals and one of the country's leading real estate developers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In the spring you have a wall. You have a wall of people that really won't watch football in the spring, and I really believe that, because I would have been one of them.
<Mike Lupica> <Positive> [Voiceover] Besides favoring fall football, Trump has turned one other USFL principle on its head: the concept that players' salaries should be kept low. He brought what's being called Trumpball to the USFL, bankrolling box office stars like quarterback Doug Flutie and running back Herschel Walker. Both are Heisman Trophy winners, and both make more than a million dollars a year.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, my theory -- and it's obviously been a proven theory over thousands of years -- you need stars. Nothing better than signing low-priced players and having a lot of fun. But nobody's going to come and watch them. That's all there is to it.
<Mike Lupica> <Positive> [Voiceover] Other owners have taken their cue from Trump, bankrolling high-priced players like quarterback Steve Young and Jim Kelly and running back Mike Rozier. But with all these young stars, the owners soon realized they would have to increase their television revenues to pay for them.
<Mike Lupica> <Negative> [Voiceover] Since more people watch television in the fall, it made sense to most of the owners to switch from a spring to a fall schedule. But one owner, John Bassett of the Tampa Bay Bandits, is vehemently opposed to fall play and Trump's superstar, megabuck payroll philosophy.
<John Bassett> <Neutral> I don't think Donald Trump knows anything about football. He knows about selling tickets and marketing and going after big names, but he knows less about football than almost anybody in our league.
<Mike Lupica> <Positive> [Voiceover] The rift between Bassett and Trump, friends once, has become a painful symbol of the USFL's problems.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to listen to somebody whose opinions -- I mean, I think I've done slightly better than John Bassett over the course of the last 10 years in everything else, okay? So I'm not going to sit back and listen to somebody else, and you know, that's just the way it is.
<John Bassett> <Negative> That's just nonsense, but that's the way Donald is, that's the way he thinks. He's a very simplistic fellow, and if he proves to be wrong on the fall issue, I think that it's going to really severely hurt his psyche. If he's right, well, then he's right. I tend to think that he's going to be wrong.
<Mike Lupica> <Positive> [Voiceover] As a consequence, Bassett has decided to leave the USFL after this season. He is putting together yet another league which will play next spring.
<Mike Lupica> <Negative> While Bassett may be a lone voice in the USFL wilderness, he is not entirely alone, not by a long shot. ABC has shown their total lack of enthusiasm for the spring-fall switch by refusing to carry the league's games next season. After exhaustive negotiations with the other networks, the USFL came up empty.
<Mike Lupica> <Negative> [Voiceover] Even all-sports cable network ESPN, which will be carrying the USFL's 1986 season, has doubts. Bill Grimes is ESPN's president.
<William Grimes> <Positive> We believe, because there is so much football in the fall, with college football, college football games on CBS, ABC, ESPN and Turner Broadcasting, and professional football on all three networks during the fall, we feel that the difficulty in attracting advertisers to the United States Football League will be much greater next fall than it would have been next spring.
<Mike Lupica> <Negative> [Voiceover] But the USFL is blaming the NFL, not its own low ratings, for the fact that neither the networks nor advertisers are embracing the switch to the fall. As a result the USFL is bringing a $1.3 billion antitrust suit against the National Football League.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We believe that the NFL is a total monopoly. We believe that they've monopolized the markets and the networks. We don't believe that they will be allowed to stay on all three networks.
<Harry Usher> <Negative> The fact that the NFL has used its monopolistic position, which was granted to them by Congress through the exemptions to the antitrust law, and they've moved those antitrust laws' exemptions beyond anything comprehended by Congress, and in effect, tied up all the means of commerce with contracts for the past 15 years with ABC, CBS and NBC. That we want stopped.
<Mike Lupica> <Negative> [Voiceover] The NFL calls the suit baseless. But one longtime television sports observer thinks the league has a good case.
<Howard Cosell> <Negative> Although you don't read it that way in the papers, I know that the National Football League takes that suit very, very seriously, despite every effort to publicly pooh-pooh it. And if one were party to certain NFL owners' meetings, one would know how much they're afraid of that lawsuit.
<Mike Lupica> <Positive> [Voiceover] But John Bassett thinks the league is placing too much faith in the lawsuit.
<John Bassett> <Negative> I think that they're basing an inordinate amount of their hope on winning a lawsuit against the National Football League. I'm a Canadian, not an American, and we don't sue as much in Canada as you do in the States, so I nd that kind of a thin premise to operate a business on.
<Mike Lupica> <Neutral> [Voiceover]
<Don Imus> <Negative> 5:25 [Inaudible]. Here on the Imus, in the morning program on the radio.
<Don Imus> <Positive> [Inaudible] actually all over the world. Armed forces radio and all that. Please welcome, now to the program, the next president of the United States, Donald Trump. Good morning, Mr. Trump
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that sounds good to me. I could tell you.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi, Don.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> How are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good.
<Don Imus> <Negative> So a lot of people including me didn't think they ever do this. You filed the papers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I filed the papers, a lot of people said, oh, he'll never do it. Why would he do it? He leads this wonderful life. I love what I'm doing. I always talk about, I tell people you have to love what you do and I love running my company.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I built a great, great company. You've been watching me over the years right over a long time and it's an amazing company as people have now seen because I'm private so nobody even knows and I filed the papers and I'm on my way and I guess you saw the polls are coming out very good. You know once people saw that I was really running which I am, the polls are very, very good. So you know we have a...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> it's a long track, it's a long haul but we're going to make the country great again, the country's going to hell. I mean it's going bad and it's going bad fast and it can, it's just can't continue to be this way, Don, we owe soon $19 trillion, when it's 24 trillion, we become a large scale version of Greece.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Bernard, remember the poll, the polls was Jeb Bush one, Trump two.
<Bernard> <Neutral> That's right Jeb Bush, 15%. Donald Trump coming in second at 11% nationally, among Republican primary voters.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, and they had a poll in New Hampshire that was similar to that, and it's amazing. You know, I go places, I get tremendous crowds. You've been, you guys have been so supportive. I mean it's been amazing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Your show and you have been so tremendous. So I appreciate that. Now, we've had a long term relationship. Okay, so that always helps.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know me well, but you guys have been fantastic and I appreciate it.
<Don Imus> <Positive> The reason we've been fantastic because we would vote for you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know, and I appreciate it.
<Don Imus> <Positive> So in my view the... that nothing that anybody asked me. But the trick is the trust going to be for you to get the nomination because I think if you get the nomination you could easily win the election. Well, how do you go about getting the nomination?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all, Hillary's got a lot of problems and I agree with you, I think it's not going to be as strong as they think. And if you look at her sort of quavering right now with this character Bernie Sanders, that's a pretty wild wood on that side. And on my side you know you have a lot of people and I'm very different from them, I've created jobs all my life. I don't debate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I create jobs. I've built great buildings all over the world. I'm building one right now in Pennsylvania Avenue the Old Post Office site, building an incredible hotel best location in Washington D.C., just finished Doral in Miami. I mean I've done a great job with this stuff and I've created tens of thousands of jobs over my life and I built virtually a city on the West Side of Manhattan and many, many buildings in Manhattan.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're all over so, you know, that's what I do. I create jobs, I have common sense. I make money.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Well, I understand that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, and this country has to be run that way.
<Don Imus> <Neutral> But how do you get the nomination, that's the question?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think by saying what I said and also by saying that you know politicians they're all talk and no action nothing ever gets done. The country goes to hell. They don't even know it. They don't even know what's happening.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean frankly and the ones that do they're controlled by lobbyists and political people and donors and special interests. You know if something has to be right and they know what's right and then the lobbyist said, well, you know these guys contributed to us and you have to help them. You can't do this. So the politician does the wrong thing because they would give it a campaign contribution which I don't need.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm not using any contributions. So you know, it's been an amazing thing to watch and people see that and they see the message down. I go up to New Hampshire and Iowa, and I make speeches. I get the biggest crowds, I get the biggest ovation, standing ovations.
<Don Imus> <Positive> I'm sure you do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm talking just common sense. I'm talking, you know, we have to have a border which is very important. I have a great relationship with Mexico, and I love the Mexican people a great spirit. But we have to have a border and if we don't have a border we don't have a country and you know we have people flowing in...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> not Mexicans, we have people from all over the world, just in South America obviously just flowing into our country, and we don't know who the hell they are, and where they're coming from and we know nothing.
<Don Imus> <Negative> That sounded when you do your major announcement at least to me it sounded a little harsh their characterization of all the Mexicans coming in those countries. Do you regret that or would you want to rephrase that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't regret it. But perhaps you're right because some other people have said that to me and certainly wasn't meant to be that way. I mean I have a great relationship with... we have, I own the Miss Universe contest.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We've had it in Mexico. We've had the winner of the contest which I don't choose but the winner of the contest a few years ago was from Mexico. She's fantastic. An amazing person and she's done really well and you know I like the Mexican people.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean the problem we have with Mexico is that their leaders are much smarter than our leaders and they're eating our lunch. They're taking our jobs, they're building car factories all over Mexico. They took one from Tennessee. Ford just announced they're spending 2.5 billion to build a car factory in Mexico.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And guess what, the parts are coming into the United States. What they're building is coming into the United States. We're not charging tax, we get nothing, other than we lose more jobs.
<Don Imus> <Negative> [Inaudible] talking with Donald Trump is running for the presidency of the United States. So also you get the nomination. I know you said you wanted Oprah Winfrey to run, but it's unlikely.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I always said that jokingly, you know, George Stephanopoulos asked me that question and he said would you like Oprah Winfrey. And she's a friend of mine, she's a great person and I said, oh, absolutely jokingly. And then all over the world saying Trump and Oprah you know, I mean give me a break. We're very different in terms of probably our thoughts.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't even know her political thoughts, frankly. But certainly, she's friendly with Obama. So that's not a good sign.
<Don Imus> <Positive> The point I was going to make or trying to make is that a lot of times when somebody gets announce, and some of these, as an example of Jack Kennedy. They pick somebody who they may not like and in the case of Lyndon Johnson, he hated Lyndon Johnson, but they pick somebody who they think can help them get elected. And so my question for you is, is there anybody running on the Republican ticket who's announced now. Well, once you got the nomination who you think would be a worthy vice presidential candidate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know I know some of them, I don't know all of them, so it's a little premature and it's even a little premature to start thinking in terms of vice president, Don. But you know, you do want to pick somebody that's going to help you. And you know frankly I like Paul Ryan very much. But when when Romney picked him, all I think about with Ryan is cutting entitlements.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was a disastrous pick. He's a wonderful young guy but it was a disastrous pick in terms of getting elected. He should have picked somebody maybe from Florida, maybe from Ohio, you know somebody that could have helped. You know what happened to Romney was very sad because he choked them in the last month of the election, it's like he didn't exist.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Something happened to him, he went away. I don't know. You know, I saw Obama on Jay Leno and he was doing all the shows. He was he was doing Letterman, he was doing every show.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said, why aren't you out doing shows. He was sitting around doing nothing. I don't know. He just joked.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, it's no different than a golfer, can sink a three-foot putt on the 18th hole, which unfortunately we just saw something happen like that, but last week in the U.S. open.
<Don Imus> <Negative> Four-foot putt miss, miss [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he's a such a nice guy. That was a very sad thing actually to watch that, it was to me very sad because...
<Don Imus> <Positive> [Inaudible], talking with Donald Trump who actually is running for the presidency. A lot of comics and late night, talk show host thinks this is amusing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, not so much anymore, since the polls came out. They're not thinking it is so amusing anymore. First of all, they thought I was never going to run. They thought I was just doing it for fun.
<Don Imus> <Negative> I don't think you're going to run.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You what?
<Don Imus> <Negative> I didn't think you're going to run.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know you didn't, you were telling everybody, he'll never run, he'll never run but I love Trump. But if he runs I'm voting for him. You would say that, right?
<Don Imus> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But then I sort of always appreciate it and I was saying, well, I don't like the first part but I like the second part. No, we have to do something, Don, we have to... you know, I... my theme is make our country great again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have to make our country great again. And it's, you know, essentially we're just not doing that. We can't do it. We're being drawn by every single country in the world China is just eating our lunch.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know just killing us. Japan is back. Japan is just devalued the yen, it's a possible, very hard for our companies to compete. Komatsu tractor's is really hurting Caterpillar and not because it make better equipment which they don't, but because you know, you could buy so much cheaper because they devalued the yen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's really an unfair playing advantage and Obama doesn't even understand, he has no clue. I mean, we have a president that doesn't have a clue. You know, we protect Saudi Arabia. They make a billion dollars a day.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They fly around in planes that I hate to say it. You know, very substantial planes. He said, these are planes that make me look small potatoes. But they fly around in planes and they have...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> you never saw people living like this. They make a billion dollars a day. We protect them. Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They wouldn't be there and we don't ask them for anything. We ask them for nothing. Saudi Arabia, I have nothing in Saudi Arabia. I do a lot of business with Saudi Arabia, I think they're great, they're wonderful, they buy my apartments, and they pay me a fortune.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I made a fortune on Saudi Arabia. But they make a billion a day and I talk to the people, some of the richest people in Saudi Arabia. I see them all the time. I say, what do you think, they said, we can't believe we can get away with it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They can't even believe it. There's nobody to ask them. Look at the deal making with Iran, it's a joke. I mean we have a bunch of jokers in there that don't know anything about negotiation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Iran is absolutely... they're laughing at us and they're laughing at us.
<Don Imus> <Negative> Well, here they are, so. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Honestly, Don, we have stupid people at the top and they don't know what they're doing. And our country is not going to be a country pretty soon if we keep going. So that's basically my message. And then I come out way up high in the polls and everyone's saying, oh wow, how did that happen? How did that happen? What happened, because I'm the only one that can deliver that message? Politicians can't say it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they protect each other. It's not going after Hillary Clinton on the emails. She gets a subpoena from Congress and then she deletes all her e-mails and nobody says anything. You remember the famous Rosemary Woods with Nixon with the 18 minutes of tape, just a done.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They destroyed her life. Here's a woman wiped out five years or six years' worth of e-mails and nothing happens and the Republicans don't even go after.
<Don Imus> <Positive> So unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Some people hear this and I guess they agree with what I'm saying.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Well, I'm not stupid. My wife's not stupid. Bernard's not stupid or a lot of the people who are not stupid are going to vote for you, so if people are suggesting that, that's not going to work. The Supreme Court on Monday is going to rule on gay marriage and Obamacare will probably sustain Obamacare.
<Don Imus> <Negative> Where are you on gay marriage?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, first of all the Obamacare in theory they should totally knock it out because you know but, but Bush put somebody in that as you know Justice Roberts who was shocking because the last time he essentially approved Obamacare and that was a Bush appointee that did it. And that was a shocking and he'll probably do it again because he wants to be loved on the beltway and you know and the decision on gay, I'm traditional marriage but the decision on gay marriage is going to be a very interesting one. Will they go all the way and will they say you know what you're going to legalize, you know the relationship situation for anybody that wants it and you know that could happen. A lot of people think it's going to go back to the states.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody knows how they're going to rule. I guess it's coming out over the next week. Nobody's exactly sure what is coming up, but those are two very big rulings.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Well, they'll announce on Monday.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, they've said that they've announced that.
<Don Imus> <Negative> So you do not support gay marriage?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm traditional marriage.
<Don Imus> <Negative> What do we care whether people get married or not? What sex they are, I mean.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will say this, that's a subject you know if you look at pro-life and it's actually as an example pro-life is actually... I'm talking polls now, it's actually gone up. But the gay marriage has really changed in terms of you know people and then the popularity of gay marriage. It's really changed and you have actually now a lot of Republicans are actually coming out of favor.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am traditional marriage but you do have... that's a very evolving situation and a lot of changes are being made, that a lot of people are changing their mind in that situation.
<Don Imus> <Positive> There's a lot of people wants to be happy, you know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, I understand. I mean, I fully understand it.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Well, man I hope you get the nomination because if you get the nomination you are in. I mean it's done, it's a done deal.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's a long track meet and we will be in there fighting one thing you know, we don't quit, Don. We don't quit.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Well, I do know that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We don't quit and I don't quit. And we've known that about each other for a long time, so I'm very proud of you. I'm very happy for you, Don.
<Don Imus> <Positive> Thanks. Donald Trump, here on the Imus in the morning program. Hopefully the next president of the Unites States. I'm serious about...
<Don Imus> <Negative> you know I'm serious, as a heart attack. Trump [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hello Sharyl.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Positive> Hello Mr. President. Today on Full Measure, our interview with President Trump, on a week when tax reform was a hot topic. Who is it that's fighting for a piece of this tax reform, maybe fighting against the interests of ordinary Americans?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> the Swamp Sharyl. It's the swamp
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Positive> But we also wanted to ask him about Russia. Have you been told to expect to be questioned by the special counsel?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no nobody's told me.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> And we asked about terrorism. Do you think Americans are safer than they were a year ago, two years ago?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think we are.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> And about the biggest threat facing America. On North Korea, In a recent poll, 50 percent of Americans said it's somewhat likely that North Korea will use a nuclear weapon to attack North America. Do you agree?
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Positive> Hello, I'm Sharyl Attkisson. Welcome to Full Measure. This week President Trump agreed to speak with us about a topic front and center in the lives of many Americans: taxes. Republicans just unveiled their new plan to update and simplify the U.S. tax code. But we also had questions on other topics. On immigration and terrorism.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> On Russia, nobody admitted it during the campaign that we now know it was the Hillary Clinton campaign that funded that so-called dossier that had all the negative information that's unproven about you apparently in an attempt to affect the election. It was given to the FBI. What do you make of that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I think it's terrible I think it's despicable the amount of money that I hear being thrown around is ridiculous. Somebody said that this guy Steele that wrote it and we'll figure that out eventually that he paid money to the Russians. And frankly, if that was, in fact, Russia involved they don't like me very much just the opposite of what people were saying. And you know I have said over the last period of time the last person they want is me because I want a strong, strong military which I've proven in many ways and that was part of my campaign.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I also want lower oil prices and lots of oil which is not good for Russia. So I would think I would be the last one. But when you look at that horrible dossier which is a total phony fake deal like so much of the news that I read when you look at that and take a look at what's gone on with that and the kind of money we're talking about it is a disgrace.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Neutral> The origins of the dossier supposedly is conservative funding. What does that tell you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I heard the other day that it might be and then I heard that basically they started something but the Democrats really took it up and started it and then the question is did the FBI get involved with it. And did the FBI use it? Because if they did that's a real problem for them. So we'll find out. But I have a feeling that the Democrats started it I'm sure the conservatives started something else but it was a much more mellow situation and they did say they didn't hire Steele and the phony people that worked on it.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Positive> Do you think Mueller is doing a good job?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we're going to see. Look all I can say is that I have nothing to do with Russian collusion nothing whatsoever and everybody knows it and nobody really has even been able to find you know with all of these committee meetings. They walk out even the other side they say well there's been no collusion yet but we continue to look. I've been watching this for how long has it been a year? It's very unfair.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's very bad for our country. But with all of the work that the Democrats are trying to do to obstruct and to you know false charges every time I see them walking out they're saying even Dianne Feinstein that no collusion and I respect her for saying it. I'll be honest with no collusion. But there are at these meetings and they go through documents and there is no collusion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Russia wouldn't help me. And I think the last one Russia would want to be president is me because of my attitude on oil and because of my attitude on the military and strength.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Neutral> Do you think you would ever consider trying to have Mueller removed are you planning to stay out of that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I hope he's treating everything fairly and if he is I'm going to be very happy because when you talk about innocent I am truly not involved in any form of collusion with Russia. Believe me. But the last thing I can think of to be involved in.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Positive> Who wasn't you remember who convinced you to take Paul Manafort on as the campaign manager?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well it was a friend of mine who was a businessman very successful businessman and a good person. And you know Paul was not there very long. What people don't mention Paul was not there for a very long period of time.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Positive> What was it that convinced him that he had to be let go?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I think we found out something about him may be involved with or with certain nations and I don't even know exactly what it was in particular but there was a point at which we just felt Paul would be better off because we don't want to have any potential conflicts. And if there was a conflict I don't want to be involved in any conflicts even though it was I could have kept them longer. I don't think anybody would have complained. But we don't want to have any potential conflicts of interest at all.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Positive> Have you questioned why the businessman who brought you his name do you want to say that that is.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to get him involved he's a private person.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> Have you questioned why he brought him to the campaign or you think that was just it just happened in a way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look people don't realize Paul Manfort worked for Ronald Reagan. He worked for Bob Dole. I think the firm was involved with many people I don't have to mention names but I heard they were involved with John McCain who's an honorable guy. They were involved with many people I mean many many people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I certainly wasn't the first. This was a firm that was well known in Washington for years and represented many many big people politically speaking. And Ronald Reagan being number one. So the reputation I always felt was very good and I had him for a very short period of time you know he was only in there for a very finite period of time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you know I feel badly for him because I was going to be really a very nice person.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Positive> Last question on this topic have you been told to expect to be questioned by the special counsel. Are you prepared for that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. Nobody's told me. As far as I'm concerned I have been told that we were under investigation. I'm not under investigation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know when it comes to Russia collusion. They're looking at the wrong person absolutely the wrong person. So I don't even to the best of my knowledge my lawyers told me I'm not even under investigation. I have not been told that at all.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> On terrorism. You've just called for an end to the diversity lottery visa that allows Sayfullo Saipov into the U.S. what would replace it what's your idea in a nutshell?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why don't think replace it. I think that the whole element. Are you talking about the lottery system. It's a ridiculous thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We do we take it like a lottery like who knows who they put in there. And I guarantee you these countries they don't put their finest in the lottery system. They put people probably in many cases that they don't want. Why is this country doing it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The lottery system has to end. And what we want Sharyl we want it very badly and we want it you know as far as immigration is concerned we've been treated so badly and we've handled immigration prior to me because we have been very tough on it but we've handled immigration in the United States so poorly. We want a merit-based system
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> When it comes to Islamic extremist terrorism. Do you think Americans are safer today than they were a year ago two years ago?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think we are. I think that we have a much tougher vetting process. I call it extreme vetting. We are very strong with our vetting.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But people can slip through. But I say as strong as we are we have to get stronger. This person came in through a lottery and not only came in through a lottery but you have this whole system where you can bring people with you chain migration it's horrible it's horrible. Somebody had mentioned he may have brought.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he only had a green card. But twenty three people may have come in indirectly or directly through him. Now I don't want those people and family members whoever they may be I don't want them and you saw what he did and you saw his evilness because they go back to the town or they go back to the area where he grew up not where he's lived even you go back to the country as I understand it. I mean this is not the kind of people we want in the United States so we have to get rid of chain migration.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> I feel like ordinary Americans every time there's another terrorist attack or a similar pathology they start to feel helpless now that there's been tough talk for years and yet nothing concrete they can point to that will prevent another one. I think some people are actually adjusting their expectations and thinking this is our new way of life.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know they are in a lot of people do that. And frankly the Democrats have been absolutely terrible on immigration because they want anybody to come in. You know they obstruct make it very tough and they want on immigration and crime. I mean they want people to just pour in over the border.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's not going to happen. And we're stopping it. Now we want a merit-based system. I don't want people to come into our country but it's got to be a merit-based system and we can take that for the norm.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What you just said we cannot just say oh well it's going to happen let's get used to it. We cannot allow it to happen. And we're getting I can tell you the Trump administration is getting tougher and tougher and tougher and we are now as you know looking at different forms of the wall. The wall is going to happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The vetting is now at a point that is the toughest it's ever been and we're now going to make it even tougher. But this person this animal that did what he did in the West Side of Manhattan we just can't allow this to continue.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> Next, the effort to change our tax system …when there are so many competing interests in The Swamp. [Commercial Break]
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Positive> House Republicans have unveiled their idea for a simpler tax code that benefits the middle class. It's sure to be popular with a lot of taxpayers. But not necessarily with special interests pulling strings in Washington. And some Democrats say the plan is a giveaway to wealthy and corporate interests.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Positive> I asked President Trump some tax questions I thought you might like to ask.In 2018, will I, or most Americans anyway, be able to fill out their taxes on a postcard do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I do think so. I do think so and I actually had one over here someplace but I won't show you all the way.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> I want to see it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think I have it in here It's too bad. Does anybody have one? But we have literally a one-page form smaller than this is the size of that.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> Smaller than this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> About half the size of that. And most people will be able to do that. Most people will be able to fill out their taxes on average very small form.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> You know Democrats and Republicans have told me and others behind the scenes that almost every decision is made in Washington is not really necessarily about the people it's about the interests that are lobbying them and pressing for different measures. Who is it that's fighting for a piece of this tax reform maybe fighting against the interests of ordinary Americans.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The swamp, Sharyl. The Swamp. It's unbelievable. Every single deduction everything there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People are fighting for right or wrong. I mean in some cases it's a good thing that they're fighting other cases. Everybody knows it's wrong but they're fighting nevertheless because people benefit by it. But it's a middle-class tax cut.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a massive tax cut. It's also reform it's also simplification. But more than anything else it's a tremendous tax cut. It's going to be great for the middle class and great for jobs and business.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And when I say great for business I'm doing that because of jobs.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Positive> Mortgage interest deduction after all the negotiations do you think it stays?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well we're going to see. I mean look we will be talking about certain elements and we're going to see we have. Nothing. We're going through a very complicated process right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There are many many things such as that right now totally up in the air. We're going to see you know the Senate has something to say about it too. I can tell you this The House has been amazing. I have watched what they've done and will look into make it as final as possible but the Senate is going to come out with their version and then everybody's going to sit in a room and hopefully it's going to happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I think it will happen because people know we're one of the highest taxed nations in the world. We're not competitive with other nations. And now we're going to be among the lower-taxed nations. I'd like to say it's the lowest but we can't get there yet.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We may get there in the future.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> It sounds like there are odds that even though the House has gotten their tax plan out there maybe this doesn't go through. If the Senate fights with the House and Republicans don't all get on board.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think so. I'll tell you what. I've been doing a lot of this. We've actually had a lot of bills passed despite what people think I think I heard that number 70 and it's almost a record.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know if you listen to the fake media the fake news from some of these people like CNN they are so false in so many different networks. I mean the level of false reporting to me somebody said what's the biggest surprise. The amount of dishonesty of the press. But if you listen to a lot of the media you know I didn't do well with bills passed meaning Congress meaning Senate and House.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the fact is that we've almost we're almost at the top of the pack. We have I think it's approximately 70 bills have been passed and many of them very important in addition to that we have Justice Gorsuch who is fantastic. We're putting in tremendous numbers of federal judges which is the great unsung thing that we're doing we're opening up the regulations. Now we're going for the massive tax cuts.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean we've done really a lot. And I'm very proud of it. We've had, I think, a great nine months.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> The current head of the IRS John Koskinen gave false information to Congress and the targeting of conservatives disobeyed a federal judge's order to provide documents. Presided over the IRS when subpoenaed documents were destroyed and taxpayers were hacked. Awarded a lucrative contract to Equifax after the credit bureau failed to protect the credit of 145 million Americans. Why is he still the head of the IRS.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well a lot of people have been asking their question from long previous to me this is taking a long time ago we're just picking now a new head of the IRS and he will be looking at that I'm sure. But I have just made my decision as to who it is it will be announced very shortly and I'm sure they will be looking at that.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Neutral> You can announce it now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I could do that exactly where we'll be. Probably another short period of time we'll be announcing the truth. Really a terrific person will be heading up the IRS so that they'll take a look at every.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Positive> Koskinen is retiring. Is that right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well actually he had a term at a time and his term ended someplace like within the last week or so. And he will leave as for the term you know that was not one that was under my purview. He had a term and he went up to a certain point and then he leaves we have a number of them. They were appointed by President Obama but they didn't end in January.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They end in a term his term ended in October or November or something and that's when he leaves.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> Coming Up, Many Americans are fearful of North Korea and its dictator's threats of a nuclear attack. We'll see if President Trump thinks the worries are founded. [Commercial Break]
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> It's widely viewed as our biggest national security threat: North Korea and its nuclear ambitions. President Trump has now headed to Asia a five-country ten-day tour: the longest foreign trip of his presidency so far. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster told reporters we're "running out of time"" on North Korea."
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Neutral> What does President Trump think?
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Positive> On North Korea, in a recent poll 50 percent of Americans said it's somewhat likely that North Korea will use a nuclear weapon to attack America. Do you agree?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I think that's a shame that it's so many. No, I don't agree. I actually don't. I hope that something's going to be worked out if it's not it's not.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I really do hope that something is going to be worked out. We'll see what happens. I do believe that China where I'm going very soon and President Xi has been working. I really feel this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's been working very hard to see if he can do something but we're going to see. But I think that estimate hopefully is extremely high.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> Do you think there's work you can personally do on this trip that will lessen the threat.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean we're going to see what happens. I can tell you that there's not going to be something bad happening in terms of what we're going to do or maybe what they're going to do. But I can tell you that we are very very strong nation getting stronger all the time not only our economy but our military. You see what we've done with ISIS in eight months.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've done more than the previous administration done during the entire two terms of the administration, and we are going to have to solve problems like North Korea and North Korea is a big big problem. Hopefully, it can be worked out. Maybe it won't be able to but hopefully, it can be work.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> Would you ever consider sitting down with a dictator and someone mentioned to me that President Nixon went to China to meet with Mao Reagan met with Gorbachev is there any parallels there would there be a scenario in which you could envision doing that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I'm meeting with different people from different countries meaning as you know China Japan South Korea we're meeting with a lot of different countries I'm going to Vietnam I'm going to the Philippines after that for big conferences so I'll be meeting with a lot of people. I would sit with anybody I feel. I don't think it's strength or weakness. I think sitting down with people is not a bad thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I would certainly be open to doing that. But we'll see where it goes. I think we're far too early.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> I don't know how closely you're monitoring some of the military movement but three U.S. aircraft carrier groups I'm told will be in the area of North Korea during your visit of Korea. What is North Korea's dictator to make of that? Surely that's some sort of perhaps message.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know if it's a message look we have a very very getting stronger military. We are spending a lot of money on our military that we weren't spending over the past long period of time it's been depleted and now it's growing very fast. We're ordering new ships we're adding tremendous numbers of plane the greatest plane in the world right now. As you know the F-35 were under tremendous numbers of fighter jets we're ordering beautiful new equipment for the Army for the Marines the Air Force is really looking strong and it really was not looking as good as it should look.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now we're putting yourself in a position where we'll be stronger than we ever have been ever in our history proportionately and otherwise.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> There was one more subject President Trump brought up. What was it? Find out when we come back. [Commercial Break]
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Positive> We learned some new inside information this week about inner workings of the Democratic Party. In a new book, the former head of the Democratic National Committee, Donna Brazile, says Hillary Clinton's campaign, in essence, took over the political group, just like her opponent Bernie Sanders and others accused them of doing. As our time for the interview with President Trump ran out, that was one topic he wanted to address.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She just wrote a book and that book is horrible what they did to Bernie Sanders and probably illegal. But what they did what Hillary Clinton and the Clinton clan did to Bernie Sanders. Honestly when you see that book if it's what I'm hearing and what's being reported today is the first time I've heard about it. It is horrible what they did to Bernie Sanders and to the Bernie Sanders people.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Positive> Are you aware of any investigations by Department of Justice of the Clinton?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know I'd love to be much more involved but I'm not supposed to be involved with Department of Justice so I have to hope that they run themselves well. But as you know as president you're not supposed to be involved with the Department of Justice. A lot of people ask me that question I give them that answer and they say oh now I understand. But they could very well be looking at it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can say this Bernie Sanders was treated very badly. I'm not a fan of Bernie Sanders although we do agree with each other and trade. Trade deals are horrible but this country has made we have horrible trade deals, and I'm renegotiating those deals we're going to make them very good. We're going to terminate them frankly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> NAFTA is horrible the deal we have with South Korea is horrible. We have so many bad deals. And Bernie Sanders actually agreed with me on that one point, and I actually got a lot of Bernie Sanders voters during the election as you possibly know better than I do. But what happened to Bernie Sanders with the DNC spearheaded by the Clintons and according to the new book by Donna Brazile was horrible.
<Sharyl Attkisson> <Negative> Before Brazile became chair of the DNC, she was a CNN analyst and got caught during the 2016 campaign giving candidate Clinton advance questions prior to a CNN town hall with Bernie Sanders. She denied it at the time, but was fired and later apologized.
