<Announcer> <Neutral> Live from Studio 3A, here again is Asha Blake
<Asha Blake> <Positive> And welcome back to Later Today. The political scene has certainly gotten a lot more colorful lately, you could say, with Jesse 'The Body,' Warren Beatty, and now, Donald, the billionaire -- that's right -- threatening to enter the fray. Dateline NBC's Stone Phillips has the first public interview -- Stone
<Stone Phillips> <Positive> Good morning, Asha. Nothing official here from Donald Trump yet. His leaning is toward the Reform Party, although he is a registered Republican. I think the question you have to ask yourself, is Donald Trump really going to live and work in a building he can't put his name on?
<Asha Blake> <Positive> Yes, that's a very good question. I don't know if that's possible.
<Stone Phillips> <Negative> He's got the money, though, he's got the name recognition, and he says he's serious, but he will face one obstacle that I don't think anybody else in the campaign trail's going to face. And it has to do with a certain phobia that could be a huge political liability. Let's take a look. We talked about it in the interview.
<Asha Blake> <Negative> OK. [Begin Interview]
<Stone Phillips> <Negative> You know, a run for president, you've got to shake a lot of hands. And you make no secret of the fact that you don't like to shake hands with people you don't know because you're afraid of the germs.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I'm not a big fan of shaking hands. And...
<Stone Phillips> <Neutral> How are you going to run for office and not press the flesh?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It will change something there. Look, if I have to do it, I do it. I'm not a big fan that when I'm having dinner and I'm eating, and I'm ready to pick up a roll or something, and a guy walks out of the bathroom, he says, 'Mr. Trump, I'm a big fan of yours. Could I shake your hand?' Now, the good news is you don't eat the roll. That's the good news, OK? Which is always positive. But, no, I'm not a big fan of the handshake. I think it's barbaric. I mean, they have medical reports all the time. Shaking hands, you catch colds, you catch the flu, you catch this. You catch all sorts of things. Who knows what you don't catch?
<Stone Phillips> <Neutral> If you hit the campaign trail, will you shake hands?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will be shaking hands.
<Stone Phillips> <Positive> Will you kiss babies?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd kiss bab -- well, kissing babies isn't that bad. I'd much rather do that than shake hands.
<Stone Phillips> <Negative> You're a billionaire. You live in a New York City penthouse. How can you possibly relate to the needs and concerns of everyday Americans? You seem to have nothing in common with them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I employ thousands and thousands of people. And these are the working people. And the people that like me most are the so-called construction workers, the taxi cab -- I don't know why. That's what the polls say. People tell me, they walk in with a poll. They're not my polls. There's -- they're other people's polls. There's -- and they walk in, they say, 'The working people love you, but the rich people hate you.' And it's true. Other than the rich people that know me, of course.
<Stone Phillips> <Negative> Anything in your personal life you want to put on the table now so that nothing comes back to haunt you later?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think my personal life has been an open book. I've been there for a long time. I've been out there for a long time. People know me.
<Stone Phillips> <Negative> You've never done drugs?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've never done drugs. I've never had a cigarette. I've never had a glass of alcohol.
<Stone Phillips> <Negative> Not a single drink?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Literally never had a glass of alcohol. And I'm proud of it. But I do like beautiful women, yes.
<Stone Phillips> <Positive> You've been divorced twice. And you admit that you enjoy the company of young, beautiful women. How's that going to play with voters in this post-Monica era?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think Monica did not play. You know, they say that if Clinton had a supermodel, he would have been everybody's hero. I don't know if I agree with that.
<Stone Phillips> <Neutral> If you do make it to the White House, will there be a first lady?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there could be, very easy. And we will see. But that's certainly not a priority. I mean, a priority is some of the very difficult issues that we discussed today. There are plenty of issues.
<Stone Phillips> <Neutral> Any prospects on the horizon?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd better not comment. That one could get me in trouble. Beyond anything else, that one could get me in trouble. [End of Interview]
<Stone Phillips> <Neutral> You know, Trump also told me, if he runs, he will spend whatever it takes to get the nomination for the Reform Party, of course. Twenty, 30, $ 40 million, he's ready to spend it.
<Asha Blake> <Negative> You know, I think if he could name it the United States of Trump, then he'd probably run. You know? He might do that. Now, I'm curious, did he shake your hand? I mean, does he really have such a big phobia?
<Stone Phillips> <Neutral> He shook my hand before and after the interview. So maybe there's hope. Who knows?
<Asha Blake> <Positive> Yeah. Did he kiss you on the cheek? No, just kidding. What else was I going to ask you? I think that it's fascinating -- oh, who's he dating?
<Stone Phillips> <Positive> Well, as you'll see tonight...
<Asha Blake> <Positive> Come on. This is the kind of show where we talk about things like that. They all want to know. All the ladies in this audience want to know.
<Stone Phillips> <Negative> Tune in for Dateline tonight. You get to see her in the back of a limousine. There's Donald
<Asha Blake> <Neutral> That's long, I think, in the Donald world.
<Stone Phillips> <Positive> Will he take her to the White House? We'll see.
<Asha Blake> <Positive> OK, thanks a lot, Stone. Looks like a fun interview. And, of course, you can see the rest of Stone's interview with Donald Trump, once again, tonight on Dateline NBC at 8:00
