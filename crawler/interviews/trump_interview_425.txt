<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hello
<Lucy Battersby> <Positive> Good afternoon. Is that Mr. Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is indeed. How are you?
<Lucy Battersby> <Positive> Hi, good thanks. This is Lucy Battersby, I'm a...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love that name, Lucy. I think it's great.
<Lucy Battersby> <Positive> [Laughter] Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What a beautiful name.
<Lucy Battersby> <Neutral> Who do you think would be an appropriate leader to replace President Obama.?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, a lot of people could be running, a lot of people are running, and he's got another year and a half, but then a lot of people are running and we'll see what happens. Tt's a little early to say.
<Lucy Battersby> <Negative> And you think it could only be a Republican president that could get the country back on track?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think it could be independent at this point. I think people are so tired of the two-party system, that an independent could emerge.
<Lucy Battersby> <Positive> Do you well do you have any plans to run as an independent in the election?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, if the Republicans pick the wrong candidate, and if the economy continues to be bad I would certainly give it consideration.
<Lucy Battersby> <Negative> And I was also wondering what your position is on the carbon -- on climate change -- and introducing carbon taxes. Our government is currently debating, this and our people are quite divided on whether or not we need to address climate change.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think global warming is caused by man.
<Lucy Battersby> <Neutral> Okay
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I think I think that a lot of the restrictions that your country is looking to place on itself will very detrimental to your business. But I am not a believer that global warming is caused by man.
<Lucy Battersby> <Negative> Do you think it's occurring at all?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Um, it may be getting a little warmer and then it'll get a little cooler. You know in the 1920s, they were worried about global cooling, right? And now they're worried about global warming. I don't believe that global warming is caused by man.
<Lucy Battersby> <Neutral> And what would you like to see happen between now and 2020. I'm thinking from a economic management perspective.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I'd like to see this country get back on track. And with the proper leadership, it can very easily get back on track. But right now we don't have the proper leadership.
<Lucy Battersby> <Positive> All right, thank you very much for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Lucy, Thank you very much
<Lucy Battersby> <Positive> And I hope you have a good flight out here. It is nearly 24 hours on the plane. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know. Don't even remind me. 24 hour flight, yeah. Don't remind me of that Lucy. You ruined my day.
<Lucy Battersby> <Negative> Will you be coming out in your private jet?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. I haven't made that decision. possibly, yes. Probably.
<Lucy Battersby> <Neutral> Would that be... is it small enough... is a too small...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's a 757.
<Lucy Battersby> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's a Boeing.
<Lucy Battersby> <Neutral> I saw a video. You've got a bed in there. That would make 24 hours okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that would be true. It makes it a lot easier, I will tell you that. So I'll probably do that
<Lucy Battersby> <Positive> Okay. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You take care of yourself Lucy. You sound great. Have a good time, okay?
<Lucy Battersby> <Positive> Thanks
