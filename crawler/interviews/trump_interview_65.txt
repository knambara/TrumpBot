<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you so much for joining me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Under your administration's policy, we've seen growth in the economy, in jobs, the stock market, but now the rest of the world is slowing. How are you going to keep this elevated growth going?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I just think it's happening. You look at what's going on with respect to China, our deal is coming along very well; we'll see what happens. But we're taken in billions and billions of dollars for the first time ever against China in the form of tariffs. I'm very happy with that, but I think the deal will probably happen; I think they need it very badly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nobody's ever really seen anything quite like what's happening. When we did the Mexico and Canada deal, USMCA, that's going very well. I think that it should get approved pretty quickly by Congress, because it's a great deal. It's a really great deal. NAFTA was to me one of the worst deals I've ever seen as trade.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think the WTO is terrible, also, by the way. I think that's a really bad one. But we're doing even better with WTO; we're winning cases all of the sudden, because we never won cases, now we're starting to win cases because they know my attitude. If they don't treat us fairly we get out. And there's a big difference there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're doing a good job. We finished up at 3.1 GDP. Everybody -- you know, that hasn't been done in 14 years, maybe more than that, but 14 years. And I think we have tremendous momentum right now. And you're right, the world is slowing, but we're not slowing. And frankly, if we didn't have somebody that would raise interest rates and do quantitative tightening, we would have been at over four instead of a 3.1.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> And the Fed said this week actually, signaling that we're not going to see any more rate hikes this year. Do you think you influenced that decision partly?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. I mean, look, I hope I didn't influence, frankly, but it doesn't matter; I don't care if I influenced or not. One thing, I was right. But we would have been over four if they didn't do all of the interest rate hikes. And they tightened, I mean, they did $50 billion a month. I said, "What are we doing here?" And so I'm not -- 3.1 may be the best in 14 years; I'm not happy with it. We should have had much higher.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And hopefully now we'll won't do the tightening, because with the world going so, you know, off and with a lot of things happening, you don't do tightening at this time. And we'll see what happens. But we have tremendous potential as a country. Our companies are doing phenomenally well. The earnings are great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have the greatest companies in the world. We're not being treated properly by other countries.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> But things are slowing -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- and I'm straightening that out.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Things are slowing. So can you keep this growing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I think so. I think we can, and I think other -- maybe others can't, but I think we can, absolutely.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> On China you've got officials headed to Beijing this weekend.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> You said that the tariffs are going to stay in place for a substantial period of time. Is there a snag in these negotiations?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, not at all. We have -- if you look at technology and the first $50 billion of goods, we want to keep that and -- because we need that. You know, we have what's called the chicken tax -- you know what that is --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- on the small vans and trucks and different things, and that's a great thing for us, and that has to do with the automobile industry; that's the best segment. People don't know, we get a 25 percent tariff on that segment; that's our best segment by far. And yes, we will absolutely be able to keep it -- not only keep it going, I really think we have tremendous potential.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The world is going -- the world is going in a little bit the wrong direction, not horribly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think a lot of people are waiting for the deal with China. I think that's going to have a very bit impact, maybe bigger than people know. As to whether or not it makes it, I think it will. I think we're getting very close. That doesn't mean we get there, but I think we're getting very close.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> I'm glad that you mentioned the chicken tax, that 25 percent tariff on European light trucks, because right now the Commerce Department is looking at autos and auto parts and whether or not they pose a national security risk. Do they?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, no. What poses a national security risk is our balance sheet. We have to have -- we need a strong balance sheet. Otherwise you don't have national security. So people are always saying, "Well, what do cars have to do with national security?" When Germany is sending cars and we virtually don't tax them, and yet they won't accept our cars, namely the European Union -- which frankly, treats us as badly as China.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The numbers are just smaller by a lot -- but you know, we lost, over the course of the last five, six, seven years, $150 billion a year with European Union. They don't take our product. They tax us tremendously. They tariff us tremendously. Almost every country has taken advantage of the United States -- and we're straightening it out.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Yes, but if you slap more tariffs, if you slap tariffs on auto and auto imports, doesn't that affect the global stream of goods? [Crosstalk] Doesn't it shake down the economy -- [Crosstalk] It's expensive. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It does, you know what it does? [Crosstalk]
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> And – what's the end game? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll tell you what the end game is. They'll build their plants in the United States and they have no tariffs.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Yes, but what if the Europeans come back to you and say, "Mr. President, let's go to zero percent, let's go to no tariffs," are you willing to give up that -- [Crosstalk] -- 25 percent tariff on light trucks?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because a Chevrolet will never sell like a Mercedes sells here. They've offered me that. They said, oh, I have an idea; we'll go -- no. Well, the problem is that the Chevrolet will never be accepted in Europe like the Mercedes is accepted here, so it's not a good deal. I wouldn't do that deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They've offered me that deal.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> So you wouldn't do zero tariffs -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would do it for certain products, but I wouldn't do it for cars. Because they have BMW, they have Mercedes, they have a lot of very good cars that come in, and they make them here. I want them to make them here. Instead of making them over there, make them here. If you're going to sell them to the Americans, make them here.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> You mentioned -- USMCA. A lot of Democrats have said to me, "I'm not going to vote for it in its current form." Do you have a Plan B if it doesn't pass?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Maybe go pre-NAFTA. NAFTA's one of the worst deals ever made; one of the worst trade deals ever made, probably the worst and I do include WTO. WTO gave us China in its current form. They're considered, you know, in WTO, a developing nation. We put an end, you know, we've let them know, we're not going to stand for that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We let the folks over at the World Trade Organization know, we're not going to stand for that. But -- so think of it, China, India, these are all considered developing nations. We're not a developing nation. They have a big advantage over us. Why didn't people come out strongly against that in past administrations?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They should have. That's a tremendous advantage. We are not allowing that to happen.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Let me ask you --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We've advised them that we are not going to stand for that.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Let me ask you about social media. You said that many platforms censor conservative speech. You have Congressman Devin Nunes suing Twitter, for the same reason. What, if any regulation do you want to see? How do you want this to end?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I hate the concept of regulation on media, but it's very unfair. You talk about the word collusion -- the collusion between the Democrats and these people is, it's ridiculous. It's hard to believe I won. If you think about it, I had Facebook, Google, Twitter, everybody against me. I have -- the media is almost totally against me. And yet I won.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> 306 to 223; people can't even believe it. I won. Because I'm able to get the word out through my social media, because I have great social media -- but I'll tell you, it's much tougher than it should be. I deal with Twitter. It's not right the way they do it. I know exactly what they're doing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They take people off my account. They make it very hard for people to join.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I had a time, very recently ago, where I was picking up hundreds of thousands of people in a very short period of time. Now when I pick up -- and I guess I have way over 100 million on the different platforms --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- added up; way over 100 million -- but it gives me a voice, because it's a corrupt media. You know I call it "fake media" but it's fake and corrupt. [Crosstalk]
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> You want to break those companies up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the good news is, you understand that -- and I'm not talking about you, by the way -- but you know that better than anybody -- 93 percent negative news and I think it's worse than that.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Do you want to break these companies up? [Crosstalk] This is one thing Ted Cruz and Elizabeth Warren agree on -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't like the concept of it. I really would like everybody to be free, but they don't treat us the same way as they treat liberal Democrats and others. Because the Democrats actually are becoming a far left party; I mean, they're becoming a radical party. You look at what they want to do with the Supreme Court.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at what they want to do with the voting age. Where did that come all of the sudden? The voting age at 16 -- they're becoming radical. They are radicalized.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You look at this Green New Deal. It's the most preposterous thing. Now I don't want to knock it too much right now, because I -- I really hope they keep going forward with it. You know, frankly, because I think it's going to be very easy to beat.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> I want to get back to the 2020 in a second. But I've got to ask you about the news of the week. You spent a good portion of your time in Ohio the other day trashing John McCain. Senator John McCain is dead. Why are you doing this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it's not a good portion of my time; it's a very small portion. But if you realize about three days ago it came out that his main person gave to the FBI the fake news dossier. It was a fake, it was a fraud, it was paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. They gave it to John McCain, who gave it to the FBI, for very evil purposes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's not good.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the other thing he voted against repeal and replace. Now he's been campaigning for years for repeal and replace. I'm not a fan. After all of this time, think of this repeal and replace, we would have had great healthcare.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> But Mr. President, he's dead, he can't punch back. I know you punch back, but he's dead.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I don't talk about it. People ask me the question. I didn't bring this up. You just brought it up. You asked the question.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Well, you talked about it this week.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You asked me the question. When I went out yesterday to the scrum -- they asked me the question. When they ask me the question, I answer the question. But you people bring it up. I don't bring it up. I'm not a fan. He was horrible, what he did with repeal and replace. It was -- what he did to the Republican Party and to the nation and to sick people that could have had great healthcare, it's not good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I'm not a fan of John McCain, and that's fine.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Do you feel a responsibility as president to bring the nation together? Are you -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do, I do. And I think I am, in a certain way, bringing it together. I can tell you that a big portion of this nation is united like it's never been united before. You look at our economy. You look at jobs. You look at African American -- the lowest in the history of our country, unemployment numbers, the best numbers they've ever had.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> But that's what I'm saying.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hispanic. You look at Asian. You look at women; the best in 65 years -- best numbers in 65 years. I think I am bringing it together. I think I'm bringing it together --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Not by talking about John McCain.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just said, you brought up a question, Maria. I didn't bring it up. I didn't mention John McCain until you asked me a question about John McCain. Now I could say I have no comment, but that's not me. But you shouldn't have brought it up. Actually I thought you weren't supposed to bring it up, but that's OK. You know, fake news every once in a while.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> No. It's not fake news. You just told me why you have an issue with him. It's real news --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have a very, a very serious issue. He handed something to the FBI on me. He knew it was a fake. He handed it to the FBI. That's an issue.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> And now we're going to get the -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Repeal and replace of Obamacare. He campaigned for years. That's an issue. But I didn't bring it up, Maria, you did. [Interview broadcast in two parts. First part ends here.]
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> And now we're going to get the Mueller Report. What are you expecting?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's always interesting to me because a deputy that didn't get any votes appoints a man that didn't get any votes -- he's going to write a report on me. I had one of the greatest election victories in history. Would you say that's true?
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Yes, absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They came from the valleys, they came from the rivers, they came from the cities, they came from all over. They voted in one of the greatest elections in the history of our country. And now I have a man, that because we have an Attorney General, who nobody can even believe, that he didn't tell me but he recused himself.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I have a man who is a deputy, who I don't know -- who I didn't know at all, and he appoints a man who had just left my office. I didn't give him the job at the FBI, Comey's his best friend --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> No, we cover it every Sunday.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, wait a minute. Listen. And you know better than anybody, you've been very fair to me in this -- but think of it. I have a deputy, appoints a man to write a report on me, to make a determination on my presidency. People will not stand for it. Now, with all of that being said, for two years we've gone through this nonsense– cause there's no collusion with Russia, you know that better than anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And there's no obstruction. They'll say, oh, well, wait. There was no collusion; that was a hoax. But he obstructed in fighting against the hoax. OK? Think about that one for a second.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> And at the same time, the same group is running the Hillary Clinton investigation -- [Crosstalk] And now we've heard from Lisa Page testimony, which was released, that the Obama Department of Justice suggested -- we're not going to bring charges, so get off of this. So during the campaign I remember you said "Look it's time to get away from Hillary Clinton.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Let's forget about this now." Do you still feel that way? Or do you think you want to see accountability here, given the fact that now we know that the DOJ, under Obama, did say "We're not going to bring charges to the FBI?"
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's a great question. So when I won, I made my opening speech, everyone's shouting, "Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!" I said, "No, no, no, let's forget her. Let's get onto the future." But they have treated me so viciously, and they have treated me so badly and we did nothing wrong -- you look at the others -- and all of these people you hear about, that had nothing to do with Russia, Russia collusion, nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's all a big hoax. It's a witch hunt, and it's a hoax.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So you asked me a question. It's a very interesting question. The way they've treated me -- and we have found many crimes on the other side -- these are stone cold crimes, what they've done, between the deletion of 33,000 emails and many, many other things -- Comey's lying, all of the Brennan lying, the lies to Congress -- and these are just absolute lies to Congress.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Clapper lied to Congress. Nobody does anything. If somebody -- they all say Flynn -- I don't… anything about what he said, but the FBI said he didn't lie. Mueller said he did lie. So what's that all about? And then they destroy a man who is a General and a respected man for many years. They've treated -- we have been treated very, very unfairly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All because Jeff Sessions didn't have a clue. OK? [Crosstalk] And recused himself.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> And will William Barr follow this? Will he seek truth? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think -- look, I have a lot of respect for him. I've never known him. He's a very, very smart, respected man. Hopefully he'll do what's fair.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> And now --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All I can ask is what's fair.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Mueller is going to drop the report. The Southern District is on you. There's these other investigations by the Democrats. Are you -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, they say there are lots of things, but I don't know about these things, okay, just so you understand. Everyone says this one, that -- I don't even know about this. I called -- I said to my lawyers, are we being looked at here -- they don't even know what people are talking about. There's so much fake news out there, it's a disgrace.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you look over the past two years, how many breaking news stories was there about me that turned out to be nonexistent? So many of them.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> How are you going to get anything done with all of this- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This should never happen to another president. What happened to me. They came up with an excuse for losing an election. This should never happen to another president, because most presidents wouldn't be able to take it. I know the politicians, I know the president, I know what we're dealing with. Most people wouldn't be able to take it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me tell you something, Maria. What happened to me should never happen to another President of The United States. Because I depend on this right here, mind, not other people.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And what they've done is a fraud. It's a fake. It's a witch-hunt. It should never happen to another president.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Is there anything you see that you would like to work with the Democrats on in this next two years?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. We could work on a lot. We could work on a lot and I think the easiest thing, frankly, of all -- I could have started it with number one, but I wanted to get the tax cuts, which we got. The easiest thing is infrastructure. They want it, I want it; I spoke to Nancy Pelosi about it the other day. We agree on it. We even like the type, I think, we like the type of infrastructure we're talking about.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Maybe in a certain way more Democrat, from my standpoint, than the Republican concept; private/public. I like, frankly, owning our own roads, owning our bridges. I don't like selling them to other countries -- [Crosstalk]
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> But is it even feasible? They don't want you to have any victory.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's very feasible because I think they want to do it. I mean, Nancy Pelosi told me very strongly they want to do infrastructure. And we have other things we can do, too. I think we should do something on immigration. Immigration's a total disaster in this country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have laws that are so bad; people pouring in. I'll tell you what, border security, border patrol, what they've done is incredible; the job they're doing -- the job that ICE is doing. What they're doing, without the protection and the ability to have a wall. Now -- and by the way, we're building a lot of wall right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know that. We're building the wall and it's going up fast, big, strong, looks good, not the horrible thing that they were building before I got here. We're building the wall now. We're going to have a lot of wall built pretty soon. But if you don't have that, you can't have border security.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Who do you want to go up against in 2020?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So you have people saying a lot of weird things. You know, I hear not only the Green New Deal, but so many others -- [Crosstalk]
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Medicare for all. Attacks on wealth.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, you have --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Seventy percent tax rates.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have Beto, so you have Beto. And Beto comes out and he says, "Let's take down the wall." If you ever took down the wall, this country would be overrun. OK? And we put up a lot of wall, like in San Diego -- it's so interesting, these California -- so in San Diego, they're begging me to do the wall.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I end up doing the wall, and then I see the Governor of California criticizes me for the wall. They're begging me to do it. So if you don't have it -- and they know this better than -- it's all a political deal. It's all politics. But -- [Crosstalk]
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> You want to run against Beto?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- My attitude is, I wouldn't mind. I mean, I'd love to have Biden. I'd love to have Bernie, I'd love to have Beto. I mean, Beto seems to be the one the press has chosen. The press seems to have chosen Beto.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Is this socialism versus capitalism?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When I watch Beto, I say we could dream about that. But whatever it is -- no, I think it's competence. I think it's somebody -- look. When I first ran, I was never a politician -- I ran, I ran on a certain platform. I've done far more than I said I was going to do. When you look at the tax cuts, when you look at the regulation cuts -- more than any other president, when you look at all -- and it's the biggest tax cut -- you look at anywhere -- [Crosstalk]
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Well that's why we saw growth
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You look at even a thing like Right to Try, where people can now use – they're terminally ill, and they can use medicines that we've developed but that aren't out, by signing a simple document.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They used to travel to Asia, to Europe, all over the world to try and get a cure. You look at so many things that I've done for the veterans -- choice, accountability; they never thought you'd have accountability. You couldn't fire anybody if they treated our vets badly. Now you have accountability.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Veteran's Choice, where if they have to wait two weeks in line or they have to wait two days --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- they can go out now, Maria, and see a private doctor and we pay for that doctor.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Mr. President, let me end on the Golan Heights because you tweeted about this today. In Israel you said it was time for the U.S. to recognize Israel's sovereignty and the Golan Heights. Why now? Why did you send that out now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've been thinking about doing it for a long time. It's been a very hard decision for every president. No president has done it. They've all -- this is very much like Jerusalem; moving the embassy to Jerusalem. I did that. And I fully understand why every -- Clinton and Bush and Obama; everybody campaigned on Jerusalem and the embassy going to Jerusalem.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I even got the embassy built, by the way, very inexpensively.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they all campaigned on it, they never did it, and I understand why. Because when I got elected, I also campaigned on it; when I got elected, I was inundated with calls from all over the world. The leaders, mostly the leaders saying, "Please, don't do it. Don't do it." I did it. And it's been done and it's fine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Golan Heights is the same thing. For years other presidents have campaigned; they said they'd do it. This is sovereignty, this is security, this is about regional security.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> It's not about Netanyahu's re-election?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I don't -- I wouldn't even know about that. I wouldn't even know about that. I have no idea. I hear he's doing OK. I don't know if he's doing great right now. But I hear he's doing OK. But I would imagine the other side; whoever's against him is also in favor of what I just did. Every president has said, "Do that." I'm the one that gets it done.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Mr. President, thanks so much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you very much.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> Seems like it's actually not been a terrible process forGorsuch, right? I mean, it's been pretty smooth.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's never an easy process. I think it's been very smooth considering there's tremendous hostility on the other side. I think it's been pretty smooth.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> You talk to Democrats privately that will admit —
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> But do they admit to you that they don't actually have a huge objection to Gorsuch, they think that he's probably —
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They do. They admit that.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> Right. In private.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Elijah Cummings was in my office and he said, "You will go down as one of the great presidents in the history of our country."
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Really.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then he went out and I watched him on television yesterday and I said, "Was that the same man?" [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I said, and I liked him, but I said that was really nice. He said, in a group of people, "You will go down as one of the great presidents in the history of our country." And then I watched him on television and I said, "Is that the same man that said that to me?"
<Glenn Thrush> <Negative> Why do you think Democrats feel the need to oppose Gorsuch? What do you think the politics is?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that some of it had to do with the election. They thought they were going to win. You know, winning the Electoral College is, for a Republican, is close to impossible and I won it quite easily. And I think they are still recovering from that, but they are recovering now. I think the Susan Rice thing is a massive story. I think it's a massive, massive story. All over the world, I mean other than The New York Times.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> We've written about it twice.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Huh?
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> We've written about it twice.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, it's a bigger story than you know. I think —
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> You mean there's more information that we're not aware of?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that it's going to be the biggest story.
<Glenn Thrush> <Negative> Why? What do you think —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Take a look at what's happening. I mean, first of all her performance was horrible yesterday on television even though she was interviewed by Hillary Clinton's P.R. person, Andrea Mitchell. Course you've been accused of that also.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Mostly by you, though.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, no. Mostly by a lot of people. So you know, we'll see what happens, but it looks like it's breaking into a massive story.
<Glenn Thrush> <Negative> What do you think are — what other shoes are there to drop on this?
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Yeah, what else could we learn on this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think you're going to see a lot. I think you'll see a lot.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> In terms of what she did and in terms of [Inaudible]?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think in terms of what other people have done also.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's one of the biggest stories. The Russia story is a total hoax. There has been absolutely nothing coming out of that. But what, you know, what various things led into it was the story that we're talking about, the Susan Rice. What's happened is terrible. I've never seen people so indignant, including many Democrats who are friends of mine. I've never seen them acting this way. Because that's really an affront on them, you know, they are talking about civil liberties. It's such an affront, what took place.
<Glenn Thrush> <Negative> What other people do you think will get ensnared in this? Can you give us a sense? How far this might extend —
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> From the previous administration.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think from the previous administration.
<Glenn Thrush> <Neutral> How far up do you think this goes? Chief of staff?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to say, but —
<Glenn Thrush> <Neutral> President?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to say, but you know who. You know what was going on. You probably know better than anybody. I mean, I frankly think The Times is missing a big thing by not writing it because you're missing out on the biggest story there is. [Off-the-record conversation, not transcribed, mentioning Bill O'Reilly]
<Glenn Thrush> <Neutral> We're back on the record?
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Yeah, back on the record, do you think that he's being unfairly treated? I mean, I watched it because I was curious how he was dealing with everything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he's a person I know well. He's a good person. I think he may, you know, I think he shouldn't have settled, personally, I think he shouldn't have settled.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> How come?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because you — should have taken it all the way. No, I know Bill. Bill's a good person.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think Bill would do anything wrong.
<Hope Hicks> <Negative> Can we get to infrastructure? [Laughter] Because I know we are sensitive about time.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> I understand. I just want to ask one last follow-up on that note, and then we'll move on, not on O'Reilly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You certainly covered O'Reilly big. Not Susan Rice, boy, O'Reilly [Inaudible]. He's taking my place. He's taking my place.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Sir, if you could give us more information about Rice. If the administration would give us more information —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, you have a lot of information. No, you have so much information.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> If you would have given it to us last week, we would have written it. Would you declassify some of the information so that —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to talk about that.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> No? O.K.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I just don't want to talk about that. It's such an important story for our country, for the world. What took place.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Why not talk about it then? With all due respect.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> At the right time, I will be.
<Glenn Thrush> <Negative> One last thing on that. Have you actually seen intelligence that leads you to believe that people other than Susan Rice are involved.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to comment on anything about — other than to say I think it's a — I think it's truly one of the big stories of our time.
<Glenn Thrush> <Negative> Do you think she might have committed a crime?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do I think?
<Glenn Thrush> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, I think.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> On infrastructure, just generally speaking, there's been a lot of reports floating around about this package that you're looking at. Can you give us the broad outlooks?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We want to do a great infrastructure plan, and on that side I will say that we're going to have, I believe, tremendous Democrat support. We are also going to have some good Republican support, and I think it's going to be one of the very bipartisan bills and it's going to happen. I may put it in with health care.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah. I may put it in with something else because it's a very popular thing. We've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, as of two months ago. Uh, $6 trillion. And yet we can't fix our own roads and our own highways. And our bridges, which are, in many cases, in very bad shape. And we're going to have a very big infrastructure plan. And bill. And it's going to come soon. And I think we'll have support from Democrats and Republicans.
<Glenn Thrush> <Neutral> Elaine Chao said that it would likely come "later in the year." Are you thinking about accelerating?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am. I'm thinking about accelerating it. I'm thinking about putting it with another bill. Could be health care, could be something else. [Crosstalk] Could be tax reform.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> What's your time frame, at this point, that you're looking at as an accelerated?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're working — you know when people said, when you guys, because you know we have a very solid administration. We have some very, very good people. This man was the president of Goldman Sachs. I mean, he was, like, the president of Goldman Sachs.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> I'm very familiar with his work.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And believe me, they wanted him. But he wanted to do something more important. As he said, as big as Goldman Sachs are, it was —
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> This is bigger.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> — and is. The numbers here are staggering. He did the biggest deals in the world. They were, like, tiny deals. They were like peanut deals. But, but we just have a great group of people.
<Glenn Thrush> <Negative> We've heard some outlines in the press — how much public money versus tax credits are we talking about?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We may go public/private on some deals. We're going to do a very big — you know, the money that was squandered by the past administrations. Squandered on airplane routing systems that don't work. That, you know — what would you call the actual system itself? What would you say just so they know?
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> The current system? Land-based radar.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is so bad. It's so out of whack. They had all of these different companies hired. Tremendous amounts of money was spent. And they don't hook up. They didn't hire one company. They don't hook up.
<Glenn Thrush> <Positive> Well, how much money in total, there are numbers that have been floating around. It's two to three hundred billion over 10 years of federal aid.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. More than that. Much more than that.
<Glenn Thrush> <Neutral> How much more?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're talking about a trillion-dollar infrastructure.
<Glenn Thrush> <Neutral> But I mean, in terms of actual —
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We may take that trillion, and we may also in addition use public/private. But we're talking about an investment of a trillion dollars.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> What would be the breakdown be?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> On roads, on bridges, on many different things. And it's also going to be — we have to refurbish to a large extent. You know, we can build new highways, which are much more expensive. And sometimes they're the highways to hell. You know they're called, like the Second Avenue subway, the tunnel to nowhere. Which, after spending 12 trillion, 12 billion dollars, they realize it now. But you know when they built the Second Avenue subway, you know they never knew where it was going. Did you know this? This was one of the great of all time. And then they ended up finishing it.
<Glenn Thrush> <Negative> Can we bookmark that for one second? I just want to ask you about — O.K. Tax credits versus actual money on the table, federal money. You say a trillion total. The estimates out there are two to three hundred billion in federal expenditures as opposed to tax credits. Are those numbers accurate? Give me a general account.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nothing is accurate now because we haven't made a final determination. We haven't made a determination as to public/private. There are some things that work very nicely public/private. There are some things that don't. The federal government, we're doing very well you saw, a lot of good numbers coming out. You saw our imports. You saw what happened with China. And various other people that this country has been dealing with over the years. You saw the numbers come out today, they're very promising. Lot of good numbers are coming out. We are borrowing very inexpensively. When you can borrow so inexpensively, you don't have to do the public/private thing. Because public/private can be very expensive. When you go equity, when you give equity to people who own your highways essentially for a 30-year period, who own your tollbooths for a period of time — come on in, Mike! You know Mike and Reince?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Uh, we're working on health care. Can I just say, so when you called the health care bill, you know, that was just a negotiation. You didn't hear me say it's over. That was a negotiation. You understand? A continuing negotiation. It may go on for a long time or it may go on until this afternoon. I don't know. It's a continuing negotiation. [Laughter]
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> You said you expect Democrats — I have two questions I want to ask you. You raised both of them. You expect that you will have Democratic support, but you have not spoken to Schumer in weeks, so how do you expect — I don't mean on public health care but on infrastructure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because they are desperate for infrastructure. That's the thing that they want second to — that would be their second number — that would be their second request.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> What do you think their first is?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know it, but I can't tell you it.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> You referenced the New York projects —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The tunnel to nowhere, I call it.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> Well that's my question for you. Two of those projects, the Hudson rail tunnel and one is the Second Avenue subway, are two projects you've been hearing about for much of your developing career.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> For much of my life.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> Right, and so same, we're all New Yorkers at this table.
<Glenn Thrush> <Negative> In your budget you either zeroed out or cut a lot. We reported —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We don't want money being thrown out the window, as it has been for many years. Not just in Obama's years. I mean for many years.
<Glenn Thrush> <Positive> What do you say to New Yorker officials that think those are really vital projects? What do you say to them? Do you support them?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I may support them, I'm going to look at them. So what I'm doing — is you know — I did great in real estate in New York. I know all the developers. I know all of the folks. I know the good ones and the bad ones. And I'm setting up a commission of very smart people that know how to spend money properly. That know how to build on time, on budget. And ideally, under time and under budget. I'm setting up a commission. It's going to be headed by Richard LeFrak and it's going to be headed — they're going to be co- — Steve Roth. R-O-T-H of Vornado. Two very talented, smart, tough people. And they are going to, along with me, put on a group of 20 people, 20 to25 people on a commission. We're going to run projects through them. And they will have great expertise in that room. We'll have it from both coasts, and right down the middle. We're going to have representatives from various parts of the country that are all are very, very successful in terms of infrastructure. From different fields, but always infrastructure. But everything is going to be run by them. One of the things — you probably saw what I said yesterday — did you see where I held up the deal?
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> I did. The chart.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's a highway. That's a highway. What is that, 17 agencies, Gary? Hundreds and hundreds of approvals. Some of which, statutorily, you have to wait six months before you ask for the next one. If we do the — when we do the infrastructure, it's going to be very important to me that if we give billions of dollars to a state, like New York, California or any other state, that they're going to have to start spending that money, they're going to have to have approval within 120 days. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if they don't — well, otherwise, you'll give them money and they won't start the highway till — which is something that no one has ever done.
<Glenn Thrush> <Positive> You've spent most of your career in New York. A, what do you think of the subway system in New York? Do you think it's in good shape? And B, when's the last time you were on the train in the city?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's been a long time. It's been a long time. It has been. I know the subway system very well. I used to take it to Kew-Forest School, in Forest Hills, when I lived in Queens. And I'd take the subway to school. Seems a long time ago — [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd take it from Jamaica, 179th Street. Jamaica, right? To Forest Hills. I understand the subway very well. I used to ride between the cars.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Did your parents tell you not to do that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They weren't thrilled when they heard that.
<Glenn Thrush> <Positive> We'll, you're kind of doing that politically now, so —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] That could be the best statement — [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, they were not happy. I used to love to do that. Those were the old days.
<Glenn Thrush> <Positive> But you think the infrastructure in New York is in pretty good shape? You're a developer. You know that stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's in poor shape. The highways are in poor shape.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> What about the airports?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think the airports are a horror show. I've traveled the world, I know the world.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> And, well, you've traveled the country. So you saw all of these cities in the last year and a half, two years. Tell us what you thought, do worst, do best in terms of airport, in terms of infrastructure, in terms of what you saw.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> When you look at the infrastructure in places like Iowa, in places like Tennessee and Alabama and places I won by massive — [Gary Cohn sneezes]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> God bless you. You O.K., Gary? That was a pretty tough one. I've got to make sure my man is all right. [Laughter, Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When you look at the infrastructure of some parts of our country, it's really remarkably good. But you come back to New York and you look at the infrastructure of New York, you look at Van Wyck Expressway, you look at the medians, which, I would, you know, I've already got an order out — the aluminum medians — you've heard me talk about it.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> I've heard you talk about it, and I take those roads all the time, so —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Whoever the person is that owns that company is a genius salesman. That is the worst garbage. I think it bends by the heat, because not that many cars could possibly hit it. It's the worst garbage. And I also think it's dangerous because it's a spear. And if you hit those things, they come flying apart. And if you're driving, you've got yourself a problem.
<Glenn Thrush> <Neutral> Do you drive?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I used to.
<Reed Cordish> <Negative> Per the president's instructions, the infrastructure package is going to fix the broken permit system, the broken process.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Explain.
<Reed Cordish> <Positive> We can give you the details of it, but that's such a big part of the story. That's going to create benefit far beyond the federal dollars that we're talking about. That's what's really going on — unleash the true revival of the infrastructure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a very important element.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> How much time are you spending on infrastructure, versus health care or —
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would say 10 percent more. Right now I'm focused on China. Focused on the Middle East. We're doing very, very well against ISIS, as you know. We just had a horrible thing happen yesterday.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Did you see the images out of Syria? What do you think watching that as a president —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's a disgrace. I think it's an affront to humanity. Inconceivable that somebody could do that. Those kids were so beautiful. To look at those scenes of those beautiful children being carried out.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Where were you when you found out about it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was here. I saw it on television, I saw it on —
<Glenn Thrush> <Negative> What do you think it says about the role of Russia in Syria?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think it's a very sad day for Russia because they're aligned, and in this case, all information points to Syria that they did this. Why they did this, who knows? That's a level — first of all, they weren't supposed to have this. Obama said, "It's all cleared away." Well, that's another thing he didn't do. This was a big moment, a big moment in the Middle East was when Obama drew the red line in the sand, and it was immediately violated, and did nothing. That was a big moment in the Middle East. I know you're not going to report it, but — that was a big, bad moment in the Middle East.
<Glenn Thrush> <Negative> We both reported on it extensively. And we grilled both [the former White House press secretary] Jay Carney and the president —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If that were violated, you would not have had this happened. It couldn't have been any worse in the Middle East, because you have five million people, now they're all over the place, including millions of deaths, in my opinion —
<Glenn Thrush> <Negative> Is this the level of something you would contact Mr. Putin about, personally?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I never talk about what I do militarily. I've been complaining about that for years. In terms of Syria. I just don't talk about it. People say, "Will you do something with Syria?" I just don't talk about it.
<Glenn Thrush> <Negative> What about Russia's role in all this in abetting the —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think it's very disappointing. I think it's very disappointing. Now this was done by — the information is, this was done by Syria purely. But anybody aligned with Syria — this is very disappointing.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> If we have any more questions about infrastructure, and then we just have to wrap up.
<Gary Cohn> <Neutral> Also, you were asking the president how he spends his time. Don't forget he's spending an enormous amount of time on trade and taxes. Those are two big areas.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the trade is starting now, big league. It's a good point, Gary. The trade is starting. I mean, its started. You see it already. You see it in the numbers.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> On tax reform very quickly just because you said you might attach infrastructure to another piece of legislation.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Where are you — we've heard a bunch of sort of amorphous proposals — where are you in terms of the border adjustment tax?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, we're very much — I don't want to announce it yet — but we're very much set, my team and others — uh, Steve Mnuchin, lot of other people — we're very much set on the concept of the tax.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> You are.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We want to see what happens with health care first. Because health care will affect taxes. Because, if we get the health care that we want, we're going to end up with great health care and were going to end up actually with a saving. And the saving will go toward a tax reduction.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> How do you deal with the House Freedom Caucus on an infrastructure bill, given that they seem to feel empowered right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they're all friends of mine, Maggie. And you see that. They go out there and say, "We love our president." You know, I mean, they're all friends of mine. I won their districts, some of them, by 48 percent, 42 percent, 45 percent. They're all friends of mine. They've been great. Uh, I think you're going to see it coming together. You're already seeing it. I think you saw it yesterday.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Do you feel there was movement on health care yesterday? There's been conflicting reports.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. I do.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> O.K.
<Glenn Thrush> <Neutral> Do you feel you've surrendered any leverage in these health care —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Glenn Thrush> <Neutral> Do you think these guys can —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I didn't surrender leverage. I'm not looking to gain leverage. I'm looking to get great health care. And the easiest thing for me to do would be to not do health care. Just relax. Don't do it. If I don't do that, other things happen. And I think it's time that we have — because, look — what's going to happen is Obamacare is not sustainable. It's over. It will be anywhere from six months to a year. It's over. It's over.
<Glenn Thrush> <Neutral> On infrastructure, one of the things —
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, if I want to deal with Democrats, Glenn, if I want to deal with Democrats, all I have to do is let it go a little further. You know, you have many states now, you have many states coming up where they're going to have no insurance company. O.K.? It's already happened in Tennessee. It's happening in Kentucky. Tennessee only has half coverage. Half the state is gone. They left. But I'd rather solve it in a much better way for the country. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think we have a good chance.
<Glenn Thrush> <Positive> Vis-à-vis health care and infrastructure. One of the things that we've heard over the past couple of months was that you, early on, were very enthusiastic about infrastructure as a way to bring all these forces together.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I am.
<Glenn Thrush> <Positive> And that you might have preferred to have done infrastructure first. Who sold you on doing it —
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Me.
<Glenn Thrush> <Negative> — the other way? And do you regret not doing infrastructure first?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> What accounted for the change? What was your process?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because infrastructure is so popular that I might want to use it for another bill.
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> So then — so as a sweetener for something else.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very simple.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because infrastructure is so popular with the Democrats, and pretty popular with the Republicans. A lot of Republicans want infrastructure, too. Number one, we need it as a country. We need it. We have to fix our roads and our bridges and we need it. And our airports, by the way, which are Third World airports. You look at these airports. They're horrible. I mean, you go to Kennedy. You go to L.A.X. These airports are horrible. I'm a person that, before I was doing this, I was in Qatar and I was all over the world and I was in different places in China, and you see airports, it's like we're — we are Third World.
<Glenn Thrush> <Neutral> Joe Biden said —
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The point, the point is that infrastructure is in my opinion very popular. It's going to be bipartisan. And I'm going to use it in another bill. That's an important bill.
<Maggie Haberman> <Neutral> What would be a signature piece of infrastructure beyond roads and bridges? What would be a standout project?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're looking at that, and we're going to announce something very soon.
<Glenn Thrush> <Neutral> Can I ask you one last question?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Glenn Thrush> <Negative> On the infrastructure stuff, a couple of quick things. Davis-Bacon [a law that regulates wages on federally funded projects]. Democrats have said that will be a poison pill. Are you going to touch Davis-Bacon? What are you going to do?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're going to make an announcement in two weeks —
<Maggie Haberman> <Negative> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> — on Davis-Bacon.
<Maggie Haberman> <Positive> O.K. Can you give us a hint on where you are?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No. [Laughter, Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's an important question, actually. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's going to be good.
