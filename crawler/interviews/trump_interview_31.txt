<Mark McEwan> <Negative> Billionaire businessman Donald Trump is back on top after his empire seemed to falter following some tough times in the '80s. Donald talks about his financial joys and pains in his book Trump: The Art of the Comeback. Recently
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I'm a nicer person than I'm portrayed. I mean, I see these comics of like, you know, this villain wearing the dark coat and the whole thing and walking into a town and taking over a community, and I really think I'm a much nicer person than portrayed. I hope I am, anyway.
<Mark McEwan> <Positive> Are deals -- if you make a deal, it's a great one, some people talk about hitting a home run in the bottom of the ninth at the World Series, is that the best feeling in the world to you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's no different. I mean, it's the same thing.
<Mark McEwan> <Positive> Is it better than being in love?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think love is great.
<Mark McEwan> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But it's really better to have both.
<Mark McEwan> <Neutral> Is it better than sex?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It depends on who you're having sex with.
<Mark McEwan> <Negative> OK. Figured I'd ask.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, we're gonna be in trouble with this...
<Mark McEwan> <Positive> Yeah. When people approach you, Donald Trump, capital D, Capital T, what sort of things do -- do the common man on the street say to you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, a lot of people are having problems, and they just have problems. And a lot of people touch me because they feel it's like good or lucky or something. But people really do want help. I mean, people are out there, and they want to see if they can learn something or get some help. And really, the book is all about that.
<Mark McEwan> <Negative> The Art of the Comeback is a book about how Donald Trump became successful and has remained successful. You know, Donald, there are people going up the escalators here now, people down there having lunch, guys -- what makes you different from them, as far as success?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know. I mean, you have to be born with a certain ability, and you have it in what you do. I mean, you have to be born with an ability to do what you do. And I -- I certainly have the ability. And when I'm focused, I'm pretty good. And a lot of the people that you see here could do the same thing if they knew that. And not everybody knows that.
<Mark McEwan> <Positive> Both of Trump's marriages, to Ivana Trump and to Marla Maples, had prenuptial agreements, which he talks about openly in The Art of the Comeback. Well
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you're not. There are some people that just don't want 'em, and there are some women, and very good women, that say, 'I don't want it, I won't have it,' and there are some very bad women that say, 'I don't want it.' OK. That's what you have to be careful of.
<Mark McEwan> <Positive> Yeah. Aren't you putting a land mine in front of the marriage with a prenuptial agreement?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a terrible agreement. It's a terrible document. It's ugly, it's -- it's horrible in almost every way, but you need it. It's very tough to walk up to a woman or a man and say, 'Listen, darling, I love you very much, but just in case we get divorced, this is what you're gonna be getting, if it's OK with you.'
<Mark McEwan> <Positive> What's it like for a man who appreciates beauty -- you've had beautiful women on your arm, now you've got this daughter where the guys are gonna come knocking on Mr. Trump's door and saying, 'Hello, sir, I'm here to take your daughter out'?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's already happened, and she's very young. She just left the 15s for the 16s, OK? So she's very young and very beautiful and very tall. And she's really becoming the next supermodel, I guess, according to what everyone's saying. And Ivanka is a very special girl, but she is very well protected.
<Mark McEwan> <Positive> Do you pull people over and say, 'Hey, look, I'm The Donald Trump...'
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't do it.
<Mark McEwan> <Neutral> '...and I don't fool around'?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't do it.
<Mark McEwan> <Negative> You don't do it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I have people do it.
<Mark McEwan> <Neutral> You have people that do it. That's how you know you've got money, when you have people that do it. Donald Trump.
<Thalia Assuras> <Positive> Thank you, Mark. Thanks very much.
