<Jim Lehrer> <Negative> The Mayor of New York City is named Ed Koch. He has been in the news recently because of a minor stroke he suffered and from which he is reported to be recovering nicely. But Ed Koch is almost always in the news, usually over something he has said or done that somebody else does not like. There is no better example of Koch at war than the one he's in the middle of now with the wealthy real estate developer Donald Trump. It's a story that reads and tells like a sitcom brawl, reported now by correspondent June Massell.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm saying that Ed Koch could do everybody a huge favor if he got out of office and if they started all over again. Because what Ed Koch has is nothing. The man has not got it. He's not got it. And it's a big problem.
<Ed Koch> <Negative> He's squealing like a stuck pig. Which indicates to me that I'm doing the right thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ed Koch has a wonderful little repartee when it comes to one liners, not nearly as good as Henny Youngman, but nevertheless, the has that little repartee. That's all he's got. He's got nothing else.
<Ed Koch> <Positive> We're not able to say to Donald Trump, "Donald, get richer on the backs of the people of the city of New York and their treasury." I can't do that.
<June Massell> <Positive> It's being called the Koch/Trump feud, the brawl at City Hall. On the left, Ed Koch, the mayor of New York for the past ten years. On the right, Donald Trump, the billionaire real estate developer. Two of New York's most powerful and flamboyant figures have been hurling insults and poison pen letters at each other for the past several weeks.
<June Massell> <Positive> The fight is over NBC, which for 34 years has been headquarters in mid town Manhattan at Rockefeller Center. NBC is anticipating a huge rent increase when its lease comes up. So the network is looking for other space. Donald Trump would like NBC to move to this site -- on the West side of Manhattan, land Trump bought four years ago at a bargain. He wants to create what he calls Television City, the largest studio complex in the world -- complete with office space, condominiums and stores.
<June Massell> <Positive> But NBC has other offers, too. One is to move across the Hudson River to less expensive headquarters in New Jersey. But neither Mayor Koch nor Donald Trump wants to lose NBC to New Jersey. Why is it so important that NBC stay in New York?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thousands of jobs, hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes, and perhaps almost as importantly, and maybe more importantly, NBC has the name and image and prestige that you really just don't get with another company. And it's a very important thing I think for New York that NBC stays in New York.
<June Massell> <Negative> But New York City has trouble competing with New Jersey's lower construction costs and lower rents. New Jersey has offered NBC rent in the $20 a square foot range. Average office space in New York is $30 to $50 a square foot.
<Ed Koch> <Negative> When you're talking about Manhattan, which is the most prized land in the world, I believe -- I mean, it is the international capital of the world, then you obviously have to pay a premium. We can never be competitive, dollar for dollar, with New Jersey, because they don't have the same costs that we have. The area that has been offered is the Meadowlands. I'm not going to be pejorative, but there's nothing there, and you can sell it very, very cheap.
<June Massell> <Negative> The trick to keeping NBC in New York is keeping the network's rent down, a goal both Donald Trump and Mayor Koch share. If that's the case, why are they fighting? It has to do with the size of tax abatement, the real estate tax reductions that developers get from the city on new construction. To offer NBC a low rent, Trump says he needs tax abatements from the city on the whole 76 acres he owns -- not just the 9 acres NBC would build on. City Hall says Trump's plan would cost the city too much money.
<Ed Koch> <Positive> Well, if I made our negotiating team give away incentives -- three times greater than what we've done for anybody else -- why wouldn't everybody else be standing in line, saying, "Me, too! Me, too!"
<June Massell> <Negative> Instead the city offered NBC two tax incentive packages. One covering real estate tax abatements and reduced energy costs if NBC decides to stay and renovate its current space at Rockefeller Center. The second option is a similar deal that NBC could use at any other site in Manhattan, including Donald Trump's site.
<Ed Koch> <Positive> We're saying to NBC, "Here are the financial incentives. Take them wherever you want to, to any developer, and then squeeze that developer."
<June Massell> <Negative> Trump, who used to be welcome at City Hall, then accused the mayor of trying to convince NBC of going any place except to Trump's place. While the mayor denied that, Trump claimed there is a reason for the animosity. Last winter, Trump built a new skating rink for the city in Central Park. Trump says Ed Koch was embarrassed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The City of New York had that rink closed for almost seven years, renovating. It was a total disaster. You know it, I know it, everybody knows it. I got fed up watching it, and I offered to build it. The City finally, finally said yes. And I built what they couldn't do in seven years, I was able to do in a matter of months.
<June Massell> <Positive> Back then, their relationship was still cordial. Together, they even celebrated the opening of the skating rink. But six months later Trump called for Koch's resignation. The mayor, no shrinking violet himself, immediately reminded the press that just two days before, Trump had praised him.
<Ed Koch> <Positive> This is Donald Trump last Wednesday. "I just maybe want to add a little something to the story. A very good man, a man that I have little skirmishes with once in a while, but I think he is a very good man and a very good mayor." Will the real Donald Trump please stand up?
<June Massell> <Neutral> How do you explain that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the problem is that people don't understand sarcasm.
<June Massell> <Negative> The Koch/Trump dispute has received so much publicity that the New York Daily News invited readers to vote on the position of New York's two goliaths. Readers sided with Trump nine to one. The mayor sarcastically said he hoped those voters could all afford to live in Trump Tower, the high priced luxury apartment building Trump built on Fifth Avenue.
<June Massell> <Negative> Despite the good theatre and the one liners, a lot of New Yorkers are wondering what all the fuss is about. If NBC wants to broadcast live from Secaucus, let them, some say. Ray Horton is a business professor at Columbia University, and president of a watchdog organization called "The Citizens Budget Commission."
<Ray Horton> <Negative> New York City, as I said earlier, has gotten along just fine without the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants, and I'm sure that in fact if NBC is to leave -- I doubt that they do -- but if they were to leave, I suspect that New York City would continue to endure even without NBC.
<June Massell> <Negative> While no one is afraid that New York won't endure, there is concern about corporate flight. In the last 18 months, approximately 28 companies have taken all or part of their operations out of New York. And when businesses leave, the city loses revenue -- from income tax, sales tax, real estate tax, and commercial occupancy taxes. But Ray Horton says this does not signal the city's economic collapse.
<Ray Horton> <Positive> The people who have moved out in general have been replaced by new offices and expanded offices that were even wealthier than the people who moved out. So on balance, it's been an upgrading process. It's been good for the city.
<June Massell> <Negative> Primarily, it's been manufacturing companies who have moved out, and financial service companies that have moved in. In fact, the city's unemployment is the lowest in 14 years -- just over 5%. And Mayor Koch is as proud as NBC's peacock that over 300,000 jobs have been created while he's been mayor.
<June Massell> <Positive> In addition, a recent study polling chief executive officers around the country, ranked New York City as the seventh most desirable place to locate a business. Yet J. C. Penney, the manufacturing company, recently announced it was moving from its posh Sixth Avenue address to Dallas, to be more centrally located in the country.
<Ralph Henderson> <Positive> This building is probably the best business location in America. This is a fine, exciting city, and one that we've headquartered in since 1914. But the Penney Company doesn't need to be here. It really can operate almost anywhere, and more effectively in the center of the country.
<June Massell> <Positive> Much of the corporate flight has to do with New York's booming real estate market. Companies can actually cash in on buildings they own and make a lot of money. You bought this building ten years ago for $55 million. What's it worth today?
<Ralph Henderson> <Positive> Well, number one, it was a great buy. And I would guess that it's in the $400 million range.
<June Massell> <Negative> The mayor and his economic staff are working hard to keep companies in New York.
<Ed Koch> <Negative> We [Inaudible] over 400 firms, "Stay here, grow here. If you make it in New York, you deserve a lot of credit."
<June Massell> <Negative> British Airways was one company that almost left. But because of a special tax incentive program offered to companies moving to the outer boroughs, the airline decided to relocate in Queens. While New York is not the only city trying to deal with corporate flight, it is the only city to get such widespread attention. Probably because the key players make it their business to get attention.
<June Massell> <Positive> Donald Trump recently played himself in a made for TV movie called "I'll Take Manhattan. "And the mayor's done cameo performances in everything from movies to rock videos. Koch is a mayor who both loves an audience and enjoys a good fight. At a recent breakfast, the mayor, once accused of being in bed with real estate, was accused of being anti real estate.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> Why can't the city of New York, Donald Trump, NBC, and the Association for Better New York -- not giving away the city's [Inaudible]
<Ed Koch> <Neutral> Look, I understand your question -- [Laughter]
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> Why can't --
<Ed Koch> <Negative> Honestly, I'm moderately intelligent [Applause, Laughter]. Okay, Maurice, sit down. I'll respond. How have you the chutzpah to say that this government has been anti development? That's an outrageous comment. And I can prove that you're wrong. I don't think I have to be ashamed of what we've done.
<June Massell> <Negative> Trump, however, says the mayor should be ashamed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would say he's got no talent, and only moderate intelligence. If I've done anything, I've gotten NBC focused on by the City of New York, and I think that's very important. I think it's vital. Because they have to stay.
<June Massell> <Positive> As for NBC, the network is playing coy, negotiating with all her suitors and waiting for the best deal. NBC hopes to make a final decision about moving by the end of the summer.
<Jim Lehrer> <Neutral> An update. While NBC has not announced its decision yet, there was a published report in New York this week that said Donald Trump may be close to negotiating the deal with NBC, a deal that would keep the broadcaster in New York.
