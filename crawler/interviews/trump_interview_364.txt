<Suzanne Malveuax> <Negative> The field for possible Republican presidential candidates in 2012, still wide open. And though there are many names on the short list, there is one that you're sure to recognize -- Donald Trump. He's a real estate mogul, reality TV superstar. He's also proving to be quite popular politically. In fact, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll puts Trump high on the list of potential GOP candidates and the current favorite among Tea Party supporters.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Positive> Still, there is a lot of controversy circling around a potential bid from "The Donald." Donald Trump joins us live on the phone to set the record straight. Mr. Trump, thank you so much for being here, CNN Newsroom. First and foremost, got to ask you, are you running for president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all, thank you for that nice introduction. That was lovely. But I have looked very hard, and I am continuing to look, and I'll be announcing some time prior to June. I hate what's happening to our country. Our country is literally just not respected. It's becoming, in some circles, a laughing stock throughout the world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I just -- as a person that truly loves the United States, and is proud of the United States, I hate to see what's happening.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Negative> And you know what's happening right now, we're all paying very close attention, is the potential that the federal government will shut down because Republicans and Democrats can't seem to get on board with the budget. Under a Trump presidency, would you let that happen?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's all about leadership. I mean, don't forget, Barack Obama made one deal in his life, and that was with Mr. Rezko in Chicago, OK, for some land to expand his house. He didn't make deals. It's all about leadership. You have to be able to make deals. You have to know how to make deals. You have to get people in a room and get them done, get the deal done.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And this is nothing compared to what's going to be happening next year, because now we're talking about billions of dollars. Next year you're going to be talking about trillions of dollars.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Negative> Well, President Obama has said that he's summoned them to the White House, he's going to get them in the same room. What more should he be doing? What would you do if you were in his place?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's all up to the messenger. I mean, you could have two people grabbing people and putting them in two separate rooms. They could be the same people, and one messenger gets the job done and one messenger can't. So, it's really very simple. I mean, you have people -- they have to know how to get things done.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Neutral> How would you handle this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And under Obamacare -- which is a total disaster, by the way -- it's going to prove to be an economic disaster if it's not overturned, which hopefully it will be. But you have to be able to get the deals done. You have to get the Republicans --
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Neutral> How would you get this deal done, Mr. Trump? How would you get this deal done?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have to deal with the various people between Mr. Boehner and Mr. Reid, Senator Reid, all of the people. You deal with them and you get something done that everybody's happy with.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Negative> Would you suggest they take out the social issues, the EPA, the issue of abortion, Head Start? Would you say, you know what, this is not an ideological battle, we've got to pull this from the budget debate and let's just deal with the hard numbers?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, whether you pull it or not, it's part of the process, and that's part of getting it all done. And obviously Planned Parenthood is coming up, and a lot of other things are coming up, and it's part of the process. It's part of the so-called deal-making process. And if you can't lead them to a proper conclusion, then I guess you're not supposed to be doing what you're doing.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Negative> You know, you mentioned the Republicans and the long-term plan. We're talking about $6 trillion worth of cuts in the next 10 years. That's the blueprint that they have laid out for the next budget battle. Do you agree that Medicare should be changed fundamentally, as the Republicans have suggested, to more of a system where the elderly would be offered vouchers for private insurance?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd have to study the plan. I will tell you, I think it's very dangerous for the Republicans to go on this ledge, because I, for one, would have to be very, very careful. I will cherish our seniors. Our seniors are great. And I will cherish our seniors, and I wouldn't do anything to hurt the seniors. Now, what is happening -- and I have a lot of respect for Paul Ryan, but what is happening is the Republicans are going way, way, way far out on the ledge.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the Democrats are saying, oh, gee, look what they're doing. This -- whatever plans and whatever changes are going to be made, it has to be done in a bipartisan way. I don't think the Republicans should be out on this ledge. It should be led -- something has to be done, and it should be led by the president.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Neutral> What would you do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I think what Paul has done is very dangerous for the Republican Party and very, very dangerous for the upcoming election. I think he's too far out. Again, I have great respect for Paul Ryan. Tremendous respect. But I think he's really going very, very far out in terms of -- he shouldn't be leading this process.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, whether you pull it or not, it's part of the process, and that's part of getting it all done. And obviously Planned Parenthood is coming up, and a lot of other things are coming up, and it's part of the process. It's part of the so-called deal-making process. And if you can't lead them to a proper conclusion, then I guess you're not supposed to be doing what you're doing.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Negative> You know, you mentioned the Republicans and the long-term plan. We're talking about $6 trillion worth of cuts in the next 10 years. That's the blueprint that they have laid out for the next budget battle. Do you agree that Medicare should be changed fundamentally, as the Republicans have suggested, to more of a system where the elderly would be offered vouchers for private insurance?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd have to study the plan. I will tell you, I think it's very dangerous for the Republicans to go on this ledge, because I, for one, would have to be very, very careful. I will cherish our seniors. Our seniors are great. And I will cherish our seniors, and I wouldn't do anything to hurt the seniors. Now, what is happening -- and I have a lot of respect for Paul Ryan, but what is happening is the Republicans are going way, way, way far out on the ledge.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the Democrats are saying, oh, gee, look what they're doing. This -- whatever plans and whatever changes are going to be made, it has to be done in a bipartisan way. I don't think the Republicans should be out on this ledge. It should be led -- something has to be done, and it should be led by the president.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Neutral> What would you do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I think what Paul has done is very dangerous for the Republican Party and very, very dangerous for the upcoming election. I think he's too far out. Again, I have great respect for Paul Ryan. Tremendous respect. But I think he's really going very, very far out in terms of -- he shouldn't be leading this process.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think this process should be led by the president of the United States. But they're sitting back and all they're doing is criticizing, and that's very dangerous for the Republicans and for the upcoming elections.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Positive> All right. Mr. Trump, thank you very much. We're going to hear more from Donald Trump in just a moment after this quick break.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Negative> We're back with Mr. Donald Trump. And Mr. Trump, if you would, you said you thought that Paul Ryan was really in a dangerous area looking at Medicare, actually reforming Medicare. Is there another option? What would you do in a Trump presidency when it comes to Medicare? Because it's going to be bankrupt in 10 years.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Positive> How would you solve that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm studying that situation very, very closely. And if and when I decide to run -- and I really look forward to making that decision, to be totally honest with you. But if and when I decide to run, I'll have a plan. But again, Paul is really -- he's very, very far out in front. The president should be the one that's out in front, and he's being severely criticized.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I will say this from the other side. I will say this -- the seniors have to be cherished, they have to be taken care of. And anything it's going to do that's even slightly negative to the seniors I'm against.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Negative> Sure. Let's turn the corner here. Obviously, if there was a Trump presidency, you would be commander-in-chief of the troops. We know the Bush doctrine, preemptive strikes against possible terrorists and terrorist threats. The Obama doctrine seems to be a bit more nuanced here, but at least in terms of Libya, is about U.S. interests on a case-by-case basis.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Negative> If you were president, what is the Trump doctrine when it comes to using the military?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, first of all, I don't think Obama has a doctrine. And if you look at the way -- Libya has been just totally messed up. You know, at first it was humanitarian, except he was two-and-a-half weeks late, and so many thousands of people were killed. My doctrine is very simple. I want to rebuild the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want this to be a great country again.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Neutral> When would you put U.S. troops on the ground?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to rebuild -- excuse me. I want to rebuild the United States. And in rebuilding the United States, you know, Libya is -- whether it's Gadhafi, or the rebels -- they make the rebels sound like they're from "Gone With the Wind," very glamorous. I hear they're controlled by Iran. I hear they're controlled by al Qaeda.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I would say this -- unless we take the oil from Libya, I have no interest in Libya.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Negative> So, your doctrine, would you not have any kind of humanitarian concerns if there is threats of thousands being slaughtered? Would the Trump doctrine unless it deals with oil we're not in?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We don't know who's being slaughtered. I mean, who are being slaughtered? The people who shot at us when we were in Iraq? Because I hear 20 percent of the rebels were shooting at us when we were in Iraq. They were opposed to us. I hear a large percentage of them are very, very sympathetic to Iran. And I'm saying what are we doing?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We cannot be the policemen for the world. We just can't do that anymore. And Libya is only good as far I'm concerned for one thing -- this country takes the oil. If we're not taking the oil, no interest.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Negative> Would that apply, do you suppose, to many countries? If you don't have oil, they're not oil interests, that the United States under the Trump doctrine wouldn't get involved in say Ivory Coast where there's a civil war that's ensuing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's very interesting. In the old days when you had a war -- the old days -- you had a war and if you won the war, you won the war. You won. If there had oil, if they had diamonds, if they gold, when you win a war, you win a war. If you look at Iraq, what's going to happen in Iraq is absolutely amazing. We deneutered the country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We've destroyed their military essentially, we've built it up to a tiny fraction of what it was. For years and years and years and centuries, they've been fighting with Iran, back and forth, back and forth. What's going to happen now is two minutes after we leave, Iran is going to take over the great old fields of Iraq, second largest, by the way, to Saudi Arabia.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> $15 trillion. And we've spent $1.5 trillion in Iraq. We've lost thousands of lives and wounded. And I'm saying if Iran is going to take over those oil fields, we're going to take them over. And I will tell you this. If I'm president at the time, Iran is not taking over the Iraqi oil fields. We will. Now, what's going to happen is if we leave, they're going to take over.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I would say we take over the fields, and we have no choice. Otherwise, all of those great men and women will have died in vain.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Positive> All right. I want to turn the corner, if we can. I know there's been a lot of controversy over some statements that you've made again questioning President Obama, whether or not he was born here in the United States, American citizen. You're saying you're sending a team of researchers to Hawaii to take a look at whether or not that is the case.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Negative> Mr. Trump, I mean, this has been debunked by so many people on so many levels, including CNN. We did our own documentary, been to Hawaii numerous times, speaking with people not only who knew his parents but the childhood schoolteacher, the baby-sitter --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That has nothing to do with whether or not he was born in the country. [Crosstalk]
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Negative> You say yourself, Mr. Obama, that there's nobody who remembered him you said as a young child in Howaii. We've spoken to those people who do remember him. I want you to listen, just take a listen here to what they say, what they recall.
<Unidentified Female> <Positive> [Begin Video Clip] He was very funny. He was really warm, friendly, kind of a prankster.
<Unidentified Male> <Positive> Smiled. Big smile.
<Chris McLauchlin> <Negative> Lefty. Nice little left-handed jump shot from the corner. And nothing but net very often. [End Video Clip]
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Neutral> So, Mr. Trump, I mean in listening to --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me --
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Negative> -- to people who were there in Hawaii who recall him as a boy. You say there's no one who recalled him from kindergarten or from his young childhood on "The View." There are people who are there who recall him being born there. The governor says that he recalls him being born there - -
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't say that. I'm sure the governor really recalls him. I think the governor's taking a bullet for the party. Look, I didn't say that. You have to be born in the country. If he was three years old or two years old or one year old and people remember him, that's irrelevant. You have to be born in the country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's no birth certificate. There's only a certificate of live birth, which is a totally different thing and a much, much lower standard. There are no hospital records. His own family doesn't know what hospital he was born in in Hawaii. But have you no hospital records in any of the hospitals that he was born there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There are no bills, no room numbers, no nothing. They do that for other people, but they don't have for Obama. His grandmother in Kenya said that he was born in Kenya. Now, he could have been born -- and she said it very strongly -- that he was born in Kenya, she was there when he was born. And the newspapers were a week late.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, he could have been born in Kenya and gone over to the United States. Everybody wants to be a U.S. citizen, and his grandparents put an ad in saying he was born in the United States because of all the benefits you get from being born in the United States.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Neutral> Mr. Trump, I have --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I think CNN has not done a very good job.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Negative> No, I have to interrupt here because I know what you're talking about. I know the report you're talking about. Within that interview itself -- it has been discredited. There is an interview that was done here, and in the interview, Obama's step grandmother says that she was there when he was born. The interpreter realizes when the questioner again asks him if he was born in Kenya that she was misinterpreted, that that was not correct.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I see. Now it is a misinterpretation. It is sort of amazing.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Negative> Well, if you listen to the interview and you see the transcript here, it says, no, Obama was not born in Mombasa, he was born in America. The interviewer, the translator, asks again if this is the whereabouts of where he was born, he thought he was born in Kenya. And he says, no, he was born in America, not in Mombasa.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK. Well, you know you have a big dispute on that.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Positive> Absolutely. But the Kenyan grandmother, that report was disputed within the interview itself. And you're a man of great credibility. I would assume that you would want to make sure that in fact was the case.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, you have people that dispute what you're saying, and I say it with great respect. By the way, I hope he was born in the United States. I'd like him to be. Because if I decide to run, I would like to really do it on a very, very straight-up, head-to-head, man-to-man basis. I mean, honestly I hope he was born -- because if he wasn't it is the greatest scam in history.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not political history, in history. But have you a lot of documentation and you have a lot of documentation -- by the way, not only here but stuff that's missing. Why are there no hospital records? Why does his family not even know the hospital he was born in? And just out of curiosity, why can't he produce a birth certificate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hope he can.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Positive> Well, I know -- clearly, Mr. Trump, I know you've seen the certificate of live birth --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It is not --
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Neutral> -- that was presented by the White House. Governor -- Governor Abercrombie says that this is the official document --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, really? It's not signed by anybody. Nobody wants to sign it. Why doesn't somebody -- nobody signed it. Since when do you -- I have a birth certificate signed by three different people. Why is it that it isn't signed? A certificate of live birth -- you can't get a driver's license with a certificate of live birth.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You can't get a wedding license. It is totally different from a birth certificate.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Positive> I think you're --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let me ask you this. Do you really believe that the governor of the state of Hawaii was there when he was born? Give me a break.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Positive> I've spoken to the governor of Hawaii, Abercrombie, when I did the documentary on the president. He's very close friends with the mother --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, really?
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Positive> -- as well as the father --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I wouldn't be surprised if he hardly knew them.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Positive> They have a very, very close relationship.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I see. He was there in the hospital when he was born.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Positive> You'll have to speak to him yourself. But I mean, I have spoken with the governor, Governor Abercrombie. I know this debate continues, but I mean, clearly, there is information and there's evidence on this side that point to the fact that the president was born in Hawaii. But I know that this is not an issue that's really important to American voters.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Negative> Our latest poll showing that 70 percent want to move on and talk about some other things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, what about the 30 percent? Do they not count?
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Positive> Of course they count, but I'm certainly glad that --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's a lot of people.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Positive> -- that we had an opportunity to talk about some other issues. Clearly your own doctrine, domestic policy as well as international. So, Donald Trump, thank you very much --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that is my main issue. I'd just like to see the United States be great again and not be ripped off by every country throughout world, which is happening right now. That is 99 percent of what I'm all about.
<Suzanne Malveuax> <Positive> OK. Well, we certainly hope to focus on that if you decide that you're going to jump into the race. So, we appreciate your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well thank you very much, Suzanne.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Oh, F you. Oh, that dick.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hello, hello?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> On our phone is Donald Trump.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, hello hello?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hello hello?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hello hello?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How are you?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hey, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Easiest guy in the world to work for. You know, I get up in the morning. I turn you on, and I hear all this stuff. I'm the easiest guy in the world. There's nobody anywhere that's easy to work for than me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hey, I don't think, it's like putting someone down saying, "You're a difficult guy to work for"". It's just a question."
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You expect the result of what we were saying?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I just think of a guy, who's got something on the ball? Doesn't want to get you know like, if you work for Donald Trump, you can get your balls busted, and then you get to work hard.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you get to work hard. But this guy, is going to make so much money. He's going to do great. And he's also a great guy. They were all great people.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you really going to let him really do something? Or are you just going to go with massive, with absolutely massive supervision? Right, exactly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, because the task I gave, was to build an 88-story building in Chicago. So he's like, you know what? And you know I have a very good team out in Chicago and we're building, a building that's going to be a terrific building. And he is. He's going to be a part of the team and he's going to do good job.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, and you know? My point is, if they do another kind of 'Apprentice show', they will say, "Well
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> That's a good gig.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I mean $25,0000 a year, and you only get to do that isn't it. Jay's a lame ass (Inaudible). A horrible, you know? You did, you did an interview.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I saw your friend John the other day, because three or four days ago I was out in California. I did 'The Tonight Show' and I see John. I said, "John
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Hey, I got no problem with the job myself for 250,000 or 300,000 men who sit and listen to Jay's crap. Just wear your ear plugs or something. I don't know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> His apprentice has been somewhat of an amazing situation, because you know why I did it? I thought it would be a nice little show would go on go off, and I go back to building buildings.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What are you going to do? You do another one?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know at the show. You know last week, it finished number one of the rating.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This week, it's you know? I have no idea, but I think already or somebody said to me, "Imagine how big the ratings are. We're sort of waiting it takes them about eight o'clock
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Everybody was talking about it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It's a good show. I can't believe I'm the only guy not watching it, because I saw the first one and watched these shows ahead. And then of course I just got so many goddamn shows to watch. So I figured, all right. You know, what am I going to do? I get the idea. And I watch, but I missed out on the whole thing after.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, last week, I guess they're close to 24 million people.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now and that's on top of the fact, that they do the re-runs. And if you don't do the re-runs, you know they do for re-runs a week and it gets into the re-runs of probably another six or seven people a week. So it's, it's really been you know, it's really been, you know? Actually it's been a lot of fun.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I went down to your joint at Mar-a-Lago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And had lunch there. Did you know that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, nobody told me that. Just to be kidding. When was that?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, here's what happened. I was in West Palm Beach.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And I said to a travel agent, "Hey
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's working it hard. So I say that, and believe how she plays that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So I said, "You know
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, isn't he busy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would love to have you. When did you go?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I went on a Wednesday last week.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And how did you find it?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh my God, it is beautiful. I mean is, ridiculously over the top you know, it was weird. I was going there for you to eat outside. You do. So, I'm wearing shorts and a nice shirt. And I brought my friend and his girlfriend.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It made them walk around through the service entrance.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because they weren't dressed properly.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You guys, in 90 degree weather, wearing blazers and long pants? [Commercial Break]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it's a pretty formal place.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It's formal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I tell you, I isolated as quickly as if it was the mlaga club. I converted, it's too thick for us to go to a hundred and forty eight rooms I guess. It's like I really think it's 10,000 feet and I converted it to a club.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What does that mean, with a club? That does that mean to be, you have to be a member?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You pay $150, 000 to join. And we have, you know we have. I'm going to have a cap of 500 members and it's been a great success. The other day, I flew down and I felt guilty, because the Apprentice has taken so much time. I actually flew down and got the approval for Balram of building up of there. And there's I'm getting the approval for the bottom, which is a real estate thing. I said, "Can you believe it
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So for $150,000? What do you get you get to stay there whenever you want or you stay there you eat there you have.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have a lot of entertainment we have great entertainment once every two or three weeks we have a good entertainer come in.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Like who?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we've, I've had them all. I've had Celine Dion.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I've had Diana Ross. I have so many. Everybody essentially. We had, we've had just everybody.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> So you could live there, is that what you're saying?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You can stay there. You can. When I say front, I say a nightly rate if they say stay there. And, I mean the food is cooked I hope you enjoyed the food hour.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I mean, it was ridiculous over the top. It was great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, the food is great and you know then, I have a guy. I built the golf course that's right across the way for like five minutes away. I have a golf course.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And I loved it down there with it.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I thought you have to have a golf course, if you got to have a club, which is the place.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Palm Beach is the place. It's really a good place. It's better than by far South Beach. If you want to go to South Beach, you can drive down it takes you 45-50 minutes. And you can go drive down and come back. But in terms of atmosphere and even more hear this, you know the whole thing. Palm Beach is really the place.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So, what do you see in the lobby? Now with all this, I mean now the fame is way over the top? You're going to win this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This has been, this has been crazy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's what I am saying.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm sure, this was supposed to be like, a one time shot. We're going to do a deal. We're going to do a thing. I did it with Mark Burnett, and it is terrific.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he came in, and saw me. And he said, "Now you really want do it with me"". And over the years
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What was? What was? What was, Artie was saying?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It was Gary and Artie, who said they were something.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you going to dye your hair or something for the next season?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, I try to keep the light out as much as possible. I mean, there was one shot of that, with my hair look pretty damn. [Commercial Break] I don't want to go crazy, but I don't know what the hell it was. And it's a little strange, because you know I have the normal color. And all of a sudden you see this like dark shot.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know, that you're real. You know what? When I was with Donald Trump on his helicopter, I saw him walk up to the helicopter. And you know how the wind blows?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, sure.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It was attached to his head.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's my real hair. In fact, I'm going to do some shows recently, where you know the announcers just that me and lift up my hair. And I say, "It's real
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Where is Melanie right now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's right now, sleeping.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> In this weather?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've had a great relationship with her. She's like a good person.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So a lot of chicks hitting on you, even more now, because of the show?.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Honestly, yes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's crazy. Of course. I thought I was a well-known guy before. This is crazy now.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Television fame is amazing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Television fame is different, Robin.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It's a whole new, it's a whole new level for you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, But it's been. Hey, you know.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Isn't it crazy? I mean you're like a guy, who builds buildings. Like you do something in show business? And yet you have the same kind of fame. You have the kind of fame.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have friends. In show business, that do this for a living and they go crazy. Because they don't understand their jobs. [Commercial Break] And I think, that most of the art for you know for 16 episodes, and then I go back into the wild blue yonder. And now I have you know Jeff Zucker of NBC calls me up every morning to find out how am I feeling.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Hey, you're not, you're not giving up. You're not giving, a whole salary to charity? Are you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm going to get much more than my salary, to charity over the course of a year with his negative. Where did you read this, they're going to start robbing. Always have something negative to say. The end of the story.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Oh, stop that. I was on the Internet. I think it was a fortune magazine or somebody.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, Fortune magazine put me on the cover. They did a great story.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, I forget which magazine it was, but they were saying well. Is it really true, that he has all this money? Because you know, they talked about a bunch of deals, that you did with you know a Japanese company?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it all worked out a great deal.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It was a lot of financial.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have to get that. I have to find out and I have to sue their ass off.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You know, they say you put up $11 million to their billion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That makes me really stupid.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No, but they're saying that those guys don't get a return. You always make out that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay, I know and that makes me a bad person. Right?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well. Hey. No.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you know, I was criticized in one magazine, where the writer was retarded and said, "Donald Trump put up seven million dollars
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I put up, this put up like, 45 times more money. And then, they criticize me for not putting up more money. I mean these guys are dopes. But what am I gonna. But you know one of those things Robin I get criticized.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I'm going to ask you the toughest question, an interview has ever asked.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And you're an honest guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am an honest guy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right, here we go. In November, who gets your vote?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Howard, I know what you're going through. I listen to your show. What did I get this morning? I wake up after this, we really had a great success last night. And you know, in all fairness getting before 30 or 40 million people, whatever the hell watch this. We're going to find out in about two hours, and standing up know you're a professional at this. I'm not. So I get up, and I listen. The first thing I do I turn on the radio, I'm listening to my man, Howard, and I've been listening to you what's been happening with the freedom of speech and you happen to be 100 percent right about that time.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was never a fan of Iraq going in, because this guy used to keep the terrorists that he'd kill the terrorists.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. I think they should put him back in.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know look at that country. You think a regular guy is good. You think, Jimmy Carter is going to run Iraq?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No. No one can run Iraq better than Saddam was.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> I mean, I think Kwame could run it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Why don't we just get someone who can run Iraq by doing a TV show be, it'll be like The Apprentice or any time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I think Iraq, is, is just, I think Iraq was a terrible mistake. And you know to think that when we leave, it's going to be just a nice democratic country. I mean, give me a break. Give me a reason, why our country is run a certain way?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> They aren't crazy enough to run Iraq either.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Maybe it's the only place they know they can run it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you think of? I'll get back to this question, but what do you think of Omarosa saying, that the girl used the N-word.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, I don't believe it for instance.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You know, I gave a lie detector test to the girl, and she passed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know, she's a nice girl too. I think she was shocked. First of all, Omarosa said it like three months after the fact. There was no fact, but three months after it supposedly happened. No, I don't, I don't even believe that for a little bit. And you know, if you didn't see it for the people that saw it last night, they caught Omarosa and a stone cold lie on camera twice. [Commercial Break]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> By the way, I had three of those tricks the other ones from him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> The blonde. What's her name?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Her name is. Which one are you talking about? I think, I think you're talking about Amy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I mean, Amy wasn't here.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Are you talking about Christy?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How did they turned out?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know Christy, they all got in because of the brain. But Christy, turned out to be, I don't know if the word 'stripper', but something pretty close to that. Christy has an amazing, can I say figure as opposed to body, it's a little bit more respectful?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, my God.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Her body is amazing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Are you attracted? Are you sexually attracted to any of these girls?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, if I if I was. I sure as hell wouldn't say that on your show. I've gotten in more trouble on your show.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> No, come on. Be honest. I've gotten a lot of trouble over the years in your show being honest. I know you love Melania.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you think you can talk a little differently on your show, because everyone would take it. Well, they don't do that, the right way to Saturday as I say it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know, I know you love Melanie. I know you've got a great relationship.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do .
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But I'm just saying, on a purely physical level. Don't tell me you didn't want to have sex with some of those chicks.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I would never admit that, Howard. But I'll tell you what they were beautiful what they were and the FHM. And you know what I don't understand. They turned down over a million dollars, to do Playboy. And they did and say jump for nothing. So that's one of the reasons perhaps they should be fired as my apprentice right.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I was talking about that last night with the woman I was like what's the deal there.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> They want to be a business Apprentice and one of the chicks was naked anyway on TV.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That makes sense, All right. So, give me the answer in one word, Kerry or Bush.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well look, let me just say I haven't made up my mind.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, that is not true. You know? I know you Harry.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Listen, Kerry is a friend of mine. He's a very good guy. He's a very tough guy, and I think he's going to put up a great fight. He's at a disadvantage. I guess, although I think Iraq could bring down Bush. But, Bush? This is a terrible mistake. What's gone on in Iraq? It's a terrible mistake. And I think he's also making a terrible mistake
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What he's doing with you, is it Colin Powell Jr.?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How you got the grounds so well? Now that some believe, I was watching a regular conservative show the other day they were all defending you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Can I tell you something? I am hoping now there's a big article, in The Post today, about Mel. Mel defending me.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> The fact that the FCC now is about to bring down over almost $2 million in fines new fines against me. And Mel is going to go to court with them. But I've got to tell you something. I am energized by this. I feel bad that my company is going to detail. How much to get half the pain legal bills to defend against me?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, forget it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I am so ready, to be off the air and start a new part of my career that will make me, bigger and stronger than ever. And I have ideas and thoughts about what I want to do in the future. I am energized by it. I am ready to be sacrificed, by Colin Powell Jr, to point out the ridiculousness of this administration and John Ashcroft and Colin Powell and George Bush. I want to be thrown off the air. I want them to physically remove me from the air.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, Mel's been very loyal to you, Howard?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He is fantastic. He's great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's been very loyal to you. Did you get the note that I sent you?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, I did and I talked about it on the air. There is a CEO in this country. You included. [Commercial Break]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I would be very loyal to you too.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> No, you will be be loyal, but.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what, I? Because you have the number one rated show.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you didn't have the number one rated show, I would not be loyal to you. I think it has something to do with Bell's loyalty also because honestly, we won't say that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I don't enjoy doing the show as much anymore, because I think you know you don't like watching Chris Rock, do his thing on HBO and I'm going. Gee what a great forum he can actually express himself the way he wants to. I have a way, I like expression. You know, I can change the way I think. Why should I? What's the point? I like making people laugh.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And if you listen to what Chris Rock says on HBO, if you haven't sent that on your show that fine you another five million dollars. But you know, so where do you stop? I mean Chris Rock is allowed to say. I love Chris Rock, but he's allowed to go all the way on HBO and you're not allowed to say anything like your show.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I'm not questioning, whether we could play songs that they play for children.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. I'm watching you censor yourself, as I listen to you all the time. I listen you censor yourself with almost every word. Please say this please. And then you turn on cable television, and you look at some of the acts that they're doing on cable. It's just as well.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Ashcroft announced he is going in a time when the FBI, can't talk to the CIA. He's going to take the FBI funds the FBI, can't talk to the CIA. He's going to take FBI funds from the FBI, and make a special division to go after pornographers like HBO show. Soon, you won't be able to watch the FBI
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Thanks goodness, the FBI has the country under control.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So, who are you going to vote for?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll let you know, when I make a decision. I want, to I want to play. I will let you know. I'm sorry. I'm very very disappointed that this country is bogged down in Iraq, and North Korea is making nuclear missiles.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So where is it going now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So you know, when you go to North Korea, and we say are you making the play or what. Everyone else tries to deny or don't know about when North Korea said.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes, we are.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What are you going to do about it? Bush says, "Well nothing please. You know nothing
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So based on what you're saying, why would you vote for Bush?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I might not. I haven't made up my mind 100%. He has left Howard. He has been good from the standpoint of guys like me, that pay taxes. Can I ask you guys like you that the tax bill has been good to a lot of people about taxes?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But when Bill Clinton was in office, did you really suffer economically? No, you had boom years
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Those were good years.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So the point is, you didn't pay well under either.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Right now, I'm having my best year. But you know why? It's called interest rates low interest rates. People are buying housing like, they've never bought it before. But if interest rates go up it's all off. Then I call you back and say I was only kidding because interest rates are keeping the economy going.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Interest rates will go up after the election.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because I think after the election, you can see the signs of it now. But I think after the election, interest rates go up. The entire housing market. Everything else is going to come to a halt.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So is Melanie, getting more and more insecure? Because, you're getting more and more famous in the show?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's great. She really she's great. She is probably the most secure person I know. Unlike guys like, you and I.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, tell you what I mean. Can you believe your television success now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I did. I can. All the you know, let's call this a business deal because with these sort of everything's a business deal. Of all the business deals, and all the deals I've ever made this is the craziest.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Hey, take this one phone call. Some guy says, he disagrees with who you chose. I didn't I don't even know.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I don't know why or how you made the decision
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Are you ready for taking a phone call? Yeah, go ahead. Now on the receiving end quote that is very difficult for me. Who is this guy? Go ahead.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Big fan. Hey, I didn't disagree with whom Donald picked, but kind of, it's kind of a joke that he goes from selling lemonade. He's going to oversee the filming of a 100 story tower in Chicago. No one wants to do the lemonade was just it was really just a concept. And what we did is the first show was lemonade because the first business thing you do in your life, like me to is when you're five years old, you sell lemonade in front of your house with your parents standing over your shoulder hopefully. And I hated that task. But we're not like that. And I think, Mark Burnett was right, because people really related to it and it was the first task. After that we had sophisticated advertising campaigns and a lot of other things
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I thought it was funny actually, that's the one I saw or you're on the air.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Hey, Mr. Trump. It is an honor to speak to you sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> So it's the ultimate success. I worked every one of them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's nice. Thank you very much.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> In a hypothetical situation, I mean saying you're not involved with a lot here and there was no ethical backgrounds for business and whatnot. How many of those bitches, you think you could bang?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Good question.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I even like, I love the thought. I will tell you that, because they were attractive. You agree with it?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, I mean I can some of the bodies on those gaffes.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> When they arrive from any of them, could you could name one of them at least?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We like to say, that they were hired just exclusively for their brain.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Now Howard, don't hang up on me. Because I'd like to say that, I'm not an educated individual but I try to find myself well read. I would love to be a contestant on your next show even though I was unable to sign up because of my status right now. I'm working 15 hours a day trying to support three children, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have no one on your show, but let us say that NBC, that you know, we had, we had for the first show. The first sign that we had thought, it was going to be a success. We had 250,000 people apply, which is like a record on a television show. This show, we have over a million job applicants. So it's been an amazing phenomena, so what are you saying that you think people all that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right, one last question for Donald Trump.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Hey, Don? I want to ask you about a painting or the painting, that you've got to do a monologue on the club there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> You know I don't want to talk about think the want of me. I don't want to hear where I work out. Howard, did you see when you were down there?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> The painting of Donald?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I don't know.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> You know I was really kind of overwhelmed at the Big Ten foot painting, and with that one one foot upon the table it got like a pen. And I thought I look around the corner.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't believe it. It's a little wild.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And it kind of, paid of for him. I mean, I was there they were poor and we to go. Would you like some. I mean. I mean Mr. Trump water I go Oh Mr. Trump we're a big giant Petrum. The Donald on the on the water, on the water, on the big water bottle
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> It got a pretty crazy place.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, you know what I'm saying? It works for you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it has worked, I've had a lot of fun. You know I enjoy it. Well I said but this shows, you know how devastating, the clock can be. This is a failing that is taken a long time ago. And I think the artist did a little artistic freedom like I said I want those hips smaller shoulders.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. It's a painting, who cares? Captain Jenks, you're on the air.
<Thomas Cipriano> <Positive> I have two questions for you, one of what Howard, the joke that he played on everybody on April Fool's Day?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're right on Imus's show.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I was?
<Thomas Cipriano> <Positive> And I guess I'm just curious.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's interesting, I didn't know that. Now, Tom. You can go anywhere you want, of course. Why I'm issue has been so? He's a dickhead. Yeah. And you said it yourself he's a dickhead.
<Thomas Cipriano> <Positive> Well, you know it's on MSNBC. He really has been a big surprise. He loves the show.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And how he loves you because you're on top. But when you were when you were down the guy was in there for you.
<Thomas Cipriano> <Negative> I'm in a horrible and shameful person.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm surprised.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, since he loves the show anyway. Go ahead.
<Thomas Cipriano> <Negative> Certain question. Do you resent a phony phone call into work for you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Or, is that what?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You need a guy to make phony phone calls for you.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> This guy is the best.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> This guy is what I am looking for.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's just that's just what I'm looking for. Absolutely.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I don't know, that whole thing with Imus. I'm surprised with that that was that I did it. Yeah I really am.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean you talk to me privately, about what does that come to you? I tell you that out. I don't have chance to listen to radio very much but he's really been a big supporter of the show. He loves the show. He wanted to show what everyone is a quarter of an hour. You'll understand this. You have to stick with people that are loyal to you. You have to stick now, whether or not he's loyal. Now, because I have you know sort of, a hot period going they always have. I have had periods of gold.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He was nasty to you in terms of, he was hitting below the belt.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was saying some unfair things he was nasty in terms of the Ivanna thing. Yeah that's true.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Everybody knew she was just out to get your money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. She wasn't too interested in future nights. She was a nice woman who has truly, truly tried to utilize that. What I don't understand about of other she gets remarriage, you name changes with the husband. I guess you know at some point he said you got to stop this stuff. She then gets divorced and she goes back to the name Trump.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said, why didn't you keep your old name your nice Italian name? But it didn't work.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hey, listen. I got here Rebecca Romaine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I got to think she's great. Well listen, I'm very sorry about what happened with her, but it sounds like they are getting along just fine.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Believe me those two will be easy to be going on.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They seem to me somehow manage.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I saw her at the Jay Leno show the other night, she looks fantastic. We're going to fill her up right here on the way. You've done very well with her. Perhaps you caused her divorce.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I don't know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They you what too nice people. They're both very talented. They look great. And I think they will have no trouble.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Which is more important? Talent or looking great?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think, she is looking great.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I agree. I agree with you on this. Everyone knows that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've had I've had both and I think that would.
<Rebecca Romijn> <Positive> Be a better salesman in your corner than diamonds. I mean look, I mean we're back here by luck and she gets complimented by this guys right. And it's. Donald, did you say something positive about already lying?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, are they going to have to think about that.
<Rebecca Romijn> <Neutral> It's your first time, you get your tongue tied.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, my tongue is tied.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Mr. Trump? I want to congratulate you on the fantastic your show. I think and I always love when you call and you know that. Well and say hello to Rebecca. I will have a good time and good luck with your book.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah it's doing great. Okay thanks.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Mr. Donald Trump.
