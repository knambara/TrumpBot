<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well this is exciting. Donald Trump must have heard I was talking about the top 10 beautiful women list, and he has called in.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Is that right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Donald, good to speak to you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Howard, how you doing? I did. I was listening this morning and I heard you talking about the list.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Let me tell you that I congratulate you again on innovating something I believe this list like People magazine's most beautiful people.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> He said the most beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I believe this list will become an important list that women may want to be on.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know the People magazine is highly political. Mine might be highly political because as I look at the names, I will tell you it is highly politicized now.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I was gonna say this can really be a list.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I mean, you even say you're beautiful girlfriend --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let's say five are legit. Five or 100% and five are political but I can't tell you which one.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm gonna guess if I may, the -- on your list you mentioned your beautiful girlfriend, and she is beautiful, Melania Knauss, and you say she is the number one woman in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She really does deserve to be there, she's really amazing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She certainly deserves to be on your top 10. But you put her number one perhaps, is political, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You actually put her number one on your list too, I know this stuff.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, I did.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I didn't know what to do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She is rather amazing, I will say that. So she could be -- she could be right there.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Sure, she --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now, I know everybody -- I know everybody on the list, Robin.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Let me talk to you about the list because I want to understand.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right. Is this going to be a yearly event?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This may be is going to be, you have no idea. Star magazine is owned by a great guy, a friend of mine. He said, Donald, we have to tell the story but you have to pick the top 10. And they gave me about three seconds to get in 10 minutes. You know it's a little tough.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You didn't put that much thought in this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm sitting there in between deals and I'm rattling off names. So, you know, when I see the names I said, Oh my god, did I really say that?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And what's funny about it is you could have used this list have you had time to think about for women that you really want to go to bed with because this would be a great honor to be mentioned.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've already been called by three people on the list who I don't even know thanking me for putting them on the list.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who was this Rigg?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can't tell you, I'm gonna get in so much trouble with this. But -- but five of the people really wouldn't be on the list.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Five of them wouldn't even make the list.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right, let me go through your list because everyone is talking about the list.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right, here we go.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Howard even tried to hone and make his own list.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. I'm trying to make my own list.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I heard this list, Robin. You know what, I listen and I have a meeting like this really important meeting and I'm listening and he is doing his list and I couldn't turn it off and I was 20 minutes late from my meeting.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Here is what you say, number 10, Diane Sawyer a 54-year-old woman, I would imagine that that is a political comment.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, she is really a quality woman and she has done interviews with me and she's been so nice and I have a lot of respect for her.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right, let's call that. So in other words if we were going to get your real top 10 you are not hot for Diane Sawyer.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's -- she's a happily married woman. So I'm sure she wouldn't want that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You sound so friendly. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> In other words --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know what, she's done some nice interviews with me, Howard. Not everybody has.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It was a payback.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right, right, right. Number nine, now this one, I hope is political. Because I don't see it, Gwyneth Paltrow.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, actually the writer suggested a couple of names to me. Because you know, after --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You run out?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, I was just doing a deal on General Motors building and then I'm a being hit with this question. Who are your 10 favorite women, and he gave me some names. But she's really very nice, I met her once, she is very nice
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I think what happened here is you didn't realize how big your list was going to become. And how did you known how important these slots are.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, next year I'm gonna take 10 minutes to think about it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Excellent. Now, Gwyneth Paltrow, she is too skinny for you and she is not all that sexy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she's a very fine actress.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> All right. Leave it at that, that seems political.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He's locked out of many of her pictures.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm gonna suggest that Gwyneth Paltrow is on it because the reporter just said, hey, Donald is like, I have three seconds.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I was rushing him off the phone.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I think next year's list is going to be the big one.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's gonna be the list. That's the one I'm willing to waiting.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's right. Number eight, Mariah Carey that I can see.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she's got something.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She sure does.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good voice. She's got something.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> There's something sexy that you want to bang her, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There's something nice about her.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Would you bang her? Let's forget about [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would do it without even hesitation
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Exactly, me too. So, I buy that. I find her sexy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> There are guys who think, no, but I like that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A lot of people disagree with us on that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Number seven, Cindy Crawford. I don't believe that you still find her all that attractive.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Her husband is a tenant of mine in one of my buildings. [Inaudible] is a great guy and I think she's very attractive.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She's a good looking woman but she's not -- what she -- she's not --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> So far, we've got three people who wouldn't have been on the list.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. Cindy Crawford now is 34 years old.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am officially saying that, Robin. I'm just saying, you know, I'm not telling you which ones wouldn't. So, just to keep myself out of a little bit of trouble. Robin, every time I do this program I get huge trouble.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You said that you -- you would sleep with Cindy Crawford, of course.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would, without question.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Me too, but you have to admit she's hit something on the wall, right?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> She's not in the top.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> She's not in the top 10, she's no Melania Knauss.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, her husband is doing beautifully at his restaurant. [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Political. I think the husband should've been on the list. Number six, Julia Roberts. I agree with that, I don't think that that was political.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, the one thing you have to say about her, she's a true movie star.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In a world where there are -- You know, you look at some of these people you look at that -- I won't even mention names but some of the people, they're terrible. And they're movie stars.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> When she smiles, she wins you over.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's an amazing talent, right. So, let's keep her on the list.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Keep her on the list. Number five, Cameron Diaz. Now I've heard, up-close, without the makeup, and without the movie camera on, she's a mess.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, I look at this picture that they have in the magazine.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And she looks magnificent. But I did see her once at Mumba.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it was about 2:00 in the morning and I was surprised.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Were you feeling no pain.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I was -- I'm not a big drinker, so.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay. Yes. So, you -- you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was a little bit surprised, she was a little different than I thought.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know guys --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> So, she's not really on your list.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'll tell you something, I know guys I'll tell you what happened to Cameron Diaz. He was searching for names that were used in rush.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That was probably a suggestion that was made.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That was a suggestion.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I know a guy, regular guy, not a rich guy like yourself. He was at a bar one night and this girl kept coming onto him, this was years ago he told me, and lo and behold after he blew her off, someone said to him afterwards that was Cameron Diaz. Literally she was not that hot.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But she is much different looking in person.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Number four, you say Michelle Pfeiffer.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right, now, you know, really from a number of years ago she was one of the -- she was really beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You agree with that?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. But I don't find her sexy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't find her that sexy. Well it's a long complicated story. I don't find her that sexy right now, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. Exactly. Because she --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But it was a suggestion.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Forty-two. All right, anyway --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, I would like to hear the story, a long complicated story.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, listen, she probably ended up on the list again because you were you were [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There were some names that were thrown out because I said, listen I have a meeting, I have to go. They said, what about this one, what about that one? But I think she's great, and I think she's another real movie star.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> All right. Now --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You should have a really talented good movie star.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I never get this thing with Lady Diana. You're very gracious to her.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> He really liked Lady Di.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I tell you what, I think she's magnificent. Lady Di was truly a woman with great beauty. I've seen her a couple of times.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You would have slept with her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Without even hesitation.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> He wishes he had the opportunity.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, here's the truth to that, Robin. She was really beautiful, and people didn't realize that beautiful. She was supermodel beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Isn't it amazing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She had the height, she had the beauty, she had the skin, the whole thing. [Inaudible].
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You've dealt with that before.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. You've dealt with that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I have dealt with that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Number two on your list which was very, very political of you but smart. This is why I consider you a bright guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Wasn't that brilliant, Howard?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You put the ex-Mrs. Trump, Ivana there.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I noticed you did the same thing and put her on the same slot.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, I do.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But you have another ex, I wonder why --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He's mad at Marla Maples right now. You're angry that she's selling off the diamond engagement ring.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> An auction -- an auction of a ring is a little tacky. You know I don't mind selling it. I mean, let's face it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She's having an auction of Donald Trump's ring, the ring that he gave her for her engagement.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I think that was pretty bad.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> In other words, if she's got enough money she don't need to be going to an auction.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I didn't spend too much on the ring, that's the good news.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> When's her garage sale?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know, but it's -- You know, in all places just taking place in Michigan I thought that was interesting also.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's the Mecca for auction.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It is?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So, Mrs. Trump, Ivana you put on there, that was very great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I thought it was good. And if you followed soon, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Is she treating you particularly well, is that why you put her on?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know if that's true. She keeps taking my money so, you know.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> How did she keep --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How does she keep getting money from you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The checks never stop.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I thought it was a lump sum?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's for the children, and for this, for that -- It just seems never to stop.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Money is just never enough. By the way, I saw that you're upset with your daughter for posing sexy.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I was surprised she wasn't on the list.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's her daughter. Please, Robin. That would've been weird.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That would've been a fun thing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Would you like me to put her on my list?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Not necessarily, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Maybe I'll date your daughter. Not necessarily dating either. What is it --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I tell you, she's very good person. She probably find you very attractive.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> Hey, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. Go ahead, Gary.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> I met Donald's ex-wife and his daughter at this charity event a couple of weeks ago. They were auctioning off sarongs for -- for charity. And you know she's doing okay, she bought a couple $2000 or $3000 sarongs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's beautiful. Ivanka's really beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Ivanka bought them or Ivana?
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> Ivana.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Ivana bought them. [Inaudible} I hope that wasn't the money for the children.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, well probably.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And number one, of course, smart again, supermodel Melania cup.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she probably in all fairness, beyond brains, probably deserves it. I mean, she is really beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I've never met the woman, but I know --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's full of illustrated swimsuit. She's in everything and she's, you know, she's truly a beauty, so
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you still monogamous with her still?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Oh, yeah. Of course.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What do you mean still?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, I mean in the last couple of weeks.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Are you going being monogamous now?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You mean for the last month? Well, for the last month have you been monogamous?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And you're enjoying being with one woman?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like it out, Howard. You know, I also -- I think the concept of marriage --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You know what [Inaudible] the article
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You need a marriage every month.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Donald, I love you, you know that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know that.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> And you know started talking about marriage, you're really funny. You have believed in the institution.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I really believe in the institution of marriage.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> If you get married again I'm gonna lock you in an institution.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a crazy [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It's not for you, it's not-. Is Melania pressure you to get married?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, she hasn't. She handles it exactly right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And where is she now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I'm in my office.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right, and where is she, you left her in the bed?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She just is someplace else.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Now I thought he was fine living with this time --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know the last time the heat I took from this program when I was thinking about being a politician for about 15 seconds.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, you're too busy making list. You know what I'm talking --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. But I did the show and you said, where is Melania?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Melania.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's right here and you said does she had clothing on.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And it sort of came out that there wasn't a lot of clothing on.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> There was nothing on.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And it was only a front page story in The New York Times post.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> And it was like, how can our president be having this conversation.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, no.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Why not? [Inaudible] president. I'll be all right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he did.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He dropped the conversation.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He got caught.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Melania. Yes. Oh, lovely.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She is really a beauty.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But you're not living with her again, are you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I've been on and off, semi.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really. She gets to live in the Trump Estate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, It's a beautiful apartment, I will say.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, he's probably got 50 of them around the city.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, yeah. I know you've got broads on the side.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My apartment's beautiful, Howard. It's not as good a building as Trump International.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Of course, Trump International is the number one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That is number one.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It is. Now all your buildings are. But listen I am glad you've made this list. You have set a new trend once again and I believe this will become a very important list.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I think it should and in fact, I can see TV show out of this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what, next year, Robin, I'm going to do a better list.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I think you should put some thought into this
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Really. I have to devote at least a couple of minutes of thought.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I mean, Gwyneth Paltrow, please, Diane Sawyer, I mean, let's be honest. All right. Anyway, Donald Trump thank you so much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You guys are great. Have a good time.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Good luck to you. And you know we always love when you call and the Great Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good to talk to you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Thank you, Robin.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Thank you, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So long, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Once again Donald Trump has innovated by creating a top 10 list. It's very good.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> Horny.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> We're going to work on our list.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You guys really -- You tell him to give it some thought.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, I'm really work on it. You know what, I'm really put some phone into make a real list.
