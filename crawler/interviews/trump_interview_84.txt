<Question> <Negative> Let's get the news of the day out at the top. There's all of these things that are being discussed about the chief of staff, about Kirstjen Nielsen. Why are you disappointed in the DHS secretary and is John Kelly going to be staying in his job right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, you know, always in an administration after the midterms you make changes, so, I'm looking at things and I've got a lot of options. A lot of people want to come in. A lot of politicians that have had very successful careers that are very good want to come in. So I'm looking at things -- haven't made a decision yet.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will be making a decision on Homeland shortly. But I have not made decisions yet. But I will be making changes on various things. Overall, I have a very good cabinet. I think our cabinet's great. You know, you're talking about a few names, you're not talking about many. Uh, we've been doing incredibly on trade deals and trade with my whole staff of traders, because that's what they are.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What we've done on trade deals is incredible -- with Mexico, with Canada, with South Korea -- taking deals that were horrible and making great deals. And now we're in the midst of China and others. But we have a great cabinet, we have -- we'll see, uh, there will be some changes made before the end of the year.
<Question> <Positive> Sure. Could you tell us where your thinking is currently on the attorney general position? I know you're happy with Matthew Whitaker, do you have any names? Chris Christie --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Matthew Whitaker is a very respected man. He's -- and he's, very importantly, he's respected within DOJ. I heard he got a very good decision, I haven't seen it. Kellyanne, did I hear that?
<Kellyanne Conway> <Neutral> 20 pages.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A 20-page?
<Question> <Neutral> It just came out right before this, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I heard it was a very strong opinion. Uh, which is good. But he is just somebody that's very respected. I knew him only as he pertained, you know, as he was with Jeff Sessions. And, you know, look, as far as I'm concerned this is an investigation that should have never been brought. It should have never been had.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's something that should have never been brought. It's an illegal investigation. And you know, it's very interesting because when you talk about not Senate confirmed, well, Mueller's not Senate confirmed.
<Question> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's heading this whole big thing, he's not Senate confirmed. So anyway, I have a lot of respect for Matt Whitaker, based primarily on reputation. And I think he's really -- I think a lot of people are starting to come out very much in favor of him during this period of time.
<Question> <Neutral> What about who will eventually replace him, sir?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm looking at a lot of people. I have been called by so many people wanting that job. We have some great people. In the meantime, I think Matt's going to do a fantastic job.
<Question> <Negative> Banning Jim Acosta. Taking his White House credentials. His hard pass. Is this going to be something that happens with repeated nature inside of the White House? Who you feel are disrespecting the White House, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Your world has changed quite a bit and you have grandstanders much more than you did before. He's just a grandstander. He's just an average guy who's a grandstander. And he's got the guts to stand up and, you know, and shout. It's primarily led by CNN because they pay him to do that. CNN is low on the ratings now, relative to Fox and others, and they're doing very poorly actually.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But because of me -- the age of Trump -- because of me, they're doing better than they've done but they're doing very poorly in compared to others. Very very poorly. And, um, and getting worse. They've lost a tremendous amount of credibility and, you know, Jim Acosta's just somebody that gets up and grandstands.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He doesn't even know what he's asking half of the time. So, we'll see how the court case goes. It's today.
<Question> <Positive> Are you confident that you're going to win the court case?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know, I think that we should. Certainly, you shouldn't be able to go up into a White House and, on principle, it's very disrespectful to the rest of the press. You were actually getting up to do a question.
<Question> <Neutral> That's right, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- And this guy's screaming. And I kept saying to you, "come on," you didn't give me much help. I kept saying, "give me the question already." But, you know, he just screamed and, you know, you knew it because you're standing, you didn't know what to do, and I understand that. He was very rude to the young lady.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I won't, I won't even -- who knows. Who knows. Certainly, he didn't act very respectful to the press. He's actually more disrespectful, I think, to the rest of the media. Because he gets up and grandstands and he wants to ask three or four questions and everyone else is, you know, you're trying to get one question in and the room was packed with a couple of hundred people that want to ask questions.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I think he's very disrespectful to the media, I think he's very disrespectful to the office, and I think he's bad for the public. You know, when I say that the fake news is the enemy of the people, it really is. A lot of the animosity that we have in our country is because of fake news. They're so angry at the news.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They get it. You guys are at my rallies all the time, you see the anger when I mention the words "fake news" and they turn around. And they use CNN because they -- it just sort of works for them I guess. But it's ABC, it's -- NBC is maybe worse than anybody. I mean, NBC's a total fraud as far as I'm concerned.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Their news is disgusting. But I think NBC is as bad as anybody. You look at -- and CBS -- you look at what's going on with the fake news and the people get it. Now they get it -- you know they had a very high approval rating before I became president and I think it's actually a great achievement of mine.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Their approval rating now is down as low as just about anybody. And much lower than your president. I actually have good approval ratings, which nobody ever writes. I was at 51, I guess, with Rasmussen the other day. So I will say that I really think that when you have guys like Acosta, I think they're bad for the country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because they show how fake it all is. And it's a grandstander, and we'll see how the court rules. You know, then they talk, "Oh, freedom of the press." But can you really have -- is it freedom of the press? It's actually the opposite. Is it freedom of the press when somebody comes in and starts screaming questions and won't sit down after having answered a couple of them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then won't sit down and then I can't ask you guys because he's standing -- I don't think that's freedom of the press, I actually think that's the opposite.
<Question> <Negative> Which is an important follow-up question, why this administration? This doesn't seem to be the norm. It certainly wasn't the norm in previous administrations, that reporters behave in this capacity.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think they behaved badly. I remember Sam Donaldson was terrible at two presidents, and, you know, we tend to forget. I think that now it's become, with cable television, playing such a role, although, you know, cable television was supposed to be a dying medium. And because of me it's now hotter than it's ever been.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But someday I won't be here and it will die like you've never seen. And so will The New York Times -- will die -- and every one of them will just be dead. I mean, look, I remember picking up before I announced for president, I picked up The New York Times and I said to somebody, "Boy, this paper is dead, look at it." The paper was dead.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was like a leaflet that you hand out at the supermarket, and now it's a vibrant paper. But you look at the stories, many of the stories on the front page are about me. You know, all my life I told this story, had stories on the front page. A few, not a big deal. Which wasn't bad, you know, maybe seven, but, you know, a few.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, you know, now if I have a few each day it's surprisingly low. But it has made a big difference.
<Question> <Positive> Sir, I do want to turn to policy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's why I always joke when I say they'll all be endorsing me. Cause I don't know what happens to their business after I'm gone.
<Question> <Negative> Sir, right now, in 2010 we saw several pieces of major legislation passed in a lame-duck Congress. What can we expect your and the Republican agenda to be in this Congress? Is it going to be an immigration fix? What about criminal justice reform? What are the two to three things you're looking at?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're working on many things. Criminal justice reform we're working on very hard. We have a meeting today, do you know about that? We have a meeting today.
<Question> <Neutral> We heard about that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Get these two in, alright? I think we have a chance at that. We should be able to fix health care. We should be able --
<Question> <Negative> Just one second, sir, on that criminal justice bill. Is that the Jared Kushner-backed bill that you want to focus on?
<Joe Bruno> <Positive> Thank you so much for coming.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The answer is I'm looking at it very closely, okay? I am. It's a good thing. You know, Texas is backing it, if you look at Mississippi and Georgia and a lot of other places, they believe in it, those governors, and they're conservative people. Rick Perry's a big fan. You know, a lot of people are backing it. Look at the people that are backing it. Even, you know, like Mike Lee, he votes against a lot of things and we respect Mike and Mike is backing it. We have a lot of people that are backing this.
<Question> <Negative> What about immigration, sir? Are you willing to shut down the government if you don't get a certain set of policies?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I may be. I may be. I'll have to see how it plays out. But I may very well be willing to shut down the government. I think it's horrible what's happening and, you know, building the wall, it's in smaller stages, we can build it very quickly. I'm building the wall in smaller stages and we moved the military there, we put up barbed wire, we did all sorts of things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have to have a barrier. You have to have a barrier. Look, we have a chance of, they can do presidential harassment, put very simply, and I'll be very good at handling that and I think I'll be better than anybody in the history of this office. And in a certain way I look forward to it because I actually think it's good for me politically, because everyone knows it's pure harassment.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Just like the witch hunt, the Mueller witch hunt. It's pure harassment. It's horrible. It's horrible that they're allowed to get away with it. Again, not Senate confirmed but, you know. You have 17 people -- half, many of them worked for Hillary Clinton, some on the Foundation. The Hillary Clinton Foundation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, you think of it. So, I think we'll do very well if they want to play the presidential harassment game. If they play the presidential harassment game I don't think anything's going to be done 'cause why would I do that, okay? If they want to get things done I think it will be fantastic, I think we can get a lot done.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we can almost get more done because they're gonna want to prove something, too. So if they wanna do health care, we can do health care. There a very good fixes to health care that could solve a lot of problems. We've really, you know, terminated a lot of the Obamacare, as it was referred to. But we could do a new health care bill that would be fantastic that could take everybody's -- that could incorporate good pieces of everybody's good ideas.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So there's a chance at that, there's a great chance at comprehensive immigration reform. If they wanna do it, they wanna do it, they wanna do it right. And there's a good chance at doing things that maybe you couldn't do. Don't forget, I didn't really have a majority. I had one senator. And I had a few Republicans in the House.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you very much.
<Joe Bruno> <Negative> What made you want to come down and have a rally for Mr. Harris and Congressman Budd? Are you worried about their seats?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I just think they're fantastic people. They're going to be great congressmen. They are, in one case, and they're going to be great congressman, and for the long term we need the vote. And they're very popular, and we just want to make sure everything works out well, and we have a tremendous crowd. But these are two great people and we need them.
<Joe Bruno> <Negative> Mr. Harris says -- has a lot of protests against gay marriage and frequently protests against abortion. Do you agree with him on those issues, and are those issues that you're hoping that your new conservative majority Supreme Court takes up and overturns?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm going to be looking at that, because I know he has very strong positions on things, and I don't know exactly what his particular -- everyone's a little bit different, but we're going to be looking at his positions. But I can tell you, he's a very popular guy in the area. They really like him a lot.
<Joe Bruno> <Positive> Are those issues that you want the Supreme Court to take up?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they might take 'em up. We're going to have to let the Justices decide. They will be deciding. We just have a brand new great, one as you know. First of all we have Judge Gorsuch, who is fantastic and Justice Kavanaugh now, so they're going to make that decision. They will be making those decisions.
<Joe Bruno> <Neutral> We have a new owner for the Panthers, David Tepper.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, a very small number. Um, and now the pressure's on them because they've gotta come to me with things. Hey, the beauty is, and I've said this, you heard me at the news conference, I don't know if you agree with me -- let's say I won with two Republicans or three. I'd have to make deals with Republicans.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd have guys coming to me, you know, out of that group there'll be people. Let's not say they're good or bad but they're people: "well I don't want to do this." Well, I'm gonna have three or more. I mean, literally, unless I had like a 25 majority, you know, something substantial, they would come to me and they would say, "well, I don't like it." You wouldn't even be able to get something through there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It would be too close. Where I am now, when they have a small majority, I can sit back and say, "hey." And the beauty is when it gets passed, when we pass things, we'll get it passed in the Senate, which now we can't because we need 10 Democrat votes. Because we'll have Democrats and I'll be able to get enough Republicans to pass.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But the beauty is, the beauty is that we actually have something that can work much better than it worked before, because before it was politically very difficult for a lot of people.
<Question> <Negative> While we're on the subject of Congress, I do want to get -- does Kevin McCarthy have your full endorsement in the speaker's race?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I didn't endorse because I stay out of it, but I like Kevin a lot and I like Jim a lot. I like both of 'em.
<Question> <Positive> How would you like them to work it out?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Who else is running, nobody, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure.
<Joe Bruno> <Negative> He has been critical of you at times. Recently, he said it's dead wrong to accuse NFL players of being unpatriotic. I'm wondering if you have a response to Mr. Tepper, but also, Mr. President, why are you opposed to NFL players protesting racism -- racism and police brutality in this way?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll tell you what I'm doing. I'm -- I want people to stand for the national anthem, to stand for our flag. I think most people agree with me. I think that's been pretty well proven. I want them to stand for our great country. I want 'em to stand for the flag, and stand for our national anthem, and if somebody disagrees with that, that's fine. That's what we're all about. We're about freedom of expression, and let them have that expression. But for me, they have to stand.
<Joe Bruno> <Negative> What's the difference between Eric Reid, a Panthers player protesting during the anthem, and Mr. Harris protesting outside of a women's health clinic?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's up to them. You know, they can do whatever they want. But I want people standing. If it was up to me, I'm have them standing, and I would have made that ruling as commissioner. In fact, I like the commissioner. He just thanked me. We did a big favor for the NFL, with respect to Canada, which you probably heard, in their advertising, they're having a tremendous problem. But it was up to me, and if I were the commissioner, I'd make them stand.
<Joe Bruno> <Negative> Will you be changing your rhetoric at all with your rallies because the whole pipe bomb incident?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you take a look at what's outside. We have tremendous fans. We have tremendous rallies. In Houston, we just had a 109,000 people accept, and we were in the Rockets arena, 22,000 people, 51,000 people outside. I better not change too much.
<Question> <Positive> That's all there is right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I like both of 'em a lot. I think Jim is a fantastic guy and I think Kevin's a fantastic guy. They're very different but Kevin is a very political person, which is good. He's a very honorable guy, and I think he's gonna do great, and it looks like, you know, he'll probably get it.
<Question> <Positive> Would you like to see Jim on the ranking member on Judiciary?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would like to see Jim in a high position 'cause he deserves it. He's fantastic, but I haven't gotten into the endorsement or not. I just like both of 'em too much, too much to get very much involved. It's something I shouldn't be involved in. But Jim is a fantastic guy and Kevin is a fantastic guy and they're very different and they complement each other.
<Question> <Negative> Broward County election commissioner Brenda Snipes is in violation of Florida law. She's in violation of Florida reporting laws, she's in violation of a judge's order. She's also reportedly mixed in illegal ballots with legal ballots and asked for them to be counted. Is she behaving criminally and should she be removed?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, you know, the bottom line -- it's, she's a disaster. You look at her past, she's a disaster. Even with me. I won Florida and, you remember? That area, Broward, didn't come in. It didn't come in. I think Palm Beach was like -- they wouldn't call Florida, I won. Then it got to a point where I won by enough that all the votes of the people that lived there would, you know, in other words -- you can only put in so many votes, although she may change that system.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You can only put in a number of people that are registered voters or live there. Now they're, I guess they were trying to take illegal voters but these are -- I've been saying, this is a problem all over the country, by the way. This is what I've been saying. This is a problem in California that's so bad of illegals voting.
<Joe Bruno> <Negative> Some Democrats say that you should take responsibility for what this man did sending pipe bombs to more than a dozen people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, then I guess Bernie Sanders would have to take responsibility, and the Democrats would have to take responsibility when people do horrible things, and they happen to be Democrats. It's very simple. But they would have to take responsibility. We have tremendous people. We have a fan base, and a base period, that's just been incredible, and we're very proud of it. And we think this is horrible, what took place.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But that happens, and recently as you know, Steve Scalise, Congressman, was shot by somebody that really liked, I guess, Bernie Sanders in that case, and the Democrats, and people don't bring that up. But I bring it up.
<Joe Bruno> <Positive> Republican National Convention will be here not too long from now. Are you excited about having it here in Charlotte, and was -- is there any concern about the debate that led up to it, because, you know, there were several Democrats who were against hosting this convention.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I didn't hear that. I heard they wanted it very badly in Charlotte. I'm -- you know, I have a job right next to Lake Norman. I love the whole area. I love the area, the place. I've actually spoken to this -- in the facility quite a few times. It's a great -- it's a great arena. It's going to be a fantastic thing. It's going to bring hundreds of millions of dollars to the state, or at least something close to that. You saw the numbers, they were pretty amazing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Your mayor was fantastic. Your mayor really wanted it badly -- who is a Democrat -- and the people want it. So, we're really happy. We think it's a -- it's a tremendous state. I won the state of North Carolina. We've done a great job with respect to the hurricane. We've gotten A+ marks on the hurricane, and we're continuing to work. It was a bad one, but we're continuing to work, and we look forward to being here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is a California problem and if you notice, almost every race -- I was watching today -- out of like 11 races that are in question they're gonna win all of them. The Republicans don't win and that's because of potentially illegal votes, which is what I've been saying for a long time. I have no doubt about it. And I've seen it, I've had friends talk about it when people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It's really a disgrace what's going on. The disgrace is that, voter ID. If you buy, you know, a box of cereal, if you do anything, you have a voter ID. Well, over here, the only thing you don't is if you're a voter of the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A voter in the United States of America. I think it's a disgrace what's going on. Really a disgrace. And they try to shame everybody by calling them racist or calling them something, anything they can think of, when you say you want voter ID. But voter ID is a very important thing. If you look at what happened in New Hampshire, where thousands of people came up and voted from a very liberal part of Massachusetts and they came up in buses and they voted.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said, "what's going on over here," my people said, "you won New Hampshire easily except they have tremendous numbers of buses coming up." They're pouring up by the hundreds, buses of people getting out, voting. Then they're supposed to go back within 90 days. And of the people that are supposed to go back, almost none of them do. In other words, they go back after the vote is over.
<Joe Bruno> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They go back -- and I think it's like three percent -- I mean, almost nobody goes back to show that, you know, that they were allowed to vote. And so what do you do? Recall the election. Recall the election. I mean, there, you should be able to recall the election.
<Question> <Neutral> You think they should call Florida right now, sir?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Uh, I think they should've called Florida election evening. Well, many votes were added to that, and, you know what's going on. And now they have mixed them up. You said it better than I did. They mixed the votes up and now you can't find the ones that were put in, they just put 'em into a batch. When they call this woman incompetent, they're wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's very competent but in a bad way.
<Question> <Neutral> Should she be removed from office?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, she should have been removed -- I think she should have been removed in the middle of this mix-up.
<Question> <Positive> How do you prevent this in 2020? From happening when you run for re-election?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> First thing you do is fire her and her cronies. You get 'em out of -- you get 'em out. And it should have been done, I mean, if there's anything really that I would be -- because, again, in the 2016 election, you guys remember, remember how long it took to get Florida?
<Question> <Neutral> It took a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Had I not been winning Florida by more than they could -- I mean, you can't produce -- if you have a million people, you can't give 1,200,000 votes, okay? So actually, what happened is they went with fairly accurate numbers because whether I won by 10 votes or by half a million votes it didn't matter. But I had, fortunately, enough votes, and they were sitting there waiting.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They said, "Broward County is not reporting." This went on for hours.
<Kellyanne Conway> <Neutral> The Panhandle came in an hour later.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the Panhandle was so devastating to Crooked Hillary, that, frankly, it didn't make any difference, okay? Because the Panhandle was so -- it was like 98 percent. That thing came in, then all of a sudden Broward came in. And I won by, you know, I won by a lot of votes. I call it four Yankee Stadiums.
<Question> <Negative> Sir, as a resident of both D.C. and New York City, what do you think about Amazon's relocation and the decision of both Virginia and New York to give billions of subsidies to Amazon. Do you support that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think they're paying a very big price. I think that it was a competition. I know all about those competitions, I've been in those competitions, you know, and it's a lot of people, a lot of cities who are competing for it. They took the best deals.
<Question> <Positive> So you support the cities giving them tax breaks?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think they're giving up a lot. They're very expensive deals. Only time will tell. Maybe Amazon will have massive competition and they won't be the same company in five years, in which case it will be a big mistake. You know, Amazon could have -- I see Walmart is doing very well and others are building sites.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think that's going to be a very competitive business someday, Amazon. And I'm not sure that size necessarily helps when you get --
<Question> <Negative> Do you still think they're cheating the U.S. postal system?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I think they're getting the bargain of the century. I think that Amazon's getting -- and that's why I've asked for a review of that. And others too, you know, not just Amazon. There are classes of companies that are getting the bargain and I think that -- I may be wrong about this, you'll check -- but I think the contract they signed with Amazon was a closed contract.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You can't even see it. It was a sealed contract. No, I think Amazon has the bargain of the century with the U.S. Post Office, which is losing a fortune.
<Question> <Negative> Tucker Carlson had his house attacked, he had a mob outside of his house while his wife was home. They cracked the door -- what is this violence? Where does it come from? Do you have a message for Tucker and his family?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do, I spoke to Tucker and I think Tucker's a great guy and I think it's terrible, they were actually trying to break down the door.
<Question> <Neutral> How do you think the police should handle Antifa, generally?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These people, like the Antifa you're talking about, the Antifa -- they better hope that the opposition to Antifa decides not to mobilize. Because if they do, they're much tougher. Much stronger. Potentially much more violent. And Antifa's going to be in big trouble. But so far they haven't done that, and that's a good thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But they better hope that the other side doesn't mobilize, you understand what I'm saying. Because if you look, the other side is the military, it's the police, it's a lot of very strong, a lot of very tough people. Tougher than them. And smarter than them. And they're sitting back and watching and they're getting angrier and angrier.
<Question> <Neutral> What's your takeaway from the 2018 election and what do you think that means for 2020 for you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think I did very well. Because if you look at -- Obama was 60-something odd House seats and lost seven Senate seats. So we picked up three or four Senate seats depending on how it all goes -- it's a big pickup. In fact, they say in 80 years I think the presidential party's only picked up two Senate seats, I picked up three.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, assuming that they don't do any further shenanigans in Florida. Almost picked up Tester. Almost picked up, you know, if you look -- and that was somebody that wasn't even in play. And that was another one at the very last moment, all of a sudden, that was over. Almost picked up Arizona and that was another one that I question, I have to question that more strongly than our candidate, a wonderful person.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But she didn't question strongly, so I'm not going to, but I think that was very odd the way that all happened in Arizona. But we picked up -- I mean, it looked like we picked up five. But probably three. It's a lot. I think this -- if I didn't go around, and you were there, you saw the crowd -- in the history of politics, and I say this proudly, I wasn't even running.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In the history of politics nobody's ever gotten crowds like that or close because you were in those stadiums and those arenas, but outside you had many more times -- you know, in Houston we had 109,000 people sign up for 22,000 seats. We actually took ads saying, "please don't come" and that helped Ted Cruz a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So if you look at Ted Cruz, and you look at some of the people that won, they wouldn't have won without my helping them. And then you look at the new senators, you look at Indiana, Donnelly was not going to happen. Nobody said Donnelly was going to lose. Nobody said -- even look at a case of a congressman.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I couldn't help too many congressmen because I don't have that much time. The only congressman I went for was Andy Barr and that was in Kentucky, Mitch was there but he wasn't running, and Rand Paul was there. Good guy, Rand Paul, by the way. And he was there, and the only congressman -- I specifically went, there was no senator running in Kentucky, it was Andy Barr, and he won nicely.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he was down 10 and he won his race. Every place I went, look at Georgia, I'm assuming he wins. That's another one now they're trying to play around with the votes. Honestly, it's a disgrace what's going on. Oprah went, Obama went, and Michelle Obama went. They went, and they spent a lot of time, and I went and did a rally, and the real number was probably 55,000 people, cause, you know, were you there in Georgia?
<Question> <Neutral> Not Georgia, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because we had a hangar, another hangar holding 18,000 at the top of the hangar. These are massive, like 747 hangars. It went way back, and he won. And everybody said he wasn't going to win. But they had Obama, Mrs. Obama and Oprah. Oprah spent three days there and every place I went, we won or came real close with areas, like, as an example, Tester.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Tester, nobody wanted even to contest it. Well, look at what happened in North Dakota with Heidi. Heidi, they said don't contest. One year ago when we were looking, they all said don't contest Heidi, she can't be beat. She lost by a lot. I went there three or four times. I mean, the truth is, every place I went, we either won or did well or did really well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I didn't go, if I didn't do those stops -- I did 31 stops in 30 days or something like that. If I didn't do those stops, I think we would've lost 10 Senate seats, seven to 10 Senate seats, and we would've lost 60 to 70 House seats or more. By doing the stops, then again a lot of times I'd have the congressmen in the room, so they wouldn't be the prime focus but I'd get up and I'd be able to talk about them for a couple of minutes apiece, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I didn't do the stops -- and I've been thanked by a lot of Republicans -- if I didn't do those stops we would definitely not have control of the Senate. It would be a question, so what are we up, three? Two or three. We would be down five or six or seven. And they know that. Nobody has ever had a greater impact.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll give you another. You take Georgia. He was 10 points down when I endorsed him, he ended up winning by 40 points in the primary. He's now in, but he was 10 points down. It was 70 to 30, something like that, 70-30 or 70-40, maybe 70-40. But it was an easy win. Take DeSantis. Ron DeSantis was a three, had no money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He was running against in the Republican primary, who was at 31 and he had $21 million cash in the bank. The Department of Agriculture, right? Nice guy, too. But I didn't know him so I don't feel guilty. I endorsed DeSantis. I endorsed DeSantis and he won by 20 points. Okay, it wasn't even a race. And his opponent, who I spoke to afterward because he is a nice guy, he said, "I've never seen anything like it." He said, "you endorsed him, the race was over." There's never been an impact -- I don't say it braggingly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, it's hard for me to say it because I'd rather have them say it but they don't say it very well. No, there's never been a story, nobody ever writes it. But you take a look at the races that I was involved in, I had a massive impact. Then they said, "well, DeSantis is not gonna make it in Florida, he's never gonna get elected." So I went down and made a speech, he got elected, he won.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now they're trying to take votes away from him, it's a disgrace what's going on, but it looks like he's gonna be good and hopefully, Rick is gonna be good. Maybe the machines are bad, now the machines are all smokey, they're all -- it's crazy. Honestly, it's a disgrace. Georgia, what they're doing is a disgrace, and Florida, what they're doing to the two people -- no, to the three.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look at what they're doing, how about the agriculture guy. He was leading all night long and then he ends up losing by 5,000 votes because nobody was watching that one. That's a very important position in Florida, right? Pretty impressive if I do say so myself.
<Alex Marlow> <Positive> We have Donald J. Trump on the line, Republican candidate for president. Good morning, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning.
<Alex Marlow> <Positive> You're on Breitbart News Daily with Alex Marlow. A pleasure to speak to you. So let's talk about where we stand right now. You guys have been rallying late into the night.
<Alex Marlow> <Positive> How much energy are these crowds giving you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Unbelievable energy. They had, we had to have close to 30,000 people in Michigan at 1 o'clock in the morning, because, you know, we added it on at the end. We're doing great in Michigan, and they're great people, and the car business has been taken away and so much has happened. And so we, we were in New Hampshire, which was incredible, that big arena, and it was packed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I guess, I mean it was just packed, with thousands of people outside. The energy in New Hampshire was unbelievable. And then we hopped on the plane, we flew to Michigan and we got there at about 12 30, almost 1 o'clock in the morning, and it had to have close to 30,000 people.
<Alex Marlow> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Inside and out. The energy is incredible.
<Alex Marlow> <Positive> You know, one thing that I have as a theme on the front page of Breitbart.com is what I refer to as the huge tent, playing off of your pronunciation of the words "huge
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think you have to do it. You know, we're at a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College, as you know. She starts off with, like, about 240. Her numbers are around 240 before she starts, and the Republicans are at a tremendous disadvantage.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I I have a great relationship with New Hampshire, as an example, a great relationship with, you know, various places like North Carolina -- which I guess you could say is purple but I think we're going to do great there -- and so many of the others. And I think we're going to do fantastically in Michigan. Michigan is a, you know, the cars, that industry was ripped out of Michigan, so much of it, and moved to Mexico and other places, and the people understand. And I've been talking about it, Alex, for five years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I got the Man of the Year in Michigan about five or six years ago, and in my speech I was talking about that. It had nothing to do with it but I was talking about it. And they know how I feel. And then the polls started coming out, as you know, and we are up, I think, two points in Michigan, which is shocking to people because, you know, in theory that was a very blue state, very blue.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And she heard about it and she went there last night too. But she's not gonna to stop, she's not going to stop what's happening to the state. So we're, we seem to be doing, and there are some others, we seem to be doing very well in certain blue states. Maybe a lot of them.
<Alex Marlow> <Negative> OK, so let's say you become the president tomorrow morning. What is your plan for the first 100 days, in the lame-duck session.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have a lot of different things. First of all, we have to strengthen our borders, we need border security, we have to start building up our military, we have to take care of our vets. We have to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. So important.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is such a disaster, Obamacare. And you're saying it, I'm sure it's a big, you know, I know it's a subject of you, that you guys cover a lot. But you see the rate increases, the premium increases are going. You know in, as an example, Arizona 116 percent increase.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Minnesota, 60 percent. You have these increases all over the place. And, you know, it came up just before the election, but everyone was suffering and they all understand. But it seemed to be a very big subject.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's one of the reasons that we are doing so well, the Obamacare. It's a disaster and it's no good, it doesn't work. I mean, you can't even use it, the deductibles are so high. So we will repeal and replace Obamacare, and we'll get a health care that's fabulous, that's, like, great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that's up for a fraction of the cost. This is crazy.
<Alex Marlow> <Negative> Yea. Donald J. Trump is my guest, Alex Marlow here on Breitbart News Daily. I think there are two groups of people.
<Alex Marlow> <Negative> If you do, if you're not victorious tonight I think that it's going to be a squeaker and I think it's because of two groups. And that's these never-Trump voters that we talked about last time on the show, and also the Latino voters, who I think they will come out more for you than people have anticipated. I think it's very condescending that the Democrats kind of talk down to them and expect them to vote as a bloc. But the question is, why did the Democrats expect them to vote for policies from the countries that they left, Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yea. I think we're gonna to do much better with Hispanics and Latinos than anyone expects. They're great people and I think we're going to do very well, and it's already been borne out. I mean, as an example, last week I received the primary award from the Cuban Bay of Pigs association, and they gave me this incredible award because of what I do and all.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know, that's an indication we're -- with the Cubans. I can tell you, we're, like, at 85 percent. But I think we're gonna to do very well with the Hispanics and, frankly, with the African-Americans. I think we're doing really well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You see what's going on. And she's not doing well. She's very uninspiring and she is not doing well at all. So it will be a very interesting evening I think.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Don't you think?
<Alex Marlow> <Negative> I think it will too, Donald. Last question for you, I know you've got a busy day. Hillary Clinton closed her campaign on a note of unity. She's wants to bring the country together.
<Alex Marlow> <Negative> I found this a bit odd, considering she had called you and your supporters every name in the book -- racist, sexist, bigots -- for so many months. Do you buy what she's selling in terms of unity?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yea, called deplorables, irredeemable. You know, a few little beauties like that. Look, I think she would not be a good president. I think that she's not an inspiring person.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Our country is very divided, as you know. We're gonna bring great unity to the country. I think we're going to do a fantastic job. I know we're going to do a fantastic job with jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We went to Michigan last night, you heard it was incredible. We had, I mean, there had to be close to 30,000 people there, and it was at 1:00 o'clock in the morning. And, you know, they want their jobs back. They want their auto industry to come back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, you know, it's left, a lot of it's left for Mexico. It's leaving as we speak. So I think that unity is very, very important. I agree with her on that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just don't think that she is going to be able to unify this country.
<Alex Marlow> <Positive> That's Donald J Trump, Republican candidate for president. Hopefully next time we speak, Mr. Trump, you'll be President-elect Trump. Best of luck tonight.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Alex, very much. Appreciate it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Donald Trump is on The Apprentice this Thursday night at 9:00 on NBC and you can watch Donald Trump on the season finale of The Apprenti -- There he is. You could drop a few. You lost some weight.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I did?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, if I noticed, I noticed these things. How are you doing?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Hi, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> There's the Great Donald Trump. I was just saying --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Always with a pink tie.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Pink tie, yes. What is with the pink tie? Is that significant of --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. You know I used to wear red ties and then, everybody copied it. Everybody was wearing red and I wore it because I thought it was lucky. And then, I had a very, very bad day and I was wearing this really bright red tie.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And he said this is not working for me.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Listen, I've got a pink.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> How much weight have you lost? I noticed that you are much, much thinner. Considerably thinner.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I would say if I lost one pound, I'd be satisfied. You know, it's like I don't think I've lost weight.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Maybe it's the suit. You look thin to me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's good. I have a good suit plus it [Inaudible] Trump [Inaudible].
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Is there a Donald Trump suit line?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> There is actually at Macy's, and it's suits and shirts and ties.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Is there anything you won't put your name on?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, let's go that way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You will not give coffee mugs or anything like that Donald Trump Card from [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But the suits are selling amazingly and --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They are.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it does make you look very thin. I actually am probably heavier since the last time I was on the show.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You got very angry with the -- It was Forbes or New York Times or somebody came out an hour ago and said you were like worth $200,000 or something. I mean it's something ridiculous like that. That pisses you and does that piss you off the most?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No. Well, there's a writer who wrote a book. I recently wrote a book and it's, it's a failed book. It did very poorly and he's a poor writer --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Unauthorized biography.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And in order, in order to get publicity for the book, he tried anyway but it didn't work. He said he thought I might be worth $250,000,000 --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Oh, that's it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then For -- and he attacked Forbes because Forbes said I was worth 2.7 billion. So then Forbes came in and re-evaluated, and they said, they made a mistake. Actually, I'm worth more than 2.7 million.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> So you all --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> 2.7 billion --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You were willing to open up the books to your personal wealth.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I did because it was such an attack. You know, like if you get attacked on radio. Well, I opened up the books to Forbes and I showed them what it is.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Because it's important to you. I mean, you do business based on the fact that Trump is a billionaire.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And people are excited by doing business with you if it was proven that you were worth a little bit of money and one would say he's not successful.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know it doesn't matter because if you're worth 250,000,000, that's a lot of money, right?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Like half of what you're with based on a new contract. But if you're worth five or six or seven billion and somebody says, in order to sell some books "Gee
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Did you read this unauthorized biography?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> No, I didn't. I mean, I don't --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You didn't look at it? Weren't you curious? Come on. Be honest now.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You got to want to know [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You don't want to know the guy -- Even if it's a retarded book.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Howard, I know all of the mistakes that were made in it and it will be interesting to see what happens over the coming weeks, but I know all of the mistakes that were made in it and they were made purposefully in order to sell a book that didn't sell.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> There was a guy years ago who wrote an unauthorized biography of me and when I read -- I had to read. I was infuriated because everyone he int -- he's with people who didn't even know me and I knew that everything was factually wrong. But I had to read it so I would know that I -- what was going on in the book.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, the most --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I was drawn to it like a moth to a flame.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Howard, the most unfair thing is the libelous. You know that. I mean, they can say things about you and I that are totally untrue. They know they're untrue. They're doing it to sell a book or sell a magazine or something and it's very hard to win in a court case but, you know, like you, I attack people. When this guy was a terrible writer and it's a terrible writing, it's like a failed -- the book is a failed book, totally. You know, I did two books this year.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What pisses you off the most? Was it -- you've heard what was in the book. What pissed me off the most?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would say, just the tone of the book.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You know, it was the tone.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> As if you were a bad man.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Or like a loser, trying to paint [?] you.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Like a bad guy. Like a bad guy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, he wasn't. Actually, he was doing the opposite of that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I need you to be my psychiatrist for a minute. I need you to help me through something. I threw a tirade the other day. I threw a fit. I had a discussion with Ronnie, the limo driver, and I'm looking in a magazine and I see John Travolta has two Boeing 707s --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That he pulls into his driveway. He has a spread in Orlando, Florida and in his driveway, his home driveway, has a personal landing strip with two Boeing 707s and I blew a fit. I said, you know, they talk about someone like me -- has all this money in the -- How? I couldn't afford one Boeing 70 --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> He certainly can't land it at home.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I absolutely could. I don't have that kind of network. I don't know how people are making billions of dollars. I -- You know, and I read in the paper how wealthy I'm supposedly going to be right now. I mean, how does a guy -- You explain it to me. John Travolta.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> John Travolta.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> All right. He was in some movies. Maybe made $20 million a film after taxes and everything else. What's that work out to? 10 million a film?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Probably right. Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> How does he get these two planes?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he gets old planes. He goes out and he gets all planes at a cheap price. He fixes them up. He loves -- I know him a little bit. He's a great guy. He fixes them up and he loves to fly. Wait a second. You explain --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> If somebody gets you go and get them much, much harder and I could really elaborate but
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] can get up.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You explain to me one time. You said you love your helicopter. You would tell me the maintenance and the fuel and what this thing cost to maintain. You've got to be a very wealthy man to own a helicopter. Even if you took a used Boeing 707, what is the cost of that a year?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, having a plane like that is a luxury. There's a definite luxury because you can travel for nothing. You know, it's like when I go to California, I have a plane --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Or I can go to the airlines and they'll give me tickets for nothing because you know that. They give you what every celebrity --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They do?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What, what kind of celebrity am I? I never once got a --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well, Donald gets everything for nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> How do you get a free airline ticket?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Every airline calls me "Anytime you want to travel
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why would they do that for you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Listen to this, Howard. You can earn a brand new beautiful airline,
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A commercial plane.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Beautiful front. They give you every seat in the plane, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you travel for nothing --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Or --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why they do that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You could pay $75,000 to fly by yourself on your own plane to California. Does that make sense?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you end up doing?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Usually, I take my own plane.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You take your own plane.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's pretty crazy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What does it cost to maintain a plane and own a plane? Be honest here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, if you're going to go like down to Palm Beach for the weekend --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you're -- whether you're working or whether it's for -- for whatever reason, it's probably a $50,000 bill to go both ways.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> To go both ways.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now, if you look at the fares and if you are going to take 10 or 12 people and if they're working with you, because you're doing projects down there or something, sometimes it is cheaper to have your own plane.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right, because you can do business --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And knows the price of those tickets would cost you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right, it would cost you a lot of money.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Sometimes, it's almost cheaper to have your own plane
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> And you're going to travel by yourself, there's nothing cheap about it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> You know what I heard about with Travolta, Howard. He just had amazing deals from the beginning. Not only would he get paid for the film, he owned the piece of the soundtrack to --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Who, who, who, who the hell is he?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Saturday Night Fever and Grease, and he got the same deal with every movie including Pulp Fiction. Like the soundtrack sell billions of, of, of dollars.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Unbelievable. I mean, this guy must be -- what do you think John Travolta's net worth is? Give me a sizable amount.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know [Inaudible] one down and he was having a hard time --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And then he did Pulp Fiction and he came back.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's been doing well since and --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What's his net worth?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hundred million dollars
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would say, after taxes, 100.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> 100 million dollars? And the guy's got him Boeing, two Boeing 707s.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Holy mackerel.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I was going to say even when he wasn't a big box office success, he still had lots of money.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> So that was those -- that was
<Howard Stern> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Record deals, I guess.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> We are here to celebrate you and all of the times you've been on this show. I want to thank you. First of all, you've been an excellent guest on what constitutes an excellent guest. You know as well as I do --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A controversy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> A man --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Who is well-known. Number one, what you are. Number two, someone who is willing, to be honest and open and that is what you've been.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right to my detriment.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Sometimes it's hard to --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Brutally honest.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know, we do need to congratulate you two. We haven't seen you since you announced the fact that Melania is pregnant.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That is correct.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's not going to kill the relationship. Let's be honest. When's the last time you had sex with Melania?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I never talk about that.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Oh, yes, you do.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I have gotten in more trouble in this crazy show.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's just [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're not attracted to women who weren't [?] pregnant?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, I'll tell you what happened.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Tell her to turn off the radio.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I tried to tell her -- I tried to just sort of forget that I'm on your show because I don't like her listening to this particular show.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Because it's, it's silly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I go into say goodbye. I thought she was sleeping and she's sitting, listening to the radio. I say "Uh
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why would you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why don't you go back to sleep?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why would you tell her you're coming to this show? Tell her you're going to Z-100 morning.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She read it somewhere that I was on the show.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I see.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I said "Oh
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Did you consider an abortion from her?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Oh.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You did not?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Did it ever pass your mind that we have a -- Let me ask you this. You and Melania, I've seen you together, lovebirds to you together. She's hot. Perfect body. I know physical appearance is very important to you. Marla Maples got a pimple. You kicked her right out the door.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I --
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> [Inaudible] to get a pimple.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh yeah. [Inaudible] still be married. Who wants a chick with acne?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Acne.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> And one pimple.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Broke up his marriage.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You only tolerate acne. The only time you want your chick have acne is if it's because she's a teenager.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. And then you'll put up with it. You don't want another kid. I mean, you got the perfect relationship with how you guys are jet-setting. You're going around. You down at Mar a Lago. Here. There. She's in a bikini. A thong. It's fantastic. Now, you're going to be with a young kid and you're going to have to travel with nannies and it -- what, what's going on?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know I have a big business and I like workers and I'm producing a lot of really good workers.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No you're not interested in that. And what do you think of Donald Jr. Getting married? I don't think you were happy about this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I was. I know her very well. Actually I wasn't happy with some of the people he was dating.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I was at a fashion show. You believe this. I mean that you do believe.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> This I read.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm at a fashion show and Don is with me.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because Melania was in Paris. So Don is with me at this fashion show and this beautiful girl walked in front and some people thought I was trying to pick her up and I was using him as a shield and that was totally false.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. That move, though.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This beautiful girl walks in. I said, "Don
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You based it on physical appearance. I admire that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I did. I must tell you, I did so. But then ultimately [Inaudible] I had to find out whether or not I can speak.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But you looked at her and said, "Now
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I said there is a girl, the girl that just walked by and I took him. And I said --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why did you say that to him? Based on what? That you would want to bang her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I would not want to do that.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> No I mean you were trying -- you find her attractive.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I found her very, very attractive, very elegant, very beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I think she looks like Melania.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Ah, I don't see that. But -- but-
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Who is more beautiful, your son's wife or Melania?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're both beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> They're both beautiful women.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're both very beautiful. So, anyway, so I I brought him over --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Don't you think he was too young to get married, your son.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He's 27.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Prenup of course.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> How old were you when you got married?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I was 30.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Really?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> We know how that went.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You see you can wait. And it doesn't necessarily have to work.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So now, Melania, how pregnant is Melania? How many months?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She is now five months.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And you're not making love now. I know you. I know you very well after all these years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there's something very sexy with a woman. You know they just blow up, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Like a blimp.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> like a blimp.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In her case, in the right places. I mean, she is -- she has really become a monster.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Are you -- [Inaudible] She's a monster?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> No, no. In a positive way.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> [Inaudible] Not a good word.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> That's an interesting word. Wait a second, [Inaudible] No I don't, I know what it means, [Inaudible] a monster. I'm a monster.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's what hot chick wants to be.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> He calls me a monster. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Trump says Melania is a monster.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Yeah, here's the headline [Inaudible] Trump married the monster. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I mean monster in the most positive way. [Inaudible] All in the right places. She has gotten very, very large.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Is that a Melania? [Inaudible]
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> Yeah, that's Melania. We got phone call. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She has gotten very, very large. All in the right places.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] Hello, Donald. Don't bother coming home. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So, I know you. If Melania has the baby and doesn't whip herself back into shape, it is over. She's gotta know that. There's gotta be pressure on her to whip herself back into the pre-baby shape.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, Howard, she's got the kind of a body …
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> … and makeup where, about one day after the baby, it's going to be the same as it was before. It's really — I mean she's got …
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You're giving her one day?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> One or two.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> She's got a whole day, 24 hours.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> She’s got a whole day to …
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think I'll give her a week. No, I’ll give her a week. [Laughter]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I mean, if there’s a year that goes by, and she's gotta …
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> There's another headline.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, I've known many, many pregnant women.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Doesn't the ass spread on the hips?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, not much. Not in her case.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Melania has a day to get back in shape.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Five months. You know those last four months are a girl’s worst enemy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That could be. I've known many, many pregnant women, okay?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Go ahead. Yes. You've made them pregnant. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I've seen ’em all types. I've seen beautiful women that for the rest of their lives have become horror.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I mean, it's been a very tough life for them, okay?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know they gain, like, 250 pounds. It's like a disaster.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've seen some women where they have a little bit of a problem. And I've seen a few women, not too many people like this, but where they just spring right back. And we’ve all seen that, where they spring …
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> The body does change — even Heidi Klum. They're crowing about how she's back in check.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, but she sprang back pretty good, right?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Not the same.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She had to work at it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Not the way it was.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know, I looked at her the other day, and it's off. There's no question.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It's off?
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> It's off.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> She's not a 10 anymore.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> She's a notch or two down. What is she now? She's not a 10.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Monster
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's a monster.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> She's a monster.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But I hear, Howard, thinks her husband the choice of husband, Robin, was a very good one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, yeah. Lucile
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You see it? Lucile? Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think Howard, thinks she was a very good choice.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I think he's fine I don't have any problem with that. [Inaudible] He is right now. But you know if you marry Heidi Klum, she had the baby and now she looks the way she looks now. She went from a 10 to a 7. Fair?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No I think she went from a 10 to an eight.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think we have to give a little more [Inaudible]
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> Will Donald Trump tolerate an 8? No. You wouldn't. I know you. [Inaudible] This is very dangerous having this kid.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Many, many women are very different after the baby. You know the French have an expression.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What is that?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> We hate America.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's another one.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But when they have -- When their wife has a baby they say they can not make love to the mother of their child.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I don't use the word love.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it's a tough expression. But that would never happen with me.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Oh, come on.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, that would never happen with me.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> You knew you were out of that relationship with Melania as soon as she got -- Not with Melania, with Marlo, Marla. You knew --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Marla was terrific and so was Iva-. You know I was married, I had two nice marriages. Howard -- Well actually, Howard destroyed my relationship with Marla.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Oh, geez.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The day of he wedding he was sitting next to O.J. Simpson.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He chops my head off. O.J. Looks angry. You know O.J. Killed somebody, two people,
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Two people, about a week after the wedding, you know that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's right. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I spoke to somebody they said, "Are you kidding? O.J. Didn't do it. I said
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You gave me permission to use it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I let you use it. That's right, you put it in your book.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> What -- what -- Okay. So-
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me. One thing. You just killed my relationship. So I go back and you saw the paparazzi. It was crazy. Thousands and thousands of photographers, everyone. And of all the people they have to ask is I'm leaving and going into the Plaza Hotel into the bridal suite, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> With Marla is Howard. They don't have to -- Not thousands of people they could -- They pick Howard and he said, "There wasn't a wet eye in the house. There were two things he said. In other words
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I said the relationship would last three months.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he said the relationship -- It actually lasted four years which was longer than even I thought. But he said the relationship would last three months and he said there wasn't -- I never -- I never forgot this was because I was laughing and she was crying.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> She hated it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She didn't like it.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> But Melania should be happy I gave her six months so it's working.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. But you also --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well then that means she's got about seven years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, he's been very respectful of Melania until this moment.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> No, I haven't. You are the one who said she was a monster I did not.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I said a monster in a posi -- In a most positive sense.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> [Inaudible] Good move.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> We'll see [Inaudible] Don't worry [Inaudible
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're gonna look in the dictionary see if there's any positive definitions of monster.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But as much as you're attracted to Melani you will admit that while a woman is pregnant you haven't been making love Melania. So what is that? So am I on the right course here with this? 'Cause this is dangerous territory.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do you remember when you spoke with Melania the last time?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I did.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And you asked her about cellulite.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I did.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And she said, you said, "Do you know what cellulite is? """
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. Meaning, do you have cellulite? in a nice way.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Yes. And she said very nicely and totally knowing what it is because she doesn't have cellulite, she said, "I don't even know what cellulite means."" Now
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Let me tell you something. Melania is beautiful. It is true. Melania does not have any cellulite.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> I understand that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It is true. I inspected her myself.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I understand that. You bent over her.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I've looked at her in every outfit and there is no cellulite. And Donald loves it there's no cellulite.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] I'm actually thrilled about it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Let's hope though after the baby.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It could happen.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> If there's cellulite will you be man enough to stay in the relationship?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will. I will love her so much, you have no idea. I'm a very loyal person. I will love her so much.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Allow me to play to favorite moments of mine from the past because this is our last show with you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> On This Kind of Radio.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> On what they call, This Kind of Radio and we hope to see you at our new home where we can curse and really talk horrible things.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> And by the way, before you do that one of the great business moves of all time, how they allowed you to continue this program instead of saying, "Howard
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You would've been out of here. You've been promoting this new deal
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Not really.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Seven or eight minutes
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> I'd just say I'm leaving.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's the most incredible thing I've ever seen. How stupid could anybody be. How they allowed you? Where is Tom? What does Tom look like?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, Donald, that is not a nice thing to say.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> Tom? Tom is hiding now in the backroom.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Tom. Tom, how could you let this happen. I mean, I wouldn't -- I wouldn't I wouldn't have said it two months ago three months ago but now, I mean, you have a week [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You're out the door.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Might as well say it now. Yeah. Listen --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> One of the greatest promotions I've ever seen is that you used another network to promote your show brilliantly. So, congratulations.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> I in no way could I tried to disadvantage the company. I am very, very happy I worked here.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> How you got away with this, I have no idea but congratulations.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Thank you. And I think it's going to be written about they're going to do a new chapter in the book at the Wharton School of Finance.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What do I know from finance? I have no idea.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> You know nothing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But, let me talk to you about -- before we get to Apprentice and the show is doing well. And I know Martha Stewart's thing tanked.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that's not coming back.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And that's not coming back. I want to talk to you about that. But I do want to honor you by playing two of your great moments on this show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> There were many great moments.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> We had a lot of great moments.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And anyone who knows the show has to be a fan of Donald Trump because well, the great moments. Here's the two I picked out for today. You did this the last appearance. I thought this was amazing. Here you are a prominent guy
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> Oh, that's right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You're- you- you're friends with all the big Hollywood people. And I turn to you and I said I want you to evaluate women. And you did it. Now the reason this is so good, is because very few people who have the fame and success of Donald Trump
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And who'd meet these people on a regular basis.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> And you came right in and you evaluated this-
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And sadly, who know these people, who don't speak to me anymore but that's okay. I don't care. [Inaudible] But you know you have billions and billions of people so if you lose a couple of friends it doesn't really matter. Right
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sit back, relax, and listen to a great moment from Donald Trump.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Nicollette Sheridan is a two, right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I'd say, I would say she's in the four or five category.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> If you were single and you know back in the day and I'm talking about the way she looks now. You would not do her would you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think you know I like the way she used to look I don't like the way she looks [Inaudible]
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> She's gone from a 10 to a four?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She wasn't a 10.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She was an eight you think, Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, she went from being very flat chested. I view a person who was flat chested is very hard to be a 10, Okay?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You have to have the face of Vivien Leigh to be a 10.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Exactly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you're flat chested. Okay. But she went from an eight to a solid four.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> Tell me about Carmen Electra now. Is she still a 10?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You see, I never thought she was a 10.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. In her heyday, I never thought she was a 10. And I think Carmen is somebody who has unbelievable photogenic abilities. She really looks unbelievable in a picture. And then when you see her first of all she's unbelievably short. And I'm a little bit surprised. I think that the boob job is terrible. You know, they look like two lightbulbs coming out of a body.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Give her a number, please.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would say she's an eight.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who is a 10 of all time.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Ten of all time.
<A.J. Benza> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't think of any, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Howard, who's a 10 to you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> Who's the 10 [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There were very few.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No Charlize Theron.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No kid -- Not -- By the way. Not even close.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have to understand. I've seen all of them. So I'll tell you, you know, one of my-
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What is Charlize Theron?
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> I would say a solid seven.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What about -- [Inaudible[
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Halle Berry.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I tell you what, I think she's got from the midsection to the shoulders
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's a 10.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The face is a solid eight.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> He's right. He's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the legs they may be a little bit less than that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right. What about --
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> Wait, wait, wait.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Pam Anderson today. Pam Anderson today not years ago.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> She was never a 10, [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Pam Anderson is a friend of mine she's a great person. But Pam Anderson is- is you know, come on, give me a break.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What is she? What is she right now?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Six?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> A Six.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. I think so. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Are the Olsen twins hot at all?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not now.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Not now. [Inaudible]
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> And they never were.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And they never were?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> About eight or nine. They never were.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And never will be. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I love you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What do you think of the women's liberation movement? Do you think they'd going to embrace me? Will they say, "He's a wonderful person.""?"
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Let me see based on that. I have my own channels now. How do I get you to come on once a week for a half hour and evaluate women? That's it. The Donald Trump evaluation show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know that's the funny thing about women. The best looking women aren't famous women the best looking women are women you see and you see at parties or models that haven't really necessarily made it. Well. There might have some great looking models that have made it, but-
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I think it has to be an on-demand show, the best-looking women in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know that will be a very good show for Sirius, I think. You know you do that for hours and hours you would get tremendous ratings.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm going to talk to you about it. I don't know that I can afford you but I don't know how to get involved with you. But I'm going to -- Because I like your att -- You're the Simon Cowell of poontang.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have I have a certain attitude about that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Your second clip that I'd like to play, in honor of the last Donald Trump appearance here. Mr. Trump was on the air with us and he got into a fight with A. J. Benza. We always talk about this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I didn't know A. J. I was promoting I own the Miss Universe pageant and I called you just to promote the pageant because NBC said would you call Howard said you know nobody wants to talk to Howard Stern, they all wanted me to do it, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love Howard Stern. So I'm -- [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And A. J. Benza was a Daily News reporter. He happened to be here, I didn't know that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right. And I guess there's a whole story, but as you know I stole his girlfriend.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I didn't know he was on. I didn't know too much about him but he was on, and he went crazy.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> And you were the one who went back down from the fight.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She told me that you owe borrowed $2, 000 from me you wouldn't pay her back. What kind of stuff is that? Pay her back, you're making enough money.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> She didn't loaned it to me, she gave it to me. And you know what, [Inaudible]. Let me talk to her.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> A. J., if she wasn't taken away from you, you wouldn't feel bitter.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What an ass. I can't wait til your daughter gets a little older for me. Then I can't wait, I'll make you [Inaudible]
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> You're gonna hit on Ivanka?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Hey, A. J. I guarantee. You have zero chance.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, yeah, I do huh? [Inaudible] What are you saying?
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> Hey, A. J., I guarantee you have zero chance. A. J., any girl you have, I can take from you -- if I want. Any girl you have, I can take from you. You're full of shit. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That I guarantee. And that was even before.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> You know what now I'm begging you, please get a boxing match going on.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Please.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> Donald's not gonna box you. He has billions.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> With the last boxing match I saw you and Chuck Zito, he beat the crap out of him. What happened to you and Chuck Zito, A. J.
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> It was one punch, it was honorable.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You were down for the cut. You know a friend of mine was there, Howard. He said he never saw anybody so unconscious, they thought he was dead. [Inaudible] You were laid out of the floor, the place --
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> You know what, I'm going to kick his ass. I will. So do me a favor travel with calamari and an army cause I'm gonna take a baseball [Inaudible] head.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, wait a second. Easy with the F word.
<A.J. Benza> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> Hey, A. J. Let me ask you, how did you do against the cab driver?
<A.J. Benza> <Positive> I don't care what he says me. I'm gonna clear you one day.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Don't say that A. J.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not figuratively, but beat him really badly.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow. What a moment. And you are not afraid of him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I couldn't care less.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You couldn't care less.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he's probably a nice guy but he had a heart. He was having a hard time.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It was humiliating that you had stolen away his girlfriend, I guess.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't really know she was his girlfriend and he's a fantastic woman. I didn't know that she was his girlfriend.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I found out later through him.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And that -- And did she say you were better in bed than A. J.? Was that the accusation?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the rumor is that I am.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You are.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I'm also better than you are, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well, who can compete with you? With your wad. [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought you were gonna play something else. You destroyed a Miss Universe contestant, Miss Russia. Oxana Fedorova
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But that wasn't your moment. I want you to celebrate your moment.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> I actually had to fire her. She left the studio. Everybody at the Miss Universe pageant said, "Please don't put her on the show. Please don't put her on the show."" She asked the questions that I can't really repeat because [Inaudible]"
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She got insulted and she doesn't want to do any more promotion and Donald had to fire her. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I remember that. We got an interpreter here, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I actually had to fire her. She was totally incompetent after that. She was doing fine and then she came off the show. She didn't want to do. I said, "Oxana
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It all works out.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> It was all because of you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Donald Trump, of course, is on The Apprentice and that's this Thursday.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You still love doing that? You like it? You like it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I like the success. I mean, as long as it's so successful I like doing it, Robin. If it's not successful I wouldn't like doing it. But it's been amazing.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Are you in a feud with Martha Stewart?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That is such a -- I love Martha.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, her show didn't do well. There's nothing I can do about that. She had The Apprentice [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You were secretly happy it didn't work out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know people have asked me that question. I guess the answer is probably, yes. I mean, I have to say
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It's more of a compliment to you that it only worked to you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You sort of like me because I'm honest, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Whether it's women et cetera. I had two choices, I own the show with Mark Burnett, the show has been amazing and you know has success
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Very lucrative
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's been great. And my version continues to get humong -- I fired 87 people and it's still getting tremendous rating. What happened is two choices; she could have come on done phenomenally and I know what the press would have said because even after five seasons my ratings, I assumed that she would maybe be able to beat me, right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the press would have had Martha that beats the Donald. That would have been the headline, I'm sure was already written.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But that never happened. So, my question is; "Would I rather have her get phenomenal ratings
<Howard Stern> <Positive> My guess would be Trump is the king is the one you're happy with.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think, probably.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sadly
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You've got enough money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I have to tell you this. Look, Martha's a friend of mine. I like her. She's a great woman.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Would you ever make love to her.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Not attractive? Too old?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No because I'm very loyal to Melania.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What about the daughter?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Only because I'm loyal to Melania. [Commercial Break]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Giver her 1-10
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> I give her a 10.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Now come on. What about the daughter?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No mercy 10s around here.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What about Martha Stewart's daughter?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The daughter, I don't know. No, I really don't know her daughter. She's a-
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Good catch?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She didn't have a lot to say on the show. I can tell you that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Give one-word answers so that's not good.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> Not good.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was not helpful for the show.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Now, let me ask you something, you never said to the press that Martha was dragging down the [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I never said it. Now, what happened is NBC. Here we go here's the second topic, right? First of all I love Martha. Her ratings weren't good but there's nothing I can do about that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why didn't it work? Why didn't Martha's work?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, Trump said on radio I said, "No I didn't say that."" [Inaudible]"
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why didn't Martha Stewart's work?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because it didn't have the magic that my show has.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You are magical and she is not? Well, magical in the show.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes. She's magical in many ways, but she wasn't magical on the show.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay. All right fair enough, that's it. All right look you got to see Donald Trump on the Apprentice this Thursday night. That's at 9 o'clock on NBC and watch the season finale.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's live from Lincoln Center for two hours.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Next Thursday December 15th.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's exactly right.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> On NBC right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> I have one final question.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Do your older children get nervous every time you have another child.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know I have a friend
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Of course.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have a friend who is also like a very rich guy. And he said how his children hate the new children coming along and everything else, I said, "Yeah because every time you have a child it's 20 percent less to the people [Inaudible]."
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> So, you know, I don't want to use my children so I'm using his children as an example. But the fact is every time you have a child it's 15, 20, 25 percent less of all the money. So, I guess, you know, maybe they're not thrilled.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Did Donald Jr. -- There was a rumor that Donald Jr. And Ivanka tried to bump off a child.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Tiffany?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Is there any truth to that? [Inaudible] Tiffany?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I haven't really -- I have a great child and Tiffany -- I have great children.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And Tiffany is going to take it out a heat on Melania's new baby? Any truth to that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know it does cut up the pie as you keep producing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Tell me the truth, though.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Are you still making love to Melania during the pregnancy?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You are?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, sure.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You swear on a stack of Bible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I swear.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> When is the last time you made love? Be honest.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Very recently, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Two nights ago?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Within two nights, yes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And she dresses up lingerie and things like this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She looks phenomenal.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Even with the bump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm telling you, I told you I used an expression that's an okay expression but she looks great in the right [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Her breast are bigger?
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> No, they're not big, they're humongous.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Humongous. And you like that?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> They're monstrous.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They can't get too big. [ Inaudible] I know a woman who was a very beautiful woman out and she wanted to have breast reduction, okay?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Oh, that's a sin, come on.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said, "There's no such thing as breast [Inaudible]."
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> Robin did it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And Robin, you did it.
<Lamanka (Caller)> <Positive> I did it. I did it. Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Shame on you. [Inaudible] Couple of people want to say goodbye. Lamanka, go ahead you're one of the people getting through.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yes. Mr. Trump, I'm a big fan of yours. I have two quick questions. Wanna know when you're coming down to on [Inaudible[ the sixteenth? And also, could you just elaborate on the theory of revenge, that I love so much about you. You're an amazing [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I haven't been invited to Howard's finale but I'm sure that --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're absolutely invited. If you wanted to come down address the crowd for a minute and say something about the show or something.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know last night, you know Tom Brady the great quarterback from NFL.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. He asked me to make his speech last Sunday and he got the big award from Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year, the Athlete of the year.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. So, I made a speech and we have a sort of a good time. We were talking about lots of different things one of them was you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he's a fan of yours. Does that mean anything?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That means a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I met Scott, your new president, right?
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He's great. He said, "Would you crown Howard?"" Now
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A crown?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I don't want to be crowned by anyone but if you want to come down
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. He wants me to crown. I said, "What are you asking?"" My theory on revenge --"
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You got to tell Scott, he can't write my material for me.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I will.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I will take care of everything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I tell you what, Scott's fantastic.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Fantastic guy. I mean he's a fant -- Okay. My theory on revenge?
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You have to do that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You have to go after them.
<Chris (Caller)> <Negative> I can't use the language until we get on serious.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes. Chris, go ahead.
<Chris (Caller)> <Positive> Mr. Trump, you are clearly one of the top five guest of all time on the Howard Stern Show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Chris (Caller)> <Negative> One thing you haven't [Inaudible] though. The actor?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You've got to be kidding.
<Chris (Caller)> <Neutral> Second Bob.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hungry angry dwarf and beetle juice obviously.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You are in [Inaudible] crowd/
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Honestly, they wouldn't be my picks.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Go ahead, Ralph real quick.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm like all that stuff Robin.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I see, I see. You want to be in a different category.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Quickly now, Ralph, let's go ahead.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Quickly. Hey, now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Huge fan of the show but last couple of seasons here's the problem. First of all, there's too much authorship. It loses the street feel like everything is pret -- you know, it's like, you know Home Depot, and you know Toys 'r us and you know, it loses the street feel.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I understand what you're saying. A number of people have said that actually, you know
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> It's tacky. It's tacky.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's sort of the opposite but a lot of people agree with you, I understand that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And second of all I don't really care about the teams. It should be 90% boardroom. I like when you guys are in there and you're you're you're you're breaking it down and people start arguing, you know, I don't care what the task is I I want to see the boardroom.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm glad you brought that up because I love Mark Burnett. He's a great friend of mine we've had great success together.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Great guy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A brilliant guy. I fight with Mark Burnett. Only about one thing and it's not because I want to be in the boardroom because I couldn't care less. But everybody wants the boardroom. And if you look at the Nielsen ratings as soon as the boardroom goes on the ratings double. I mean, they go up like
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Well [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I keep telling the people and I say, "Make the boardrooms longer."" That's what everybody wants. They want longer boardrooms."
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You could make the boardroom two days and I would watch it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know it's funny because I've said they want the purity of the task because the task is what it's about.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I actually say flip a coin and put them in the boardroom. I mean, take two minutes because I really believe that everybody will -- I don't believe, the ratings believe that people want the border room.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well than. Let's give the people what they want.
<Steve (Caller)> <Positive> You know what so many people like you have said extend the boardroom. And I just can't get them to do it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let's go to Steve. Quickly. Steve. That's it, because I got to go.
<Steve (Caller)> <Positive> Okay. Hey, Mr. Trump how are you doing?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How are you?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm good. I want to just tell you with your top scale of beautiful women I want to tell your wife is a solid 12 [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I agree. She's one of the most beautiful woman.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I sat next to her to a game one of the Knick games and I was looking at she pregnant everything was she looks -- she looks phenom -- I would've went to rubber [Inaudible] In front of the Knicks. With all of the Knicks. In fact the Knicks lost because they were busy looking at Melania.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They couldn't handle it. Yes, go ahead. I love -- I love Mr. Trump's endeavors. You know he's got Ivanka coming out.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. And I know you don't drink.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm very mixed about that. Of all like Robin set up the suits and all that. I am mixed about iVodka. I had a brother who's an alcoholic. Everybody's approaching me.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But your brother died of alcohol.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a brother -- And what I'm going to do is I'm giving all of the proceeds of the vodka to charity.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What is that, do you have a fever?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No no.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Are you crazy?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what, I hate alcohol. I hate that I did it. I don't like that I did it but I did it because it's going to make a lot of money and I'm going to give all of the money 100% all expenses [Inaudible]
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Negative> You know who's got you beat? Artie has a line of heroin coming. [Inaudible].
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Well, that's not bad.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There's a lot of money in that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He feels bad about it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't like I don't like alcohol I don't like what alcohol does to people.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> I do. Have a drink with me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hey, Gary, if I don't do it somebody is going to do it so I'll make the money and I'm going to give it to charity.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love you as a marketer because he said, even -- even if product wanted to do it he said, "By the summer everyone will be asking for TNT."" a Trump Tonic."
<Howard Stern> <Positive> There you go. Well, listen. Donald Trump is the best and thank you for all the years of doing the show. And if you would grace the crowd by saying hello on the 16th, you know I would love it. But that's up to you. I don't want to pressure you. I'll pressure you on everything else, though. And Donald Trump is on The Apprentice this Thursday night at 9 o'clock on NBC and then you've got the big season finale which is two hours?
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> Two hours from Lincoln Center.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's great. Great accomplishment to be in prime time television and have that many seasons. December 15 on NBC. Check it out the great Donald Trump and thank you for all the years supporting the show and always being there for us and I appreciate that.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> And being a great guest.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And being a great guest and always putting on the line and Thank you very much. I do appreciate that. We'll take a break and be back right after these words. [Commercial Break]
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Let's go to the phone right now and a man who is feeling very comfortable this morning because he's sitting safely away from Mika's arm length. That is the frontrunner for the Republican race for president, Donald Trump. Donald, we showed a video earlier where Mika was -- I'm sorry. She was in your space. She was grabbing your hair. She didn't do it once. She did it a dozen times. I think you may have a claim against her.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> I think you're taking it out of context.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [On the Phone] Well, nobody's ever ripped my hair to that extent. I had Barbara Walters do it. She just touched it. But Mika was getting very frisky. Nobody has ever attacked me that way. My hair was destroyed for the rest of the day.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Donald, did you feel cheapened or objectified while Mika was clawing your hair?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I felt abused. In fact, it's a good thing. In fact, I think I'll bring a lawsuit against Mika. Do you mind?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Why not? Bring it on. It wouldn't be the first one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nowadays you're allowed to sue for something like that. You know, our standards have gone way down.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Okay, Donald Trump. But you didn't bite the groping of the hair. So let me just point out the first question here. I want to ask you about South Carolina and their requirement that you sign some sort of petition or like requirement --
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Basically, a loyalty oath.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Now are they leveraging you or what? Because you like leverage.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think so. I think what happened yesterday, first of all, was amazing. We had 1800 people in a room.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was the biggest crowd they've ever had in that room. As an example, not to mention this, but Bush was there, he had 301.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we had -- I mean the place was absolutely rocking yesterday. We had such a good time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it was a luncheon. Chamber of Commerce. And it was amazing in South Carolina. It's been amazing everywhere I've gone.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The crowds we're getting are incredible. We had an amazing -- we had a fantastic time. And, yes, South Carolina is looking at that and Virginia is looking at that and many people have that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Many places have that where you have to sign on when you decide by a certain date. No.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> 1, that date doesn't come do for a long time. The earliest is about September 30th. So there is certainly plenty of time. But I will say, and I said it to you, as long as I'm treated fairly, that's all I want. And they've been treating me really nicely. [Inaudible] and the RNC and everybody has really been great over the last three or four weeks. I'm leading in every poll by a lot. Maybe that has to do with it. But I also know them. You know, I used to be on the other side of the equation. I was the fair-haired boy for a long time.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right. When you were giving them money.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> When I was giving money, absolutely.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Let me ask you about Jeb Bush. It looks right now like in every poll, it looks like it's coming down to you and Jeb Bush, or in some polls maybe Ben Carson. And you keep talking about Jeb Bush as being a low energy candidate. Are you doing that just to provoke him or do you really think the fact that you say he's a low energy would prevent him from being an effective president? And let me just ask you, gut check here, if Jeb Bush came to you and he wasn't the politician and asked you for a job, you would give him one?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't want to be nasty and I don't want to say that. But I will tell you that if you look at the polls, he's not really second anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's fourth and fifth in a lot of the polls. I've always assumed that he was going to be a primary competitor. I guess that's why I'm hitting him harder than others.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I like him. He's a nice person. He is a low energy person. There's no question about it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, you know, I think we need much more than a low energy person right now to put this country back in shape. We need tremendous energy and tremendous smarts and tremendous cunning and all of the things that other countries have. You know, you look at what the Mexican leaders are doing to us. You look at what China's leaders are doing to us. And Japan's leaders. Abe, he's brutal what he's doing to us. He's really - Japan has really stepped up their game, by the way, in case anyone isn't noticing. But, you know, we need a person with tremendous drive and tremendous smarts.
<Willie Geist> <Positive> Donald, it's Willie. Good morning. Good to talk to you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi, Willie.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> I, for one, have never been a hair truther. I've known your hair is real from the very beginning. I just wanted to be on the record with that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good. Thank you, Willie.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Let's talk about a serious story that has happened this week that horrified all of us, that shooting in Virginia that took the lives of a reporter and a cameraman down in Roanoke. You said this was not a gun problem in this incident, it was a mental health problem.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Do you think there are any gun restrictions, further gun restrictions than we have now, Donald, that would make sense in this country to help stem the tide of gun violence, which is much, much more than any country in the face of the earth?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think you need further gun restrictions. They have restrictions. If you look at a place like Chicago, Willie, it's got the single toughest gun laws in the United States and it's a disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're having in certain areas of Chicago. Chicago sort of a tale of two of cities. But in certain areas of Chicago, there's tremendous gun violence.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> More than just about anyplace. You look at Baltimore, they have very strong gun laws. You look at these places that are going wild with killings all over and they have very, very powerful gun laws, laws that you would say, I mean, you should not have any killings whatsoever if they worked.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The fact is it's not the laws. You have a tremendous problem with crime. You have a tremendous problem with mental health. And in this case it was pure mental health. And it's amazing that all of these guys that do these things, and we certainly see plenty of them, it's incredible to me that somebody doesn't come out. Because they really could see he was a sick guy two, three, four years ago. Every place he worked he had problems. And very severe problems. And yet nobody comes out and reports him. And at the same time --
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> But Donald, if they did report him, it seems to me that should go into a background check area and shouldn't we expand background checks? I mean, you always talk about how government doesn't work and I do, too. One of the areas it doesn't work is on these background checks. Don't we need to fix the background checks and expand it? So if a guy is working for you and he threatens everybody in your office and says I'm going to come back to get you and on the last day that he leaves the office everybody has to cower in the corner, they have to call 911, that guy shouldn't have a gun.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> But he'll get a gun if we don't have a background check.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A couple of times it did work. You know, a couple of these shooters were actually on the list and they were able to get guns. A mistake was made actually by the government where it wasn't reported properly.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right. That's what I'll saying. Shouldn't we fix -- work to fix the system --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, fix the system --
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> '-- work to close the gun show loophole where terrorists can go in and buy guns without background checks. I mean, doesn't all that make good common sense?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think what you have, Joe, if you look we actually have strong laws on the books. And again, you look at places like Chicago. Look at New York City. In New York City, we have among the toughest gun laws in the country and we have gun violence. It's a real problem. But we have the laws. So you have to make the laws work. The government is not making the laws work. But beyond that, you do have a huge mental health problem. There's no question about it.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right. Mark Halperin?
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> Mr. Trump, I want to go back to this issue of you and the establishment. You're freaking a lot of people out. They're worried now that you might be the nominee or be what they consider a disruptive force. Two people in particular constantly talking right about you in a negative way: George Will, Charles Krauthammer. I'm wondering if you think you can become the Republican nominee without winning them over? Or you don't care about winning them over?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, it's funny, a lot of the pundits have come a long way. In fact, yesterday at the speech, and I was very proud because the CNN reporter said it was the single greatest political speech he's ever heard, which was very nice, as far as I'm concerned.
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> Which reporter was that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love that. I had to bring that up because I said, wow, that's a nice --
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> Who said that?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Who was that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know her name, but she was wearing a beautiful red dress. She looked good to me. Anybody that says that looks good to me. So --
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Even if Richard Haass - If Richard Haass is wearing the red dress and says that to you, would he look good to you, too?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, he would look beautiful to me. There's no question about it. But you know what's happened, Willie, is a lot of the pundits that were saying, oh, he's just kidding, he's just playing games, it's just for his brand, he's just going to have a little fun.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A lot of those people have come a long way. So rather than attacking people, including Krauthammer and George Will -- and even Krauthammer's coming a little bit -- you know, people are starting to see what is happening. I'll tell you what, there is a movement out there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was in Alabama, and Joe knows because his brother was there, we had 31,000 people in that stadium. It looked like it was going to be pouring. And we had 31,000 people in that stadium. And it was an unbelievable evening. And there is -- you know, I call it a movement. I think it's a very, very strong movement. And a lot of people are seeing it and I've had people -- I mean, I won't mention names because I don't want to put them on the spot, but I've had - Well, I could say Gene on your show, who I've fallen in love with, is an example.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Yes. He loves you, too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've fallen in love with him. I think he's one of the greats. Joe, nobody was hitting me harder than Gene. But there is something happening out there that people -- some people say they've never seen happen before.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> I will tell you something that's very interesting is - as I watch -- I don't watch a lot of TV after I get off a three hour show in the morning. But the only thing I do notice is even people on the left are talking about that it's hard to nail Donald down ideologically and that he doesn't read Republican talking points and he goes to all sides. I think that's one of the things that are new. Richard? Richard Haass has a question for you, not in a beautiful red dress.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> He looks good though. He looks good.
<Richard Haass> <Positive> A blue suit, for the record. Donald, I was surprised by something you said a few minutes ago, which you were very critical of Prime Minister Abe of Japan. This is a -
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, not critical. I think he's great for Japan. No, no -- I wasn't critical. I think he's doing a great job for Japan.
<Richard Haass> <Negative> But why isn't it also good for the United States? It's an ally. If Japan economically recovers, they can contribute a lot more militarily. They can become much more of a partner of the United States. They can help us around the world. Why is somehow his doing good for Japan in any way not good for the United States? This is - It's the third largest economy in the world and one of our closest allies. Shouldn't we celebrate that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because, Richard, they're killing us economically, Richard, because they're selling millions of cars to us that we're not making here. Because if you look at the balance of trade and if you look at the deficits that we have with that country, they're killing us economically.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was in Los Angeles two weeks ago. I saw ships, the biggest ships I've ever seen with cars, thousands of cars pouring off those ships coming in tax free, which is fine, but the problem is we send practically nothing to them. We're not doing business with them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a one-way street. I love Japan. I think Abe is a great leader. I'm not speaking critically.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm just saying they are much smarter than our leaders. Our leaders don't know what they're doing. You have to see what I saw two weeks ago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I've known this anyway. But the balance is so off. We have to change that balance.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We send them beef and a lot of times they don't take our beef. And I will tell you, it's a tiny fraction of what the cars are.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we have to even it up. Same thing with China. I mean, China, it's like taking candy from a baby what they're doing to us. They're destroying us. They're taking our jobs. They're taking our base. We send them stuff and they tax us. Nobody knows they tax us. But they tax us. And it's very hard for people to send things into China or into Japan. When was the last time, Richard, you saw a Chevrolet in the middle of Tokyo? OK? How many Chevrolets are in Tokyo right now? Two?
<Richard Haass> <Negative> A lot of the Japanese cars, first of all, are produced here now, as you know. It's true that trade imbalance is about 2:1. But why would we want --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not 2:1. Richard, it's more than 2:1. It's massive.
<Richard Haass> <Negative> It's not. But why would we want to emulate that? For the last two decades, Donald, they've had no growth. We've grown sensationally. We've created 25, 30 million new jobs over the last couple of decades. They've been basically flat. Japan is not a threat to us.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Richard, they've had -- Richard, they've had no growth because other countries aren't as stupid as us and other countries aren't allowing them to get away with, like they get away with us. But they made a fortune with us.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now they do build some plants here. But a majority is still over there. And it's massive. You know, China would not let you get away with that. And how many plants do we have over in Japan building cars, as an example, Richard? How many plants do we have over right now in Japan? And how many cars do we sell to Japan? I want to tell you, if you look up that number, it's almost nothing.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Donald, let me ask you about a follow up on some comments you made earlier this week in what we all thought was a fascinating interview with Mark Halperin and John Heilemann. It involves something you said - something that I've been trying to get Republican candidates for president to say for some time and that is that there is something wrong with hedge funders paying 14 percent while their secretaries are paying 25 percent and while small businesses owners are paying near 40 percent in taxes.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> And you said you'd get rid of carried interest and you would make hedge funders carry their load. What about the idea that Warren Buffett talked about a couple years ago, a minimum tax that every American would have to pay at least a minimum tax of 25, 30 percent? Because the last presidential campaign, I think you had both Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, if I'm not mistaken, paying taxes, their tax rate was in the teens.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Now, if it's legal, that's fine. I'm not saying they shouldn't be aggressive as possible. But isn't there something wrong with a tax system that allows billionaires and people running for president to pay tax - tax rates in the teens while their secretaries and campaign workers pay 28, 35, 39 percent?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, Joe, I know the hedge fund guys, as you know very well. I probably know all of them one way or another and big supporters of Hillary Clinton, big supporters of Jeb Bush.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have given Jeb Bush millions because they're going to keep it going the same way. And they've given Hillary Clinton -- you know, with all the talk about, you know, with Hillary about Wall Street - I mean, they're all supporting her.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a joke. It's a joke that she can get away with it. And her last statement on terrorists was a disgusting statement, by the way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I heard you talking about that before. But the concept of hedge funds -- now these are guys, they don't really build anything. They shuffle paper.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They go back and forth. They live beautifully. And so do I and so do you and so do all of us, OK? But they pay -- When you say 14 percent, Joe, I don't know who you're talking about because I don't know any that pay 14 percent. There are things that hedge funds do, hedge fund guys do, they make a tremendous amount of money and they don't pay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And what I want to do is I want to simplify the tax code and I'm going to be coming out over the next month with a -- I think a really -- Look, nobody knows the tax code better than I do. OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know it better. I'm the king of the tax code. And I'm going to come out with a plan, a simplification, a plan, getting rid of some of the deductions, which are ridiculous and complicated and, you know, I used in statement, I want to get rid of H&R Block.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to put them out of business. People that make $50,000 a year have to go to H&R Block or somebody else to get their tax returns done because it's so complicated and they're smart people. So we're going to simplify the tax code, take away some of the deductions. And hedge fund guys have to pay up. Now, I'm going to lower taxes. But these hedge fund guys are making a lot of money. I mean, I could tell you, I have friends that laugh about how little they pay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it's not fair to the middle class. And the middle income people and the middle class, we're destroying that. And, you know, that's what built this country and we are destroying the middle class in this country. So I will have a plan. The hedge fund guys won't be happy. But pretty much everybody else is going to love it.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> When are you coming out with that plan?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Over the next four weeks.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> OK.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Look forward to seeing that. Donald Trump, thank you.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Thank you, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Willie Geist> <Positive> Thanks, Donald.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Nice to have you on.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> We'll talk to you soon.
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> Thank you very much for joining us on Fox News. Appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you Pete, thank you.
<Pete Hegseth> <Negative> You facedresistance on this bill, but of course you've faced resistance on the entirety of your agenda. Who's been your biggest opponent? Has it been Democrats resisting? Has it been fake news media? Has it been deep state leaks? What's... when you think about it, what holds it up?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well you kno,w when I ran, I talked about the rigged system because I saw I was winning states and I wasn't getting the delegates that I should be getting, and you know I would look at this, I said what kind of a system? Well the whole system is very... there's a lot of bad things going on, a lot of very bad things going on. One of the things that that should be solved, but it probably won't be is that the Republicans of Democrats don't get together, and I'm open arms, but I don't see that happening. They fight each other, they... the level of hostility... and by the way this isn't just Trump. This has been like this for years -- you've been doing this for a long time -- it's been like that for a long time. But the level of hostility, as an example the health care bill, that you are reporting on, and everybody's reporting on it, would be so great if the Democrats and Republicans could get together, wrap their arms around it and come up with something that everybody's happy with. It's so easy, but we won't get one Democrat vote -- not one -- and if were the greatest bill ever proposed in mankind, we wouldn't get a vote, and that's a terrible thing. So there is what -- look, there their theme is resist. I've never heard of anything like this, resist?
<Pete Hegseth> <Negative> How frustrating it is to have former President Obama there, out there leading the resistance?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think I don't think he's leading it -- he actually just put out a small statement, I don't see that leading it -- but other people are leading. Don't forget I saw Schumer criticizing the bill a couple of weeks ago, and he had no idea what was in the bill. He was saying this bill is this, and it's that, he had no idea. In fact, the Republican senators didn't know because it wasn't released -- very few people knew, so he was criticizing a bill that he had no idea what was in the bill. But that's called the resistance. I mean that's a terrible word, think of it. Their theme is resist. Their theme should be let's together, envelope, get together.
<Pete Hegseth> <Negative> Fix.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the theme is resist. It's obstruction, and the problem is they become obstructionist and the voters -- I happen to like it from the standpoint of running for office -- but I think it's a terrible theme in terms of getting elected, and more importantly, I think it's a terrible thing for the people of this country, resist. Obstruction. That's not what they want.
<Pete Hegseth> <Negative> How do you overcome that, when someone like Senator Warren, Senator Elizabeth Warren literally says people are going to die because of President Trump's health care bill
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I actually think she's a hopeless case. I call her Pocahontas and that's an insult to Pocahontas. I actually think that she is just somebody that's got a lot of hatred, a lot of anger.
<Pete Hegseth> <Neutral> But she's got a lot of a loud microphone and although..
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nah, she does. But you know, I don't think she has the kind of support that some people do. I think she hurt Hillary. I watched her campaigning for Hillary, and she was so angry, Hillary would be sitting back listening to her, trying to smile. But there were a lot of people in that audience that were going, wow is this what we want? There's a lot of anger there and hostility. So no I think, I... I think she's a highly overrated voice
<Pete Hegseth> <Negative> Some people might say it's the level of anger is unprecedented, but it's also unprecedented former president to come out the way President Obama has. He came out on Facebook recently, you may have seen it ,he said your bill, Mr. President, not a health care bill. It's a massive transfer of wealth. It's going to harm Americans. It's mean. What do you say to the former President
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well he actually used my term, mean.  That was my term, because I want to see... I want to see -- and I speak from the heart that's what I want to see -- I want to see a bill with heart. Health care is a very complicated subject from the standpoint that you move it this way, and this group doesn't like it. You move it a little bit over here... you have a very narrow path and honestly nobody can be totally happy even without the vote... forget about votes -- this has nothing to do with votes. This has to do with picking a plan that everybody is going to like. I'd like to say love, but like. We have a very good plan, we have a few people that are, I think you could say modestly, they're not standing on the rooftops and screaming. They want to get some points. I think they'll get some points.
<Pete Hegseth> <Negative> Are Republican Senators doing to have your back to get that healthcare bill through?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think so. You know, I have great relationships with most of the people in the Senate, with, as you know, most of the people in the House. I think I really I worked very hard. I made a lot of great friendships with the people in the House, a lot of them ,same thing in the Senate. Therefore, very good people. They're friends of mine, and I don't think they're that far off. I don't think they're that far off, you know, famous last words, right? But I think we're going to get there. For years I've been watching the battle for healthcare, and I watched during the Clinton administration Hillary, rightfully, devoted her life to trying to get healthcare. She was unable to get it. You watched what happened with Obamacare, which by the time they finished with it, it was, you know, something that doesn't work. But look what happened with Nebraska, where they gave the great Nebraska giveaway in order to give a vote.
<Pete Hegseth> <Negative> Cornhusker kickback.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it was a very closed session, you know. They talked about closed, and behind closed doors. There ws nothing more closed than Obamacare. But the bottom line is, they worked so long and so hard, they got a plan that didn't work. They got a healthcare plan that didn't work, and I've only been there for five months, you know  they work for a long time during the Clinton administration. They worked essentially during the entire administration. Health care is a very, very tough thing to get, but I think we're going to get it. We don't have too much of a choice, because the alternative is the dead carcass of Obamacare. That's what it is.
<Pete Hegseth> <Negative> I opened up the failing New York Times and the Washington Post this morning. No mention at all of this bill that you're signing today. For veterans who are so passionate about this, it's such a historic bill. Are they going to cover this, and if they don't, why don't they cover it the way they cover every breathless scandal in the media today?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I just heard today for the first time that Obama knew about Russia a long time before the election, and he did nothing about it. But nobody wants to talk about that. That... the CIA gave him information on Russia a long time before they even, you know, before the election. And I hardly see. It... it's an amazing thing to me. You know, in other words the question is, if he had the information, why didn't he do something about it? He should have done something about it. But you don't read that. It's quite sad.
<Pete Hegseth> <Neutral> That never leaked out.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> With that... that doesn't leak out. No they... they're very selective leaks, with sources... I always love the sources... many of which don't exist. But no, there's a there is a thing going on in the country, and hopefully it's... somewhat of a sickness in that sense. But you know what? I am so proud of what we've done in such a short period of time.
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> Just in the East Room for a historic bill signing. Tell us about the bill that you just signed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's really an accountability bill. You had people that would be in the VA and they wouldn't work, or they do much worse than that, and you couldn't fire them. You couldn't get rid of them. They were hanging around, they were receiving money, they weren't taking care of our veterans, and I've made the promise that I was going to be taking care of our veterans if I win/ And you know, they voted for me overwhelmingly. I just had a, you know, in my own heart, I had a very strong obligation to take care. So, we had it passed. Tom Cotton and so many other people were so involved, that Mr. Rowe, you who you know very well. They worked so hard and so long on that, and that was a tough one to get through. So now they do have accountability.
<Pete Hegseth> <Negative> Why would a bill that makes so much common sense to so many Americans, why would it be so hard to get done? Because this was a difficult fight through the finish line.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was a very difficult fight. But look, you have many forces -- and I'm not saying bad forces -- you have unions, the unions don't want to see a thing like that where you can fire someone right away, and you know if they're not doing the job, it's called accountability. But you had a lot of forces, as you can imagine and, you know the force probably better than anyone. You were one of the reasons that I really felt... I used to watch you on Fox talking about the veterans with such... with such heart, and you know, you were one of the factors I will tell you, then we started speaking about it. But we've done a lot for the veterans, but you did have a lot of forces against this bill. This was not an easy one.
<Pete Hegseth> <Negative> Absolutely. When you rode down that escalator in Trump Tower, it was the first time a presidential candidate had made veterans issues a top... you mentioned multiple times in that speech. Obviously you've been involved in veterans issues for years. Where did that passion first come from?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've always felt the veterans weren't given a fair shake. They fight wars, they lose limbs, they lose, you know lives. They've gone through so much, and I've always felt they were never appreciated the way they should be appreciated. But, you know who appreciates? The voters and I'm not just talking about them as a block, which is a big block. But I'm talking about the voters outside of the veterans. They appreciate what the veterans have done. But I've always felt they were not given a fair shake, and then you agreed the disaster stories of course where people are waiting on line for 7, 8, 9days to see a doctor and worse, where they have a disease or a problem or a form of cancer that's easily and quickly curable and they have to wait 6, 7, 8 months and by the time they get in it's... it's terminal. It's ,you know the things that go on, it's just incredible, and have gone on. And we have doctor David Chilton who's done a phenomenal job. He's got tremendous compassion, but he's also a tough cookie, and we're getting it done, and we're doing whatever is necessary. We're getting... this was one bill, but we have many and many coming, and the veterans. I think when you look at that in the not-too-distant future, it's going to be a much different place.
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you for your time, and on behalf of America's veterans, thank you for your commitment and following through on it. We appreciate it. It's truly historic day.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Peter.
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> Thank you.
