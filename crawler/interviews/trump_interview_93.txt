<Matt Lauer> <Positive> He owns a chunk of Manhattan and half of Atlantic City, but that is not enough for Donald Trump. He won't stop until he's a best-selling author for the third time. In his new book Trump: The Art of the Comeback
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But very nice dishing I hope.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Always nice with you, that's right. As I -- as I promised yesterday I do want to talk about some of the women in your life. Your -- your second marriage to Marla, which was three and a half years long, about that...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> ...ended recently.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> She says she could not convince you to spend time with the family, that work and deals always, always came first. Is that fair?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it was fair. I think that she really has a legitimate complaint. You know, I love my business, I love working, and I think I'm a very good father. I'm not sure I'm as good of a husband as I am a father, but -- but I think she has a legitimate complaint in that -- in that way. I am not able to spend very much time.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> But this isn't something new to you, so why do you even get into a marriage with Marla if you know that's the way you're going to be?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, sometimes in life you make mistakes, and I don't even blame her. I mean, I think that I really, you know, I'm very intense with my business, I love my business. I love a lot of things. But the fact is I do spend a lot of time on the business and that takes away from the -- from the marriage stuff.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> You write in the book, Often I'll tell -- and I'm quoting
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true. Well, I mean, I think that a man...
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> That doesn't say much for trying to make a marriage work, though, does it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, it doesn't. It's very cold and I hate saying it, but it's true. I mean, I've seen people that are married to women that, you know, they -- their lives, they just will not be successful. Now, maybe success isn't the only thing, but in my opinion, and this weren't -- was not referring to Marla or Ivana -- but in my opinion you really need support, and if you're not going to have that support, you're not going to be successful. And it is a book about success. I mean, it's the various ingredients towards success. Not only coming back, but really success. I think success may be even more than coming back, so.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Do you think people are going to look at you as someone they should take marriage advice from?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's a tough question. That may be the toughest question in two days. I don't know. I think, to me, a relationship, that kind of a relationship, is much more complex than business. Business always comes easy for me, it's always been easy for me, and I -- I knock on wood, I had to refocus a little bit and all, but, I mean, my business is much bigger and stronger than it ever was before, even in the '80s. And it's just been natural that I want to work a little bit at it, whereas the marriage stuff to me is very much more complex.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Also from the book, quote, One thing I've learned
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I guess I say that with a little bit of tongue in cheek. I think that a -- a marriage should be easy. When my father -- my mother and father were married well over 50 years -- he'd come home. He'd just come home and have dinner. It wasn't like you worked hard. I know that...
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Don't you think it was a good marriage?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A great marriage, my parents had a great marriage. Yeah, they were married for well over 50 years, and divorce wasn't even...
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> But, again, that's the time when people didn't get divorced as often as we do now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's true. I think that's true, but, I mean, they just had a very good marriage. My father was a businessman and my mother was a great homemaker, and they were just lovely people, and they had a good marriage. But they didn't have to work at it. You know, I have people that say, Oh, you should go see a doctor,' or, you know, a shrinko, you should see' -- who have more problems than all of us put together. I mean, these guys are really sickos. So, You should go over and see a doctor,' or this, or that, and you'll counsel and spend hours. And my attitude is if it's that hard, maybe you shouldn't be doing it. You're supposed to have, like, an easy relationship, not a hard relationship.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> You say you're looking for no maintenance. In the book you also say, as it's been well publicized now, that you would have liked to have courted Princess Diana. Do you think she's a no maintenance kind of lady -- or was?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think she was probably heavy maintenance, very heavy maintenance, maybe the heaviest of all, but I think that it would have been interesting, certainly.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> You said that. You put it in the book after the book had been completed. Obviously after her tragic death. Did you ever -- did it ever cross your mind, you know, even if you think it, maybe just don't say it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I like to say it. It gets me in a lot of trouble but I like to say it. I think she was great. I mean, I knew her a little bit, and I thought she was really a great beauty. She was actually supermodel beautiful, and a lot of people don't realize that. But she was a total beauty and she was very nice. But very mixed up, very insecure, had lots of problems, obviously. I mean, they're very well documented. But I -- I think, just in thinking back, that would have been terrific.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Let me get back to Marla for a second. You have a prenuptial agreement with her.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Mm-hm.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Pretty tight or do you think you're going to have a nasty court battle?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I mean, I don't know. We're friends. And we've been broken up for quite a while, and we'll see what happens. I mean, with -- with Ivana I had a prenuptial agreement and she took me to court, and I won, but -- and I won consistently. I mean, she had lots of lawyers and lots of different lawyers at different times, and I won consistently. Prenuptial agreements are very powerful, especially in New York they've very strong, because it really solves lots of problems in New York. It keeps people out of court.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> You have a clause in the -- in the prenuptial with Marla that said that she would get more money had the marriage lasted a little bit longer. There are a lot of people, you know, who say you made a business decision here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well...
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> You got out of this to save some cash.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...I mean, I don't even know who told you about that clause, but I mean, if there is such a clause...
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Is there?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...psychologically I guess I'd have to think about that..
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Is there such a clause?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to comment on it. I -- it's just really not the thing I want to talk about in terms of the specifics of the prenup. But she's a good woman. We're going to find out whether or not she will do what lots of people do. I mean, oftentimes you signed the prenup and, you know, as soon as something goes wrong, you get sued. So, we'll be finding that out, I guess, soon enough.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> You mentioned Ivana. She's single again.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She is.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Any chance you two will get back together?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, but we're friends and she's a good woman...
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Do you want to think about it for a second? No.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Why was that such a quick answer? That was very quick, but -- but she is a good woman, and we have three beautiful children together. And Ivanka's become a little star in her own right, my little Ivanka, so, you know, the relationship has been very good.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> The Art of the Comeback is the new book. Good luck on the golf course.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you very much, and you too.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Thanks. We're back in a moment. This is Today on NBC.
