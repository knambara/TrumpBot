<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Part 1 of my interview with President Trump right after this historic meeting.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. President, great to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you very much.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Historic day. Let's just -- I think most people like me want to know what was going on in that room one on one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well the big thing is this is now my 25th hour of being up and negotiating, and we've been negotiating very hard.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> This is about the complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization of the entire peninsula.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And so without that, we could not have had a deal. I mean, the one thing -- we want to de-nuke the entire peninsula, we want to de-nuke that whole situation. That is a hotbed, and you know what's been happening for years, and nobody did anything about it. And you have to. We have no choice. We had to.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The relationship was really good. The -- you know it built. And, I talked about early on in the relationship, and the feeling, well, we had a very good feeling right from the beginning, and we were able to get something very important done, and actually some things happened after that was signed Sean, where we're getting rid of certain missile research areas, certain missile testing sites. They're getting rid of a lot.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You know in the lead up to this, and this was pretty amazing, because obviously I'm a pretty strong critic of our news media --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> in our country, but a lot had happened. He dismantled the nuclear test site. He crossed over the DMZ. Three hostages were released. The missiles stopped being fired. He was willing -- he -- you wouldn't have come here if he did not, if he was not willing to talk about denuclearization.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> So all of that happened before you walked in, and I don't remember that you sent cargo planes of cash, or gave anything really for the lead up. Why do you think you -- why do you think he's interested in doing this after spending that time with him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's sort of interesting, because I noticed some of the press -- and I'm not even knocking them, because honestly, they're treating me very good on the subject. What's to treat badly? But some of the press would say he's meeting with them, and therefore he has a major loss. I said, since when? Others wanted to. It never worked out. It probably never could have worked out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, we really have gotten a lot. You haven't seen missiles going up in seven or eight months. You haven't seen research. You haven't seen nuclear tests, very importantly. Japan is very happy because they were being encircled. I mean there was a period of time when they were going right over the middle of Japan.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we got our hostages back. And you're right. We didn't pay for that. But, but I think -- I don't say that in a braggadocios way at all, because he did such a smart thing, because that was such a good -- a good thing to do. And, and I feel so badly about Otto Warmbier. That was the one thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And Otto did not die in vain. I actually believe -- and I've gotten very friendly with Otto's parents. They're incredible people -- devastated as they, you know, as would think, great parents. He was a great young man. But I think without Otto, this whole thing wouldn't have happened. Because it crystallized when he came back in the condition, it crystallized so much to so many people, maybe even to the other side, frankly. But I think that truly did not die in vain.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I've known you for a lot of years and I think one trait that I could say is brutal honesty. In the room alone, and then the subsequent talks with your team and their team and their team. How honest, how brutal? What was said? Bring -- try to bring people into the room.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we got along very well. We got along from the beginning. We started off, he and myself, and two interpreters, and from the beginning we got along. You know, I've made a statement, and I've said it before, I've said it about a lot of different kinds of relationships. You can almost tell right at the beginning.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Did you tell at the beginning? What was that first minute?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I felt, I felt, no I felt very good at the beginning. And we, you know, I talked about -- we have to denuke. This country has to be denuked. And he understood that. He fully understood it. He didn't fight it, and we're doing some great things for his country and South Korea is going to be involved very much in helping, and Japan is going to be involved, and President Xi of China has been you know really terrific on the border. I think less so the last couple of months unfortunately.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Was that a big part, because, in your meetings, when you met with the President of China was scheduled, if I recall, for like 15 minutes. Didn't some go on for four hours?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right. Well, we actually met at Mar-a-Lago. He wanted to be at Mar a Lago, and we had a 15 minute meeting scheduled, when he comes in, we were going to go into breakout rooms where we had many people waiting for us. And it ended up lasting four hours. The 15 minutes, President of China. Great guy. It ended up lasting for four hours. We just got along, and we have gotten along. I mean I want him to treat us better on trade. That's my only problem. You know, they're killing us --
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Is that happening? Did they make concessions on intellectual property, trade...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they want to do things. It's a tough thing. You know, they're doing so well. They've made so much progress against us for so many years, it's awfully tough for them to bring it back, and we'll see how that all works out. We're gonna -- we're going to do something. Definitely we're going to do something. You know, they offered us $80 billion in purchases of agricultural products.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it's just not enough for what we're talking about. It's $80 billion.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> What do you want?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I never thought I'd turn down $80 billion. But, e have to do something with intellectual property. We have to do something just generally and trade. Last year we lost $500 billion dollars with China. We can't do that anymore.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Let's go to the beginning. There were a lot of people, critics, quickly saying when you said little rocket man, or fire and fury, or, you know, when he said, oh I've got a red button on my desk. You said, well mine's bigger, and it works better than yours. How did we -- how did it evolve from that to this? Because he did say, at the very beginning, we're going to basically start over, and that has been building behind the scenes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think without the rhetoric, we wouldn't have been here. I really believe that. You know, we did sanctions and all of the things that you would do. But I think without the rhetoric, you know, other administrations -- I don't want to get specific on that -- but they had a policy of silence. If they said something very bad, very threatening and horrible, just don't answer. That's not the answer. That's not what you have to do. So I think the rhetoric, I hated to do it. Sometimes, I felt foolish doing it. But we had no choice.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> So strategically you were doing it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, yeah, I mean, but I think we gained respect. You know, he's a strong guy. Hey, people were saying what's he like. He's got a very good personality. He's funny, and he's very, very smart. He's a great negotiator. And he's a very strategic kind of a guy.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> One of the points that I think surprised everybody, I think every American should be very happy about this is the Korean War, which has gone on for so long. More importantly, there are still American remains there --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And they will be repatriated?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The remains are coming back.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we got that at the end. In fact, we have some things that you don't even have in the report. We put out the report --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> What can you tell us?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- what we signed. Missile sites that they use for the launching of missiles and missile research areas, that's going to be gone. We made a lot of progress, tremendous amount of progress, and one of the things that I'm very happy about. We're not going to
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're flying these massive bombers in for practice from Guam. I said, how far is Guam? Six and half hours or so. I said, that's a long way for a big bomber times, you know, 20 --
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- and lots of other planes coming in. So, we're not going to be doing the war games as long as we're negotiating in good faith. So, that's good for a number of reasons, in addition to which we save a tremendous amount of money. You know, those things tha
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would look at them coming in from the sea and bombs exploding everywhere. I said, what does this cost? I don't even want to tell you. But it's a lot. So we're not going to be doing that as long as we're negotiating in good faith, which I think we will be.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You managed expectations, I think, pretty well. You didn't think coming in here you were going to sign an agreement. And you said maybe it takes two, three, four, or five meetings, but you were open to going as fast or slow as he wanted.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We get along better than I would have assumed, right from the beginning. We got a lot more done today than I ever thought possible. And he's going back, he's now headed back, and he I think he's going back to get this done. He wants to get it done. You know, when you hear the whole thing about his father and other administrations, or his grandfather, the fact is -- and he, and he brings that up. But they weren't dealing with me. They were dealing with different people, and nobody's ever come close.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> What did you learn from -- did he talks about the difference between past administrations and yours?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, but I can say that, because I don't want to be the one saying it. At some point, I'm sure he'll say it. But they never got done. And they would never this close either. I mean, it was never to a point where they were like we are.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Is there a history lesson to learn here? I think, in one sense, we could talk about past administrations. Reagan, evil empire. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall. His own advisers did -- wanted to take those words out of that speech. And you compare, Bill Clinton gave Kim Jong-un's father $3 billion dollars in energy subsidies.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A tremendous amount of money.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> The mullahs in Iran, you have said the worst deal in the history of mankind. That's --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Probably the worst deal I've seen. Worse than NAFTA, and I think NAFTA it is pretty bad, worse than the WTO, the World Trade Organization, which frankly built China, in addition to the money that we gave them all the time. You know, I mean these were terrible deals. But I would say that the Iran deal was one of the worst I've ever seen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will say, speaking of the Iran deal, since we got out of that deal, and we could do it very easily because they never had it approved by Congress. It was just President Obama.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> This must be approved by Congress.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want it to be approved by Congress, because otherwise it's really doesn't mean very much. I want it -- I would think anybody would want it approved by Congress. But since we took out of that deal -- we got out of that deal, I think Iran is a much different place. I don't think they're looking so much to the Mediterranean and Syria and Yemen. They're starting to pull people out of Yemen. They're starting to pull people out of Syria.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, it's a whole different thing. Now, I did it for nuclear. But one of the side benefits is, you take a look, a serious look, and Iran is not the country that it was three or four months ago when they were much more emboldened.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Well, certainly sanctions played a big part.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A big part.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> The strike forces that you sent into the region off the coast --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A big part. And I think at a certain point, honestly -- I know the Iranian people. I know many people from Iran. These are great people. I really believe at some point they're going to come back and negotiate a deal.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Did reunification come up? Did humanitarian issues come up in the meeting?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes it did. And one of the things I will tell you that I'm most happy about, and that is, you know, is a big sticking point is bringing back the remains of thousands of soldiers that were killed.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> This came up last minute? This wasn't --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This was sort of last minute, yeah.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said, would it be possible? Because I get letters all the time from families who lost a son, lost a brother, lost a father in Korea. That was a rough fight.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they were buried along the roadways. They were buried, as, you know, soldiers going back and forth into battle, and they were burying them along roadways. And they say, please, please could you do it? I get so many letters from people who lost a loved one in North Korea, essentially in North Korea.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I would say, I'm going to try. And I brought it up and I'll tell you what. It was almost immediate. Now, in the past it was -- you couldn't even talk about it. But it was really a nice response.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> How quickly... did you talk about a trip to the United States? Did you talk about --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think, at the right time, he'll absolutely be coming to the White House, yeah. Look, we've been very -- it's been a very intense relationship. It's been short, and very intense, and of course, before that, it was pretty rhetorical. It was, you know, not a pretty thing. People were very worried. But without that, I don't think we would have been here today.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He wants to get something done. I want to get something done. I think we'll get it done. And we started off by really, a very strong document. I think people are surprised to see it. They're shocked to see it.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And then add some more things that we got after that was signed.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> And so, can you give us maybe a glimpse into what, that you keep sort of referring to, a little bit, to things that will be coming.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I just think that we are now going to start the process of denuclearization of North Korea, and I believe that he's going back and will start it virtually immediately, and he's already indicated that. And you look at what he's done. So, we've got our hostages back. But they've blown up one of their sites, one of their testing sites. Their primary testing site.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In fact, some people say their only testing site. They're getting rid of a missile which isn't in the document that was done afterwards. They're getting rid of a missile testing site. They're doing so much now. So, it's a process, and it's it's really moving rapidly.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Last question because I know you have a lot to do. Obviously he wants something on his end. Certainly he wants the -- the world community, wants sanctions lifted. He wants economic opportunity, and his people need it desperately. There are people starving there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> So I guess the question is the order. What would he have to do to get the sanctions lifted? To get the economic opportunity opened up for the people?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, what he wants is security. And I understand that and he'll get that. And he wants to see if they can make that incredible location -- because it's an incredible -- it's between China and South Korea. Think of it. I'm in the real estate business. Think of that.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> [Laughing] Are you planning on building Trump Tower maybe, first thing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have prosperous South Korea -- no, but think, how good a location is that?
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You have China --
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- and you have South Korea. And he's got right in the middle of both of them, surrounded by water. That's called like, can there be anything better than that? And it's also beautiful land. It's incredible land. So I think he wants -- I think he understan
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Are the Chinese happy? They're involved. The South Koreans. The Japanese.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so. I think -- look. China can't be thrilled about a very strong group of people having nuclear missiles with great capability right next to him. So I really do believe they are -- they were very very helpful.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think maybe a little bit less so in the last two or three months, because we're talking about trade and other things, and you know, it's -- nothing's going to interfere with my relationship with President Xi, because I have great respect for him. He's really a great man, in a true sense. He's a great man.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> One of the best stories you tell, and it's an interesting story, historically speaking, is you were having dessert with him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right, at Mar-a-Lago. Chocolate cake.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You remember.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I said --
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> This was the first -- this was after this was after Assad had used chemical weapons --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right. That's right.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> -- on his own people. And you had launched the first strike. And you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said, Mr. President we just sent 58 missiles into Syria to hit a certain target. And he said, please say it again, with his interpreter I said, we just sent 58 missiles and -- by the way, to show you the technology. Every single one of those missiles, from 700 miles away, in the ocean, ships in the ocean, every one -- 58 missiles, 58 hits. It's incredible technology.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What -- what we have is so incredible, so lethal. Not that we want to do it, but so lethal. But that was done because Syria, Assad used chemical gasses on children, and we had to do that. Had President Obama gone over the red line, I think you maybe would have had a different story in the Middle East. I really believe that. But he didn't do that. But we did. And so I told him, sitting at Mar-a-Lago, at dinner.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Eating chocolate cake.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said, either he's going to leave, or we're going to still be friends. But he didn't leave, but he understood. He really understood. He really doesn't want to see it.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> He agreed? Did he agree?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well he, I think, yeah, I think he really did, because he knew that a lot of people ,and a lot of children, were killed by gas. And he -- yeah, he fully understood.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I know you have a lot to do. Mr. President, thanks for being so generous with your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Congratulations. Thank you, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi everybody. Good to see you. Colleen.
<Colleen Marshall> <Negative> Good morning, Mr. Trump. Colleen Marshall. NBC4. Nice to meet you. This is Mike Klug. In the debate last night, you raised questions about whether or not the election system could be rigged. We have a Republican Secretary of State who says it's virtually impossible to rig an election. Is this a dangerous message you're sending to people that election might be rigged?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, he's excellent by the way, I have to tell you and maybe in Ohio, it's fine, but in many places throughout the country they do have problems and I'm actually here to talk about it during my speech, so I think you'll find it very interesting.
<Colleen Marshall> <Neutral> What is your evidence of that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you have a lot of evidence and I'm going to be talking about it during my speech, so you'll watch.
<Colleen Marshall> <Negative> Okay. Ohio Senator Rob Portman is one of the people who withdrew his support for him after the Access Hollywood tape came out. How much is it hurting you, that these Republican leaders are trying to distance themselves from you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I think they're doing themselves a tremendous disservice. We're actually substantially in Ohio. We have tremendous support from the people. And I think they are doing themselves a tremendous disservice. We have a couple of cases where people that aren't supporting me, they're losing and I'm winning states. And you're seen that. It's all over the place.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, you know, I was very disappointed in Rob, but he's free to do whatever he has to do. You're doing fantastically well in Ohio. Rasmussen just came out the poll. We're 3 up nationwide. And IBJ just came out, and we're one up, and that was the most accurate poll of the season last year. So I think we're doing really well.
<Colleen Marshall> <Negative> Last night, it was pointed out in the debate that financial plans, experts say, would put America in a worse position than those of Hillary Clinton, even though she's not getting high marks either. Do you agree with that? I mean, are you concerned...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I totally disagree. We're going to lower taxes very substantially for Ohio and everybody else. Our taxes... we're the highest tax nation anywhere in the world. So we're going to lower taxes very very substantially. We're also lowering business taxes. The businesses now are leaving. They're going to Mexico and every place else, because the taxes are so high
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So when we do this massive tax cut, this massive regulatory cut, which is a tremendous problem, we're going to have jobs coming back in. We have a GDP of around 1 percent. You saw the last quarter. It was around 1 percent which is record setting low, almost record-setting low.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to have gross... look, we're going to have a tremendous GDP. It's going to be maybe 4 percent, and it could even be higher than that. If that happens, then our nation will be booming again. We have the weakest recovery in our nation since the depression. Since the Great Depression. People are looking for jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look at the kind of crowds we're getting as an example right here. They're looking for help. They're looking for the jobs. Our manufacturing has been stripped out of our country. Our jobs have been taken out of our country. So. My plan is lowering taxes. Hillary Clinton wants to raise taxes they don't like her plan very much.
<Colleen Marshall> <Positive> But yet the experts say your plan is the one that really won't work.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> My plan will work. The experts are not really experts. They've been wrong so much over the years. My plan is the largest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan's plan worked Mine is similar. My tax cut could even be a little bit larger, but I think it's going to work, and it's going to be great, and it's going to put people back to work. And it's going to stop companies from leaving Ohio and other places.
<Colleen Marshall> <Negative> Nineteen days out from the election, you've been labeled a racist. You've been called a sexist.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Colleen Marshall> <Neutral> How do you respond to that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am the least racist person you've ever met.
<Colleen Marshall> <Positive> Thank you.
<John Heilemann> <Negative> Corporate inversions, right. You've said this is a serious problem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A tremendous problem.
<John Heilemann> <Negative> OK. So you've also argued that bankruptcy laws -- you've taken advantage of bankruptcy laws --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have.
<John Heilemann> <Negative> Corporations have done that. It's within the law. You take advantage. How is -- how are inversions different from taking advantage of the bankruptcy laws?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the difference --
<John Heilemann> <Negative> This is legal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<John Heilemann> <Positive> This is companies trying to benefit their shareholders. How is it different?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Much different in this way. You can stop it so easily. There's $2.5 trillion out there -- at least. It could be four, could be five.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But $2.5 trillion that they know of. This is money that wants to come back to this country. The corporations want to bring back; they can't bring it back in because of the tax laws. They're so prohibitive, so bad and so complicated.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So they can't bring it. So now what's happening is companies are leaving our country. And you're reading about it. You're seeing Pfizer, you're seeing some -- they're leaving our country and thinking about -- massive numbers of companies are thinking about leaving to go out and get that money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Also to get a better tax deal. So that's a lot different.
<John Heilemann> <Negative> So when you're saying it's a serious problem, what you're saying is the law is the problem, not the companies' behavior. It's not bad what Pfizer is doing --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, and there's no way you can stop it really other than lowering the taxes because right now, John, it's prohibitive to bring that money. They'd have to pay so much, they'd have to be fools to bring it in. But under my plan and a couple of others' -- but nobody even knew about corporate inversion until I brought it in. I mean, these are the candidates -- they don't even know what corporate inversion is.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do know, I really know. You're going to lose hundreds of thousands of jobs to other countries because of corporate inversions. What you're going to do is you're going to lower the taxes, bring the money in, and they're going to use that money to build and do things in the United States.
<John Heilemann> <Positive> Again, so you're not criticizing Pfizer at all --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, really, I'm not.
<John Heilemann> <Positive> -- or companies like that. It's just about the law.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, in the old days, you'd leave New York and go down to Florida. Or you'd leave New Jersey and go to Texas to save taxes. Now because of the way the world is, so different, you leave the United States and you go to Ireland and you go to different places in Asia and you go to Europe. I mean, it's a different world, and we have to compete better.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> This is a great New York institution.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It is.
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> So is Saturday Night Live. You're doing it this week.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> Nervous? Excited? How do you feel about it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I did it like 11 years ago when "The Apprentice"" became number one and they asked me to do it. And I'm just excited about it. I think it's great. We're going to meet with Lorne Michaels today."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're going to come up with some skits. And it's going to be very exciting --
<John Heilemann> <Positive> I'll give you an idea. Pretty good one, right? You're going to try that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's a good one.
<John Heilemann> <Neutral> Think about it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'll think about it.
<John Heilemann> <Positive> I don't want a royalty, but --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'll think about it.
<John Heilemann> <Positive> So this rink, right? It was once the largest ice rink in the world --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right?
<John Heilemann> <Negative> Now it's -- you know, this lot [Inaudible] rink is bigger than this, obviously. That was back in the 50s when it was built --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we had more people. Oh, yeah, they have massive lakes. You know, they have lakes, in all fairness. [Laughter]
<John Heilemann> <Positive> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we have more people than any other ice rink by far in the world.
<John Heilemann> <Positive> Right. Do you skate yourself?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't.
<John Heilemann> <Neutral> What do you do for exercise if it's not ice skating?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don't ask me! I run for office. This is what I needed. [Crosstalk]
<John Heilemann> <Negative> C'mon, seriously? No exercise?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I play golf. I play golf. I play tennis. I love sports.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't have much time for exercising, but I do love sports.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> OK, here's a question I've been wanting to ask you for awhile. We almost never get to see you eat. What do you like to eat? What's like, Donald Trump's favorite food?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love to eat the food we have in here.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> Really? Like what do they have in there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love steak and hamburger and pasta and French fries. All the things we shouldn't be eating is what I love.
<John Heilemann> <Positive> Well, then you need to do some more exercise if you eat that well!
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> Are you like a normal eater, like three meals a day?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Pretty much. Pretty much. I try. A lot of times I can't because I'm pretty busy.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> What's a food you like that you know you shouldn't eat but you just can't resist?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, bacon, eggs, steak -- I don't know. I hear good and bad. I hear good things. Sometimes they'll come out with a report; steak is great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Then they come out with [Inaudible]. So the bottom line: they don't know what they're doing. So I eat what I like. But it's been -- you know, it's been working.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> How many pieces of bacon would you eat normally in one sitting?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Don't ask.
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> Don't ask.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Too many!
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> More than two?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Too many!
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> All right.
<John Heilemann> <Positive> New York's team, the New York Mets last night lost the World Series against Kansas City Royals. Is that because the Kansas City Royals are great or because the Mets kind of blew it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they blew it a little bit. But they've really turned out to be a great team, Kansas City. And the Mets had a wonderful season. They've come so far and they should be proud of themselves.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think Kansas City really had a great winning team. And they've said during the whole season they'd come back. I love these comeback people. They would come back.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They'd be losing the game in the ninth inning. I think they practically set a record for comebacks. There's something special about that. They came back on a number of occasions against the Mets.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But the Mets had a great season.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> You've got a son, you've got grandkids. What do you do to make them laugh?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I spend as much time as I can with them. You know, the time has been -- it was tight before, and now this is ridiculous. Although more and more, I'm giving management over to my children and my executives of the company. But I do nothing to make them laugh.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just love them.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> No funny faces --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A little bit probably. I don't think I want to do it on this one, but a little bit, yeah --
<John Heilemann> <Negative> Oh, come on, give us just a little bit.
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> Bernie Sanders -- Bernie Sanders does a monster imitation for his grandkids.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah... Bernie Sanders. He blew it. Bernie Sanders blew it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what? He blew it with the emails. When he gave that up, I said, great sound bite, but that's the end of him. That's the end of him. By the way, not getting the crowds anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's over. When he gave up the emails, which he shouldn't have given up, I said, great sound bite. He's dead. And he's dead.
<John Heilemann> <Positive> This rink, right? You were talking before in extraordinary detail about how the ice gets made, the Freon versus this and that. Have you ever driven the Zamboni?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have, one time.
<John Heilemann> <Negative> Really? What was that like?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's great.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> What things have you achieved since your father passed away that you think he'd be really proud of?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he was a spectacular guy. He was a wonderful builder and a wonderful person. Had a great heart -- we talked about heart. But he was a very good negotiator.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I learned a lot. And he gave me a loan when I -- I said, Dad, I want to go out to Manhattan. He said no, no, no, you don't know anything about that. Let's stay in Brooklyn and Queens.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I said no, I want to go out to Manhattan. When I was very young! And I came to Manhattan, I did really well right from the beginning. And it was just -- you know, he was just somebody who was very special.
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> What do you think he'd think about your running for president?
<John Heilemann> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he would say, amazing and go do it. You know, he came up with a saying -- but he was a very tough cookie. But he came up with a statement because when I worked for him, I did great stuff and I had great success even working for him and brought it to a very high level. And he said to one of the big business magazines, "Everything he touches turns to gold."" And I said -- and that statement's followed me."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, because this was not a father who would normally say that. This was a very tough cookie. Not easy, but terrific. A terrific guy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But he said that. He made that statement. And that's probably the greatest compliment that I have ever had. But he said, "Everything he touches turns to gold."" So let's see what happens."
<John Heilemann> <Neutral> Was he a political guy?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He was political, but different kind of political. He was political to get a building permit, political to be able to build a house or a building in Brooklyn or Queens.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> There's nothing more political than that!
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's pretty political. [News Break] [22:55] [25:52]
<John Heilemann> <Negative> So let's go back to the summer of 1986. Your office, not that far from here. You looked down and saw what? And why did you then decide to get involved in this project?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I saw for years a mess. I saw a place that was under construction, which is the Wollman Rink, and it was under construction for many years -- eight, to be exact. And I said, what's going on? We're talking about a slab of concrete. Now, it's actually much more complicated than that, to be honest with you, but still, it's a very large slab of concrete.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And after a number of years, I call the mayor and say, what's going on? And nobody was ever working. They were having a lunch break all day long. Hundreds of people. They'd all be sitting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it has been a great experiment. I mean, you may want to continue with your question, but it's certainly been a great experiment.
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> What was in it for you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I just wanted to get it done. I had a young daughter at the time, young -- and still young, Ivanka. And she said, Dad, I'd love to go ice skating. But thank rink is never going to open.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And you know, we took in seven to eight years. Seven seasons and eight years total. And I said, let me look into it. So I would look down and I'd see it, right from Trump Tower.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And then I would pass it and I would look at the men. I know a lot of the men, because the construction business I know. And I would see a lot of the workers and they would wave to me, "Hi
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody cares." And I went to see Koch
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I went to Ed Koch, I said, "Let me do it. If I don't do it under $2 million and do it fast
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> Right. So is this a story about the ineffectiveness of the public sector and the effectiveness of the private sector, or does this say something special about your capacity to get things done?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I do have a great capacity to get things done. But it also has to do with the private sector. I mean, I don't know if anybody could have beaten my record. As an example, the old post office under construction right now on Pennsylvania Avenue right between Congress and the White House, boom! The most beautiful building.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It is incredible. I'm under budget, ahead of schedule. Which is what it should be. And we're going to open -- we were supposed to open in '17.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're now going to open probably in September of '16, which is very good timing, actually. Right on Pennsylvania Avenue. So I get things done. But another one I'm very proud of, Ferry Point.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They had a big development in the Bronx that was a disaster, under construction probably for 30 years. Nobody really knows when it started it was so long ago. And I got it done in one year. And it is open now and it is very successful.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> To people who say that Trump has no government experience, he can't possibly be president because that's not what being president is about, this was a government problem. The city did not get these things built. So what are examples of things now that aren't getting done that you think that you could bring the same skills to if you were president, just the way you got this thing built?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will give you one example. Wars. Wars aren't getting done. It's the same thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, you look at ISIS, you look at what's going on with what we're doing. Then we send 50 people over there, our 50 best. Why would anybody say that we're sending? Why does the president say we are sending 50 people? Those people are in great danger now because we're saying that. Why wouldn't he send them if he's got to send them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> First of all, either win or don't win, win or get out. But he sends 50 people over there; he then he makes a public announcement to the world, 50 people. Well, those men and women right now being hunted. They are looking for those men.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why does he have to say that he is sending them out? Do you know how dangerous that is?
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> Your critics would say that you've just compared building an ice skating rink to stopping wars. [Crosstalk]
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> Explain this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because it has to do with efficiency, it has to do with commonsense, it has to do with knowledge. Look, I wrote a book in the year 2000, and I talked about Osama bin Laden because I watched this guy talking. You know, he was a terrorist, well known, and I wrote about him in a book. And Joe Scarborough said, hey, when was that book written? It was in 2000.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was before the World Trade Center came down. And he goes, whoa, that's amazing. Look, you know, I have a knack for things, and I know what I am doing. And this country is so far behind in every way, in trade, in military.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We are so far -- I watched the other day, General Orieono. He's leaving. He said we are the least prepared -- he was talking about Army. But he said we are the least prepared that we have ever been -- I think he said ever been -- in the history of the country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, he said might have been since the Second World War, but I think it was essentially said ever. We can't have that.
<John Heilemann> <Positive> So let's ask the question this way, a different way. Are you -- is the argument that you are making that the skill set required to be of the president of the United States is the same as the skill set of a CEO?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No. I'm not.
<John Heilemann> <Neutral> And if they're not the same, what are the differences?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, they're not the same. But I am better than those people. I will do a better job. I will do a better job with the military, I will do a better job with jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know my competition. I understand life. I understand competition --
<John Heilemann> <Neutral> But again, just what --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> See these buildings over there? I've built numerous of them. And they're successful!
<John Heilemann> <Positive> But what are the differences, though? What's the difference? There are skills that are required to be a successful CEO, skills that are required to be a successful president. You said they're different. So what are the differences? What's the way in which you'd have to change your game if you were president?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> To be a CEO and depending on companies and everything else, because every company is different, OK? But to be a CEO, you have to be, boom, and get it done. To be a president, I think you have to be boom and get it done, but I also think you have to have heart. We have a lot of people that need help. We have a lot of people in this country that are not making it, and they are in trouble.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I think you really -- I always say I am a conservative with heart. Because people think conservatives don't have heart. You know, you hear about Obamacare and people want to knock the hell out of Obamacare, and they should be, because it is horrible. And by the way, as I told you at our last meeting, actually quite a while ago, watch the premiums.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you've seen what's happened. The premiums are going through the roof; it's not working. It's not going to work, and it's going to collapse in '17, unless something major is done in Congress. And they shouldn't do it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They should come up with a much better plan. But I like to say, you need great abilities, but you also have to have big, beautiful hearts. That's important.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> Oftentimes when people are asked about, are you ready for president, someone will say, well, nobody's ever really ready. No one can step in until you're in the job. Is that how you feel about it, or do you feel like because of accomplishments like this from day one, you could walk in and do it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, this isn't one of my big things, but this is -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what this shows? This shows simplicity. Now it wasn't that simple. They were using Freon; they should've used brine. They were using -- and I tell the story where they had their engineer for making ice was located in Miami.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Immediately I said, why is an engineer for an ice skating rink in Miami? And it wasn't working. And they had -- they had all these copper pipes. Every night they'd lay them, and they'd be stolen. They'd lay them -- they lost a fortune.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What happened is I went to the Montreal Canadians -- a friend of mine works for the Montreal Canadians, the ice hockey team in Canada. And I said, "Do me a favor. Who do I speak to about making ice?"" And he gave me the people that the Montreal Canadians use. He came down and said
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> Again, are you ready to be president from day one? No learning curve, step in and do it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hey look, Obama had no experience. I've always said talent is more important than experience. But I just don't think Obama as our president is a talented person, and he should never have been in this position. And he had no experience, and it is not his thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, you have Democrats, you have Congressmen that have hardly ever seen him and hardly ever met him. He doesn't work the system. That is why he signs executive orders all the time because he can't get his own people to go along. But when it came to the war, as an example -- talk two examples.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We should have never been in Iraq. And you know that I said a long time ago, in 2003, 2004, don't do it. You're going to break up the balance of the Middle East. And boy, has that happened.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know it gave us ISIS, it gave us nothing but problems, all right? But then when we left, he should not have left the way he did. But when he announced a date for leaving, the enemy said -- and I immediately said, this is a disaster. He announced a specific day, "We will be out by such and such a day."" So the enemy says
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know it is politically -- I don't think even think it came out politically good because people say what do you mean 50? What can 50 people do? So I don't even think it was good for him politically. But you have to be quiet. General Patton didn't go and talk about, I am sending 50 men here, I'm sending 200 men here. He did the job, he knocked them out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> General Douglas MacArthur, you go back and look. These were not talkers. So I think it's -- and I really mean this strongly, I think it was a horrible thing that he announced that 50 people are going over to Syria.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> Thank you, Mr. Trump. We are going to be back with more Donald Trump, some news of the day, right after this. [Commercial Break]
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> And now the stirring conclusion of the conversation with Donald Trump in Central Park where we started out asking him about his rival on the rise, Marco Rubio. [Begin Videotape]
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> Well, Marco Rubio is now kind of a candidate on the rise. Some people are saying he's like Barack Obama. He actually compared you to Barack Obama at one point --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He did?
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> -- and he said, like Barack Obama, you are not dignified or worthy of the office you are seeking. He said we have a president now with no class. I'm just wondering what you think --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, is he the one that said that?
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> What do you of the comparison? On issues in leadership --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think he's highly overrated. I think he's an overrated person. I don't think he is going to make it. I noticed that the press, -- in fact, I was watching this morning one of the shows and they were talking about Marco Rubio.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, he's nowhere near in the polls. He's -- I don't think personally he is going to make it. You know, I called him a lightweight. I said at one point he was a lightweight.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I don't mean to be insulting, but I do describe people somehow well. I think Marco --
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> You have been critical of him on immigration. Are there other issues?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, no, he's very critical -- I'm very critical. He was a member of the Gang of Eight, which basically wanted to have everybody come in and take over our country. All of a sudden, he went down in the polls and he immediately changed and got out. He is totally driven about what the public thinks.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think he's not -- look. Bush got creamed in the debate, but he shouldn't -- if I had were the messenger, because the message is great. His delivery was poor. But the message is great.
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> What's the message?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He doesn't show up. Marco doesn't show up to votes, he doesn't do things that you're supposed to do. He got elected senator, and you know, the same thing happened to him in Florida senate if you look, and I know a lot about Florida. I am there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You saw the poll that came out today where I am beating him and Bush by a lot and Carson by a lot in Florida. I know Florida better than they know Florida. So what happens is --
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> But you were talking of him as a state legislator, when he was the speaker.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, he was in the senate, and he tried to get the top position or whatever. Tried to get the top -- a friend of mine told me, who was there with him. They fought, they fought, they got the top position. Two minutes after he had the top position, he was looking to run for Senate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Then he runs for Senate, now he wants to be president. I would say -- maybe I am the last person to say this -- relax. Take it easy. Take it easy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think he is a highly overrated person. I've called him a lightweight. I think he is a lightweight. I hope I'm wrong about that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We can't have -- I don't think he has -- look. You know why he has a chance? Because guys like you -- and I am not specifically referring to you. You a little bit, to be honest, you, a little bit. But I watched somebody on Joe's show this morning, he's fawning over him, He says how handsome he is, how good-looking -- I don't know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I'm better looking than him. Am I better looking than him? So -- no, but they're talking about he is so handsome, he's so wonderful. And Joe goes, look where he is. He is way down here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's probably a nice person. Another thing that I didn't like about him and I don't like about him, he was -- he should have been more loyal to Bush. I was told -- I didn't know him at all -- I was told he would never run because Bush was his mentor, Bush really helped them, Bush did things. Well, I said, all right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Good. Because I am a very loyal person, I am an extremely loyal person, to a fault, frankly. And maybe I would rather have it this way than the other way. He was very, very disloyal to Bush.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't like that.
<John Heilemann> <Positive> Let me ask you about the debate about debates. What is it that you are looking for in a moderator or a set of moderators as we go forward? What are your criteria for moderators?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, John, I don't care that much honestly. I did well in the debates, all three of them. This last one, even CNBC had the winning, did you see that? CNBC had me winning the debate! I do think this: a debate should not be three hours like CNN. CNN did that for money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I could stand up for 24 hours and debate, but the audience isn't going to watch it. Gone With the Wind is three hours, OK? Who's going to want to watch these guys, including me, for three hours? There are certain things we should get. The room was probably 100 degrees, the one room -- was 100 degrees out. All these things are very important things for a debate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is unfair. Now, speaking of Rubio, he's the one that's watched the most. He's the youngest, but I have never seen any human being sweat like that.
<John Heilemann> <Negative> But your problem isn't liberal bias? A lot of your colleagues seem to feel as though these debates have been liberally biased.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, I thought the questions were very unfair, but they were unfair in my opinion from Fox. And they were a little bit unfair from CNN. And most of the unfairness was directed at me, so I am the one who should be complaining.
<John Heilemann> <Negative> So when Senator Cruz says that only moderators who have voted in Republican primaries should be allowed to be in these debates, do you agree with that or you disagree with that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think it's a bad idea. But I can live either way. Look, I had a representative there. I don't care that much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think, frankly, I'd go a step further. I'm more of an economic person. The networks are making a fortune with the debates. The truth is, we should say, we should be like a basketball player.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We should go on strike and say, we want money for Wounded Warriors, or we want money for a great charity. The veterans, I would love to give it. Because CNN made a fortune, an absolute fortune. CNN had a two -- hour debate two days before the debate, and nobody told anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They decided to make it three. Only for one reason, because they sold out all their advertising. They were getting $4,000 for a 30-second ad. They got $250,000.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Same thing with CNBC. I called up CNBC when they went from two hours to three. And they went to three. So Harwood lied.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know Harwood lied when he said that's not true. He totally told a lie, a dirty lie. It was in all the papers that it was going to be a three-hour debate. Does that bother you? That's New York [Sirens in background].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's called welcome to New York.
<Mark Halperin> <Neutral> We are outside.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is both a beautiful and an unattractive sound you know, because it means trouble. But that is New York. So Harwood lied when he talked about the debate. And he lied big-league.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I called up through my people and myself. And within about three minutes, I got it down. It was like one of the easiest negotiations of all time. More important than moderators or anything else, they are going to have big audiences.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let the money go to charity.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> We call this the "Rank the Trump"" bill. Thank you for welcoming us."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> We appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Appreciate it. Thank is so much.
<John Heilemann> <Positive> Actually want to give you one of these.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK! [Laughter, End Videotape]
<John Heilemann> <Positive> All right. Our thanks again to Donald Trump and to his giant block of ice.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I moved on her. Actually, she was down on Palm Beach. I moved on her and I failed. I'll admit it. I did try and fuck her. She was married.
<Billy Bush> <Neutral> That's huge news.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nancy [O'Dell - former co-host of Access Hollywood], no this was... and I moved on her. Very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said 'I'll show you where they have some nice furniture'. I took her... I moved on her like a bitch. I couldn't get there and she was married. And all of a sudden I see her. She's now got the big phoney tits and she's totally changed her look.
<Billy Bush> <Negative> Sheesh, your girl's hot as shit. In the purple.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Whoa! Yes! Whoa!
<Billy Bush> <Positive> Yes! The Donald has scored. Whoa, my man! [crosstalk]
<Billy Bush> <Negative> It better not be the publicist. No it's her, it's...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah that's her in the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs [breath fresheners] just in case I start kissing her. You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful... I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything.
<Billy Bush> <Neutral> Whatever you want.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.
