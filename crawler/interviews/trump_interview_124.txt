<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was not like an option.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> We're all in love with Donald.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you work on a laptop? Kate, your last name is Bohner?
<Kate Bohner> <Neutral> It's Bohner, Howard. I knew you're gonna go there.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, come on.
<Kate Bohner> <Neutral> I know you're gonna go there.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Seriously, I wanna get into the book and everything, cause there's a lot of interesting questions I have. I would always learn new things about you. Yes, I know, and I want to read my passage. Yes. Very nice.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We should read that hope -- that was a pretty good.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I will read -- you said some very nice things about it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He said if I did that. He'll give me a good -- good shot on the show.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You're damn right. You're getting a great shot.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You think you're gonna get promoted.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. It's not often that something nice is written about me. Kate, what happened, the process was, that you and Donald would talk, would you talking to a tape recorder kind of thing and --
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> Yeah. Donald would -- we talk about how to set up a chapter, I come up with an outline and then I mean, Donald --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Where did you do all this work? Where did you do this work?
<Kate Bohner> <Neutral> Mostly --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> At Mar-a-Lago? I wish that house had a name. Did you do it in a hot tub? I -- cause Donald loves to relax and he enjoys, you know, fine things in life. Would he take you to somewhere special to work on a book?
<Kate Bohner> <Negative> No, Donald's a worker. He's the hardest working man in the world.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know that. Where would you do this in a city.
<Kate Bohner> <Neutral> You know, he gave me an office on Wall Street in his new building 40 wall.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Kate Bohner> <Neutral> Cause I work down there --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Front office, the right --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's 72 State Building and she has the office where you fit a desk, a little desk.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow. Is there a bed in there? Were you attracted to her at all? I mean, seriously this is a very attractive --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. I hired her really based in her look. I didn't check her --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You didn't even know if she could write.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So seriously, I mean, listen, when I wrote my book I worked with Judith Raegan with my editor and I would sit with her every day and listen to her. And once in a while Judith would kiddingly take a pencil and poke it into my genitalia. You know what I'm -- She admits this, and It made it fu -- I look forward every day to getting down there writing. And I mean, seriously, when two attractive people are together in a room working on something like this, and Donald has a magnetism he gets all the best looking women.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> According to his book, the women are throwing themselves.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, they are. I mean he's not lying. And who's the new model you're dating now? I just read, dark-haired-beauty?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They do say dark-haired-beauty. I've really been going out with a lot of different people. I just love it. You wouldn't like it. I don't think you've seen such a great wife. You wouldn't -- I don't think you'd like it.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> He came to torture your life.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You know, really, I hate it when you do this. Don't torture me, okay?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm going out with lots of beautiful women, it's really not that good. Aren't you better off going home,
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You know you don't believe a word you're saying. No, you don't.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. The case is that you have a great one.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> My wife is wonderful. She really is wonderful.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Marla is wonderful.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Marla is wonderful. Marla is wonderful, Ivana wonderful, everyone's wonderful and he's having a lot of variety. And that's what's great about it. The variety is what I measure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Variety is important, there's no question.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It is. I miss it. I do. I may be [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not a happily married man like you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I am happily married but I'm [Inaudible] But can I have both?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But you have to work here, Donald.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. Don't you have to -- put on your headphones, Donald, because you're not hearing Robin right. [Inaudible] Yeah, right.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You know what, Donald hate women so much, he's not even gonna put on a head --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> How are you having sex with these women when you -- listen, you -- I -- First of -- Everyone's making a big deal about you with the shaking of the hands. He hates taking hands with the germs. You used to tell me that for years on this show. For years you stated that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And I agree with you. I believe colds are spread through shaking hands and people are shaking my hand constantly.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But now people are analyzing him and calling him an egomaniac.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I think because he admitted this.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They -- what they did in the paper was they said that you wanted people to bow to you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know. You see, they take it out so out of -- It's so ridiculous.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You said the Japanese custom bowing to one another is nice.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The only thing I like about the Japanese, and to be honest --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have [Inaudible] to tell.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> They cut the deal with. He is not kidding.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a great relationship with the Japanese.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You have to do business with them.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They owe me lots of money and I take them back some.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But the thing is --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Robin was the only one who catch it.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I catch you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Howard didn't catch you.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, I caught it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Why I'm writing a book.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Listen to me, when you have sex with all these different women you've got to be nervous about AIDS, Herpes, Venereal warts, Anal warts.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Chlamydia.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And chlamydia. I mean, seriously I would be scared out of my mind. I talked to a guy, a very high powered guy who recently became single. You know everyone else. And he said to me, it's really great, there's lots of really beautiful women and all that kind of thing, he says, but I'm scared out of my mind. I really don't want to die, I don't want to get AIDS.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's frightening.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It is.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is frightening.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So what do you do? You just wear a rubber and hope you for the best?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I wouldn't say I do this but you could send lots of people that you really like to the doctor before you ever get to know them.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That is not terrible [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Tomorrow there'll be a story. I'm sure that lots of people -- except tomorrow there will be a story that, you know, Trump's really a bad guy, just like [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, I would do the same thing, I would do the same thing.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> They'll find the doctor.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The doctors are --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Kate, would you let the doctor -- if you had any chance? Just in case things got a little out of hand?
<Kate Bohner> <Negative> Ah, no, Howard. I wasn't
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Don't tell me you didn't think about having sex with Donald Trump while you were writing a book. Just think about it.
<Kate Bohner> <Neutral> Even I do think of it I wouldn't say it on air because I have the morals clause in my NBC contract.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really, you have an NBC contract?
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> Or CNBC, yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And not morals to sleep with the Donald?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No. It's considered not moral.
<Kate Bohner> <Neutral> It's not moral to think about it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So you must -- It must've crossed both your minds because seriously, she's attractive. It never crossed your mind to sleep with her, being serious now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't think so. You know, I looked at Kate really as a worker bee.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And she worked very hard on the book.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Guess I'm gonna write a book with her.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She is very beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But -- but -- And she's also going out with one of my executives. He's really good.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I see.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And she is -- she is very much in love. And, we hope he is too. Right, Kate?
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> Here's to hoping.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm all for worker bees, especially when I have a worker B cup or C, beautiful, thank you. All right, anyway, so, Donald the cutting to have you here, you've written the new book. I see you're all over the place with this. First of all, your daughter Ivanka is on the cover of The Daily News today.
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> Now, she's a beauty.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She's beautiful.
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> She is the most beautiful of all.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Now, you've got to worry about this because, seriously, why would you -- now you got all the money in the world and your wife's wealthy, your ex-wife, you know, I'm talking about Ivana.
<Kate Bohner> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Why would you want your daughter going -- I think you put your foot down and say, look I don't want you doing this, you're 15 years old, be a kid and, you know, and just -- just stay home.
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> Well, she really wants to do it. And she's very beautiful, she's 15, now just going on 16 and she's 5'11 and which is very, very tall.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> For any age. And she is just great at it. And she loves it and it's something for her to do. She likes that she goes to school. School is the priority.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Aren't you worried about this heroin chic.
<Kate Bohner> <Negative> I am. I am worried about a lot of things.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And what about guys, is she dating?
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> She's surrounded. I mean, we had a rock star come up to her, and you wouldn't believe what this guy look like.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. What was his name?
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> Well, it didn't matter because
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Tell me the name, please.
<Kate Bohner> <Neutral> By that time Big Matt, I can't do it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Out him. [Inaudible]
<Kate Bohner> <Neutral> He's got more tattoos than I've ever seen in a human being.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Go ahead.
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> And she thought he was absolutely awesome.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really? Oh, Jesus.
<Kate Bohner> <Neutral> But anyway, by the time my guy finished, Big Matt, that guy -- he'll never call her again.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, really?
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> Because you know a guy's got to be thinking not only is Ivanka gorgeous but he figures he can back the Brinks truck up
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Sure.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Because you would be his father-in-law. I mean, let's face it that would be the monologue was it not.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It wouldn't be so easy, though. But she's a great girl, she's doing great. She's become a real top model which is amazing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right. And -- and -- and -- Okay, so let's get into the book. All right, so you wrote this book, and there's more revelations than I can even handle. First of all, one of the ones that I found fascinating that you write about is that you for a while hid Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley, I'm surprised the press didn't pick up on this more. You hit them at Mar-a-Lago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They were at Mar-a-Lago. Actually, the press did pick up -- that's where they fell in love.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. Then you claim you heard them having sexual intercourse.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You remember -- I did.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You did.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Did I say that in the book?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But you say that they were going to have HIV. Yes. And I don't know what it's you say you think they we're really doing it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think that they were really doing it. I mean they were in the tower, they were holding hands, they were kissing all over the house. They were -- I really believe -- You know, and I say this in a positive way. I don't want to be ratting on anybody, ratting would be almost going the opposite way. I think they really were in love. I like, incredible love.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the day they left Mar-a-Lago they fell out of love. They were there for about a week and they were in the tower and my --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And you think it's cruise?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Michael would stand on top of this huge tower right over the highest point in Palm Beach and look out and say, Trump, Trump, there's press out there, the press is all over the street, shooting pictures of the tower.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He calls you Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. He calls me Trump.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Nice. Hey, yeah, Trump, Trump.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Trump, Trump. Trump who is a Trump. Trump. Trump. Did you say, hey man, can you call me Donald, man. I'm hiding here, you bastard.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we were there and they had a great time and then it didn't work out so well after that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right. So you know the two of them, you hid them and you believed that what was going on in the room was actual sex.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely, I believed it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Unbelievable. The worst day of your life you say is, when you were down to $900 million or you lost $900 million.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I was -- I was down to a very low point. I had billions and billions in debt. I had $975 million personally guaranteed. Around 1991, and I got -- I think It was on the front page of The Times and The Wall Street Journal that, how could he possibly come back from this disaster. We're in a depression, real estate prices went crashing, casinos were crashing, everything was crashing and that was my low point. And I got a call, and the call was from Ivana, who I took very nice care of, I mean, she was very, very lucky to have been married to me. But actually, you say that better than anybody else.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Ivana was a witch. She was a witch. Here's what here's what happens, the guy was losing his money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She says I want my $25 million from the prenuptial. Fine. So, he gave her the god damn -- Oh, please.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> She did not want a divorce.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, he wasn't in love with her, what does she want?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> But you've got to get a reaction somehow. So, you know, she tried kicking Donald when he was down.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She's trying to get out of the prenuptial by saying, I didn't understand English. That Barracuda understood English fine. Thank God you got out of that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She was a good woman, actually.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is disappointing to me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> She was disappointed to you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, the guy was down and, you know --
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> What? You know what, she didn't want -- you know, it is very embarra -- Here is a woman who used to run around the country, talking about how she didn't care about women's lib, because the Donald, the Donald, the Donald. You know, and it was personally embarrassing for her to be dumped so conspicuously, you know I'm not --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She wasn't really dumb.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, come on.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This was something that was long and coming.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Come on. You know, that confrontation, that was pretty awful.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But things could've happened years before.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All I know was I'm distracted by your co-writer. Are you wearing -- What are you wearing underneath that? Is that -- You just have a jacket on, and no shirt underneath. Wow you are cute.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> I don't think she's wearing a bra.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're not wearing a bra?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And no makeup, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And no makeup. Wow. How's you -- You're never been married or anything?
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> I was like once or twice at a time.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh really.
<Kate Bohner> <Neutral> To a writer.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Oh, no kidding.
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know about him.
<Kate Bohner> <Neutral> He's now married to Tabitha Soren.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He left you for Tabitha Soren?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, you are that one? Oh, boy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Hey, you want to write a book. What is it, Gary?
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> I didn't realize that this was the woman but they did an article about her husband. He's quite a character.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What's his story.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> He's married a lot of women.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Oh, no kidding.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Apparen'tly his M. O. is that he gets you to fall in love with him and he does anything he can to do that, and as soon as you do he's disinterested in you.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, he's a real romantic.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> He's like 30 years old and I think [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you know about this Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I knew about it.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You did know about it. What is his problem, Donald? Seriously, what kind of guy is this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, I guess he's a pretty bad guy from what I understand, or least certainly from what Kate --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> How many times have you been married? Three? And you're what, the second wife or the --
<Kate Bohner> <Neutral> I was the second.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And Tabitha's the third wife?
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> Tabitha's the third wife, yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No kidding.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> But he's a young guy. Howard, how old is he, 32?
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> Thirty six. Yeah, really young.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So, the guy made a couple of mistakes. I mean is that so wrong. Why does that make him a bad guy.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, be quiet. You were always trying to see that the --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Wait a second he got married to -- Donald, you've been married two times, you can make mistakes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've been married twice, and we can make mistakes.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, wait a minute, Donald. Donald, Donald, Donald. You're marriage advice in the book absolutely crack me up.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now, what is -- What is -- What do you say?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> The marriage advice is If your wife anything let her speak -- [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Donald, are you saying that if a woman annoys you, why stay married?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I'm saying that if a woman doesn't totally support you, and I give examples of a professional golfer who's on the tour, he's a friend of mine, he's got a lot of talent. I will mention his name because why should I. Because --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Tiger Woods, go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I have a friend who's a professional golfer, he's married. He could be a very good player.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Every night he gets a call from his wife, why aren't you home. He says, because, you know, why are you in North Carolina, why are you in California? He plays the tour. This is what I do because I'm a touring professional.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, why don't you become a home professional. Well, you know, because it's not quite as much money since I'm a touring professional. I'm a great golfer, I have a chance to be a really great golfer. Every night she calls up crying and bitching, and I said to him get a divorce, cause you never gonna change her.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And you're doing her a favor. Let me get a guy who she really wants to be.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Wait a minute. Say, he's drawing -- you know, he gives you a very broad example.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay. What's a pretty broad example? That is a broad example.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Who could not have been more supportive than Ivana. Ivana wanted to come home and discuss a little business because he was not working for him. So, he said I couldn't say.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What about that Donald? Was Ivana the supportive wife that she paints herself to be or was she a big pain in the ass. Go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I tell you what, I made a mistake with Ivana and the reason I made the mistake is that I put her to work for me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then instead of having a wife, I had a business person and that was not so good.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, that's what you have.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, that's true, and I'm not blaming her for --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And you got sick of her.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And all of a sudden I'd come home and she'd say, here's what we'll do tomorrow. This is what, you know, the porters are meeting and they [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And you want the bath fixed for you and give you some sodomy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I really do not want to hear about it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> I agree with that.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> And Marla, who only wanted to be a supported wife.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But you know what? Seriously, what's going on with his bodyguard, dude? Now here's the way I see it, this -- this Marla who you are married to, who I knew you would never stay married --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You did -- I tell you [Inaudible] But you were wrong because that lasted lot longer.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I know what happened with you. What happened with you is that, I know you with the fear of germs, you said, you know what, hey this Marla's great. I remember you were dating Marla. She hot piece of ass. I would love to get into her pants. With your permission, do you mind if I did her now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I certainly wouldn't.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You wouldn't even care, wouldn't even be jealous.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That would be totally up to you and her. But I tell you what --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm pretty sure you're better sexually than I am. I wouldn't screw that up for you. Marla, As far as I was concerned, was sort of like this thing we wish -- remember she started dating like Michael Bolton?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And she tried to make you jealous and it kind of worked, he said, hey she's great piece of ass, I dig her and you know what, I don't get AIDS from her. And what the hell, who's gonna be better than her? Might as well just do her. This is exactly why you married her. I sat beside your wedding, I sat there and told the people sitting next to me why you are marrying her. This was the whole discussion. Am I wrong or am I right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I will say this, I was married to two really nice women. At this point they're both friends, at this point.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> It could change any second.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> They can form an army.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> My opinion, therefore, could also change very quickly.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it could change instantaneously, but at this point, they're both very nice women. And I sort of leave it at that. You know I've had -- I've had two --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But that's why you married, am I right? Tell me why you are married. Tell me why you married Marla, am I right or am I wrong?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I had a good relationship with Marla, but, you know, it ended. I mean, my relationship really ended, just as it did with Ivana, and I blame -- I don't blame anybody.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I think she cheated. I believe the bodyguard story.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I was sort of out of there, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. you're right.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He's already saying he's out of there.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Are you gonna sue the body guard for --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm suing on the basis of confidentiality. I have like 20,000 employees.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And everybody signs a confidentiality agreement.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I don't want to have a guy going out every time something happens, every time I don't brush my teeth. I don't want to have a guy calling up the National Inquirer, The Globe with that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right. So you got to reinforce --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I want to sue him. And I also am giving away the money to charity, whatever he made I want to take it away, and maybe more than that. To be honest, you know, what he did was wrong in many ways, and Marla very strongly denies it and all that, but that's up to her, I mean, to be honest, cause again, I've been gone from that situation for a long time, but I will tell you this, howard. The -- the -- when you sign a -- it's like you, you have people, I don't know if you have signed confidentiality --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean do you have confidentiality?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, of course. Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And so I have them, and I just want to enforce it. Now it will cost me ten times more to properly enforce it than whatever I can get from this character.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And if you saw the guy you wouldn't be impressed.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In fact one of the tabloids, I have another buddy guy who's really a handsome guy
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right. And you worry about.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Him I am much more worried.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But they use they used the other name and this guy's picture.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, one guy is really upset, and he does pass first this guy.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So, actually, he wanted to sue, everybody can sue.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I've been gone for a long time, from the Marla situation and at this moment I have a very good relationship with her. I have a very good relationship with Ivana and I like keeping it that way if possible but I'm just not sure really it's [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I see. All right so -- so, okay, so let's say Marla did make it with the bodyguard, right? Let's say she did, what do you care, right? You just want to get the guy because he broke the confidentiality.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Again, I've been out of that deal for a long time. But, I don't want to have some some ex-employee going around saying a lot of things. By the way no matter what they say -- So what I did is I sued, very strongly sued on the confidentiality, we'll see what happens.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So now now getting back to dating, right. And when you got to say to woman, hey listen you got to get to my personal doctor, I gonna have you checked out, is this a tough thing to say to a woman, or you've got the balls to say it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I tell you, It's amazing, I can't even believe it. I've been so lucky, in terms of that whole world, it is a dangerous world out there, like Vietnam, sort of like.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It is, it is your personal Vietnam isn't it, you said that many times.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> Like a great and very brave soldier.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> A lot of guys who went through Vietnam came out unscathed. A lot of guys who've gone through the 80s having sex with different women came out with AIDS and all kind of AIDS.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> They survived Vietnam it is better than the Second World War.
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Positive> It is better than Vietnam but it's a --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> A little better but every vagina is a landmine. Have we both said that in private? A potential landmine?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think so.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's a real danger there.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> When you go to a bar, do you ever go with a fleet of doctors and have them check all of the women and then party with the uninfected. Go ahead. So -- so you say to a woman when you're romantic whether, let's say you do some kissing and stuff then you say, listen, I don't know about you but I really want to go all the way with this thing. Would you go visit my doctor?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I tell you what, it's like the whole romantic process is up, because you meet somebody
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you start really liking that person and you start, sort of, getting warmth with that person.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then you're really going at it and then you say, excuse me I have to stop now.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Now, like, how far --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No like, you know, the 70s were the best type.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, please.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm old enough to have gone through this the stuff.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Me too. I had one girl.
<Kate Bohner> <Neutral> Howard, can I ask you something?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Kate Bohner> <Neutral> With this whole theory, what happens if the girl has a lesion after she sees the doctor?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well, then you have a problem.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That's the thing you have to double check every time.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> There is a -- You have to say that to Donald, now he was like, Oh my God. Now, how do you protect it, you have them followed? [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He has to be your best friend. He has to go with you at all times.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Dating must be the best.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They have to do on-site test.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, that's fantastic.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They have to pass medical school.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And by the way, you can meet Donald Trump today.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, how is that?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> At the Barnes and Noble bookstore on Fifth Avenue at 12:30 p. m. Don't shake his hand. Please leave the man alone.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What should people do when they meet you, Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, wait, they were asking to coming into that crummy e-cameras, the crummiest looking camera.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It's the cheapest thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes It's the worst looking camera I've ever seen, but they were asking me, would you shake Howard's hand? And I said, yes.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> We've shaked.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Would you shake Robin's hand? Yes. Would you shake Fred's. I don't think so. Gary's, I don't think so. I said Robin's, yes. Howard's begrudgingly.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Since you wrote that you don't like to shake hands. Now, do you find everybody is coming up and wanting to shake your hand even more so?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, amazing, so many -- the book has become very big for all of us.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right, right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The book came out four, five days ago.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> The Art of the Comeback.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's become a really big seller. So, so many people have read that chapter and they are actually coming up to me with their hands raised and saying, Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, I don't want to shake your hand.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And now you feel even worse.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I almost feel guilty, but I also feel like, hey you know we'll making it back.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's weird. And you're mad at Governor Whitman, I'm supporting her. I like her.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know you're supporting her. I'm supporting her, but you don't like her cause she -- you feel she's helping out your competition? I'll tell you what, she's spending $300 million just foolishly and very stupidly build a tunnel for a wealthy casino company that's coming to Atlantic City anyway.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And there's no reason to spend the money and have to raise people's taxes and everybody's talking about it. The other two candidates are totally opposed to it. Why she's spending $300 million to build a tunnel for a casino company that's coming to Atlantic city regardless of whether or not the tunnel is beyond me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Maybe because lots of new jobs and she wants to make an environment -- Do you believe that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Howard, we do have the jobs anyway.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You're gonna the have the jobs anyway, they're coming anyway, and why spending that much money in a state where you have very high taxes.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Is she good in bed? Governor Whitman? Don't tell me you haven't had her.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, I mean, please.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That I wouldn't know.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I doubt that. Will you have sex with a woman if she's having her period? Go ahead.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Oh, my goodness. You revealed this in the book?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I thought you said, I thought he was looking at Kate when he said that.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Kate, what about you, would you have sex with the woman when she's having a period?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's done that. [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Donald, seriously, you would not, right? Am I correct?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've been there. I have been there.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You have been, but you don't like it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, sometimes you get there by mistake.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I see, you don't even know what's going on. You think you've been shot. It is like Vietnam.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Wounded, wounded.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Did the nanny killed the kid?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't think so.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You don't think so.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think the nanny -- I mean certainly in terms of reasonable doubt there has to be reasonable doubt, how do you give this girl life in jail because -- So there certainly was reasonable doubt.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, you know, I personally think that that trial is not so good. It's sort of interesting O.J. --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, I know that is weird.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> To me, the great one is O.J. gets off and he's out playing golf, of course, at public courses.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right. You know which is a horrible thing. That's his Vietnam.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But he gets off and she goes to jail for the rest of his life -- her life. That's -- You know, there's just something wrong with that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Let me read what you wrote about me in the book. I spoke to Howard Stern about the premiere of his movie. I speak to Howard Stern about the premiere of his movie. Howard is an amazing guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Beautiful, which is true.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Much different in person than on the air. On the air, he is wild and crazy but totally brilliant. He talked for hours practically without notes about subjects as varied as you can get but mostly about sex.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Like today.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> His ratings are through the roof. He is by far the number one show in New York. He has become a true phenomenon with the industry itself. His movie Private Parts has just come out and for a couple of weeks, it's number one movie in the country. He likes to call himself the king of all media and he is not wrong. His opening was amazing a total hoot thousands of people lined the streets outside the theater. Howard is unique a really nice guy and he has one of the nicest wives around. We know Allison. My only disagreement with Howard is the way he treats Frank and Kathy Lee Gifford, two great people I have known for a long time. I constantly tell Howard stop already but he just won't. Listen, thank you by the way for saying those nice things. But, also, you know I'm right about Frank and Kathy Lee. You know I am.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Do we have to get into this?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you know Susan Johnson?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, but I thought she looked better than I thought in the play.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Not bad. Can you blame Frank for getting a little strange?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's too bad, you know, the whole thing.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You know what, the airbrushing cost was on that?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, come on.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Seventeen grand, 17 grand, I'm not kidding.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She's got quite a [Inaudible] How did you know that it was 17 grand.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That's the rumor.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Really? Well, you know a lot. I got to write a book with you myself. Queen of all media.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's got a great job of airbrushing, I tell you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So, I -- were you surprised? I mean, you know Frank and Kathy Lee very well.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Very well?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you know he was cheating?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very well.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did Frank tell you about this woman?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I don't believe you. How dumb is he? How dumb is he to get caught?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's such a great guy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, come on, that's too much to make you sick. You like to have fun.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> What's he afraid about?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, he's just a great guy, and he's always been a great guy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What is great about him, tell us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what, I met Frank a long time ago, playing golf, we were playing golf together.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You say every guy should play golf?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I happen to think he does a great job with football. I mean I think his voice is very --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He's not very good at it. Listen, he's not the greatest. Even his coworkers say that behind his back.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like him.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Donald, you say in the book people should play golf because that will help them make them business fields?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've -- I've really made a lot of money playing golf and I've gotten to know people better on a golf course than you could ever get like sitting over lunch or talking.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Are you good at this game.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Pretty good.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You are.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Pretty good.
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> He's really good.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He is. Now, what do you know? You know him that well?
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> I'm here to support.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I bet the two of you made love.
<Kate Bohner> <Neutral> Oh, Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I don't -- I don't believe it.
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> Embrace your imagination.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I don't believe it. And you're blushing.
<Kate Bohner> <Negative> No I'm not.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Donald, not you. Listen to me. I'm the one who's blushing. The fact, you don't know this while Donald Trump was writing the book, Kate was his caddy also. [Inaudible] Took her into the woods that's not all and never came out. So she was the 19 call. Just kidding, just kidding. Bad joke, bad joke.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Please send in the movies, she's gonna like this, right?
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> I'm okay.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She's fine.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know what Howard -- [Inaudible]
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> After this one, she's going to feel strong.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Believe me I'm heavily into the woman's movement.
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> I love the interview with Mark Wahlberg.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, thank you.
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> It was very fun.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He was, he was, good he was a lot of fun.
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> I love his voice.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Listen to me. What was I just talking about, golf?
<Kate Bohner> <Negative> Yeah, you made a bad joke about the 19th call.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yes, okay, but forget about golf. What was I talking about before that --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what I like to do, I'd like to invite you on November 15th, people said it's called the Freedom Party. Give me liberty or give me death.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're having a party?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You ever heard of give me liberty or give me death?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I heard of that, yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, this is what they're calling this party, it's absolutely untrue.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It's because you are free now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's what they're saying.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's what they're saying, I'm giving the party for, well it is really not.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And when is it gonna be?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Somebody made that up.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Will Suzanne and Frank be there?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Or Kathy and Frank.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Or Kathy and Frank.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If that's the case we'll have a big fight.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Let's go back to Kathy in Frank for a second.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's November 15th at Mar-a-Lago, so you are invited.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So, it's a party with what, supermodels?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> November 15th?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The most beautiful people in the world will be at this --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Forgy City? Who's gonna go to that party? Like, gir -- beautiful women?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't tell you the names but --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Al Pacino?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The most beautiful people in the world.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I could be -- I'm gonna go. You stay home.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'm married. Why were we invited? Donald, what's the point of me going to that if I'm married?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There is no point.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> There is no point.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There is no point.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know, Tommy Mottola invited me to his Halloween party.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Tommy Mottola will be there, by the way.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Will he?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> He invited me to his Halloween party. He's recently broken up with Mariah Carey, he's free, he threw a big Halloween party. He told -- I imagine there must be beautiful women invited to that party.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was at that party.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You were? Are there beautiful women there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Really beautiful women.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And did you pick up chics there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I wouldn't do anything like that, but you know you had really beautiful [Inaudible]
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you get few phone numbers?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Kate Morrissette, this one, that one Naomi Campbell, you have the most beautiful woman of that day.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why do people think it's egotistical of you to say that you've gotten Lady Di, right? You could've gotten her, right? You could've nailed her.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah, but could you have send her to the doctor?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Of course, I don't know, maybe that one, that was a tough one.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He wouldn't answer it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hey, Lady Di, would you go to the doctor?
<Kate Bohner> <Neutral> I don't think he would have asked her.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Go back over to my Lexus because I have a new doctor, we wanna give you a little check up.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Lady Di you would've gone out with. Not that she was not attractive.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She was actually really beautiful.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You think so? More beautiful than supermodels?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I thought she was supermodel beautiful. I'm telling you, I said this the other day. I said Lady Di had supermodel beauty.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She had times, you know, it was interesting, she had times when she didn't look great, and sometimes you look better than anybody in the world. But she was super model.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I'm shocked that you say this. I can't believe it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She had the height, she had this, she had magnificent skin. She really had -- she was a great beauti --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And did you meet her?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She wrote me a letter.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, she wrote you a letter, go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> About a couple of months before she died, thanking because I did a favor for something.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What did you do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Like a schmuck, I went back to work. I did -- I just --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What was the favor that you did for her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just did her a favor. She asked me to do something, I did it, and she wrote me a really nice letter.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What was the favor?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't tell you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, you can. Please, please what was it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's a personal thing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Share your privates? What are you a doctor? Come on, tell me what you did, please.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I did something and then I sent her some flowers.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What did you do for her?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't tell you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, you can. Come on.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But she really thanked me for the flowers more than the favor.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What do you think he did for her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have no clue.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Ever pleasured yourself to her.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, never.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Do you still pleasure yourself or are you going to have to have a woman to take care of that full-time?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Do you like to do the sec -- I mean,
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You still dot it once in a while. How do I answer this question? [Inaudible] How do I answer this question? [Inaudible] That's a little of personal effect, you know. I bet you still do it. Kate, do you think Donald still pleasures himself?
<Kate Bohner> <Negative> Oh, I'm gonna stay away from that one, I have no idea.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, obviously you get to know him that well, did you?
<Gary Dell'Abate> <Neutral> You're blushing right now.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really.
<Kate Bohner> <Negative> Maybe I should've worn makeup.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> She is hot. Can I feel your wrist. I don't mean you, I mean Donald. Donald, let me feel your wrist, please. Check for your wallet No, wait a second. My poor wife, she got me a lot of luxury. She's got her own Mar-a-Lago going. Please, I never want to hear her complain again.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> That's right. She doesn't even invite him.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well you're both invited. I don't think he should come alone because if he come alone it wouldn't be good. It wouldn't be appropriate.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, please.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know what, you are both invited. You can stand there holding hands with your wife.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm trying to figure out what favor you did for Lady Di. What could you possibly have done --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A favor, just a favor and then send her some flowers and she wrote me the most beautiful letter.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Why can't you tell me what the favor was?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can even send you copy of this -- the most beautiful warm letter.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And instead of following up with that like a schmuck Rob and I didn't.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow. She probably wanted it. You're better look -- You're 10 times better looking than Dodi Al Fayed. I mean, you never know --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> There was an opening.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And he was a screw up. Isn't it Dodi Al Fayed a bit of a screw up?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He wasn't good for her, as it turned out.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, it wasn't.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This was not a good situation.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You never would've drove her to the side of the tunnel, would you?
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Henri Paul would have never driven Donald Trump.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> That's for sure
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We went 127 miles an hour. Can you imagine?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He would have stopped posting the picture, right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By the way, this is Gana Hill.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I guarantee the roof of the car had hit the top of the tunnel because you're going down a steep for sure. I know that tunnel in Paris.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know it's got like a 30 mile limit.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the speedometer was stuck at 121. I don't know. That means it was going 121. But if you go on 121 you never had to land you just hit the side of you know the ceiling.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Even if you're straight you wouldn't be able to --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Henri said, if Mario Andretti was right --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He could have got through that. Not in a tunnel.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Is Mario Andretti a 50/50 shot of getting through that tunnel. It is absolutely insane to go that fast. Well, you know, he was probably a lot of pressure, faster, faster, faster, the guy had no clue where he was. So he said, you wanna go fast, I'll go fast.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So, is it fair to say that, with the paparazzi just standing there and post, what's the difference? So, let them take the picture. What are you gonna go 127 miles an hour for?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have the blackened windows, anyway.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The black car with a black window, so you're not gonna see it, and I mean, generally, you know what these guys do when they put the camera up to the window, you can actually see the light's gonna come in. But if you look at this tunnel, and I really know that tunnel well, I've been through that tunnel many times, you can't go more than like, 30-40 miles an hour. If you're going 40 miles an hour through that tunnel, you're going fast. These people had to be going 127.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It's insane. You're saying your book you do a lot of people lot of favors and it really pisses you off when they're not nice back to you when you're at a low point, they could at least be nice to you. You say, one woman, you got her husband, I guess it what some financial person, you got her husband admitted into a special Catholic, like hospice or something? And nuns are taking care of him 24 hours before he died.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And she couldn't get in. It was it's harder here than getting into the Wharton School of Finance. I mean you can't get into this hospital and I got a man through the Catholic Church through the cardinal, the Catholic Church.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You called a lot of strings.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And bottom line, and he died. He was taking care of magnificent wake. When he passed away and he was, you know, expected to pass away, but he passed away beautifully.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And how did this woman screw you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She then -- like a year later it was time to maybe you know she could help me on something. And it was like --
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Like with a loan or something?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, something happened, and she could have very simply helped, and she didn't. And I said, you son of a bitch.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I said, I don't believe it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She is almost, you know, she lost 30 pounds she's looking at the husband forget about him, he's gone.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She lost 30 lbs she's now looking for the new boyfriend.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, the whole thing. She still looks like hell, but she thought she was hot-stuff.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, now it's my turn, I call, I said, listen, well, could you do me a favor bah, bah, bah.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What was the favor you needed? What was the favor?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> It was some kind of financial favor.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And then she treated you worse than your ex-wife.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. She treated me --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Like dirt.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, worse than if I did -- if I said no to her.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you say to her, hey I helped your husband when he was dying.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I did, but I didn't want to do it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You did. What did she say? Hey, I don't care.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she was into a new boyfriend.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Wow, wow, wow. Business is rough.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Husband was by that point a thing of the past.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Not even a memory.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This is called the cooler.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> When is the last time you have sex. When is the last time you have sex with a woman, seriously?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Let me see.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Did you have sex last night, did you have sex last night?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Howard, I never say a thing like that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, you would.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Of course, you would.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I'll tell you what I did do. I went -- I went to a fashion show last night.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, yeah. Now you say that in your book.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Marc Jacobs.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You say the thing that you say the thing that screws you up in business back then was you didn't pay attention because you were busy living the jet-set life, you go to Paris for fashion shows. Is this happening again?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. [Inaudible] I go to Paris, I go to Italy.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Oh, you were all over.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The same models come to New York, so why do I need to go to Paris?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. Why go to them when they can come to you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it was embarrassing, everyone was taking down their dresses on, right? [Inaudible] and the top. And I'm really not looking at the dress.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> So, I interrupted you last night you said, you went to a fashion show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Marc Jacobs had a great fashion show over at the [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Schmatta Meka, he makes what, the jackets?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He makes lots of clothing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Beautiful.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The show is fantastic as well. But, so, I did that and then I went home.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right. That's it. And with who?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That I can't say.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Why, you got laid last night? Son of a bitch, what a party you having?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No I'm having a good time. What's the move taking a private jet. The book is better than The Art of the Deal.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Was it a white chick?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Is that a terrible thing, Robin? How do you not -- [Inaudible] Sometimes, because I do listen to her -- No, no. But you what I don't understand, because I love Robin. I don't understand how, Robin. I bet you're getting a lot of hate from the black community.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I don't listen. I'm like you, I don't care.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And sometimes they say why does Robin ever back the black community.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, she does.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I do, all the time backing black community. He asked a stupid question, so what?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It must have been a chink. What did you have last night? Give me the menu. You got a black woman in bed, ever?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, that depends on what your definition of black is.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Interesting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is -- I like this.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Now, what is your definition of black, Donald?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> But it's a rainbow. Like a rainbow.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Rainbow colors.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So, yeah. What is the perfect date when you take a woman out, what is the perfect date?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd say the perfect date is you needed seven for drinks.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> 7:30 you're in bed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You promised you'll get dinner but you never got there.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right, beautiful. Look at your co-writer. [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> At least he's being honest.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, no. And then you're back in the boardroom by eight.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Then the amazing thing is you can have a second date about 8:30.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You've got to admit, you're a bright guy. A lot of these models have to bore you to death after you orgasm.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what, can I tell what -- So -- some of these girls, you know when they make $4 or $5 million dollars a year it's not just because of their looks or beauty.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really? You think they're bright?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think a lot to do with their looks.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A lot of these girls are very smart.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What is your favorite condom? Please, tell the audience.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know the name of it.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Really.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know the --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Black knight?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Black knight. But I'm using, but I'm using, I tell you that.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Thank you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What a light, what a light. I am fascinated by this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hope they worked. What happens if they don't work? We're in trouble.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You are, white man. What do you mean we, white man? Donald, Donald Trump The Art of the Comeback. He will take you to his lowest point all the way back to the rise. And for those of you who want to make it in business you'll learn something here. That no matter how far down you go, no matter how low, no matter how much the press kicks you, you can make a comeback too. Is that the message of the book, Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That is the message. But I think it is really how to make it in business, and also there's lot of personal questions.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, the personal stuff rules.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But everyone talks about the personal stuff. You know --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Why not write a book about dating next? [Inaudible] Music is beautiful.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Every interview I've done. I have a couple of chapters on the marriage, on the this, and the that, and every interview I've done, not one person has asked me about Trump tower, 40 Wall Street, the big deals, projects. They all want to get back to the same thing.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> What?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What you make living at, sex, sex, everything is sex.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Hey, I saw a Stone Phillips interview. Is he the worst or what?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, it was great.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It was great.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think it is.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But he is a stone.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a handsome guy. He was great.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm supposed to look like that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, he was -- you were born to be --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I was born to look like that, I don't know what happened.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no. He's a perfect guy.
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> He looks like G. I. Joe.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. He stole my face. They gave me this one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I think he's very good.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You do, you like him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You saw the show?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I saw the show, I thought it was okay with you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How did I do?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I thought you -- I think you did great I do it. Sometimes I fall asleep when he interviews me.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Really?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And sometimes I feel like, you know, off camera he'll say to me, yeah, I saw your booty, it was great, I loved it pa, pa, pa, pa, pa. And then we'll get on camera, we'll be like, so why did the FCC go after you, and how could you make a movie? You know, so, it's like a two-faced kind of thing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So, if you had a choice between 60 Minutes Dateline and 20-20, which one you pick?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Dateline. Sixty minutes, 60 Minutes what a fragile state.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Dateline gets the highest ratings.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, you're right. I would go with that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That was the choice.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Then you did the right thing, then you did the right thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sixty minutes is boring, now too.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, for old guys.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Dan Yu has done an amazing job.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Dan Yu is a punk.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But, you know, you do get sales. Can you imagine me in 60 minutes --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Dan Yu will hate you because you're successful, and wealthy, and you get laid a lot. He would hate you. Anybody who does that, he would hate, because he's bitter and sour. Donald, he's sour. He's a friend of yours?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, he's really.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Tell him to lighten up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have different kinds of friends. No, no, that's the problem, I would probably get killed.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, you did the right thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I've done 60 minutes before, and I've been killed before in 60 minutes.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Now, Donald did you find that all of these friends stayed with you through the bad.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I was the only one.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So, Howard stayed.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I'm asking Donald a question. Will you be quiet?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I want money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You are the worst thing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, go ahead.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I met married Howards at the wedding along with O.J. We had a [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I know.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know what, you could write about it. How about --
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Your wedding alone.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. You could do a whole book or many books on my wedding, O.J. you, you were sitting right next to him.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, yeah, please.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> O.J. was a nice guy then. It was before the killing.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yeah. This is before the killing. In fact was like another wedding and having him after the killing. We wanna see if it's different.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There will be another wedding.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> What is a good investment right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have saved the invitations.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> I never got to find out, you know, because he was talking about all these friends. I want to know is the same friends from before the fall and after the fall.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, okay. It really is a great question and it's covered a lot in the book that. I had great loyalty from most people.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Is that right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But there were some people that showed disloyalty, God bless you, Kate.
<Kate Bohner> <Positive> Excuse me.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And you got to screw them to the wall.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And my attitude is screw them to the wall and, you know, you have no idea, you know just in doing these crazy interviews and everything. So many people -- you just said it right. Do you really mean that --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> The Stone said that. Like Stone want to do that. Stone is a bubblehead.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's a different personality.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right. He's empty inside.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I had one yesterday, where they said, how could you possibly be so angry and so mean. Now, there was one person who I made, you know, I don't want to take credit. They just took the person out of government.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Who is it? Tell the truth, come on.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In my case, it's a woman. I took the --
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Christie Todd Whitman? Who is it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Out of government.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who is it, who is it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It doesn't matter.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Tell me. Actually, I think it's covered.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It is covered in the book. I don't know if the name is covered but it doesn't make any difference.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Who is it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I took the person out of government.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Name this person.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I may give it to you --
<Howard Stern> <Positive> All right. Good, you have to come back and tell me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All of a sudden, the person's living this beautiful life, his beautiful house, blah, blah, blah. This person could've done something for me when I was in my deepest moments.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hilary Clinton.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She thought that I wasn't gonna make it back. You know, a lot of people thought I was not gonna be able to come -- they figure out I have to go bankrupt, that I would be -- You know, and like so many of my friends they've gone, so you'll never hear from them again.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know it's pretty sad.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My business now is much bigger than it ever was, much stronger, much richer, much everything, instead of -- You know, it is amazing, that's why I write a book. So this person did left my side, now I am supposed to be doing something for that person, not even a chance.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Right. And let me tell you something. That's the way you succeed in business. That's what I do to my enemies, I screw them to the wall. Don't F with me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And people say, Donald, that's terrible.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, everybody's like that, who would help somebody who --
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Who screws you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It wasn't even a question of screwing, didn't do something, covert.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> There's a woman on the phone and she said asked you out on a date. Yes, Jill? Or you want to ask Donald out on a date?
<Jill (Caller)> <Positive> Yes, I would love to.

<Jill (Caller)> <Neutral> 34C.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> C.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not bad.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Not bad, right?

<Robin Quivers> <Positive> It'll be a great story.

<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like the institution of marriage. I really do, I mean if you get it right. I haven't gotten it right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, you're never going to get it right. Trust me.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> He's gonna try again, and again, and again.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> There's no such thing as getting it right when you can have the variety you can have. I mean there's what --
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> All right, I have one more question, one more question, one more question.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I have one last question. Go ahead.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> How tough is the prenup going to be for the third one?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very tough, and I mean, very tough.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Of course.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Tell me, what that's one gonna say?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's going to be extraordinary.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> They're going to owe him $50 million dollars when they break up. It'll be an encyclopedia Britannica. All right. Here's my final question. If you were on a desert island, no money, strict survival, you can either have one of two women with you, Ellen DeGeneres or Rosie O'Donnell. Who do you take? Don't forget Ellen's a dyke.
