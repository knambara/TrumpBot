<Michael Graham> <Positive> This week it's a very special episode, it's the raw audio of Selena Zito's one-on-one interview with President Donald Trump. Maybe you've seen a little of the controversy surrounding President Trump, Andrew Jackson and the Civil War. Well now listen to the interview that started it all. [Begin Interview]
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> I want to ask you some domestic questions, but I do want to ask you about Egypt.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay.
<Salena Zito> <Negative> You know, I thought it was... how do you see our relations... your relations developing with them given the release of the human rights worker that you got out that I don't think a lot of people talked about.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I see our relationship with el-Sisi as very good. I think he has done a tremendous job, a very difficult job he's got. And, I think our relationship is very good. As you know President Obama tried to have Aya released for three and a half years. They were unsuccessful. I was with President el-Sisi for 10 minutes. During the 10-minute period -- I was with him for longer but privately in those two chairs. See those two chairs? They're very famous chairs actually [Laughter].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But during the 10-minute session I said it would be a great honor for this country And I think would be a very positive step if Aya were released. And I didn't even ask for her husband, because her husband is not an American citizen, as I understand. And he said I would like to consider that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I said I really think it's very important. And he was so great, and he not only released Aya, he released her husband and he released 8 people total. And I thought I thought it was fantastic.
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> What did that feel like for you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It, it just meant, because I happen to think he's a good man. He's a strong person, but he's a good man with a great heart. And I know he didn't like President Obama, and I know President Obama didn't like him, but I do like him, and I thought that was a great and brilliant gesture.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I thought it was a very smart gesture and I very much appreciate it. She would have been in jail for 28 years. She's a young person, she's a good person. She was a totally innocent person. She would have been in jail for 28 years, can you believe it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said to her, what, what's your term? Because she came up the next day, she was so happy. She said, well sir, I would have been in for 28 more years. I said 28 more years?
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> That's a lifetime.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's 28 years. That's not 28 years but you're out in one year for good behavior.
<Salena Zito> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Okay, that was 28 years.
<Salena Zito> <Positive> So, one of the most common questions I hear, I travel for my job across the country, spend a lot of time in the Midwest, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, and one of the most common questions I hear from people who supported you...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you very much for the invitation.
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> ...they want to know what your impressions are of being president. What's it like? What's your day?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> First of all, this just came out. They just... This was our final printed map.
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> All in that red area.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're red and Hillary is blue. This just came in out. This is the final print. Pretty good.
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> How does that make you feel?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very, very, uh, honored, and proud, and I love the people of this country. These people are incredible people. I mean, look at those numbers?
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> How do you stay connected to those people?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> And by the way, thank you very much for the shout out you gave at the press conference about 10 days ago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true. I did. You treated me... have treated me very fairly and I appreciate it.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Did you take much heat from that from the other networks?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No not really. I think they know it's true. You know, they know what's fair and not. But you have you treated me very fairly and I have been a friend of your show for a long time. Remember those call-ins? Maybe without those call-ins, somebody else is sitting here.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Let's talk about your speech. You've talked about spending about $54 billion in additional money for our military. Senator John McCain said that is not enough. What's your reaction?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we are going to spend a lot more money on military. We really have to. We have no choice. A lot of people think it's a tremendous amount of money. It could be actually $30 million... $30 billion more than that. We are going to upgrade our military very substantially. Remember this, I also am going to get involved in negotiating. We have many planes and boats and ships and everything that we are spending too much money individually on. We are going to get involved in negotiating. We are going to be able to get, I think, a lot more product for our buck. And I'm going to be very, very serious about it. We saved $700 million plus on a f-35 after I got involved. And I have to tell you Lockheed was terrific. But we saved a lot of money on airplanes and that number is going to increase very substantially as we keep going. We will be having the greatest military that we ever had by the time I finish.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think I'm doing... for instance, I don't know if you were here, but I just did a whole thing on aluminum, which is just being destroyed
<Salena Zito> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just did something last week on on steel. And you know, that's a first step, because you can't just do what you want to do. You have to go a step, you have to do the study, you have to, you have to review the study, you have to go through a process. And then you can do what you have to do. It's gonna happen pretty soon. We've been tremendously mistreated by the world, with dumping and with, you know, what's happened to our country. Donald Trump
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> How...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we're freeing them up. We're getting rid of, uh, we're getting rid of tremendous regulation and, you know, one thing that has been said Salena, cause I really believe... I don't think any president has ever done as much as I've done in the first hundred days. I also think the first hundred day standard is ridiculous, because I've done some things that people don't know, like I set the foundations for relationships, as an example with President Xi from China, who I think is a very good person. Who wants the best people for his people. Who also doesn't want to see war against North Korea.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I have a... I think he's a fantastic person. Now maybe he won't do anything for the United States, or maybe he will. But I think he's a fantastic person. My, my opinion of that won't change. We had an amazing... uh, you know I don't know if you know, but the Chinese, very organized, were in the meeting. So when I met him at Mar-A-Lago, where he wanted to be.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, Mar-a-Lago is a dealmaker's paradise because everybody is comfortable there. You understand. And they wanted to be there. They've been here, they wanted to be there. You know, there's a great warmth and the great... a great feeling at Mar-A-Lago. She knows.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Mr. President, you will have the biggest -- if tradition means anything and I know severing a little bit different these days.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> You will have a biggest audience for a State of the Union-like address this year. Having said that, how do you plan on capturing that opportunity for yourself and for your administration?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, Brian, all I can do is speak from the heart and say what I want to do. We have a really terrific, I believe, health care plan coming out. We have to understand Obamacare has been a disaster. It's way out of control. It doesn't work. We're coming out with a health care plan that I think will be terrific. It will be very inclusive. And I think it's going to do really what people are wanting it to do. But I will be talking about that. I will be talking about the military. I will be talking about the border. And remember this on the border and throughout our country, we're getting the bad ones out. The bad people, gang members, drug lords, in some cases murderers.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Has that not been communicated? Do you think that has not been communicated effectively?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think so. No I, maybe that's my fault. When they show people being taken out, these are people that are -- we are looking at the bad ones. I said that from day one. I saidfrom the day I'm President, we are getting rid of the bad ones. And a lot of people understand it. I can tell you the communities where we are removing people that are really trouble and frightening to a lot of people who live there, those communities are very, very happy.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Sure. Mr. President you are going to spend $54 billion at least on the military and the people in our audience like that. Love this and you said you were going to do that all along. You will make big spending cuts at the EPA and State Department.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's just... just... it's just amazing place. And we sat in that living room, in these big beautiful chairs, and we sat there... it was supposed to be a 10-minute... 10-minute one-on-one. Then we go into a breakout room, where we have 40 people... 40 people, you know...
<Salena Zito> <Positive> Right
<Donald Trump> <Positive> 40 each. That was going be the whole day. And I was told by Steve Schwarzman, of Blackstone, that President Xi is a great guy, if you could get to know him one-on-one, would be much better than sitting in the big... so we sat for 10 minutes, but the 10 minutes turned out to be three hours.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And our people went ahead. The next day, it said same thing: 10 minutes, 45 minutes, you know, with 10 people, three hours with 30 people, 3 hours with 40 people, you know. Big groups of people. Including him and I. So, the next day was 10 minutes and it turned out to be three hours, and we had dinner that turned out to be 3 hours.
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> So, the relationship...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, we have a real relationship... he's great. I spoke to him two days ago. He, he's a great guy. Now, with that being said, he is... he's in love with China, and he's in love with the people of China, and that's a great thing, but I think he is going to try and help us with North Korea
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Where does the money come from? Because it -- if you cut all the money from EPA and all the money from State, that's about $50 billion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think the money is going to come from a revved-up economy. I mean, you look at the kind of numbers we are doing, we will probably GDP of a little more than 1%. If I can get that up to 3 or maybe more, we have a whole different ballgame. It's a whole different ballgame. And that's what we're looking to do.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> But to get the economy going you have got to get the Affordable Care Act, replace and repeal and do something about atxes and how close are we to either of those?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We are going to be doing things having to do with other countries because we are treated very, very unfairly. When we help them, even militarily, we are going to ask for a form of reimbursement which, right now, I mean, we have countries where we are taking care of their military. We are not being reimbursed and they are wealthy countries. We have a lot of things happening. But we are going to get the numbers way up, and get jobs back in our country. You see what I have done. Ford has announced, General Motors, Fiat has announced. They are all building big plants. They are all coming back into the United States. They we fleeing... They were fleeing our country. You mentioned the EPA. We have right now, I call it the veins of the country. We have right now hundreds and hundreds of massive deals that are tied up with environmental protection. When they are -- Scott Pruitt who is terrific, just got approved -- But, when he gets going, those projects are going to be freed up and sailing. And you are talking about thousands and millions, actually, of jobs.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> You ran on jobs. You ran on draining the swamp. You ran on repealing and replacing Obamacare. When do you start to put pressure on Congress, the swamp to get Obamacare repealed and replaced.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think Paul Ryan is terrific. I just left Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell. And, y'know Paul is working very hard. Health care is a very complex subject. If you do this, it effects nine different things. If you do that it effects 15 different things. I think we have a great plan. And I think Congress is taking a lot of blame but it's not their fault. Don't forget I have only been here four weeks. Somebody said he hasn't done health care. They have been working on health care for 30 years. I have only been here for what is this, my fifth week? And we're set to propose a plan. And I will be talking about it, as you know tonight. But we're all set to do a plan. And I think it's going to be something that's going to be really respected. And you take a look at what's going on with the stock market. Trillions of dollars of value have been created since I won the election. I mean, trillions. No, I mean the stock market is very enthused. And that's jobs.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> But I just have to bring back two things in your cabinet. You have OMB director finally. He says you have to take an axe to entitlements. You Treasury Secretary says we are not touching it. Who is right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I will tell you what who is right. If the economy sails, then I'm right because I said I'm not touching Social Security.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> So your OMB is wrong.
<Salena Zito> <Positive> And that's the important part.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because he doesn't want to see as attacking North Korea, and I think you'd love to see if we could work something out. Now that might happen or may not, but the point is I've created foundations that nobody's ever done before, whether it's Prime Minister Abe or the President of China, or so many others that we have.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Today, we had, as you know the President of Argentina, right? Macri? President Macri.
<Salena Zito> <Positive> Right, right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> and that's all part of this very complicated, very large-scale puzzle.
<Salena Zito> <Positive> How do you approach your day? What's your day like? A lot of the people who voted for you, they... they're very curious to find out, you know, what would it like, you... all of a sudden, you're President, you come into the office... what's your day like?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all I want to thank you, because you've treated me very fairly. I've been watching you for a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not saying anybody is wrong. I'm just saying this: if we and I think this is what is going to happen, Brian. I think our country is going to sail.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Mr. President, you announced by twitter you are not going to the White House correspondence dinner. How come?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm not a hypocrite and I haven't been treated properly. And that's okay, which is fine.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Some the left say you can't take a joke.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, do they say that? No. Well, I have taken it. You know, one of the great misconceptions when President Obama was up -- what is it now a long time ago, five years ago or whatever, I loved that evening.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> You were there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was there.
<Salena Zito> <Positive> Oh, thank you sir. I try.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I want to thank you, and I really I mean that too. I mean it too. So, my day is very long. I actually never thought, you know, when I was doing many real estate deals at one time, I always thought that was going to be more comprehensive and lengthier in terms of a day than this, it's not. And, you know, these decisions are also so important. You can't make a mistake.
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You can make a mistake in deals, and you work it out. These deals, you make a mistake, you can't. These things, these transactions, you make a mistake there's nothing to work out. It's, you know, it's trouble. It could be big trouble, and it's life-threatening trouble for lots of people, potentially. But I'm up very early. I go in very late, spending a lot of time in this office. And it's, it's very... it's very much busier than I thought it would be.
<Salena Zito> <Negative> Now this office seems very peaceful...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Salena Zito> <Negative> ...at least at this time of the day. Do you, do you, do you find there times of the day where you walk into here, you know, you talk to these guys that used to be President? I mean...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well that one over there is Andrew Jackson, so it used to be Ronald Reagan. But then it got back, and I said, they said my campaign is most like... my campaign and, and when, was most like Andrew Jackson...
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> You were the target.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I was the target.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> You were the piñata.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And can I be honest? I had the greatest time. Now I can't act like I am thrilled because they're telling jokes. I mean he was telling jokes that I'm going to change the name of the White House to Trump House and other things. And he was very respectful. I thought he did a good job and he was very respectful and it was fun. And I enjoyed it and I left and I told the press did you have a good time, I said it was fantastic. The next day I read Donald Trump felt terrible about the evening. I loved the evening. I had a great time.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> You said before I can take hits when it it's justified.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Correct.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Can you give me an example of a time when someone was critical to you and you thought to yourself, I deserved that hit? I deserves that column?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I could probably never do that. I'm not going to give you any ideas.
<Salena Zito> <Positive> Right
<Donald Trump> <Negative> with his campaign, and I said, when was Andrew Jackson. It was 1828. That's a long time ago, that's Andrew Jackson. And he had a very, very mean and nasty campaign because, they said, this was the meanest and the nastiest, and it's unfortunately continues.
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> His wife died.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> His wife died.
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They destroyed his wife, and she died, and you know he was a swashbuckler. But when his wife died, you know, he visited her grave every day. I... I visited her grave actually, because I was in Tennessee.
<Salena Zito> <Positive> Oh, that's right. You were in Tennessee.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it was amazing. The people of Tennessee are amazing people. Well, they loved Andrew Jackson. They loved Andrew Jackson in Tennessee.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Do you ever think to myself, wow I kinda screwed that up? I kinda deserved that hit.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, sure. And you know, honestly, if I do that, if that does happen and if I take a hit, I won't give you any additional ammunition. But over the years, you make a mistake, I fully understand when they hit you. But when they make stories up, when they create sources because I believe that sometimes they don't have sources. You know, the sources don't exist. And sometimes they do exist. I'm not saying all sources. But I believe a lot of the sources are made up. A lot of the stories are made up. I believe a lot of the stories are pure fiction. They just pull it out of air. I just thought in light of the fact of fake news and all of the other things we are talking about now. I thought it would be inappropriate.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Too cozy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, not too cozy. I think that... look, I have great respect for the press. I have great respect for reporters and the whole profession. Now, with all of that being said, I just thought it would be better if I didn't do the dinner. That doesn't mean I'm not going to do it next year. But just I thought it would be better if I didn't do it.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Mr. President, The Oscar Awards, Jimmy Kimmel, he was tweeting, he was saying some crude comments. He insinuated at least you were racist. What's your response?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look it, just seems, the other side, whenever they are losing badly, they always pull out the race card. And I have watched it for years. I have watched it against Ronald Reagan and watched it against so many other people. And they always like pulling out the race card. The fact is, I did pretty well, much better than past people in the Republican Party in the recent election having to do with Hispanics. Having to do with African-Americans. I did pretty well or I wouldn't be sitting here. If I didn't get numbers at least as good or better I wouldn't be sitting here.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> You don't take it personal?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can't. Because I consider it a very serious violation when they say it, and I have to write it off as being purely politics.
<Salena Zito> <Positive> Yeah, he's a fascinating...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, had Andrew Jackson been a little bit later, you wouldn't have had the Civil War. He was, he was a very tough person, but he had a big heart and he was he was really angry, that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War. He said there's no reason for this. People don't realize, you know, the Civil War...
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> Yeah, it was...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you think about it, why? People don't ask that question. But why was there the Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out.
<Salena Zito> <Negative> One of the things that people have said when I talk to them, because, I told them I was coming to interview you, is they ask that, you know, I said what would you want to ask them? They say, we have your back and..
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They really do.
<Salena Zito> <Negative> They really do have their back
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> More than ever before. The base.
<Salena Zito> <Negative> And, and you look at their towns, and you said carnage in your inaugural address. There are plenty of town that I've been in, East Liverpool, Ohio, Fort Heights, Illinois, the opioid crisis is just tearing these towns apart. But they, when I asked this one woman, Bonnie Smith, I said so what do you want him to do? And she said, I want him to bring our country back.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Big story here in Washington, DC. That Sean Spicer asked his communications team okay, come on in, everybody, put your phone right over there. We have a leaker here. We're going to have the White House lawyer look at your phones. How intent are you on finding the leaker or leakers are in your administration? Not just your communications team, but over at the State Department, maybe the intel community, everywhere?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, first of all, Sean Spicer is a fine human being. He is a fine person. I would have done it differently. I would have gone one on one with different people. And we don't have a major leak process here. We have major leak process in government. But
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Did they figure out hot leaker was?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have sort of ideas but, don't forget, we have people from other campaigns. We have people from other governments. We got a lot of people here.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> So you wouldn't do it that way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would have done it differently. I would have had one-on-one sessions with different people.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> You'd say let me see at your phone.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I might have done that things you can do a hell of a lot worse than that to be honest with you. But I would have done it differently. You know he has done a very good job and that's the way he chose to do it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, we're doing it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think, what do you want him to do for you and she said I don't want anything from him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They don't.
<Salena Zito> <Negative> I want it for my country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My people, they're the greatest people. So they had on Fox the other night, you know, the first 100 days. Who, she's very nice.
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> She's coming tomorrow.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Is she coming tomorrow? She's done a good job. But anyway, so she has her own, you know, a lot of people. So who thinks President Trump has done a poor job? One guy raises his hand. Who thinks he's done a great job? The whole place went crazy. The whole room went crazy, more than that election day. I believe it is much more than election day. I don't know if you can feel it. I was just told by Kelly, who was just here, Congressman Kelly.
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> Mike Kelly, from my, he's my Congressman.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Who's the greatest guy, he was just here, for the aluminum thing, you know. We're gonna do a big... we're gonna bring aluminum back. We're gonna bring steel back. it's all happening, believe me. I mean, unfortunately, we have to go through a process. You can't just say, I'm gonna raise tariffs, you have to go...
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Let's talk about you Tweeting, if we could. You've attacked, recently, McCain, the FBI, Democrats. Is there a method to the attacks or is it just venting?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No method, really. It's just -- it's not venting either. But, you know, I felt badly when a young man dies and John McCain said that was a failed mission. According to General Mattis, it was a very successful mission. They get a lot of information, a lot of -- a lot of different things that they really wanted to get.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I thought it was inappropriate and I thought it was inappropriate that he goes to foreign soil and he criticizes our government. I just think that's just inappropriate. And, you know, people have to be careful with that. But it does allow me to go around dishonest media. I don't have to go around you folks. I don't have to go around a lot of the media.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I do have to go around some media. And it does allow me to do that, because the following is so large, between Twitter and Facebook and all of the different things. I have so many millions of people, it allows me to give a message without necessarily having to go through people where I'm giving them a message and they're putting it down differently from what I mean. I do.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> A lot of people like it. They say you're tough. They're glad you're going after people when they attack you. But you have people on both sides of the aisle...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, you do.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> -- that are saying you're going after your enemies on Twitter. They want you to stop it. Will you?
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> Inch by inch.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We are going to study. After the study, we are going to analyze this stuff.. Otherwise, you know, you're going to have a lot of bad things happen. So we're doing it step by step. It's going to happen. But he said, man you are so much higher than even on Election Day.
<Salena Zito> <Negative> Oh in Erie, in his, in Erie County, which... which was the first time since 1972 that they voted for a Republican, Frank and I were just there this past weekend. [Crosstalk] and they love you, the one guy said, I actually think I like him more than I did when I voted for him. There was a man in Ashtabula, Ohio, which you flipped by 19 percentage points, who said I didn't vote for him. I didn't vote for Hillary, but I like him because he stands up for the... for my community. How do you stay, how do you keep that connection with those people?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we're doing it, by doing what I'm doing now. For steel for aluminum, for the mines I mean... look at the miners. The miners, there I got a close to 100%, who wouldn't be with us, right? The miners. I just freed up the mines. Clean coal. Clean coal, now they don't have to compete against, you know, other sources...
<Salena Zito> <Negative> Shale.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But but clean coal, and we're going to bring the mines back. We're bringing energy back. We were at a point where energy guys for the first time in my life were losing everything and letting everybody go. Nobody's ever heard of that before. And the miners are so great. West Virginia, Wyoming. I mean you know I'm going to be in Pennsylvania on Saturday night, are you going?
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> Yeah, Of course.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, most of the people that want me to stop it are the enemies, I'll be honest with you. The enemies would like me to stop it. I -- if I felt the media were honest, all of it, or most of it, I wouldn't do it. But it is a modern-day form of communication, especially when you have, you know, tens of millions of people like I have.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Mr. President, you mentioned John McCain mentioning that the young man who died, the Navy SEAL...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> -- who died in that mission...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> -- his father has said that he didn't want to talk to you. Your reaction to that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, this was a mission that was started before I got here. This was something that was, you know, just -- they wanted to do. And they came to see me and they explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected. My generals are the most respected that we've had in many decades, I would -- I believe. And they lost Ryan. And I was at the airport when the casket came in, the body came in.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> In Dover.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Packed.
<Salena Zito> <Positive> It's going to be in my hometown. What about...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Packed. Yeah, you're right there.
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> You, what about, I think that it's Governor Christie you appointed on the opioid crisis.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right, one of the biggest
<Salena Zito> <Negative> Just devastating in, across the country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There are two things that people don't talk about that are really bad. Number one is the drug problem in this country, that the wall will help solve. Believe me, the wall is a very big thing. And the other one is human trafficking, people have no idea. It's essentially slavery, except worse. And human trafficking now is so bad... and you know the wall helps with that, because they bring people over and they bring people back. You can't do that if there's a wall, and it's very hard. But the human trafficking problem is a tremendous problem in this country that people don't talk about, and the other is opioids and drugs generally.
<Salena Zito> <Negative> The opiods are destroying communities.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When I won New Hampshire, for some reason New Hampshire has a disproportional problem, bad problem with drugs. And I told we're going to solve the problem. And if you look at the, the... it was, when I won that in the primary, that was really my first big thing. And even though I came in second in Iowa, should have one Iowa, but a lot of things happened.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it was a very sad, with the family. And it's a great family, incredible wife and children. I met most of the family. And I can understand people saying that. I'd feel -- you know, I'd feel what's worse? There's nothing worse.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's nothing worse. But again, this was something that they were looking at for a long time doing. And according to General Mattis, it was a very successful mission. They got tremendous amounts of information.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> All right, can we talk about President Obama? You said you personally get along with him. You guys were going at each other for three, four, maybe eight years. It turns out his organization seems to be doing a lot of the organizing for some of the protests that a lot of these Republicans are seeing around the country and against you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Do you believe President Obama is behind it? And if he is, is that a violation of the -- the so-called unsaid president's code?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think he is behind it. I also think it's politics. That's the way it is. And look, I have a very thick skin.
<Salena Zito> <Positive> Well I thought was interesting, when you won Iowa, is that if you look... drill down on those numbers, you won the evangelical voters.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I won the evangelical, right from the beginning. They're unbelievable.
<Salena Zito> <Positive> Do you think it's because they think you project strength and you will you will stand up for their beliefs?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so. I think that the evangelicals were unbelievable... the Christians. We had, you know, first of all double the amount voted, and I got 84 percent. So I doubled the amount of the previous election, and I had 84 percent, which nobody has ever had before. So, if you think about it, that's why I won the election.
<Unidentified Female> <Positive> I also think they respected honesty.
<Salena Zito> <Positive> Yeah, well I think...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're great people.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> Even if they don't like content [Inaudible]
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> But Bush was never -- Bush wasn't going after Clinton. And Clinton wasn't going after Bush.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you never know what's exactly happening behind the scenes. You know, you're probably right or possibly right. But you never know. No, I think that President Obama is behind it, because his people are certainly behind it. And some of the leaks possibly come from that group, you know, some of the leaks, which are really very serious leaks, because they're very bad...
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- in terms of national security. But I also understand that's politics. And in terms of him being behind things, that's politics. And it will probably continue.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Does he just -- does that disappoint you? This -- don't you think that that goes beyond what we usually do in this country?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to use the word disappoint. I'm not really surprised because I understand the way the world works. It's politics. I mean I'm changing things that he's wanted to do. I mean we're much tougher in terms of getting the bad guys out. You know, people don't realize, he deported a lot of people, but we're focused on the bad people. But we're focused on the bad people.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're focused on the drug lords and the gang members. We're focused on a very, very bad group that are in this country that we're getting out rapidly. He was much less focused on that.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Can we talk about what Nancy Pelosi said yesterday? Here we are on the cusp of your first major speech and the question was, what he has done? He's -- basically, he's done nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well Pastor Jeffress, you know, from Houston, is great. And I didn't know him at all, and I see him and he says Trump may not be the perfect Christian, and maybe he's done things that maybe we're not supposed to be doing, but he's the best leader by far. And I'd rather have the best leader then have some guy that has every value that I have, but that, you know, doesn't... doesn't really lead.
<Salena Zito> <Positive> You created an interesting coalition. Did you do it on purpose,
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I didn't do anything on... I just...
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> Did you go on gut?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Honestly, I spoke from my heart. Yeah, gut. But I spoke from my heart more than anything else. And you know I didn't have the pollster stuff, and it was only until later they started hiring these pollsters, so I said what are you doing? What are you wasting your money for? You know, some of my my people started hiring pollsters and, but, and I always said, in fact, Hope say [inaudible] what are you wasting your time? Second of all, I read polls every day in the newspapers. Of course, a lot of them turned out to be fake polls, in my opinion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Remember ABC-Washington Post a week before the election? They had me twelve points down, and I said there's no way with... because we go to a community that has 35,000 people show up, Hillary go there she'd have 500 people and then I'd read that I'm down. I said there's no way, and we complain to them, it turned out they interviewed mostly Democrats. And the following week, they came up with a poll that I was one down, and the next week they came up I was one up. But I'm telling you, those polls are fake and what they do is they suppress the vote.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They totally suppress the vote. Because people would say, you know, I love Trump, but I also want to go to a movie tonight, I'm not going to vote, and I'm going to go to a movie. I wish he would win, but he can't win, because the polls are saying he can't win. They suppress the vote.
<Salena Zito> <Negative> It's a difficult narrative to watch. I think the 100 day thing in a lot of ways is a false measuring stick, because it's only 100 days. But what would you, do you have like three top things, if you are blessed enough to be in office for eight years, what are three top things that you'd like to walk away and say, I did this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think the Supreme Court is very important, because you know somebody wrote, in fact, it was our friend from Fox, he wrote that article yesterday, which was amazing -- that the Supreme Court is so important, because every five to four decision is because of me. A win. And that could go on for 40 years, because he's a young man, Gorsuch, Justice Gorsuch is a young man. That's a very important thing.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> He says he's put -- it said he put Wall Street first, he made America sick and he's still -- he instilled fear in immigrants. Those are your accomplishments. What's your response to her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I've been watching Nancy's tape. And so I think she's incompetent, actually. You know, if you look at what's going on with the Democrats and the party, it's getting smaller and smaller.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, in a certain way, I hate to see it, because I like a two party system and we're soon going to have a one party system. I actually think a two party system is healthy and good. But she's done a terrible job.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> So she's wrong?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't think she's a good spokesman. She's certainly wrong. There are those that say I've done more than anybody in 100 days. And you look just at the money I've saved. I've saved billions and billions of dollars. I brought Ford back from Mexico.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ford was going with a massive plant. I brought Fiat in. I'm bringing in all these incredible countries. You've been reading about them on a daily basis. They're all pouring back into our country. I mean there are those that are saying that I've done just about more than anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, when you add our health care that's going to be coming out soon and will be a really good health care as opposed to ObamaCare, which is a total mess, if you add the tax cuts that were going to be doing as soon as we finish health care.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That will come out very soon, the big tax cuts for business and for people, for middle class, tremendous cuts, and for everybody. I think that, you know, I think I've done just about more than anybody in the first four weeks.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But what I'd like to do is peace, I like, you should have great strength for our country and peace, and I'd like jobs, and I also think Supreme Court is very important. It's very interesting, because they wrote an article yesterday and I never thought of it this way. The Supreme Court is so -- such a big thing, and don't forget I got him not just nominated, but I got him confirmed in that hundred days. So that was pretty amazing.
<Salena Zito> <Positive> What are the three foreign leaders that you that you really see yourself building a strong relationship with?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I like a lot of them.
<Salena Zito> <Negative> It doesn't have to be three. Just, who are you...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah well, believe it or not I had a great relationship with Chancellor Merkel. They come up with this thing about shaking hands --I shook her hand four times before I sat down -- and it turns out that either a reporter or somebody said, shake her hand. I never heard it, but I would have been glad to shake... and they made the shaking of the hands. It's a big deal.
<Salena Zito> <Negative> Do you get... do you get frustrated... why is that a story?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don't forget. I was with her. I couldn't believe it. They made it like I was rude. I sat in those chairs, you know, the scrum where it comes in, with all these people screaming and shouting.
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> Yeah
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it sounds like somebody said something about shaking hand. Well maybe she didn't, there's so much noise because they're all going crazy. But, I was with her for a long time before that, and I shook her hand on numerous occasions. We get along great, okay? Merkel. I get along great with President Xi. I got along great with Prime Minister Abe. I got along great with all of them. Macri, I know, you know from Argentina. I know him. He was a friend of mine 25 years ago. His father was in the real estate business.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> What's the one thing about this job which you've thought about for a very long time that now that you've got it, surprised you? Like, oh, I didn't realize that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it started off being a surreal experience. You know, you wake up and you're in the White House or you're walking through the front door and it's the White House and all of that. But you do get over that. I think the one thing that hits me even more than anything else is the magnitude of everything. The numbers are so big. You buy an airplane, but here you're buying 3,500 airplanes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The size of the numbers are really staggering. And every...
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> And what about the people...who are counting on you all across the country? And around the world?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well the love is great. And I saw a poll where I was at 45 or 46 percent, but one of the things they said is that the level of enthusiasm for me is as strong as they've ever seen. In other words, that's a real group of people.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, you have other people, they have a poll, but if they sneeze in the wrong direction, everybody disappears. [Laughter]
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> But the protesters are also there. And they're -- and they have not subsided. That -- what's your reaction?
<Salena Zito> <Negative> I didn't know that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> and, I actually, yeah, I got along great. His father's a great guy, and he's a great guy. But every single one, I mean, name 'em. Now, I mean, I haven't met Putin yet. I haven't met a couple of them yet. But everybody I've met, I got along fantastically with. Theresa May, I thought she was great. Haven't met France, and that's obviously that's going to be a new one.
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So that'll be interesting to see what happens.
<Salena Zito> <Negative> What do you think the three... what three foreign threats keep you up at night? What keeps you up at night?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The biggest threat... Well not much because frankly by the time I get up, it's like, you know... it's a very... it's a very intensive process. Really intense. I get up late. I get up to, you know, up there late.
<Salena Zito> <Negative> Up to bed late. Like how many hours of sleep do you get a night? Like four?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah Four. I would say four.
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> Have you always been like that? Or is it...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they are there and many of them are the ones that lost the election. Now, with all of that being said, I'm going to try and bring people together. And the way you do that is through success. When I create jobs, when I create a health care plan that works, as opposed to ObamaCare, which doesn't work, when we do the kinds of things -- when we get rid of a lot of bad players, really bad players that we're doing right now on the border...
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- people are loving what General Kelly is doing, I will tell you. I think that will change. But a lot of the people that are protesting are the people that lost the election.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> True.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> You have 600 open jobs, though, that you can appoint. What's going on... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, a lot of those jobs, I don't want to appoint, because they're unnecessary to have. You know, we have so many people in government, even me, I look at some of the jobs and it's people over people over people. I say what do all these people do? You don't need all those jobs. Now, there's a...
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> So you're cut -- you're cutting...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, we're cutting...
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Those slots are not going to be there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, Pretty much always. But four, but, but which, you know, gives me an advantage. Plus I can call foreign leaders you know - at two o'clock in the morning.
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> Because they have different time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, because then, it's prime time two o'clock in the afternoon, or something, right. So it gives me a little bit of an advantage. But, but, it's it's been a great period of time. I think we're doing a good job. We're bringing back jobs. The stock market is up almost four trillion dollars.
<Salena Zito> <Positive> What are you most proud of since you've become President? What are some of these... because you have you done a series of executive orders that impact middle America.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I've also had 28 pieces of legislation signed. People don't talk about it. You know, they're saying, oh he did executive orders, but he, well first of all I've rolled back...
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> Some of your legislation...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've rolled back, yeah, I've done a lot of legislation too -- in fact I think we'll have 32 pieces of legislation before, you know, the.. the... you know, the artificial hundred days is up. I think one of the best things I've done is created a foundation for a great president. I think I have a great foundation with foreign leaders and with labor leaders and with workers and with companies. I legitimize President Obama's red line in the sand, which we had to do. See, he's even shaking his head, but it's true.
<Salena Zito> <Negative> Were you, were you, I mean, what was that decision... what was that decision like for you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, it's funny, I -- that's what I mean about messaging. If you have (INAUDIBLE)...
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> We had no idea...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- if you have people...
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> -- that you didn't want to fill them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, many of those jobs I don't want to fill.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> We didn't know that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There are hundreds and hundreds of jobs that are totally unnecessary jobs. And instead of being credited with that -- bad messaging -- they say oh, you have to fill hundreds of jobs.  I say isn't that a good thing? That's not a bad thing. That's a good thing. We're running a very good, efficient government.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> Let's ask you what kind of -- what grade would you give yourself from an A to an F?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Somebody had to do it. It's hard. It's a hard decision. First of all, you don't know, you know we're gonna shoot 59 missiles off. Every one of them hit the target. It was amazing, from way out at sea if you think... you know hundreds and hundreds of miles away. The level of talent, and the level of technology is amazing. 59 out of 59. And these things -- sometimes at 10 feet off the ground. Can you imagine if you're farming, and the thing goes over your head at 700 miles an hour. You say, what was that? But it's very low. That's why it's not detected, and knocked out 24 planes, which we didn't anticipate to do to that extent. But 24 planes, that's a lot of jets.
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it was a hundred percent. It was a hundred percent hitting the targets. 59 out of 59. But I'll tell you, it's tough because you don't know that's going to happen, you know, is one going to go haywire and will end up in a city, or end up in a town and kill a lot of people? So you don't know. But it was an important decision. Not an easy decision to make, because, you know, when you say yes, that means there's death, and death is very tough. It's very tough, you know, it's... there's a lot of weight on that kind of a decision.
<Salena Zito> <Negative> Was that your toughest decision you made so far?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, I probably would say yes.
<Salena Zito> <Neutral> And how... how is North Korea weighing on you now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it weighs, but we have to prepare, be prepared for the worst. We have to be prepared to do what we have to do. We can't allow this to go on. He's very threatening. He's very saying terrible things, and people can't do that.
<Salena Zito> <Positive> You're... last question, you've been really generous with your time.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> I think I know what you're going to say.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Well, let's hear it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think -- yes, no, I wouldn't do that. I think in terms of effort, which means something but I give myself an A plus, OK, effort. But that's, you know, results are more important. In terms of messaging, I would give myself a C or a C plus.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Really?
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In terms of achievement, I think I'd give myself an A. Because I think I've done great things, but I don't think I have -- I and my people, I don't think we've explained it well enough to the American public. I think I get an A in terms of what I've actually done, but in terms of messaging, I'd give myself a C or a C plus.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> All right, what are you going to... [Crosstalk]
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> -- how are you going to change that then?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, maybe I change it during the speech.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, you've been great and I appreciate it, so...
<Salena Zito> <Negative> Tax reform. I know... I know your proposals in its infancy, but you're a middle class guy, you're sitting in...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Those are the biggest beneficiaries.
<Salena Zito> <Negative> Yeah, just explain that a little bit.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Honestly, they're the biggest [Inaudible], they're the biggest... that's the ones I care about. I don't care about... I don't care about this, you know, like, business, if I go back I'm going to, what, build buildings again and stuff? Who cares, it doesn't matter when you look at this. You know, one thing I did which was you know, it's gotten no talk because most people don't know, but I renegotiated the F-35 contract, where I saved $725 million on 90 planes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're buying 2,500 planes so if you multiply that out, you know, it's billions of dollars, and I'll do that with many things. It's natural Hillary would have, I mean, this is off the record, Hillary Clinton's not going to do that. I read an article in The Wall Street Journal about the F-35 is a disaster, the program. Seven years later, four hundred billion over budget. I went in and renegotiated the next lot of planes, it was a lot for ninety planes. I got 725 and General Mattis said I've never seen anything like that in my life, and he's been doing this for a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I'll do that. That's $725 million and, and so that was, that was great. But I think just keep it going. I think it's been a really great period of time. I'm being very untreated, you know, treated very harshly by the press. I know this, Ronald Reagan said this too. I thought after I won the press would then become fair, and after I won the press became far worse than it ever was, you know, I mean.
<Salena Zito> <Negative> I believe that famously just didn't even, he just stopped watching, or stopped reading the papers.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Oh, that's good.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because, you know, frankly, I'm going to be discussing a lot of those things.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> After our exclusive with President Trump, we were so fortunate to get a VIP tour of actual White House.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Yes, our tour guide: the President himself walking us through his brand new house.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> And we even ran into a very familiar face. I think you'll recognize her.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Got a nice place
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've done that. You probably heard, I mean I don't watch CNN anymore. I don't watch in MSNBC anymore. It's all it is, a hit. If I negotiated the greatest deal in the history of the world, they would try and make it look negative. You know, I never thought I had this ability. I am totally able to not watch things that are, you know, unfair and unpleasant. And it keeps you right. You know, it really is a good thing for you. So it's been very positive, and you've been very positive. You I watch, and read. Take care of yourself, okay. You take care, okay?
<Salena Zito> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you very much.

<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a good place
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Do you know where you're going yet?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. I really have it pretty well figured out. We're actually going to make a trip downstairs and we -- you may have a surprise downstairs.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Oh really?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You may have a surprise.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Oh, wonderful.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> We're going to go to the picture of Hillary Clinton there...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This is the First Lady's area actually. They have all the First Ladies in this area. It's very interesting.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Do they actually go through with a historian and talk about what's what?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They did. They gave me a long tour, and they gave me very specific tours of all of the different areas. It's really an amazing place, including the Promenade, which is pretty famous. Let's go in here. Oh good, I wonder who's in here. Let's see who's in here. We'll never figure this out.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Mr. President, what room is this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So this is a room where I believe you're going to find the First Lady. hello First Lady.
<Melania> <Positive> Oh, hi
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- And her whole crew.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Hello how are you? What are you up to?
<Melania Trump> <Neutral> Just working.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Doing what?
<Melania Trump> <Negative> Yes, the next event. We had the successful Governor's Ball last night, so...
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> How was it?
<Melania Trump> <Positive> First one and many to go. It's very good. A beautiful event. And this is my team, so we're working hard.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> What type of planning goes into these events?
<Melania Trump> <Positive> Ah, from... everything. You know, you're planning, it's almost like you're planning a wedding every time. So yeah, it's a lot of work.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Each event is very important, and last night they did such -- the group did such a great job with the Governors. They've never seen anything like it. So it was special, and it was very good for the Governors to see. But Melania did a really fantastic job with your group, really good.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Well, that's says a lot, because you're in -- you were in the hospitality business.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I really understand it very well believe me and it's not easy.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> How weird is this that you work, you work in the building over here but you live in a house back there, yet you gotta... you gotta walk about a block outside to get to work.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know this is a very famous walk, as you know.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Rose Garden
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- And if you notice the ramps, there are many ramps.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Yep.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's FDR.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Sure
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They were put here for FDR. But this is a very, very famous walk and you'll oftentimes see the great foreign leaders walking this with the President, whoever he or she may be -- someday she.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> And people tell you, OK grab the German leader walk with her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, they tell you basically, but then you know what to do after a little while.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Do you ever walk these steps in the Colonnade and say to yourself, these are the steps John F Kennedy, these are the steps that Ronald Reagan, these are steps Jimmy Carter...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Sure.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Harry Truman.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> They all walk this walk.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They.. all of the greats. If you -- you think, 1800 was when it really first -- and then this was built somewhat later -- but 1800 is when the White House really opened, even a little bit sooner than that.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Has it intrigued you to read and study this right now, knowing what you know?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It is a fascinating building, and the history of the Oval Office is incredible.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right behind us is the mansion, that's where you live. This is the Colonnade. Right over there is your hotel.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, that's right, isn't that beautiful? Isn't that beautiful?
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> It's a beautiful hotel. Do you ever sit in the Oval Office at the Resolute Desk and say, you know what, if I was over there I would have a cheeseburger right about now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I don't really, but I will tell you I'm so focused on what I'm doing here, I don't even think about it.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right, and that's that's the thing too. He does not want to mention the hotel because that's a separate business.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> It is.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> The kids are running that.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> But he can see it from his desk.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> It was almost like he's so busy with his job at the White House, he didn't realize that you could see it.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> No kidding.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> You pointed that out to him. We went into the Oval Office. He gave us a tour of that, and we're going to show you that part of the interview coming up on Thursday.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> That's right. And by the way, to the President and the White House team, thank you very much. This was the honor of a lifetime, to be able to bring this exclusive interview to people watching -- watching Fox and Friends.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> So when we went to the White House on Monday, and we sat down with the President, which was so awesome, we took a little tour, and we... we showed you yesterday, past the Rose Garden, right up to the Oval Office. Well right now we're going to take you inside the Oval Office with the President of the United States.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Open the door
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> After you
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Thank you. I feel a little awkward walking in before you before you.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Just don't touch anything before he comes.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> This is beautiful.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ut's a great and beautiful office.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> This is Ronald Reagan's desk?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is the Resolute. It's called the Resolute. And it's actually been the desk of many Presidents, and it's a special desk. That's Andrew Jackson ,who you know very well, a dear friend of yours.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Why did you put that up?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they say that his campaign and his whole thing was most like mine that was -- it was interesting, that was 1828. They used to go back to Ronald Reagan, now they go back to Andrew Jackson, but that's the great. Andrew jackson, who actually was a great general, and he was a great President, but a controversial President. And this is Thomas Jefferson, very famous painting, actually, you've probably seen that. Very, very famous painting. And this is a bust of Abraham Lincoln.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Now, do you get to choose what paintings are here and what busts?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I do but some of them just sort of come with the office, like the picture of George Washington.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> Did you choose the colors.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I did.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> Gold?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I did. I chose pretty much the colors, but those chairs have been there for a long time. Those are really used for foreign leaders when the foreign leaders come in. It's a very open office, when you have a lot of people around, but it works, and it is the Oval Office.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Sure
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've had people coming with the most beautiful offices you have ever seen and they... one person came in and actually just broke down and started crying. You know, there's something very special about this place.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Absolutely. Page 1 of the Art of the Deal, it talks about how, when you were running things in New York City, you had a rather unstructured day. You didn't want too many meetings, and your door was always open. And I have read that the door is always open to the Oval Office because you want to hear from your people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, and I also want people to see it. And I have union leaders, I have heads of major companies...
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> You had the miners.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I had the miners. The miners were incredible. The miners came in... they were from West Virginia and Kentucky... and they came in and I had them behind me... a lot of miners, and we took pictures. They were incredible.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> They even wore hard hats.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They are incredible
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> What about the Patriots? Some of the Patriots have said that they don't want to come to the White House. What's your message to them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't even think about it. I mean they can do whatever they want, you know as far as I'm concerned. And I'm friends with a few of them, and Bob Kraft is a terrific guy and what a great coach and what a great quarterback, it was a great game. But no, they should -- only the ones that would want to come should come
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> You know what's interesting is, there's one picture here from somebody, it's not a bust of a person, it's not a painting, it's your dad.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's my father, yeah. And I have others coming in, but that was the first one I put up. my father, yes.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> What do you think he would say, right now, when he says my son is President?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think he had a lot of confidence in me, and he gave me confidence by having confidence. He was a tough guy, but a good guy. He had a great heart. But I think he would say, that's amazing, you know when you think of it.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Would he be proud of you or would he say I expected it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he loved the country, I can tell you he loved the country and he would be very proud, yes.
<John King> <Positive> In a moment, the reasons for the big White House strategy shift, but first Mr. Trump, the man the president had in mind when he talked of sideshows and carnival barkers. Mr. Trump is here in New Hampshire today, introducing himself to Republican leaders and voters, saying he expects to formally enter the 2012 presidential race in June. Now self-promotion is a Trump trademark and when he landed here this morning, he was beaming.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Today, I'm very proud of myself because I've accomplished something that nobody else has been able to accomplish. I was just informed while on the helicopter that our president has finally released a birth certificate. [End Clip]
<John King> <Negative> Now Mr. Trump mixed bragging with a bit of revisionist history, suggesting it was us in the news media somehow forcing him to question whether President Obama was born here in the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We can get on to issues and hopefully when I sit down with interviews people don't start talking about birth certificate, birth certificate, like they've been doing. So I feel I've accomplished something really, really important. And I'm honored by it. [End Clip]
<John King> <Positive> Now, we're here in beautiful Portsmouth tonight because we scheduled an interview with Mr. Trump several days ago, well before we had any clue the president would make his birth certificate public. Mr. Trump told us this afternoon he wanted to cancel that interview. He accused CNN of being unfair to him in recent days. We don't think that's true. Although we are proud of our consistent reporting showing the birther conspiracies to be bogus. In the end though, Mr. Trump did agree to sit down and talk. Thanks for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<John King> <Positive> You've said today that you're honored and proud --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very honored and proud.
<John King> <Neutral> That the president released this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very good, I'm very happy about it. I think I've been given great praise by the press, and I'm honored to have -- look, he should have done this years ago. He didn't do it for Hillary Clinton. He didn't do it for John McCain. He did it for me. The fact is I get things done. And I don't understand why he didn't do it a lot sooner, John, but he didn't, and it's a shame.
<John King> <Negative> Are you at all maybe a little embarrassed for stoking what many in the country see as a foolish debate?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, I think I really did a great job in getting him to -- I mean, first of all, I haven't seen it. You're just -- I'm looking at that --
<John King> <Neutral> Here it is.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It doesn't -- I'll look at it later. I don't need to look at your copy. But I hope it's -- everything's perfect. And I've been saying that very consistently. I hope that he has it. I don't understand why he didn't do it years ago when Hillary Clinton wanted it, when Bill Clinton wanted it, when John McCain wanted it.
<John King> <Negative> Some supporters of Hillary Clinton circulated an e-mail asking him to release it. I don't recall Senator Clinton or President Clinton ever asking --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I heard everybody wanted to see it and I was the only one that got him to do it. And nobody understands why he didn't do it sooner, and he should have, because it would have been good for the country. And it's also good for me -- I've been given great credit for having him do something that he should have done and should have done a long time ago.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But what I like about it, it allows me to get on to subjects like China ripping us off, because they are just absolutely brutalizing and abusing this country. Like OPEC, what they're doing to the price of oil, and nobody talks to them. Nobody calls them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Saudi Arabia, three days ago, just, as you know, they really cut back on their oil production, meaning let's raise the price some more. And people are going to be paying six, seven and $8 for their gasoline.
<John King> <Neutral> Let's get --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it's really a shame. [Crosstalk] Excuse me, John. And I'm really happy that we can finally get on to that subject, because that's my strength, jobs, the economy, getting OPEC to behave. We have all the power. Getting OPEC to behave. They don't respect our leadership.
<John King> <Negative> But you raised this, saying the president should release --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, you raised this -- [Crosstalk] Excuse me --
<John King> <Negative> No, I did not raise this --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You raised this, John.
<John King> <Negative> I didn't call a press conference in Palm Beach earlier this week --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me, you raised this --
<John King> <Negative> I haven't been on -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And every time I sit down with the press, all they want to talk about is the birth certificate. And I got him to do something that nobody else could get him to do.
<John King> <Neutral> And you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I've been given great credit for that.
<John King> <Negative> And you raised this issue of his credibility, that if he has it he should release it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely.
<John King> <Negative> There are some people who question yours in the middle of all this. The other night you went on Anderson Cooper and you said your investigators told you it was missing or it wasn't there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me.
<John King> <Neutral> What was that based on?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me, very simple, I had people looking into it. Now I don't have to have the people -- I can call them back. I hope, I mean, I haven't seen this. And I'm sure that a lot of experts will analyze it. [Crosstalk]
<John King> <Negative> But would you ever pay them -- if serious people told you it was missing or not there, here it is.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Would I pay them? I don't know. Maybe I'll let you negotiate it for me, OK? [Crosstalk] I can say this, John. Let me just tell you, I don't make up anything. Let me tell you something. I have done a great service to the American people. I got him to release a birth certificate that he should have done three years ago and four years ago and he didn't it. And if you remember, he said, oh, no, no, there's no such thing as a birth certificate, it doesn't matter. They don't have it. There is no such thing. He was saying the live -- the certificate of live birth was the only thing that mattered. Hawaii doesn't have that. All of a sudden, Hawaii has it? Sort of strange.
<John King> <Negative> He said he didn't think he needed to release it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me; he kept saying about the certificate of live birth was all they have --
<John King> <Positive> That should be good enough -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me, John. He kept saying the certificate of live birth was all they have in Hawaii. They don't have birth certificates in Hawaii. And I said he was wrong. Guess what? I turned out to be right.
<John King> <Negative> Today, he said that he felt he would reverse himself and release this because of the distraction he blamed on sideshows and carnival barkers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look --
<John King> <Neutral> And people say he means you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look -- well, that's OK, and I will tell you, we have a president that's incompetent. We have a president who's doing a terrible job. We have a president that has fuel oil and fuel prices and gasoline prices going to six, seven and $8 and people can't even fill up a tank of gas now because they don't have the money. And we have OPEC making more money than any group of countries has ever made in the history of the world. We have China taking our jobs and ripping us off. And we have a president that gives the head of China a party at the White House. We have a president that's incompetent.
<John King> <Neutral> You don't consider yourself a sideshow or carnival barker, I assume?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am a very serious person. I am a person that has made great wealth. I have built up a great, great company. And if and when I decide to run -- and you may be pleasantly surprised in your case, in the case of CNN, you may be unpleasantly surprised, I'll be announcing sometime prior to June. Not only will I be announcing something that I think a lot of people will be happy -- because I feel I formed something in my own mind as to what I want to do. But as you know, if I announce, I have to present very detailed information on wealth, cash, the banks --
<John King> <Neutral> You told Eliot Spitzer this week that if Obama released this, if the president released this, you would release your tax returns.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know what I told Eliot Spitzer -- I look at Eliot Spitzer --
<John King> <Negative> You told George Stephanopoulos the same thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me, excuse me, I'll be doing my tax returns at the appropriate time. I haven't even announced yet.
<John King> <Negative> You said this was missing. You had investigators who said it was missing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me --
<John King> <Positive> You're questioning the character and integrity --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The president himself -- [Crosstalk]
<John King> <Neutral> Let me finish. I let you finish --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> John --
<John King> <Neutral> You're questioning the character and integrity of the president of the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The president himself -- [Crosstalk]
<John King> <Negative> ' -- CNN poll that shows you in a dead heat with the president of the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right.
<John King> <Neutral> There's no such poll. We've never polled.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll give it to you. [Crosstalk] I'll give it to you.
<John King> <Positive> We have never polled Obama versus Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, you have. [Crosstalk] Oh really? Do you want -- [Crosstalk] Can I show it to you? [Crosstalk] Can I show it to you?
<John King> <Positive> Yes, I'd love to see it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me, hold it. Can you get that poll? It was like 42 to 44. A CNN poll.
<John King> <Positive> CNN has never polled Obama versus Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. That's fine. Let's see if you're right or wrong, OK? CNN -- it had like a 42 to 44. It was a statistical dead heat. Check it. You know the one I'm talking about, Michael? OK, I think you're wrong.
<John King> <Neutral> You --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Of course you're not going to show that because if you are wrong, you will cut it out. [Crosstalk] Excuse me, if you are wrong --
<John King> <Neutral> When I find out --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me, if you are wrong, you'll cut it out. [Crosstalk]
<John King> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're wrong.
<John King> <Negative> No, if I'm wrong, I look at the camera -- I made a mistake. I'm wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good, good. I hope you do that.
<John King> <Neutral> That's what I do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, I hope you do that. OK, next question. [End Clip]
<John King> <Positive> But we're not wrong. We told the Trump people if they could produce evidence of that poll, we'd be happy, happy to correct the record. We also rechecked with our polling department and our polling director specifically.
<John King> <Negative> The Trump people never got back to us and this is why. We're positive, positive CNN never conducted such a poll. More of my interview with the possible presidential candidate coming up and how did he fare here in New Hampshire and why did the president choose to show his birth certificate today after two years of saying no? That's next.
<John King> <Negative> So why did the president after two years of saying no decide not only to release his birth certificate today, but to come into the White House briefing room to discuss it? And now that it is public, will the birther debate finally fade away? One other question, is Donald Trump a legitimate presidential candidate?
<John King> <Negative> Joining me here is the New Hampshire State Republican Party Chairman Jack Kimball -- good to see you, sir -- and in Washington a Democratic pollster and CNN contributor Cornell Belcher and our national political correspondent Jessica Yellin. Jess, to you first, the president had said for two years no, no, no, this is a distraction. This is bogus. I'm not going to do this. Today, he released this document, and the spin from the Democrats is he thinks this helps him. If he likes the Republicans talking about this, why did he put it out there?
<Jessica Yellin> <Positive> There is a political downside to this, as you point out, John, which is that the more the Republicans are spinning up about this birther issue, they're not talking about jobs and the economy, which is what ultimately will get the next president elected, everyone agrees. So it was a useful political distraction.
<Jessica Yellin> <Negative> But all my sources in the White House and on campaign Obama believe that this was becoming such a distraction it was stepping on the messages that they really want to communicate, especially about the plan to bring down the debt, the president's vision, and the day after he unveiled his plan, major news networks came to talk to the president about the plan and were asking about this instead and word is that the president himself was personally miffed. He just wanted it to go away.
<John King> <Negative> So Cornell Belcher, is that it? I'm always -- forgive me -- a bit suspicious when the White House changes a position that they've thought through for a very long time. They have access to this document. They could have done this at anytime. I get suspicious that they're seeing something in the numbers, as ludicrous as they think this debate is, as ludicrous as our reporting has shown this debate to be, that they see something that's hurting the president. Is there anything in the numbers?
<Cornell Belcher> <Neutral> Two things. One is I got to back up a little bit because, you know what, in 2008, you know, the Obama campaign, campaign Obama actually released what Hawaii says is a birth certificate. You know the long form thing is sort of the opposition moving the goal post. But back in 2008 the campaign actually released what Hawaii gave us as his birth certificate.
<Cornell Belcher> <Negative> So there's that. But in the numbers, this cuts against Republicans in a real damaging way. It cuts against Republicans because it's about judgment. If you're an independent voter in middle America worried about jobs and the economy and you see that the leading Republican candidate -- by the way, I want to know about this secret CNN poll John -- that your leading Republican candidate right now is -- number one issue is the birthers, that's got to be really problematic for the Republican Party.
<John King> <Positive> So, Mr. Chairman, you are in the first primary state. Iowa has its caucuses. New Hampshire has its primary. The candidates including Mr. Trump here today beginning to get more active. Is this a real issue? Are you happy that the president has put this document out and now you can talk about -- I assume Republicans will argue, you know, he wants to raise taxes or he has too big of a government. Would you rather talk about those issues?
<Jack Kimball> <Positive> I think that it's a little funny that Mr. Trump showed up today and the birth certificate showed up as well. I think it's important that we get this out of the way. I think it's very --
<John King> <Negative> You don't think that's a coincidence?
<Jack Kimball> <Negative> I don't know. I really don't. But, really, I think probably the transcripts are next. And when you look forward to these things the only --
<John King> <Neutral> Wait, wait, wait, wait -- I'm going to jump here -- use the transcripts, you mean his college records?
<Jack Kimball> <Neutral> Yes, that's probably next --
<John King> <Neutral> Why is that relevant?
<Jack Kimball> <Negative> Well, think it's not. I think -- the only grades -- that's really not relevant to me --
<John King> <Negative> He's been president of the United States for two-plus years now. He'll be president for almost four years when he runs for re-election. Whether he got a C or an A in Greek studies in college I hope my employer doesn't -- [Crosstalk]
<Jack Kimball> <Negative> I'm only concerned with the F's in the stimulus package and the F's in Obamacare that he gets from me, that's for sure. The same thing with foreign policy. So those are the things I'm worried about. I think we've got to move forward in the campaign and the candidates as well.
<John King> <Negative> One of the things we try to do here is hold people accountable and we try to hold everybody accountable. You saw part of a contentious conversation with Mr. Trump there. There's more of it to come. I want to play one other thing the president said because as Jess just noted, the White House making this decision, saying it believes that this birther debate had become a huge distraction. Let's listen to a little bit of how the president characterized it.
<Barack Obama> <Negative> During that entire week, the dominant news story wasn't about these huge monumental choices that we're going to have to make as a nation. It was about my birth certificate and that was true on most of the news outlets that were represented here. [End Clip]
<John King> <Negative> Not exactly. We want to give credit where credit is due. Jake Tapper of ABC News I think was the first one to notice this Thirty-nine percent of television news program, then the Middle East unrest, the Japan quake and the tsunami and then the Obama administration and Southeast tornadoes. So the president certainly felt that there was a lot of cable chatter about it no doubt, but the president not exactly factual in that one. Cornell, I want to come back to the point that if this is such a good issue for the president, why say anything? Why put the document out?
<Cornell Belcher> <Negative> I don't -- I don't argue that it is a good issue. I think it is a horrible issue for America. I think this is a bad issue for Republicans and I think you see Republicans even sort of Bachmann and Governor Brewer in Arizona sort of backing away from this issue because guess what, if your central premise right now is not jobs and economy but whether or not a birth certificate -- you know, moving the polls, moving back the goal posts on the birth certificate, you are missing where American people are right now and I think Republicans fall into a trap right now and right now their leading Republican candidate right now is a guy whose central issue has been the birther issue.
<Janet Yellin> <Negative> John, if I can also add, I would -- I will say that one top Obama aide said to me after this, and what's Donald Trump going to talk about now? So it's not like they're tone-deaf to the political environment out there. And then there's this larger concern of the ways that it's an effort to discredit the presidency in general, call him illegitimate, bring in these larger issues of is he really a Christian or is he Muslim? They didn't want it to get into all of that and keep this dragging on, so there were larger concerns beyond just the media coverage.
<Cornell Belcher> <Negative> And real quickly, John, the whole now -- the grade thing, that's again not on issue. That's about sort of making Barack Obama illegitimate. It has nothing to do with the pains of the American people right now. It is a smear campaign.
<John King> <Negative> Were you joking about that? [Inaudible] were you joking about that or do you seriously think he should -- his college transcripts are a relevant issue?
<Jack Kimball> <Negative> No, that was tongue in cheek --
<John King> <Positive> All right, tongue in cheek -- let's try to put that one away because I know Cornell has a point. Let's talk about Mr. Trump. He's here today. He spent some time privately with you. He sounds by every account, everyone who meets with him privately, and certainly in the public interviews, like this time he's serious. He has flirted with this before. So people are a tad skeptical. He likes generating publicity for his television program and for his businesses. You had a private meeting with him today. Is he running for president?
<Jack Kimball> <Negative> I can't answer that yet. I will tell you just his appearance here today I think is ominous. I do. And I think that he wouldn't have bothered to come here if he wasn't taking the next most serious step, you know, toward that decision.
<John King> <Positive> Are you confident he's a Republican? I want to just go back -- if you go back in time in 1999, he talked about himself as a potential Reform Party candidate for president. He said the Democrats were too liberal and the Republicans were too crazy right. That's his words -- too crazy right. He supported abortion rights back then. He talked about a one time 14.25 percent millionaire tax. Civil rights for gay couples. Universal health care. Is this a born-again Donald Trump ? Do you believe he's a conservative Republican in the mold that New Hampshire Republicans would embrace?
<Jack Kimball> <Positive> Yes, I think -- I think what you're going to see and today you saw -- the folks showed up and he was pretty well received, but all of the candidates are going have to get out there and tell their platforms. And the voters of this state -- and -- I love this state. That's -- we do the vetting I think for this country.
<Jack Kimball> <Positive> And they're going to ask the tough questions and the answers that they're going to receive are going to prompt them to vote for one of these candidates. And Mr. Trump is really no different than any of the other broad group of candidates that we've got vying for this position.
<John King> <Positive> Cornell, I know you're a Democrat, but you study the numbers. Be as fair as you can be here, my friend. He has gone up --
<Cornell Belcher> <Positive> I'm always fair.
<John King> <Negative> -- in the polls among perspective Republican candidates, he has gone up in the polls. Is it -- do you think it's just a birther issue or are Republicans looking around and maybe not so satisfied or maybe looking for fresh faces or is it just that he's a celebrity?
<Cornell Belcher> <Negative> Two things, I think the chairman is actually doing a real good job being the Republican chairman but he knows in the back of his mind those issues that you just laid out there, Mitt Romney and those other Republicans are going to kill him dead on those issues because they're going to run advertising that's going to be really harmful for him in that Republican primary. The other thing about this I think -- I think Trump is actually -- the Republicans are to blame for Trump.
<Cornell Belcher> <Positive> They wait too long to get in -- their top candidates waited too long to get in. They left this doorway open for Trump to get in. But also what I think is exciting about Trump is he's changed. He's not your typical politician. Americans said time and time again they want change. Donald Trump is to a certain extent right now a change agent.
<Cornell Belcher> <Negative> As bizarre as it is he's a change agent because he doesn't look like the rest of those guys. He doesn't have their political background. He's someone who's not been part of the political process.
<John King> <Negative> Jess, do other Republicans view him as a likely and as a serious contender? He certainly could write himself a big check.
<Janet Yellin> <Negative> If they do, I haven't met that person. I mean there's a lot of eye rolling that goes on. A lot of, you know, Republican -- establishment Republicans think he's not good for the party and an early season distraction that will probably go away before we see people go into the caucuses in Iowa.
<John King> <Negative> Who's your front-runner in New Hampshire at the moment?
<Jack Kimball> <Positive> I would say right now Mitt Romney would probably be considered the front-runner --
<John King> <Positive> What makes this state interesting and sometimes fascinating, we saw this play out in 2008 when you had contested primaries on both sides, there are more Independents, undeclared voters you call them here in New Hampshire than there are Democrats or Republicans and they can vote in either primary. If President Obama does not have a challenge, do you suspect that most of those independents will vote in the Republican primary and a lot of them, sir, would be Democrats maybe playing mischief, Democratic-leaning independents saying, hey, no race on my side, let's go have some fun.
<Jack Kimball> <Positive> John, it's one of the strange issues we have in this state. People can actually do that to manipulate the vote. We don't like to see that, but it's hard to tell. It's very hard to tell what they're going to do. But you're absolutely right. You know 30 percent -- the makeup in this state, 30 percent Republican, 30 percent Democrat and around 40 percent in the middle, so it's an incredible dynamic and that middle, that's the sway vote and that's going to be the determining factor in this state.
<John King> <Positive> Fascinating to watch. We'll spend a lot more time with Chairman Kimball in the months ahead. Thank you, sir, for your time tonight. Jess, Cornell, thanks as well.
<Jack Kimball> <Positive> Thank you.
<John King> <Positive> Up next, more of my interview with Donald Trump and why he doesn't buy Made in America. Live pictures there. We're in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, the Eastern Seaboard of New Hampshire, a beautiful town, beautiful town in a wonderful state and a great place to come and cover American politics.
<John King> <Positive> Donald Trump here today. He thinks about -- he's thinking about running for the Republican nomination for president. As you watch those pictures, maybe you believe him, maybe you don't.
<John King> <Positive> But Donald Trump says he's happy tonight that the president has released his birth certificate because it means talk on the campaign trail will turn to other issues. China's role in the economy is one of Trump's favorite themes. In our conversation, we discussed that and whether he's really serious this time about running. You just mentioned that China is raping us, taking our jobs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said that China is taking advantage and abusing us like other than OPEC, no country has ever done in the history of the United States. We are being abused by China. They're manipulating their currencies. They are taking all and -- I don't mean like a little bit. They are taking tremendous numbers of our jobs. They're making our products. We are rebuilding China. Now, if it's one-on-one and free trade as opposed to fair trade, because it should be fair trade, but if it's one-on-one, that's one thing but what China --
<John King> <Neutral> Do you know your wife sells a jewelry line on QVC?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true. And you know what else -- can I give you --
<John King> <Positive> Do you know every piece of jewelry -- every piece of jewelry is made in China?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Can I tell you what else? I build my buildings, unfortunately, because companies can't compete because they manipulate their currency. So China makes jewelry and they make curtain walls and they make lots of other things and it shouldn't be that way, John. We should be making it.
<John King> <Neutral> But --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me -- [Crosstalk]
<John King> <Negative> People will ask, is this guy a hypocrite?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because --
<John King> <Neutral> He's out there beating up on the Chinese and his wife is making money selling products made in China.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because of the fact that China manipulates their currency. And they really manipulate it big league. And our people aren't smart enough to know what's going on. When I order curtain walls for a big beautiful building, when I order other things, you know what happened with the sheetrock, because the good news is we make better products than they make in China. But when I order -- can I talk? When I order various elements for building a big building, many of them come from China. Many other industries, the same thing. These -- it comes from China. You know why? Because they manipulate the hell out of their currency.
<John King> <Neutral> But if you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And unless we're going to -- [Crosstalk]
<John King> <Positive> -- start a company here in the United States -- you could start a company here in the United States and go on QVC or go -- when Trump sells a building, say it's going to cost you a little bit more because I decided to make it in America. When you're out there beating them up --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's a 40 percent manipulation, and it doesn't allow companies in this country to compete. And when you start throwing a tax on Chinese goods, you will see tremendous companies be built in this country. Now, you may never get to it, because once you do that, John, as soon as that happens, I'll tell you what's going -- as soon as China thinks the messenger is real, not a guy like Obama, but the messenger is real, they're going to stop manipulating their currency.
<John King> <Negative> But I'm not so sure we shouldn't do it anyway. We need jobs in Alabama. We need jobs in New Hampshire, where I am right now.
<John King> <Negative> They need jobs badly. We need jobs in this country. And China's making our product.
<John King> <Negative> We are rebuilding China. So when my wife does jewelry, you can't do it. They don't even make it in this country. Everything is made in China. When I order curtain walls, when I order other things -- I order thousands of television sets for a building, thousands. I said, Let's buy it from the United States. I want America. I want United States. There's no place that makes them. We don't have television companies in this country. I mean So, I end up getting LGs made in South Korea, thousands of them. Now, why -- excuse me, why aren't we -- why aren't we making them in this country? Why?
<John King> <Negative> So, between China and other countries, but China's the biggest abuser of all, and they are an abuser because they manipulate the hell of their currencies which makes it almost impossible, almost impossible, for our companies to compete. So, you see no hypocrisy there? You see no hypocrisy there?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Zero. No, zero. I buy stuff -- the first thing I do, hey, look, you're supposed to be this great reporter, even though your ratings are no good -- let me just tell you something, let me just tell you something -- I want to buy here so badly. I want to buy in this country so badly that your head would spin, OK? So badly. The problem is, half of these products that I want to buy, they don't even make them in this country. And if they do make them, they cost four times more because China manipulates their currency. Now, the good news is, we make a better product than they make.
<John King> <Positive> If you run, do you guarantee you will run as a Republican or might you run as an independent?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would run as a Republican.
<John King> <Neutral> No question?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm running as a Republican. I mean, I'm looking to run as a Republican. I'm doing very well. As you probably know but won't say, I'm leading in almost every poll --
<John King> <Positive> You've come way up, you're doing quite well --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm doing very well. [Crosstalk]
<John King> <Neutral> ' -- without a doubt.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think now I've gotten Obama to do something that for some reason he didn't want to do, which is expose his birth certificate, I think probably, that will have a huge positive impact. But I will say this, pollsters have also said, as you sort of indicated before, that a lot of people have voted for you in the polls. But a lot of people want to vote for you, but they really think you're just having a good time, I'm having fun. They said P.T. Barnum and all of this nonsense --
<John King> <Neutral> I'm not so sure of that myself --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Or I'm trying to build up my ratings of The Apprentice. And you're on television I don't need to build up the ratings in The Apprentice. And it's too trivial to even think about it. Now, I will tell you that I will make a decision sometime prior to June. And I love this country. I want this country to be great again. I want this country to be rich again. With Obama as president, it can no longer be great and it can no longer be rich.
<John King> <Positive> So, then how, as you try to make the case, you're in this great state today. It has a prestigious historic first presidential primary.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a great state.
<John King> <Negative> Independents can vote in that primary. They take it very seriously. Some of them looking at your record, see a guy who in 1999 talked about being in the Reform Party, said the Republicans were too crazy right. Your words on Meet the Press -- too crazy right A conservative activist here, Jennifer Horn, writes today, she was a nominee for Congress in 2008: Even the most experienced political operative gets whiplash trying to follow --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, let me ask you this, why am I doing so well in the polls in New Hampshire? I mean, I'm doing great in the polls in New Hampshire. I'm leading the national polls. And I'm doing great in New Hampshire. And you know why -- you know why --
<John King> <Neutral> Rudy led the national polls for a while.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't care about Rudy. Rudy is a great a friend of mine. He's a great guy. But he didn't run a good campaign and he'll be the first to admit it.
<John King> <Negative> And he didn't even come to New Hampshire, really, and he didn't come to Iowa, and he obviously should have. So, you can't compare that, all right? But you don't see -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But Rudy is a good friend-
<John King> <Positive> ' -- that credibility and consistency- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me just tell you something -- I'm doing great in the polls. You know why? Because people in New Hampshire, as well as people in the country, don't want to be ripped off by every nation that does business with us. Even Colombia, in Latin America, Colombia, it was just announced, they made $4 billion on us last year. And now, we're looking to sign a new trade agreement that's going to let them do even better. We're run by people that are incompetent. Our leader is incompetent. And people want to see a change. And that's why I'm doing better in the polls. And I have to catch a plane, I'm sorry.
<John King> <Negative> If they want that change -- one last question -- if they want that change, they want to look, they want the credibility of a new commander-in-chief. Let me ask you about something you said here this morning. You said that when you look at the Libyan opposition, that we should be careful, that you see Iran and al Qaeda.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right.
<John King> <Negative> Not a bunch of good guys trying to kick out Gadhafi.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right.
<John King> <Negative> The United States intelligence agencies, the British intelligence agency, say there's a sliver of al Qaeda, but for most part, it's just people rising up against Gadhafi. Does Donald Trump have a better intelligence network than the United States government?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Are they the same intelligence agencies that said about the World Trade Center, that, you know, Saddam Hussein knocked down the World Trade Center? I guess, are they the same people?
<John King> <Negative> But somebody might ask, where do you get that information? Do you get it from the same people who told you this is missing?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know where I get it from? I get it from reading newspapers. And I didn't say it is. I said I am reading and I am hearing that Iran is very strongly backing the so-called rebels. Wonderful word. Sounds like Gone with the Wind And wouldn't that be something if we go in and we do a big number and we get rid of Gadhafi, which is fine as far as I'm concerned, and now somebody takes over who's worse? Now, here's another question -- China gets a lot of its oil from Libya, right? You know that, right?
<John King> <Negative> I know that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We get none. Why isn't China involved? Why isn't China involved, John? We don't get oil from Libya. We're involved. We spent over $1 billion already, because the Arab League, which is Saudi Arabia and others of the richest nations in the world, the Arab League wants us to go and take out Gadhafi because they don't like him. We don't like him. Go do it. Why didn't we say to them, all right, we'll do it, $5 billion, we want $5 billion? You know what they would have said? Absolutely, you have a deal. They wouldn't -- that's peanuts for them. That's peanuts.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're into the war for $1 billion, at least. And we're not even winning. I mean, so far Gadhafi is in power still. And people are on the streets cheering him on. So, we're into the war for over $1 billion. The Arab League said go in and take him out. Obama gets up, he says, oh, it's great, it's great. The Arab League wants us. They're with us. They're with us. The Arab League is with us. He's all excited. The Arab League is with us.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why doesn't he just sit back nice and calm and say, you want him out, we don't like him either, I don't like him, but you want him out, we want $5 billion? We want you to pay for the cost. And by the way, after he's out, we want a big percentage of oil. Because the only way I go into Libya is if we get some of the oil. Thank you very much.
<John King> <Neutral> We have a Republican debate here in June. Can we count you in?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Pretty soon, yes, I guess. I mean, only after I announce. And you can certainly count me in.
<John King> <Positive> Amen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I look forward to that. Thank you very much, John.
<John King> <Positive> See you then. Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Have a good time. [End Clip]
