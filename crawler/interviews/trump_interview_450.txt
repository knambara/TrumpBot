<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, nice to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I wanted to talk to you about the recent news about Pakistan and China. But first I want to ask you about your tweet. I can't resist. A recent tweet from you, on your Twitter account, says, Barack Obama played golf yesterday, now he heads to a 10-day vacation in Martha's Vineyard, nice work ethic.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, the fact is, he takes more vacations than any human being I've ever seen. They used to complain about George Bush, but I understand he's already exceeded George Bush and we're not even through the year. So he likes vacation.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What does -- I mean, obviously, that doesn't sound a -- send a good message if, indeed, the American people think that he likes a, quote, "vacation."
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I mean, it sends a bad message. Here we have a country that really is going to hell in a handbasket. Let's not kid ourselves. What's happening to this country is horrible. All over the world, they're talking about it. And we have a president that's constantly -- whether it's Martha's Vineyard or someplace else, constantly on vacation.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, all the time he's on vacation! So I think it sends a very, very bad message. We have to work in this country to bring it back.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Does he get any credit from you on the fact that right now, he's on a tour around three states, in Minnesota, he landed today. He's going to Iowa, Illinois to -- apparently not to layout a financial plan but to listen to what people have to say?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it's also a fund-raising tour. And he's trying to raise funds. In the meantime, he's using a beautiful Boeing 747 as the aircraft that -- you know, the aircraft of choice. And I think it's pretty sad where the taxpayer is paying for his trips to raise money because, really, what he's doing is fundraiser.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And what he's been doing really quite well is raising funds, although inconceivable that people are putting up money. I just -- it's hard to believe that people are actually putting up money to get him reelected.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, if this is a campaign matter, the American people shouldn't pay for it. If it's official White House business, taxpayers should pay for it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I guess that's different. But basically, it's campaign. He's going to campaign and say what a wonderful job he's doing as president. I can't imagine that anybody believes that, necessarily. But he's using Air Force One. He's using a Boeing 747, the most expensive plane you can fly, just about. And why isn't his campaign paying for this?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Really, why doesn't his campaign pay for a Boeing 747? I think it's very unfair.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, well, on the trip, he's been asked about whether or not -- he's given a lot of speeches, but one of the big questions is whether the members of Congress should be called back to Washington. And today he said -- this is a quote from his -- one of his speeches today, "It's time for the games to stop.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Some folks were asking me, Well, why don't you call Congress back? And I said I don't think it'll make people feel real encouraged that we have Congress come back and all they're doing is arguing again."
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think that's all leadership. They wouldn't be arguing if we had the proper leader. And we should have Congress come back. I also heard him say he wants the Congress to go and talk to their people so when they come back, they know what to say and how do people feel. They know what to say! They don't have to spend a month-and-a-half and two months at home with their people.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They know already. They know without spending any time. The country needs leadership. We're not getting that leadership from President Obama.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Is there anything that he's doing right now about being a leader that you agree with?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I mean, the only thing I can give him credit for is campaigning. He's a good campaigner, not a great campaigner because Hillary almost beat him, frankly, after a big lead. But he's a good campaigner. He's a good fund-raiser. And I give him credit for that. As far as leading the country, I mean, the country is being led into oblivion.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, now the other issue that I wanted to talk to you about, and that's the news breaking over the weekend that when Usama bin Laden was killed on May 2nd, that of course, we had a disabled stealth helicopter left behind, and now the news that Pakistan let China look at the stealth helicopter and presumably will do reverse engineering and now they're light-years ahead in their technologies from us.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it's not hard to believe because, again, it's leadership. I mean, we allow countries to take advantage, whether it's OPEC, OPEC nations, whether it's China, certainly Pakistan. But you look at Pakistan -- we give them hundreds of billions of dollars. They do nothing for us. You look at China, they're ripping us like nobody has ever ripped us before, other than, of course, OPEC.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The OPEC nations are really doing a number. So I mean, oil should right now, with this bad economy, be at $30 a barrel. It's at close to $90. I mean, it should be at $30. If the free market were there, if these didn't sit around a table, oil would right now be at $30 a barrel, which is what it should be, and it's at -- it will soon be over $90. And by the way, if it goes unchecked, it'll be up to $100 and $110, and here we go again.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And you know, part of the problem the country has -- every time we start to make a little progress, the OPEC guys sit around the table and they say, Oh, they're making a little money, let's take it from them. So they raise the price of fuel. It's such a big factor. They raise the price of fuel. So we have to do something.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We need people that know what they're doing.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, the helicopter -- obviously, we want our military to get out of there quickly when the helicopter was disabled on May 2nd. I mean, I don't know if they could have blown it up. I assume that that was considered and rejected and they got out of there. Leaving that helicopter, that stealth helicopter, behind was something, apparently, we had to do. But once it's left behind, is there anything, in your mind, we should have done to prevent the Pakistanis from showing the Chinese?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think we should have had people over there. I think we should have called ahead the head of Pakistan and say, We don't want anyone seeing that helicopter. Too bad. I guess it hit the back, the back hit a wall. It's too bad that happened to -- you know, too bad it happened. But certainly, we should have let Pakistan know that we don't want anyone looking, whether it's them or China.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But what's happened, and from a friend of mine who's very good at this stuff -- he tells me that we spent billions of dollars on this stealth technology, and China gets it for nothing. It's hard to believe. So Pakistan gave it to China. China, as usual, got it for a bargain price. The United States is the loser, as always.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Obviously, you don't think that President Obama is being a leader. Take a look at the Republican -- at least right now, the group that are running for president or still in the run. What -- who's got the leadership that you like, admire?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I know a lot of them. I know Michele Bachmann. She came to Trump Tower about a month ago. She was great. She was a wonderful person. I mean, we had a great time. I don't know if Sarah Palin's running. I really like her a lot. I mean, I think she's a very good woman. We had the famous pizza incident, where we had pizza and I was using a fork and...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What's the difference between the two for you?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There's not that much difference. They're strong. They get unfairly maligned by the media. And I was watching this weekend on "Meet the Press" -- I watched Michele just get absolutely -- she was so badly treated on "Meet the Press." I watched that.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> In what way?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Just unfairly. I mean, the way the group went after her, it was so unfair. Michele was so unfairly treated. I've never seen -- I don't think I've seen anything like it. And that's what happens to Sarah Palin also. So...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> And did Hillary Clinton... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think Bachmann has done well. I don't think Hillary's treated the same way. I like Hillary, too. She's a friend of mine. I think that the way Ms. Bachmann's been treated, the way Ms. Palin's been treated -- I think they've been treated very, very unfairly by the press.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know. I mean, you ask me. They're conservative women. And I think that's probably why.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, now, take -- Governor Perry has now jumped in the race. Does that change the dynamics? And what do you think of him in terms of leadership? And I realize it's early on. There's a lot of information that we need to learn as the months go on.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's very early. I think that he is a good man. I've known him over the years. I spoke to him two days ago. He called me on something. I think he's really serious. I think he's going to do a good job. I think he's going to be a force. I don't actually know Romney. The one I don't know is Romney. But I think that -- I think that Perry's going to do a good job.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> How come you don't know Romney? I mean...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know. He never calls.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You're both big businessmen!
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Honestly, he's the only one that doesn't call.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Never call?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know. I spoke to him years ago, but I never -- you know, hey, Sarah Palin calls. Michele Bachmann calls. Romney doesn't call. So that's OK.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> What does that mean?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, that means probably he doesn't like me or I shouldn't like him. I don't know. It's not about that. It's really about replacing Obama. It really is about replacing Obama. You have to get -- this country is going to be in trouble like it's never been before. It already is. You need great leadership. You need somebody that's going to stop the constant rip-off of the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We can't afford this anymore. The world is ripping us off. I think the biggest single problem that we have is that the world, from a business standpoint, is ripping us off. We're like patsies. We're like the big bully that gets beat up. The world is taking advantage of the United States. Countries like Colombia made $4 billion last year against the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now they want a new trade pact where they make more. And we have these characters negotiating. I don't know, do they know anything about it? We have some of the greatest businessmen in the world. In my opinion, the greatest. If we'd put individual incredible people, and which I know 25 -- I know the 25 best.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I could give you a list. And if we took our great business leaders and put them in charge of China, one, somebody else in charge of Japan, you look at what's going on, of course, Japan now has their own problems. But you look at India where -- the outsourcing. You call up American Express, you want to find out about your credit card.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's very possible you're talking to somebody from India. Why aren't you talking to somebody from Alabama or from Iowa or from many other places, or from New York? The country is being ripped off and ripped to shreds by every single country that we do business with. The worst abuser is China, but I guess even maybe worse than them are the OPEC nations as a whole because nobody has abused the United States like OPEC.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And certain other countries, by the way, have been abused by OPEC to a large extent. But second to OPEC would be China. And if we don't stop that, we're not going to have a country.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I asked you about the difference between Governor Palin and Representative Bachmann. I don't to be sexist, just [Inaudible] the two women against each other, but I'm curious in terms of even leadership skills or what you look for, even, like, a Representative Michele Bachmann, who won the straw poll over the weekend -- I mean, how do -- how do her leadership skills translate into being effective, and how do you compare it to the men?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, it's very interesting because Michele Bachmann was in Trump Tower one month ago. She -- I was very impressed with her, I have to tell you.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, not just her views. I just thought her demeanor was absolutely great. Her way was wonderful. I thought she was terrific. And I think she ran a fantastic campaign thus far. And people that were taking her lightly are not taking her so lightly anymore. Sarah Palin, we know. The question with Sarah is whether or not she's going to run.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And I personally think no. And yet there are a lot of people that like her. You look at polls, and she's very popular in the polls, and certainly in the Republican Party polls. So I just don't know whether or not she's going to run.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> How about the men? How -- I mean, bring the men into this discussion.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I think Pawlenty was great that he dropped out. It was time. I think he missed his opportunity when they gave him during the first debate the softball question about "Romney care" and he refused to answer the way he did the day before. So I think that was a positive that he's out. You have some very good people, but it's very early to see.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You have to see how do they handle the heat, how do they handle the scrutiny and the pressure. I think it's very, very early to say. Romney, I don't -- you know, I mean, I know some very negative things about Romney. The state wasn't exactly doing great, Massachusetts, when he was governor. But maybe there are reasons for that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Popularity-wise, he wasn't the most popular governor in this country. Now, Rick Perry has a couple of pretty good sound bites because jobs in Texas -- I mean, then they say, Well, they weren't great jobs. Jobs are jobs, at this point. And he did a very effective -- and he's been an effective governor of Texas.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Some of the other folks -- I mean, I really get a kick out of Ron Paul. I really like a lot of what he says. You can't like everything, but I like a lot of what he says. I think he's going to have a hard time, but I sort of, you know, really understand a lot of what he's saying. And a lot of what he's saying is not incorrect.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> How about Speaker Gingrich?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, you know, I have a lot of respect for him, but it's just not resonating. And he's a member of my club in Washington. I have a great club on the Potomac, Trump National, and I really like him. I think he's been treated very harshly. If you go to "Meet the Press" again, I thought his answer was really made into a disaster, when perhaps it wasn't perfect, but it wasn't a disastrous answer.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So he got very badly hit there. I think he's a really smart guy. Doesn't seem to be catching on.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Senator Rick Santorum?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, when you're a senator and you're a sitting senator and you lose your election in Pennsylvania by 19 percent, I don't think you should be running for president. So I think -- you know, he's just obviously not catching on.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Today, one last question. Warren Buffet had an op-ed in "The New York Times." And he says that the super-wealthy are paying -- I think he said he's paying 17 percent income tax, while many Americans are paying profoundly more than that. He says that, basically, the super-rich aren't getting taxed enough.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> You're a rich guy. What do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I have a lot of respect for Warren Buffett. I like him. I think just think that everybody sort of has different feelings. You can all have -- I have rich people that think he's right. I have many rich people that says they're not going to work anymore, and you know, they're going to move to other countries and they're going to do other things.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So you know, there are lots of different sides to that argument. I do think this. When ExxonMobil, which is this monster company making a fortune, and in cahoots -- there's no question about it in my mind -- with OPEC, which is, again, our number one abuser -- when ExxonMobil is paying very little tax, which they are, and when ExxonMobil and the other oil companies are being subsidized by the United States government, I think that's ridiculous.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> How does that happen? Because, I mean, I don't know anyone who thinks that a rich company, rich or poor people, nobody thinks that a rich company should be paying no taxes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, to think that if Exxon had to pay some tax they would stop looking for oil is ridiculous. But when you think of it, many of those companies -- and I'm not just blaming Exxon, but many of those companies are in cahoots with OPEC. That's how OPEC gets rid of their oil. And to think that we're subsidizing some of the biggest oil companies in the world and giving them money, actually, in addition to paying low tax, I think they should be paying a lot of tax.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> I said one last question, but I do have one more. It was reported I the last couple days that the unemployment rate for teens in the District of Columbia is north of 50 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's a very frightening number, if you look at it. It's a horrible number. It's a very sad thing. I feel very badly about it. I saw that number. This country -- look, all of our problems can be solved with a great economy. If we can get this economy roaring again, which it should be, if we can get the world to stop taking advantage of us, which they are, if we can get fuel down to $30, as opposed to $90 and $100, and it'll be $150 because we have nobody talking -- if we can get this country going again, and the economy really good again, all of a sudden, Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security -- people aren't even going to be discussing it anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They'll be solid as a rock. That's what we have to be doing. But we have to get the world from ripping us off. They are just ripping us, Greta. And unless we get them to stop -- and it's real easy to do it. Unless we get them to stop, we can never have a great country again.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> All right, assume we did, though. How do you inspire the teens who are sitting around and don't have the jobs and might feel quite discouraged?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, all of a sudden, you'll have jobs because the country...
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> But will they be -- will they be inspired?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I hope so. I mean, that's the other thing about a president. One thing I thought about Obama -- and I was all for him. When he got elected, he won, I wanted him to be a great president. I wanted him to be the greatest president. And one thing I thought about him when he got elected was that he would be an inspirational president.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He'd be a cheerleader for the country. He's really not. He's really turned out to be the opposite. I thought that the one thing he really had was he'd be a great cheerleader. He's not a great cheerleader. If anything, he's a negative person. He talks about the Republicans and the Democrats and it is Congress's fault and it's everybody's fault but his own.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's a negative person. And I really thought he was going to be totally inspirational. He's not.
<Greta Van Susteren> <Neutral> Donald, thank you. Nice to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thank you very much.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> On CLOSE UP this morning, Donald Trump. Thursday was a big day for the New York real estate tycoon. He authorized the formation of a presidential exploratory committee and last night had dinner with the man who's encouraging him to run, Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura. When we sat down this week, I asked him whether he thought his reputation would hurt him. The reputation of Donald Trump, the man who dates a different woman every year.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't do that. I mean, I -- I've been with a number of women, but it's been over a fairly long period of time. I've had great relationships with women. The fact that...
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> You've called them your Achilles heel.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The fact that my women are more beautiful than Warren Beatty's women, I guess a lot of people have a problem with that. But I don't call it an Achil -- I say I don't drink, I don't smoke, I never had a drug in my life. I never had a drug, I never had a glass of alcohol. I never had a cup of coffee.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Why? Why did you never...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I do go out with beautiful women.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Do -- why did you never have a drink?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have a brother -- had a brother -- who -- who was a very, very heavy drinker. And he passed away, and -- and really the cause of that was from alcoholism. I mean, he was truly -- and he was a great influence on my life because he used to look at me, at a young age -- he was 10 years older than I -- and he'd look at me and say, 'Don't ever, ever drink.' Because he knew he had a problem. This was in the formative years. And...
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> How old were you when he died?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...he'd also said 'Don't smoke. If I ever catch you with a cigarette, I'll go wild.' And you know, somehow, it just had an im -- because I saw he was having a problem. He was an incredible guy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was a handsome guy, the best personality of all. He was just -- he had it all. But he was stuck on booze and he smoked.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Smoked like crazy. I mean, they were two terrible things and he couldn't shake it. And you know, it's a drug. They're both terrible drugs. And you know, I'd like to see the lawyers start going after the alcohol companies the way they went after the cigarette companies because I think alcohol is a much greater detriment than it -- than cigarettes. And I think cigarettes stink. But I do have, on the other hand, I mean, we all have our little vices. And I do go out with women. But that's not so bad, is it?
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Any skeletons, do you think, Donald, that -- I mean, if you decide to run, you know that your background is going to be examined with a fine-tooth comb. Is there anything that you can think of that you'd like to look at me and say, 'Matt, let me admit it right now. Because -- let's get it on the table, because I don't want it to come out six months from now'?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I mean, wouldn't you love that? But the fact is...
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...that we could -- we could have a really good deal here. But, you know, I've been a very public figure, in a sense. I've been more public than the so-called public figures. And I think everything is known about me. If I go some place, if I -- if I sneak into a room someplace, it's written about. So you know, you really pretty much know what you're getting. I think you know what you're getting with me much more so than most of the politicians that you deal with. And I wouldn't be doing this. I mean, there -- there really is nothing in the closets. Of course, reporters can make things up, and as you know, they do, because they're a vile lot. But there is...
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> The whole lot?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, not the whole lot. There's some tremendously talented and wonderful people. I mean, Maureen Dowd is great at the Times and other people are terrific. And you know, they're terrific. But at the same time, you deal -- I -- there's so much scum out there, it's unbelievable. Some of them are so bad. I mean, they write stories telling me, 'We know the story's false, but, Donald, it's going to be great.'
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Let me point out a little contradiction here. Earlier in the interview, you're telling me -- you're quoting me a poll from the National Enquirer. Donald, I mean, that would fit in that category, wouldn't it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I -- hey, excuse me. I mean, I don't want to defend the National Enquirer, but they got the awards for the O.J. Simpson coverage and everything else over all of you characters. I mean, you know, the National Enquirer has done an amazing job. And they do. It's the largest thing there is. I guess they have six million readers or something. And when they do a poll, in many respects, that represents more to me than when some guy that doesn't like me does a poll and he asks a question in a way that nobody could possibly say yes.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> One thing we know about you -- gambling. You're a major player in the gambling industry.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> What happens to your gambling holdings if you decide to run for president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd probably have to do something with a trust or put it in trust. I'm the biggest in Atlantic City by far. And you know, we're doing spectacular business in Atlantic City at the Trump Taj Mahal and all the places. And I'd probably have to put that in trust.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Taxes. You want to see a break. You want to see a cut?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> How big?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A substantial cut. I think that...
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> To who?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> To -- really the -- not to my guys. Not to the wealthy people who are really the people that dislike me the most, in all fairness, except for the ones that know me. But, really, I'd like to see a cut for the middle classes and -- and really the lower-income people. And it should be very, very substantial. Along the lines of maybe even greater than the Republican suggestion.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Paid for from the surplus?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Paid for by trade deficits that now are staggering. Where I look at Korea and some of these countries that are ripping us so badly, it's unbelievable. Paid for very easily by that.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> NAFTA, big failure in your opinion?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't like NAFTA. I've never been in favor of NAFTA. The good economy -- the current economy we have makes it look OK. But I've never been a fan of NAFTA.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> But you think you'd be pretty good sitting down across the table during some trade negotiations, don't you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I'd be the best. I mean, who's better than -- I mean, look, that would be my strength. And this country would take in lots of money from lots of foreign countries that have been ripping us off so badly. When you look at what Japan has done to us over the years, it's frightening.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Yeah, but I mean, if you're elected president, that's not something you can just walk up and say on your first day -- in your inaugural address, you can't say, 'Look at Japan, they've been ripping us off for years.'
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at countries like France that do nothing for the world and they only take. I mean, they -- the worst team player that I've ever seen is France. And so many of these countries -- and then they want so much from us. There are many countries and the trade deficits are huge. And believe me, you wouldn't have trade deficits when I got finished. And I wouldn't do it personally. But do I know the people? Do I know the negotiators? And...
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> I can see your first world tour as president, there'd be no one there to meet you at the airports all over the world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They might not want to meet me. But they'd -- they'd listen. They get away with murder. They just don't respect us. At least, they'd respect us, and they'd pay their fair share.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Let's talk about health care. Bill Bradley, Al Gore, have both come up with universal health care programs. I think Mr. Bradley's would cost about $ 65 billion every year. What do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's great. I think you have to take care of the sick. I think you have to take care of people that are not able to take care of themselves. Otherwise, what's the purpose of even having the country? You have to take care of the sick. So I'm all for it. Universal and everything else. Health care -- I'm very, very conservative, but I'm very liberal when it comes to health care and social.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Your lifestyle. Why would you want to trade this in? I mean you love the parties. You like the fast lane. You like making money. The presidency doesn't pay a lot. It probably would barely cover your country club bill. Why trade this in?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I'm the one candidate running that really has a lot to lose. Because I'm the biggest developer in New York by far, I've done better than anybody else in the hottest city there is, which is New York City. And I'd be stopping that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I love it. I'm building a 90-story building opposite the United Nations. I'm doing the General Motors, where your competitors are going to move into a nice studio very soon.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They have the best location of all. And you know, I'm doing all of these things and I'm really loving it and I'm having fun doing it. And I'm the best at it. And I'm the only one that's in there. If I'm some politician I'd say, 'Hey, I'm this,' or Pat Buchanan, I mean, he goes off Crossfire.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Every time I bring the presidency up, Donald, you -- you keep attaching business terms to it. You keep talking about it -- 'What I could do negotiating. What I could do with this group.'
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But that's a big thing, Matt. When you look at our trade deficits...
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> But I haven't heard you talk -- what should the job -- what should the office mean in terms of what should it stand for? What are the morals that should be attached to it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it should stand for spirit in this country, which we don't have. I mean, we've been decimated for the last four years with Monica and that Linda Tripp who is the world's worst. I mean, I look at Linda Tripp, she's like, just the worst. And -- and Paula Jones and all -- I mean...
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Did you think the president should be impeached?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think Ken Starr's a lunatic. I really think that Ken Starr is a disaster. I hated the way the president handled it. He could have said, 'Look, I don't want to discuss it.' I've seen politicians in New York that are scoundrels get away with that for years. 'I don't talk about my personal life.' They've made a living off not talking about -- he should have done that. Instead, he had to lie.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Should he have been impeached?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He had to lie. I'm glad it worked out the way it did. But it was a long and terrible process. I -- I really think that Ken Starr was terrible. But I think the president handled it terribly. And it's a shame, because he could have gone down as a very good and even great president. It's a shame.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Didn't you say one time about the whole scandal what bothered you most was Monica was unattractive?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I didn't say that. I said that he certainly could have picked a better candidate. And I mean that. And you mean that. And everybody means that. They'll say, 'Oh, it's controversial, Trump.' In the meantime, everybody's saying, 'Why?' I mean, why was that? Somebody said to me that if he would have had an affair with a supermodel, he would have been everybody's hero. But, of course, I would never say a thing like that.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Running mate. If you decide to go with this, who would be the ideal running mate for Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I think Oprah would be great.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Seriously.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think that -- probably that would be serious, actually. There are numerous people that would be good running mates. I -- I think that you'd have five or six people that would be actually great running mates. And I think I could convince them to run. If I decide to do this, I will have a great running mate.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> What's it going to take to make you decide to do this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll be deciding sometime early next year, and I think there's only one really important thing, and that's if I can win. Not if I can get the Reform Party because I believe I can get the Reform Party. It's really if I can win.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I can win, then -- you know, look, the Reform Party has a huge obstacle. You have Democrats and you have Republicans. And you have 25 or 30 percent of the people are going to vote for one or the other or both, no matter what, no matter who's running.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So you're building this huge obstacle against hundreds of years of tradition and everything else. So I think the Reform Party candidate's at a huge disadvantage. If the economy is bad at the time of the election -- and you know, we have a long way to go, and lots of things can happen -- the Reform Party candidate would, if it's the right candidate, have a good chance. If it's Pat Buchanan, there's no chance. He'll get a hard-core group of wackos. But the Reform Party candidate, if it's the right candidate, would have a good chance of winning the election, depending a little bit on the economy at the time of the election.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Another boring interview.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Just a boring interview. Nice seeing you.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> You, too. Donald Trump. It's now 7:17. Here's Katie.
