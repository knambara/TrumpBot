<Bret Baier> <Positive> Good evening from the Scranton Cultural Center in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Tonight, the battle for the White House comes to the Keystone State. Good evening. I'm Bret Baier.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> And I'm Martha MacCallum. Great to be here tonight. Pennsylvania, of course, was critical in securing President Trump's victory in 2016. And it is a state that he may need again this November.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> This comes as the Democratic field hoping to challenge him is narrowing. Only two major candidates remain, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> President Trump has already held rallies across the country, touting record jobs, new trade deals, and an overall strong economy.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> So, will that message resonate here, as he looks to become the first Republican since Ronald Reagan to win Pennsylvania twice?
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> Ladies and gentlemen, President Donald Trump. [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Whoa! [Applause, Cheering] Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi, Bret.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> Mr. President, thanks for being here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nice to be invited. [Crosstalk]
<Bret Baier> <Positive> Nice to see you again.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> Thank you for being here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> Thank you.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> Great to have you. [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you. [Applause, Cheering] Whoa. Thank you. So great.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> Well, you got a great crowd here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nice audience.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> Nice crowd. [Applause, Cheering]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> Terrific crowd here tonight. Thank you so much, everybody.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> We would love to get into a lot of questions tonight.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> And there are a lot of good questions from residents here in Scranton, who will want to talk about big issues.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> So, we are going to jump right in with the first questioner from our audience. Thank you again, Mr. President, for being here tonight.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you very much.
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> Katherine Pugh is joining us. She's an undecided voter. And she has a question for President Trump. Katherine?
<Question> <Negative> Mr. President, at the outset of the coronavirus, your administration's response seemed to some as being confusing or minimizing. What plans are being considered on a federal level for the possibility of a long-term disruption from the novel coronavirus?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, actually, we are giving -- I think really given tremendous marks -- you look at Gallup poll, you look at other polls, for the way we have handled it. And one of the things I did is, I closed down the borders to China and to other areas that are very badly affected, and really having a lot of troubles, I mean, countries and areas of countries that have had a lot of problem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I closed them down very early, against the advice of almost everybody. And we have been given rave reviews. And that's why we have only right now 11 -- it's a lot of people, but it's still 11 people, versus tremendous numbers of thousands of people that have died all over the world. We have 11. We have 149 cases as of this moment.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This morning, it was 129. And I just see you -- right now, it's about 149 cases. There are 100,000 cases all over the world. So we're really given tremendous marks for having made the decision. And that was a decision I made to close down the borders, so that people from China, where we take in thousands and thousands of people a day, they stopped coming in very early, weeks ahead of where they normally would have been stopped.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Bret Baier> <Negative> Mr. President, you have said you want to take politics out of dealing with this crisis.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Bret Baier> <Negative> But in the White House yesterday, you said that about the testing kits and the delay, you blamed President Obama.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't blame anybody. I want to get everybody to understand, they made some decisions which were not good decisions. We inherited decisions that they made. And that's fine.
<Bret Baier> <Neutral> As far as regulations?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We undid -- yes. We undid some of the regulations that were made that made it very difficult. But I'm not blaming anybody. It just seems that the Democrats, some of them, I must say -- and you know it better than anybody, Bret -- it's become much better. But some of the Democrats have said, no matter what -- if we found a cure, and everybody's better tomorrow morning at nine o'clock, they would say, he's done a terrible job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's just automatic. How is the president doing? Oh, terrible, terrible. They don't mean it. And we have done a great job. Again, we have gotten the highest poll numbers of anybody for this kind of a thing. And it's -- and the other thing, I'm working with phenomenal people, with CDC and all of the people involved.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Mike Pence is doing a fantastic job. I mean, Mike Pence is working 20 hours a day or more on this, and really doing a fantastic job.
<Bret Baier> <Negative> I guess the critics say that, why wait until the testing issue became a crisis before dealing with it? If you wanted to change the regulations, why not change them either when you took office or when you first learned of the virus in January? For example, South Korea really got their act together right away.
<Bret Baier> <Neutral> That's what they say.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, when you say take office, we just learned about this a very short while ago.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> Sure, but -- or when you learned about the virus in January.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know, but you're not going to be thinking -- I'm thinking about a lot of other things too, like...
<Bret Baier> <Positive> Sure, yes, yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... like trade and millions of other things. I mean, we are doing some job with the economy and all. So, I'm not thinking about this. But as soon as I heard that China had a problem, I said, what's going on with China? How many people are coming in? Nobody but me asked that question. And you know better than -- again, you know, you both know that I closed the borders very early.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we were given A-pluses for that.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> And you were given applause for that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, saved a lot of lives.
<Bret Baier> <Neutral> But I'm just talking about the testing -- the testing kits.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the testing, we did it -- as soon as we found out that it was a problem, we did it. It's not the kind of a thing you say, gee, I just got elected. Let's do some testing on this. They had some bad decisions. Some bad decisions were made. We corrected those decisions.
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> So, obviously, you care a lot about the economy. And we are seeing some impacts. It is kind of surprising how many conferences are being shut down, and meetings are being canceled, and flights. A lot of flights have been canceled. Even the James Bond movie, they're delaying because of coronavirus. I'm wondering what you think is the long-term -- over the course of the year, Wall Street says that they don't expect U.S. companies to have any growth in 2020, which is pretty surprising.
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> What's the impact on the economy and also potentially on your reelection?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think people are viewing us as having done a very good job. What we have to do is do a very professional job. Nobody is blaming us for the virus, nobody. I mean, I haven't heard that, even from some of the so-called enemies or whatever you want to call them. They're not blaming us.
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This started in China. How it started, there is question, but thousands and thousands of cases in China. And it infiltrated to almost 100 countries right now.
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> But I'm not talking about the handling of it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody is blaming me.
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> Excuse me. I don't mean to interrupt. But I'm just asking about in terms of things you can't control, right, the impact on the economy, and that potentially that could -- if people feel like the economy is turning around, that that could be an election issue as you go into it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, we were set to hit 30,000 on the Dow. This is a number that nobody ever even came close to. And, already, we have the number. And even though it's down 10 or 11 percent, it's still the highest it's ever been by far. It certainly might have an impact. At the same time, I have to say, people are now staying in the United States, spending their money in the U.S. And I like that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have been after that for a long time. You know that. I have been saying, let's stay in the U.S., spend your money here. And they're doing that. They sort of enforced doing that. We met with the airline companies yesterday. They're doing a fantastic job. And they are just not flying to areas that have a big problem.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it's going to all work out. Everybody has to be calm. It's all going to work out.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> But, to Katherine's original question, there is a long-term plan if it lasts longer than we think?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sure. We could have a very long-term plan. We hope that doesn't happen. But we're -- we have plans for every single possibility. And I think that's what we have to do. We hope it doesn't last too long.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> We want to get to audience questions. Robert is a Trump supporter. He does have a question about rhetoric here in the campaign. Robert.
<Question> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you so much for returning back to Northeastern Pennsylvania.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good. Thank you.
<Question> <Positive> I have been a big supporter of you for the duration.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Question> <Positive> And you every -- for everything that you have done for this country and continue to do for this country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Question> <Negative> Unfortunately, insult politics have become a staple of this political environment.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Question> <Negative> Joe Biden has suggested to take you out back behind the gym and fight you. Maxine Waters has a low I.Q. Could there be a way that we can deliver your message without the controversial rhetoric, in efforts to reunite this country during these divisive times?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have to tell you, I think -- I appreciate the question. I think the country is far more united than people think. And, ultimately, what is uniting the country is success. And we're having more success than we have ever had. We got hit with the virus really three weeks ago, if you think about it, I guess.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's when we first started really to see some possible effects. But even despite that, the country, we are having the greatest year. We had -- last year was the greatest year we have ever had economically. And I think the way we unite is really through success. But when they hit us, we have to hit back.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I feel that. I mean, there's two ways of doing it, turning your cheek. But I wouldn't be sitting up here if I turned my cheek. If I said, OK, let them just keep hitting at me, and I won't do it, they're not interviewing me right now. They're interviewing somebody else. Maybe they won't even be doing that, because if they don't get ratings, they don't interview anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Laughter] That, I have learned. [Applause, Laughter] But you know what? You can't turn your cheek. I mean, we get hit. [Applause] Thank you. [Crosstalk] We get hit so hard. And we have a media that is, I say, to a large extent, it's a part of the Democrat Party. It really is. It's terrible. It's unfair.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I call it fake news. I have used that. And people are using that, I guess, all over the world right now. And that's the way it is. We have to fight back. If we don't fight back, you won't be a fan of mine very long. But I appreciate the question. Thank you. [Applause]
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. [Applause]
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> So, I -- speaking -- speaking of rhetoric, I want you -- to ask you to listen to this.
<Chuck Schumer> <Negative> [Begin Video Clip] I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price. Now, I should not have used the words I used yesterday. They didn't come out the way I intended to. [End Video Clip]
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> So, going over some of the response to all of that, President Trump, some of your critics are saying, well, President Trump has also gone after liberal judges, and that Chuck Schumer...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You mean they're blaming me for Schumer?
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> No. [Laughter]
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> Well, they're saying that, then he came out... [Applause, Cheering]
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> So, he made sort of an apology there. [Applause, Cheering]
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> Do you ever -- do you think that you should make any apology for your -- what you have said about liberal judges, or not?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, look, I mean, we had a justice come out and criticize me badly. And I just responded to what she said. I had it twice. And when you look at -- I had a very harsh criticism, as you know, Justice Ginsburg, during the -- just before a debate during the election, as I was getting elected. She came out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She had to apologize. It was a terrible thing she said. She should have never been allowed to say it. But if they say something to me, I'm not allowed to say back? You had another justice say something that was somewhat derogatory. And all I did was respond. But I didn't respond like Schumer. Schumer, that was a physical thing, in my opinion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He tried to say, oh, well, that has to do with the election. That had nothing to do with the election, the way he said, we're going to hit back, like you have never seen before? That was a real intimidation. And the best you can say is, they're trying to intimidate, so that the judges vote -- so the justices vote their way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's no good either. But that was a physical -- that was really -- if a Republican did what Schumer did, they'd be in jail right now, I'll tell you right now. [Applause]
<Bret Baier> <Positive> Mr. President, just follow up on that really quickly. Chief Justice Roberts obviously put out a statement and really rebuked Senator Schumer for those words. The last time he put out one of these rare statements, it was about you and the federal judge that you called an Obama judge. So, to Martha's question, is there something about apologies on both sides when dealing with justices or judges?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, I have to state the facts. I'm not threatening anybody physically. But if we have an Obama judge, we don't do very well. Now, we have appointed 220 federal judges, the most, I think, in history. It's a record. It's a record. Because -- because, number one, Mitch McConnell did a great job, but the Republicans did a great job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But the bottom line is, President Obama gave me 142 openings when I first got there. Normally, you would have -- there's never been anything like that. Normally, you would have no opening. Now, you say he's a great president. The most important thing you have to do, I say, is the military, but a lot of people say is judges and justices of the Supreme Court.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> President Obama gave us 142. It's unheard of. If you have one, it's like you got lucky -- had 142. We're up to 220 federal judges and court of appeals judges, two Supreme Court justices. I mean, it's incredible. But we were going -- if you go to the Ninth Circuit, if you go certain places, it's almost impossible to win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I was surprised at Justice Roberts. And I have a lot of respect for him. I like him personally. I have a lot of respect. But I think that could have been left unsaid, because a lot of people, a lot of very top legal minds disagreed with him when he said it. Now I'm just talking about the facts. I'm talking about sort of the facts of life, that's the way it is.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> Well let's get back to our questions, our next question is from David Hines, he's a Democrat who decided to vote for you in 2016.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good.
<Question> <Positive> Mr. President, welcome back to Scranton.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, David.
<Question> <Negative> Everyone supports protecting the environment, but the EPA seems too focused on complex regulations, fines, fees, and lawsuits. What can you do to lead the EPA to focus more on proactive compliance instead of punitive enforcement to protect the environment?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> David, I love the question because our EPA is much different. We're very tough, but we get things done, and we're taking regulations off like nobody's ever seen. And I say very simply, I want to have the cleanest air on the planet. I want to have the most crystal clear beautiful water on the planet. And our conditions now are much better than they were three years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know very well David, because you're into the world of regulation -- I think it was maybe one of the biggest things we've done. I've cut regulations more than any president -- whether they're eight years, four years or one case quite a bit more than eight years. I cut more than any other president in the history of our country, and I did it in less than three years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So it's a great question. The EPA was -- this is why I was able to get the country going, because so many jobs were stopped, by not only EPA, so many other agencies where you'd have to go get 11 different permits for essentially the same thing. I opened up LNG plants in Louisiana where they were for years -- for 10, 12, 14 years and longer trying to get permits -- they couldn't get permits.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I got them built. A $10 billion plant in Louisiana. They Keystone XL pipeline, I gave it -- in my first week I got approval. The Dakota Access pipeline, I got the approval -- 48,000 jobs. And frankly, it's more environmentally -- you know, it's better than having the train going up and down tracks, and you don't know what happens with the train -- plenty of bad things happen with those trains.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Here you're underground, environmentally better. So I think it's a great question. We're really -- one of the reasons the economy is so strong is because of what we did with regulations. If the other side -- we'll call it the other side, affectionately, got in they would have made regulations much, much tougher.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> Well that's it, we're going to…
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> I want to ask him…
<Bret Baier> <Positive> Oh, thank you. They're talking about the rain tax here in Pennsylvania.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> I want to ask David, actually a follow-up question, because you are really the typical voter, I think you were -- you were a lifelong Democrat who crossed over and voted for President Trump in 2016 in areas like we are in right now in Lackawanna County. So you know, obviously now Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders -- whoever it is, is going to try to get your vote back.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> So I'm just -- I am curious, is there anything or any issue that they could answer for you that would change your mind, do you think?
<Question> <Positive> I'm focused on the economy, and on regulation and deregulation, and I like what's happened in the country in the last four years…
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Question> <Positive> …and I'm thankful for your efforts, sir…
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, David.
<Question> <Positive> …and I hope we can continue on that. [Applause]
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> Thank you. So the answer would be no, nothing would change your mind? No -- he's shaking his head, no, nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think they thought you were going to give them a different answer.
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> No, I wanted to hear because I do think it's very, I mean he is…
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That sounded like a setup question -- no, no, no David, you're my man. David's my man, I like that guy.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> No, I wanted -- you know what, I love that too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like that guy.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> I said, I'm very interested in voter, because we want to know what -- you know, how voters like you are going to vote next time around because we love to follow the story of the movement of the electoral. And I think it's fascinating that you -- you know, answered as you did.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well Martha, this area of Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania itself has the best numbers it's ever had. It's got the best economy it's ever had -- has the best unemployment numbers it's ever had. And Scranton has the lowest and best unemployment numbers they've -- and employment numbers too -- that they've ever had by far.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So you know, we're very happy about the job -- the people in Pennsylvania they're very happy with the job. You know, it was 30 years since a Republican won Pennsylvania, and based on results, I think we'll win it again very easily.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> Yeah. I mentioned… [Applause]
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> President Trump, I mentioned Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders because Elizabeth Warren dropped out today, and I want to know what your reaction to that was?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, if she's a true progressive, which probably she is -- she should have dropped out three days ago. It would have been a whole different race. Texas was close, she got votes -- she didn't do well, but she got a lot of votes -- far more than the difference. I think about Maine. Maine was almost a tie.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They had to wait a day and a half before they could even call it, it was so close. She, I guess, came in third, and it was, you know, a very distant third. But she got a lot of votes. Maine would have gone to -- I think he would have gotten everything, right? Bernie Sanders would have won five, six, seven states -- would have won Minnesota, would have won at least another two or three states.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So when you look at it, she did him no favors. That was not a good friendship. That was -- we started to see that during the debates, by the way, that one became unhinged.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you know, if she would have gone out -- she didn't even have to endorse him. If she weren't -- if she just dropped out of the race without an endorsement, he would have won a tremendous number of states that he lost. You know, he lost states by not very much. And she got enough votes that it would have made a big difference.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think he would be leading by a lot right now, had she not been in the race.
<Bret Baier> <Negative> You know, tonight you're in the boyhood home, obviously of Joe Biden, who is sort of like a phoenix from the ashes in this Democratic race. And tonight looks likely that he could get the Democratic nomination. Now Democrats insist that you were impeached because you were trying to damage Joe Biden, were you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, it was a fake impeachment. [Applause] We had 100 -- think of it, of the Republicans in the House. We had 107 -- 196 votes in favor, zero from the Republicans, zero against. We picked up three Democrat votes on top of that. And we had one Democrat -- was so angry by it that he left the party, became a Republican, which I think is a first time because he left a majority and went in to a minority.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Van Drew. And it was a whole fake deal. And everybody knows that. I made a phone call, it was a perfect phone call, there was nothing wrong with it. And they said, let's impeach. Now the real back story is when the phony whistleblower – who's a total phony -- he heard the call supposedly, you know, through somebody -- through the informant.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You notice the way everybody disappeared once -- thank goodness I had a transcriber -- we had more than one. Thank goodness we had that call transcribed, because the transcripts of the call reveal that it was a perfect call. By that time they were already talking about impeachment, and they were going by a phony whistleblower rendition of a call that didn't exist.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Just like Adam Schiff, he goes before Congress and he starts talking about eight quid pro quos, and don't call me I'll call you. Well that's a mob expression. Don't call me, I'll -- and everybody's saying that's a terrible call. He made it up -- it was totally made up. And I said, oh good, we'll sue him, we'll take him down.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then I find out he's got immunity because he made it in Congress. It should almost be the opposite. You should almost have to be more honest if you're in Congress. [Applause]
<Bret Baier> <Negative> Do you think Biden is damaged? Do you think he's damaged?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that Biden has been damaged, yeah. A lot of people -- I saw a couple of statements, very strong statements by very respected people in your world saying they aimed at Trump, but they took Biden down. And really that's what happened, when you think. Because you look at the son -- here's a guy, didn't have a job, was unfortunately, sadly -- the military was a very sad experience for him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He goes out, he gets $3 million plus $183,000 a month to be a board member of a company that a lot of people said was corrupt. Worse -- just as bad, China -- I just made a great China deal. China is paying us billions and billions of dollars because of what I did to them with tariffs. Billions of dollars -- I mean, to a point where my farmers are in love with me because I took some of that money, gave it to them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Applause] But his son walks out of China with a billion and a half dollars for a fund. Now a billion and a half dollars for a fund, meaning he's going to make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year and much more than that.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> So you want to face Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders, that's my question?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll tell you, I was all set for Bernie, because I thought it was going to happen. And you know how we get ready for things, right? So mentally I'm all set for Bernie -- communist, I had everything down, he's a -- I was all set. [Applause] And then we have this crazy thing that happened, right? On Tuesday which he thought was Thursday.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Laughter] But he also said 150 million people were killed with guns, and he was running for the United States Senate. Support me, I'm running for the United States -- there's something going on there. But I was all set -- I was all set. And, you know, when I focus and we all focus, sometimes you do well and some people choke.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I watched mini Mike choke. When mini Mike was hit by a very mean woman, he said get me off this stage -- just get me off. And that wasn't a pretty sight to be -- but I was all set to take on Bernie. I was ready, and then all of a sudden they say, guess what. I went to the first lady, who people love. I go in to the first lady -- [Applause] -- and I said -- I said, he just won Texas, he just won, you know, et cetera, et cetera.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And by the way, so close. It was a whole different thing because of her. So now I'm ready for Bernie, and now all of a sudden I have a whole different -- you know, it's a whole different deal -- two very different people. I think in a certain way Bernie would be tougher, because he's got a base. It's a much smaller base than my base.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think a lot of my people are here because -- and I did nothing to do that -- but we have a lot of support in Pennsylvania. And I think we have a lot of support everywhere, look at the rallies -- look at the rallies. [Applause] But I was all set -- I was all set for Bernie, I was ready to go. And then I say, you know, I don't think I'm running against Bernie, I think it's going to be very hard for him to come back.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> We'll cover it. Many more questions to come -- healthcare, also the economy, immigration. Please stay with us on this special town hall.
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> We'll be right back.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> Welcome back everybody to our town hall with President Trump. Let's go right to Audrey who has a question for President Trump. Audrey? Right here -- here we go, hi Audrey.
<Question> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you -- Pennsylvania thanks you, Bucks County thanks you for everything you're doing for our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Question> <Positive> We look at your energy, and it makes me get up and say, if he can do it, I can definitely get up and do everything I've got to do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Question> <Negative> I want to say, Republicans have failed to come up with an alternative plan to Obamacare, how do you plan to rally the Republicans around a plan, and what would be included in that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, that's a great question and very important -- healthcare, and I think it's probably the thing that I'm most disappointed that I haven't been able to say what a good job we've done. I haven't been able to tell what a great job we've done. First of all, I got rid of the individual mandate, which was the worst part of Obamacare.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's where you paid a fortune not to pay for horrible and -- healthcare and insurance. And it had a tremendous impact. Preexisting conditions, 100 percent, we take care of. But we have many healthcare plans now, where it's 60 percent, even 65 percent less expensive than Obamacare. It's better than Obamacare.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And what we really have left is the carcass of Obamacare, or you could call it new healthcare, because, without preexisting, without -- without the whole thing with the individual mandate, it's a whole different ball game. It's a much different -- it's a much different plan. And what we'd like to do is totally kill it, but come up before we do that with something that's great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What we have done is, we have really managed Obamacare, the remaining portion -- we got rid of the bad part -- but the remaining portion really well. And before I got involved, you know what was happening with the rates on Obamacare, they were going up at levels that nobody's ever seen before. We are managing it. And I had a decision to make.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This was very important. I said to my people -- and we have great people -- Seema, Azar, I mean, great people that are so good at it. I said, you know, I have a little problem. Do we manage it great until we get something much better? Or do we manage it poorly, and say, Obamacare is horrible? And I said, we have got to do the right thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have got to manage it really, really good. So, it's not great healthcare, but we're managing it fantastically. And you don't see all those stories about the rates going through the roof anymore because we know what we're doing. At the same time, we want to get you really fantastic healthcare. If we can win back the House, we will be able to do that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have to win back the House, keep the Senate, keep the White House. [Applause, Cheering] And we will be able to do it. Thank you. Thank you for the question. [Applause]
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> So, Mr. President, I just want to follow up quickly on that, because the issue of preexisting conditions...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> ... you say you're going to protect them.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> But your administration is also fighting Obamacare in the courts. So how do you -- how do you promise people that you're going to protect them, based on that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that's what I said. That's what I said, yes. We want to terminate Obamacare because it's bad. Look, we're running it really well, but we know it's defective. It's very defective. We got rid of the worst part. And that was a very important thing. Getting rid of the individual mandate was a very important thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we -- we want to get something. If we can get the House, you will have the best healthcare and health insurance anywhere on the planet. But we have to get the House back. Now, that means we have to hold the Senate, we have to get the House, we have to obviously keep the White House. But what we're doing is managing it really well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, it's a case, it's called Texas versus -- you understand, it's Texas is suing. They want to terminate it. But everybody there is also saying and everybody -- we have our great senator from Pennsylvania. Thank you very much, Pat, for being here. [Applause] And -- and Pat Toomey. And -- but very important.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And our -- by the way, our great congressmen, I have to say they were warriors, right, real warriors in terms of the fake impeachment, I will tell you that. [Applause] But -- so Texas is trying -- and it's Texas and many states. They're trying to terminate. But they want to put something that's much better.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're terminating it to put much better. And they have all pledged that preexisting conditions 100 percent taken care of.
<Bret Baier> <Negative> Immigration.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Bret Baier> <Neutral> The next question is from Jennifer. And she has a question about this issue.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi.
<Question> <Positive> Hi. Thank you, Mr. President. This is truly an honor and one of the best days of my life. Just don't tell my husband.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Wow. [Laughter]
<Question> <Negative> And I want to know, how are you going to control the illegal immigration without support from the Democratic Party?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, it's been hard, but we have done it incredibly. It could have been -- we have things called loopholes. And the loopholes are terrible, like lottery, where you give lotteries. They pick lotteries, and they have people coming into our country. We have ended catch and release. We have right now 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border, saying that, if they don't do that, we're going to have to be very tough on Mexico.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they're doing it, because our soldiers aren't allowed to be there for a lot of reasons. And we're very politically correct as a nation. Mexico perhaps is slightly less politically correct. And we have the best numbers that we have had in many, many months. We have had -- I guess it's now nine or 10 months where the numbers are way down.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we can keep them down. But we need the wall. And, most importantly, the wall is way under construction. We're up to 129 miles already. Where we have a wall, by the way, nobody's coming through, practically nobody. We will have, by early next year, almost 500 miles of wall. And once we have that wall, it's going to stop drugs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Applause, Cheering] It's going to stop big percentages of everything coming in, OK? [Applause] And we're really, really doing a job. And, by the way, it's very important, because I could have done a much less expensive version. I could have done a much easier version, but a version that people would get over very easily.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have seen the people that get caught on top. It's very high and very powerful. We are building exactly what border control -- what the Border Patrol wanted. They wanted a very specific wall. You had to be able to see through it to the other side. You want to see where the people -- I thought -- before I got involved, I said, I can build just a nice concrete plank wall, throw it up. That would be no good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It wouldn't work. We built the wall that everybody has been dreaming about in terms of law enforcement for many years. So, we're up to 129 miles. We will be at 500 miles in a very short distance. It's really moving up quickly. It's a big difference. Thank you. [Applause]
<Bret Baier> <Positive> A lot of questions, a lot of questions, by the way, about the wall. Also a lot of questions, Mr. President, about the national debt. Since being president, you have signed into law $4.7 trillion of debt, including $2.1 trillion of discretionary spending. I understand that you're spending on the military as well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's right.
<Bret Baier> <Negative> When you ran for president, at one point, you said that you would pay off the debt within eight years. So now we're about four years in, and the debt is up $3.5 trillion. That's about 18 percent. Republicans and Democrats obviously are not talking about the national debt a lot on Capitol Hill or on the campaign trail.
<Bret Baier> <Neutral> So, do you...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I talk about it.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> Do you care about the national debt?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do, very much. And I will always talk about it, because, to me, it's very important. Now, the good thing about the debt is, we're paying very little interest, almost nothing. This is a great interest climate. In fact, I want to refinance the debt. But I had to fix the military. The military was depleted.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Applause, Cheering] I had to fix the military. It's one thing to say -- it's one thing to say, gee, we did a good job on the debt, or, gee, we did a good job on the budget, and you have people from other countries running up the White House lawn, you know? Maybe they took over our country, but I did one hell of a job on the budget, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I had to fix the military, $2.5 trillion. We had to do other things. The country, when I took it over, was in very bad shape. Remember this. President Obama had -- he more than doubled -- he put more debt on than all of the other presidents of the United States combined. Combine all the debt of every other president.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I took it over. We had 20 -- we had $20 trillion worth of debt on the country, and actually more than that. But he -- and we had a lot of commitments for other things. And on top of it, you know, it's one thing you take over something, and you have debt. You have a building, you have debt. But the building is fixed up. The country was a mess.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We were in all these wars all over the place.
<Bret Baier> <Neutral> So, this would be a focus of a second term?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, absolutely. But when the trade deals kick in -- now, again, we were disturbed by what's going on with the virus, but that's going to be fine, and everybody -- it's going to be fine. But that was a disturbance. But I will say this, we -- when these -- when these trade deals kick in, and when all -- you know, the economy is the best economy we have ever had.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's nothing compared to what it's going to be when the trade deals kick in. [Applause]
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> But if you -- if you don't cut something in entitlements, you will never really deal with the debt.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, we will be cutting, but we're also going to have growth like you have never had before. We have never had growth like we're experiencing. We will be experiencing, when they kick in -- China, as an example, they didn't do anything with us. They're now spending $250 billion a year. And that's only for phase one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Phase two is going to be even more so. It's $250 billion. I just made a deal with Japan, where they're paying $40 billion. They never gave us anything. All they do is sell us cars for no tax coming into the -- to the country. South Korea, you know I have made a deal. And then I made the USMCA deal with Canada and Mexico, replacing the worst deal, which was made by -- by the way, which was made by Joe, OK? I didn't want to say sleepy Joe, because I want to be respected.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want to -- I want to respect him. [Laughter]
<Bret Baier> <Positive> But you got it in there anyway.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He looks like he's going to be a candidate. And I just say, how did that happen? [Laughter] So -- but, no, Joe Biden -- in all fairness, Joe Biden made a deal, NAFTA. He approved it. He was pushing it. It's the worst trade deal ever made. We're terminating NAFTA. We have the USMCA. China -- if we look at what happened, between China and Mexico and Canada, what they were doing to this country, how they were taking advantage of us, they were -- Canada was charging us 300 percent tariffs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now we have it really in good shape.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> All right. [Applause]
<Bret Baier> <Neutral> Mr. President, turning to foreign policy, John Sullivan has a question. John? There you are.
<Question> <Positive> Hi, Mr. President. Thanks for coming to Pennsylvania tonight.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Question> <Positive> So my question is, ever since you have taken office in January 2017, North Korea has been in the news, and it's on the minds of many Americans and...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Question> <Positive> ... just like myself. So, if you're elected again this year, what's your plan moving forward with what you have already done with North Korea?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think it's on the minds of too many Americans, to be honest with you, but it certainly -- it should be, OK? And it's good that it's on your mind, because it's big stuff. And they do have a lot of power, a lot of nuclear power. So I don't take credit for this. And maybe I should, maybe I shouldn't. But when I became president, I was told by President Obama, sitting in the Oval Office, in our -- probably our only meeting, essentially.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, that was enough for me. [Laughter] But I was told...
<Bret Baier> <Neutral> And you haven't talked to him since?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was at the funeral of President Bush, sat next to him. And I said, hello. And then I said, goodbye. [Laughter] That's about -- that's about it. No, I didn't like the -- I don't -- I didn't like the job he did. I didn't like the job that he and Biden did. I didn't like the position they put us in. I didn't like what he did to our military.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Our military -- we didn't even have a military. Our military was so depleted. [Applause] And I tell the story. And I hate to tell it, because it's embarrassing, but, right now, we have more ammunition than we have ever had. It's all over the place. [Applause] But when I -- when I -- we were having difficulty with a certain country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Remember, Donald Trump is going to start a war right away? Well, here it is, we're almost four years out. There's been no war, and we're respected again. But I was told by a general, sir, please don't do that. Why? We have no ammunition. This is the condition we were left in. When you look at so many different problems that we were left, I mean -- and with countries.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But he said, the biggest problem we have is North Korea. That's what you're alluding to. And I have a good relationship with him. I said, did you ever call him? The answer is, yes, he did. But I will tell you, I don't think they admit that. Maybe they do, but called many times. And Kim Jong-un didn't want to talk to him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And me, he wanted to talk to. And we met in Singapore. And we met in Vietnam. And I also went to the border, first person ever to walk over from -- et cetera, et cetera. [Applause] And we had -- we have a very good relationship, understanding. Let's see what happens. But, you know, the pundits say, isn't it terrible, what he's done?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's given -- I gave nothing. I gave nothing. The sanctions are on. They want to see if they can do something. But I haven't given anything. If the other side got in, you would right now be in a big war with North Korea. Maybe it would be over by now, but you would right -- almost immediately, you would have started.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if you remember the rhetoric at the beginning, that was very tough rhetoric. But that rhetoric got us to a place. And the Olympics became successful because of me in South Korea, because, all of a sudden, they called. They said, we would like to be -- participate. They didn't sell any tickets, because nobody wanted to go to the Olympics.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All of a sudden, North Korea calls up and says, we want to be a participant in the Olympics. Everybody fell off their seat. That was because of me. And, by the way, the president of South Korea gives total credit for that. So, it became successful. The bottom line is, I have a very good relationship with him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I cannot guarantee anything, but, for three years, we have spent nothing. We're getting sanctions, and we're not in war with North Korea, which is not bad. [Applause]
<Bret Baier> <Positive> All right, Mr. President, thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> We're going to take a quick break, squeeze one break in here. And when we come back, we're going to have more questions from the audience. And then we will have a lightning round for President Trump. [Applause]
<Bret Baier> <Positive> Welcome back to our town hall with President Trump in Scranton, Pennsylvania. We want to continue with foreign policy for a couple questions. You talked this week to the leader of the Taliban.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I did.
<Bret Baier> <Negative> And you said it was a good conversation, in which you said you both didn't want violence. However, on that same day, the Taliban launched some 50 attacks in Afghanistan, 40 of them in one province. There are many Americans really wondering -- and the U.S. struck back against the Taliban. There are many Americans wondering -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- very powerful.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> -- where the peace part of the Peace Plan is, and can you trust the Taliban?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So these are warriors. We've been there for 20 years. We're really serving more as a law enforcement group than a military group. We could win that war very easily but I don't feel like killing millions of people in order to do it. We don't want to do that, you don't want to do that, nobody wants to do that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People are tired, even the biggest hawks are tired of being there. I had a very good conversation with him. There was a group that formed. And again, you know they have many tribes and they have many different -- it's hard for one -- there's not like perfectly one control. I spoke to a certain man who is the leader, but the leader has not -- it's not the easiest leadership position.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> Structure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the structure is you know tribes all over the place. A tribe formed and a -- a group formed that was going to attack certain soldiers -- Afghan soldiers. And the military heard about it, and the military went and they took them out. That was it. I believe they really want to make a deal. I think after 19 -- actually going very close to 20 years, they're also tired of fighting, believe it or not.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But they are warriors, and they are fighters and that's what they've done for a thousand years. You know just ask -- ask the Soviet Union, which became Russia because of Afghanistan. You know, it's a tough place.
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> So given that, you have said that you want to, you know, end this. It's gone on for a long time. But what about the conditions on the ground, because, you know, General Mattis had a disagreement with you about pulling troops out of Syria and Afghanistan. If your generals tell you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I was right. I was so right.
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> If the generals say to you, Mr. President, we need more people not fewer people right now. What will you do?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Mattis said that, and I gave him more people for a short period of time and it didn't work out, and what we were doing is policing in -- [Crosstalk]
<Bret Baier> <Positive> But now with Afghanistan.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- Afghanistan. As far as Syria, I did pull them out. I pulled them out. We were -- we were securing the border between Turkey and Syria. I said why are we doing that? Turkey is big, Syria is fine; let them fight their own battles. What are we doing with our soldiers? Getting people killed. [Applause] Now, the one thing -- when I came in ISIS was all over Syria, all over Iraq.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we don't want them coming to us, and it was a mess. You understand that very well. And I knocked out 100 percent of the -- of the territorial caliphate. 100 percent. We knocked the whole thing out -- [Crosstalk]
<Martha MacCallum> <Neutral> But what about Afghanistan?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. But -- but just so you understand. So we knocked out the ISIS caliphate in vast amounts of the Middle East, and I did that fairly quickly when I came. Again, President Obama, it was all over the place. When I say we're not doing the borders, we did leave soldiers. We left soldiers because I kept the oil.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I was always against Iraq -- going into Iraq. I think it was one of the worst -- maybe the worst decision ever made. But I used to say, once they were in there, keep the oil. They never kept the oil. We have an oil area in -- near Syria and in Syria, we kept it. So the only soldiers I have over there, they're guarding the oil.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We kept the oil. So we kept the treasure. That's OK.
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> But if it takes more troops to keep the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan, is that something you would be willing to do or no?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, there's a big question about the government of Afghanistan. There's a big question about that whole situation in Afghanistan. We're getting along very well with everybody. We have to get our people back home. It's not fair. We're a police force over there. We're maintaining things. Eventually we have to leave.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We don't want to stay there for another 20 years. We don't want to stay there for 100 years. We want our people to come back home. [Applause]
<Bret Baier> <Neutral> All right. Lynette has our next question from the audience about division really in politics. Lynette.
<Question> <Negative> I'm sorry.
<Bret Baier> <Neutral> There you go.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi, Lynette.
<Question> <Positive> Hi, President Trump. I'm so happy to have you here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Question> <Negative> From the day you came down the escalator in Trump Towers I was on the Trump train.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like that. [Applause] I like you too. Thank you.
<Question> <Positive> And I -- I proudly wear my Trump pin every day of my life.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Great honor.
<Question> <Negative> My question is, we are so divided as a country. I have family members who do not speak to me and recently was told, if you support Trump you are no longer part of my life. How are you going to bring us together?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I -- I gave an answer before, success, but it's really a little bit more than that, because we've had great success, and there is a division, there's no question about it. Politicians have to be able to be civil. If they're not, you have to fight back. You have to. Otherwise we're not going to be -- there's a -- there's a movement on, and I call them the radical left Democrats, and it really is the radical left, because we have plenty of Democrats that are terrific and they want to see -- you know, let's get together, let's get things done.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There's so many things we could do. We've done a lot. We've done more than any administration in three years in the history of our country for the first three years. And I say it all the time and the press doesn't even dispute me and they would do that. But we could do even so much more. We talked about a great question on the border and the border question's true, but we should get rid of the loopholes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You can't do that without Democrat votes. I really believe we're going to win this next election, and when we do the other side's going to say, OK that's it, let's get along. I really believe that. But we have to win the election. Good question. [Applause]
<Bret Baier> <Positive> All right. Mr. President, we're going to do a quick lightning round here. Short questions, short answers ideally. This one goes back to coronavirus in the beginning. You are a self proclaimed germaphobe. In the campaign, before the campaign, you didn't like to shake hands. You changed that. What do doctors --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm not thrilled. [Laughter]
<Bret Baier> <Negative> Yes, yes. You're not thrilled. What do doctors tell you? Have you changed anything in the way that you operate?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So yes, it's a great question, because I've always felt, you know, I don't know from the time I was a young guy I -- you know, I always felt the concept wasn't good, and then you'd read a lot of medical reports, it's not good. Now especially they're saying -- by the way, if there was ever a time that you could convince people not to shake hands, this could be it. OK. This could be it. [Crosstalk]
<Bret Baier> <Neutral> So do an elbow or fist bump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know what I did -- you know what I did, I really -- I love the people of this country. You can't be a politician and not shake hands. People come in -- when I leave I'll be shaking hands with people. They want to shake your hand. They want to say hello. They want to hug you, they want to kiss you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't care. It doesn't -- you have to do that. If I went around, no, I don't shake -- can you imagine? I'm going to speak with a group of people and they like Trump and they come up; sir, thank you very -- I don't shake hands. It's over. I don't care how nicely you say it. The bottom line is I shake anybody's hand now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm proud of it. They're people that I love. They're people that I want to take care of. Now the concept of shaking hands since this -- you know, you're hearing a lot of stuff about trying not to shake hands. It hasn't stopped me at all but it is -- it is a little bit of a problem. But I got over it.
<Bret Baier> <Neutral> -- two weeks.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I was kidding. You know you're not supposed to -- I heard the other day you're not supposed to touch your face. So I went on camera and I said listen, I haven't touched my face in weeks. Now, obviously I'm kidding. I said and I miss my face. And one of the networks said he said he didn't touch his face and they show pictures.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So I don't know. These people.
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> So you have -- you have said, you know, about being president, I didn't have to do this, you wanted to do it. What about your old life? Is there any little thing that you miss about your old life?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I loved my old life. The day before I announced I was running for president that was the best period ever of my life. My company was the strongest it ever was, especially, you know, being in development and do real estate all over the world. I built a great company, but it was the strongest, because you have times when the markets go bad and then you have to fight and then the markets are good and you're doing great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was the strongest period of my life. It was sort of the best period of my entire life. And then I announced I was going to run for president. And you know the greatest day of your life, they say, is the day before you announce you're running for president. I don't know if anybody's ever heard that but they do say that about people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But in my case I won. You know I won. I saw as an example they were using numbers and they were saying how much various people spent to become president. And Bloomberg spent like $550 million. It was in of all places "The New York Times." And this guy, Steyer, we call him impeachment Tom. How did that work out?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not too good. Tom Steyer spent $250 million. Another one -- another one -- I know Steve Forbes spent a lot. A lot of people spent a lot of money and I was sort of in the middle. In fact this is your own money, I spent $70 million. And they said lost, lost, lost, lost, lost. Donald Trump became president of the United States, lost, lost -- and I said isn't that cool.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Isn't that cool. [Applause] You know. So, I love it. You know why I love it, because we are doing more than anybody can imagine. Even Right to Try. For years they wanted to have Right to Try, where we can use our medicines if somebody is terminally ill. So many things we're doing --
<Martha MacCallum> <Negative> But is there any little thing that you miss? You know, I mean -- I remember Michelle Obama said she missed, you know, sort of going shopping or walking down the aisles. I mean is there anything that you can't do now that you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, yes. I mean I can't walk down the street now, before I could. I was well known, and we had a very successful business, and even my show turned out to be a success. I had many top best sellers of things, you know.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> You were used to that. Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But -- but I could walk down the street, and I could actually walk into a store and it was, you know, fine. It was not like some nobody knew me, but it -- now, today if I ever suggested that to Secret Service -- you know, I think I'm going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue and let's go shopping. [Laughter] So it's a lot different.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So -- so I -- I do miss that. I miss that sort of free life. This is not a free life. But I love what we're doing because we're accomplishing more than anybody's ever -- I'm viewing it as we're saving this country. This country was going wrong. [Applause]
<Bret Baier> <Positive> Mr. President, very last question. Who -- who is your closest friend in Washington?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't want to say because I have a lot of close friends, I really do. You know I'm putting everybody in this fight. I get along great with our vice president. I keep hearing I'm replacing him. He's doing a phenomenal job. He's a great guy and a loyal guy, and he works so hard. Every day I read he's going to put this one, he's going to put that one, he's going to put -- if I did that would be a great act of disloyalty because he's been great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I speak to him a lot. But I speak to all of the senators a lot. I speak to all of the congressmen a lot. We have great people in Washington. And you have great Democrats too. I mean I speak to Democrats also, believe it or not. But we have great, great people in Washington, very smart people in Washington.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it's going to come together. It's going to come together, and it's going to be sooner than you think. [Applause]
<Bret Baier> <Positive> President Trump, we thank you very much. And thank you to our audience.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> Yes. Thank you very much, President Trump. Good to have you here tonight.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> I'll be back tomorrow for "Special Report."
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> Great to have you with us. Thank you very much.
<Bret Baier> <Neutral> Martha is on the other side of the break.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> So we're going to do "The Story" up on the balcony right after the break. So stick around for more. Thanks everyone.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> Good night everyone.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> Good night everyone.
<Bret Baier> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Martha MacCallum> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good to see you.
<Craig Wall> <Positive> Welcome to Chicago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Craig Wall> <Positive> Thank you for taking the time to talk with us
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. It's an honor.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nice crowd we have out there.
<Craig Wall> <Positive> Yeah. Mr. President, would you like to stand here, so you have the flag over your shoulder?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is good. Oh...
<Craig Wall> <Positive> You like that? Thank you.
<Craig Wall> <Negative> So, the last time you were in Chicago, you were supposed to come here March 2016. You were -- it have to be canceled due to protests. Why here and why now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the police asked me to speak and this is a nationwide conference, and it's my honor -- greatly honored to speak. We've gotten tremendous support from the police, and they've gotten it from me. So I'm speaking to the police.
<Craig Wall> <Neutral> And what's your message to the police?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's really something that I'm very proud of, what we've done over the years. We've given them tremendous equipment and material to work with, which previous administrations didn't do. Our numbers are great. Chicago numbers are not good at all, but the numbers outside of Chicago, throughout the country, have been fantastic.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In Chicago, the numbers are horrific. You know, what they're doing here is not -- not good. Whatever they're doing, they're not doing it right. But outside of Chicago, if you look at our crime numbers, they're way down.
<Craig Wall> <Negative> Why has Chicago been such a frequent target of criticism from you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well all you have to do is take a look at your numbers, where you have five and six hundred murders a year, and you have all of the problems that you've had, and it can be straightened out with proper management, and you need leadership. But it can be straightened out. Other cities have had big problems and they straightened it out.
<Craig Wall> <Negative> The superintendent said he would not attend your speech because of racial rhetoric and your stance on immigration. Should the superintendent be here?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there is no rhetoric. All I do is ask for people to do a good job. He doesn't do a good job. He should be here to be with other police so he can learn from them, because obviously what he's been doing has not been working.
<Craig Wall> <Negative> Outside, a lot of protesters, a lot of people who don't want you here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I haven't seen that I saw a lot of supporters outside, tremendous supporters. And it's a great place. It's a great city. I have big investments in Chicago -- you know it's a very special city, and it's a city, frankly, that needs work on crime, because when you look at what's going on, that's not emblematic of the city, when you look at what's taking place.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, hopefully they'll get their act together and straighten it out.
<Craig Wall> <Positive> They would say that crime numbers are down this year, that they've made progress.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sure, down from what? Down from the highest crime numbers we've ever had. So, you know, they're down a little bit, and they have to go down, not just a little bit. They have to go down many many times.
<Craig Wall> <Neutral> Does there need to be some federal intervention? You've spoke of that before.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, there well may be. I mean, we're looking at it very seriously, something we don't want to do, but we are looking at it. You can't have 70, 80, 90 shootings over a period of a week ,and people being killed all the time, constantly. So, we are looking at that very seriously, intervention.
<Craig Wall> <Negative> Where do you put the blame for all of this crime problem, because they would say here in Chicago, it's systemic. It's been going on for a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think it's systemic at all. It's not systemic. It's -- you need leadership at the mayor's level, and you need a police commissioner, police superintendent that can do the job, and obviously that's not what you have.
<Craig Wall> <Negative> The mayor here has said the police department will not cooperate with ICE. Is she damaging the relationship with the federal government?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's one of the reasons your crime numbers are so horrible in Chicago. It's a sanctuary city. We've had many -- but I'm going to be speaking about it in a minute. You've had many instances of horrible crime that wouldn't have taken place, except for the fact that this is a big, fat sanctuary city, and it's not good.
<Craig Wall> <Negative> Are you blaming the crime on illegal immigrants?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm blaming the crime on sanctuary city. I'm blaming it on a lack of leadership, and a police superintendent that obviously doesn't know too much about what he's doing.
<Craig Wall> <Negative> Rob Blagojevich has petitioned for your assistance. His wife has made frequent appearances on Fox News. Should Rod Blagojevich give up hope of a commutation or a pardon?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think he should. I think he was sentenced very harshly, and I don't know him, other than for a very brief period. I always found it to be very nice, but I think he was treated very harshly. Very, it was a very, very severe sentence, and there were a lot of people that disagree with that sentence.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, he should not at all give up hope at all. And we are looking at it.
<Craig Wall> <Negative> The mayor and the governor have been frequent critics of you, particularly on immigration and [Inaudible]. Is there any reason that they should have concerns about federal aid being hurt coming to Illinois or Chicago because of their criticisms of you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I will say this again, and not in terms of federal aid but the sanctuary city situation in Chicago is causing it to have lots of problems, and leadership is causing it to have lots of problems. But no, not in terms of federal aid, no. I'd just like to see them get their act together, because I love the city.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love this country, and I don't like to see murders and shootings constantly coming out of Chicago, especially when the rest of the country is doing so well.
<Craig Wall> <Negative> Would you consider removing your name from the Trump Tower here? There has been some talk about Washington, maybe that happening.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I would not consider that, no. I own the building. Why would I consider that? It's always been an asset. Now, frankly, we just -- we're doing a great job as President. Our numbers, we just had an all time high in the stock market today, again. The S&P just hit the all-time high. Highest in its history.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Unemployment is the lowest in history, just about, for almost every group. African-American, Asian American, Hispanic American. Lowest numbers ever. Best unemployment numbers, and the best employment numbers we've ever had. Our country's booming. Our military is strong. We just got al-Baghdadi, which President Obama was trying to get for a long time, and he was unable to get, and other people, they've been -- we should have been gotten a long time ago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We got him. No, the country is doing the best it's ever done, and we're very proud of it.
<Craig Wall> <Positive> Is there anything good you'd like to say about Chicago?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. It's a city with tremendous potential. It was a city that was a very safe city, and now it's not a very safe city. And they have to do something about it locally, and if they don't do it locally the federal government will step in.
<Craig Wall> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
<Question> <Negative> Stephen Paddock, the shooter in Las Vegas in 2017. The FBI just closed its investigation yesterday without determining any motive. But don't you think Americans deserve to know why so many people died in the worst mass shooting in modern history?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was a horrible event. He was a very, very sick person, obviously. It was very unusual in that there didn't seem to be your standard set of reasons as to why this would happen. I'm a little surprised that the report wasn't much longer but at the same time I can understand it. It was just a -- just a terrible thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They were unable to find a real reason other than, obviously, he was sick and they didn't know it. So, I was a little surprised and a lot disappointed that they weren't able to find the reason. Because you'd like to find a reason for that.
<Question> <Neutral> Were you following the developments through that case?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was watching it like everybody else. I thought it was horrible. I went to the hospital, I saw many of the victims and right after the event it was horrible. It was inconceivable. But he was a very sick person and nobody would've known it. Nobody had any idea. He had money -- or at least they think he had money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was a gambler, you know, you don't see too many gamblers that have money. I think they worked very hard. I will tell you they worked very hard on that case. They just were unable to find anything from all of the facts. Because I've looked at some of the things also and it was a very unusual case of a very sick person who just, people never saw that coming.
<Question> <Positive> Speaking of the FBI, sir, were you comfortable with the way and the force that was used against the raid in Roger Stone's house? Do you think that was appropriate for your FBI to be doing that in a white collar case?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought it was very unusual. You know, I've stayed out of that whole situation so that -- because there was no collusion whatsoever. There was no nothing done wrong and frankly, I could have waded in very early, I could have ended it very easily if I wanted to but just let it run its course. But I will say, like, I'm speaking for a lot of people that were very disappointed to see that go down that way, to see it happen where it was on camera, on top of it. That was a very, very disappointing scene --
<Question> <Positive> You thought it was unusual that CNN was there?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> — You have 29 people and you have armored vehicles and you had all of the other and, you know, many people know Roger, and Roger is not a person that they would have to worry about from that standpoint. I thought it was sad to see it.
<Question> <Negative> Would you ask the FBI to review its use of force, its militarization when it handles cases like this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's a good question for you to ask, and it's something I'll think about.
<Question> <Positive> One last question related to that. On the Paddock case, all of America was really interested to find out what happened there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Including me.
<Question> <Negative> Of course. And I wonder how many resources in the FBI were committed to the Paddock case versus committed to the Mueller investigation. How much money was spent? How many people were on those things? How do those two things compare?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What a great question that is. It's one of the better questions. I hope you're going to play your question because that is a very, very interesting -- you're talking about, I guess they're well over 30 million dollars now on this Russian collusion hoax, and everybody knows it's a hoax. They've spent all this money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nothing. No phone calls, no meetings, no nothing. You look at it, and you say, isn't that sad to have devoted this time, this energy over a -- you know, look, there's been numerous books written right now, including number one best sellers, calling it a "hoax." And it is very sad. That is very sad. By the way, to me, both very sad events.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But that is very interesting to ask, where you've had so many people killed, and so badly wounded, because I went to the hospital. You had people so badly wounded. People never talk about the wounded. The level of hurt and devastation for a whole lifetime. You know, many people just devastated for a lifetime.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They'll never be the same. And you look at that by comparison to the Russian hoax, it's a shame. The Russian witch hunt, it's a shame.
<Question> <Negative> Speaking of that, sir, Matt Whitaker came out I think a couple of days ago. He said that the Mueller probe seems to be wrapping up, generally. Has he communicated that to you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No, I haven't spoken to him about that. I would say that I think after almost two years it certainly should be. Process crimes or process, you know, questions, the answer is different than what you thought it might be and some people say they lost their memory or a lack of memory, which a lot of people can understand that too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I never spoke to him about that.
<Question> <Negative> So Whitaker or whoever is heading as the attorney general at the time will get to make a decision about releasing the report that Mueller sends him --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know what --
<Question> <Negative> Is that the kind of thing you'll sign off on if and when it comes to that decision?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They'll have to make their decision within the Justice Department. They will make the decision as to what they do. I could've taken a much different stance, I could've gotten involved in this, I could've terminated everything. I could've ended everything. I've chosen to stay out of it. But I had the right to, as you know, I had the right if I wanted to to end everything.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I could've just said, "that's enough." Many people thought that's what I should do.
<Question> <Negative> You know, Andrew McCarthy has made the case that the reason Comey was recommended to be fired by Rod Rosenstein is that he went out in public and he made a public indictment of Hillary Clinton without actually recommending a prosecution. In other words, he made a character indictment of her in the court of public opinion.
<Question> <Negative> In Andrew McCarthy's view, if this report comes out from Mueller and it does anything to try and go after you for any reason that doesn't have any criminality involved, that would be a disservice to you. That's not justice if the Justice Department is trying to say things to hurt your character but they don't have anything to do with criminality.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I never had anything to do with the Russians having to do with this. I ran a great campaign. I ran a campaign that now they say was better than that gentleman's campaign in the 1800s and we did a great job. And we got 306 to 223 and that's that. Won states that nobody thought were possible to win. Remember the expression, "he cannot get to 270." And we got way beyond 270. And I don't even say she ran a bad campaign.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I ran a very good campaign.
<Question> <Negative> Well the people who elected you are very interested in the immigration decision and what's going on with this negotiation. Republicans in charge of Congress for two years didn't get to your wall promise in Congress. How big of a roadblock to wall funding was Paul Ryan now that he's gone?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I was going to veto the omnibus bill and Paul told me in the strongest of language, "Please don't do that, we'll get you the wall." And I said, "I hope you mean that because I don't like this bill," although I love the bill for what it did for the military. And therefore, if it weren't for the military I would have vetoed it. Just so you understand, our military needed funding desperately.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Totally depleted. And this bill was great for the military. Had I vetoed it, you would never have gotten the numbers back that I got: $700 and $716 billion over the last two years. Which is substantially more -- much more than President Obama was able to get for the military. So that was a negative but a big factor as to why that was the reason I signed it. But another very big factor was the fact that Paul told me in the strongest of terms that, "please sign this and if you sign this we will get you that wall." Which is desperately needed by our country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Humanitarian crisis, trafficking, drugs, you know, everything -- people, criminals, gangs, so we need the wall. And then he went lame duck. And once he went lame duck it was just really an exercise in waving to people and the power was gone, so I was very disappointed. I was very disappointed in Paul because the wall was so desperately needed.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And it is. And I'll get the wall.
<Question> <Positive> Did he lie to you? Did he play you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to say he lied. I think he probably meant it at the time, I guess. I hope. So I don't call that lying. But when he went lame duck, meaning, he said he's not running again -- and it was very unusual because usually they'll do that sometime after an election and he didn't want to do that because it's somewhat misrepresenting and I understand that too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But maybe you don't run, okay? Maybe you just don't run. And he had an excellent person taking his place in Congress, he ran a great campaign, did a really good job. So Paul said, "please sign the omnibus bill." Now, in all fairness to Paul, I may have signed it anyway because it was so much more money than anyone ever thought possible for the military, and equal to the wall and maybe even greater than the wall was my promise to refurbish the military.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I made many statements, many promises. In fact, here are some of them, folks. But those are some of the things we've accomplished. VA choice, VA accountability -- you know, these are things that for decades and decades and I got a lot of these things. Tax cuts, regulation cuts by far the most that anybody's ever got, biggest tax cuts.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And that's why you look at the market -- we just hit over 25,000. We're back where we were, right? So anyway, that's the story.
<Question> <Negative> One thing that some conservatives are worried about is that you're prepared to give away some status for illegal immigrants in exchange for the things that you want. So when it comes to DACA, in these negotiations that are going on on Capitol Hill, how far are you willing to go there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I don't know if you saw -- you know, there was a couple of days ago, "he's going to give up DACA, he's going to —" First of all, it's not mine to give up right now because DACA is going to the Supreme Court, hopefully. But miraculously, and horribly, they lost DACA. This was a case that President Obama said, essentially, he doesn't have the right to sign.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But they went, as usual, to the Ninth Circuit and they won a case, they won an appeal, and now it's hopefully going to the Supreme Court soon because this is a very important case. We should win that case easily, you know, it should be won. Now, if it is won, then we'll talk about DACA but right now -- when that case was lost we were very close to making a deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then a judge in the Ninth Circuit agreed that President Obama, although President Obama didn't think he had a right to do it, he said that -- as soon as that was done, I said, "that's the end of that deal." We had a deal for some DACA -- for a lot of things. But we had a deal done and I said to people when that case was lost -- well, it wasn't lost permanently, I think we're going to ultimately win -- that's the time I want to talk about it.
<Question> <Positive> So DACA is tabled until the court resolves it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I said to people, I saw yesterday, "well, what about DACA," I said, "it's highly unlikely." I was tougher than anybody else on that. I could see doing something for DACA but I want to find out what the Supreme Court's gonna do first.
<Question> <Positive> Chuck Schumer said he doesn't want the White House playing a role in negotiations on Capitol Hill—
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't blame him.
<Question> <Neutral> How much of a role are you going to play?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because he doesn't want me to make the deal. He doesn't want to make me -- because my idea of a deal is different than other people's. Without our involvement a deal's not going to get done and I think we're going to -- look, that deal. Look, there are numerous things we could do, including declaring a national emergency where we have very good law on our side, including the fact that I'm already building a tremendous amount of wall.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People don't realize that. I'm going to be announcing the exact numbers but I'll have over a hundred miles of wall either built or under construction between new and renovated. Over a hundred miles. We have a tremendous amount of money right now to build a wall. We're building the wall. I'll be announcing some numbers on -- but in addition to that we declare a national emergency if this doesn't work out.
<Question> <Neutral> I believe you have a military base in Yuma, Arizona. Are you going to do some wall there? Is that the plan?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have, I believe, that area -- yes. We have a tremendous problem in that area. It's very interesting, California, you know, they always say, "don't build a wall," well, they were begging me to build a wall over in San Diego. The day I finished they said, "don't build a wall." But they were begging me to build the wall because people were pouring in through that border, through that area.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We built a brand new wall. That's not a renovated wall, that's a brand new wall. We took down the old wall, we built a brand new wall. It's fantastic, looks great, they did a great job, totally stopped everybody from coming in. The day we completed it California started saying, "don't build a wall, we don't want a wall." They want drones, right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Flying up around.
<Question> <Positive> You talked about the courts, sir. Are you keeping an eye right now on Justice Ginsburg's health?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, I hope that she's healthy, I hope she's happy, and I hope she lives for a long time.
<Question> <Positive> Would you commit to replacing her with somebody who was on that list -- somebody like Amy Barrett who a lot of conservatives have looked at?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I've been very religious. I've very much confined myself to that list, as you know. And that list has great people on it and I would say it's highly likely I would stay. I think one of the things --
<Question> <Neutral> But Amy Barrett would be a choice?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, she would certainly be a choice. I think anybody on that list would be a choice. They're great people. I've been told, and I don't know that that's true, I would be surprised if it's true, but a lot of people said that list was one of the reasons I won. Because, being a non-politician, where you don't have a record of choosing people, people just didn't know who I would choose.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And Supreme Court, especially for the Republican Party, it seems, was very, very important and I came up with the idea of a list of 20 and then I increased it to 25, 25 people and they're very outstanding people. I felt so badly that Justice Kavanaugh had to go through what he had to go through but now he's a Supreme Court justice and he's going to be a great one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Justice Gorsuch went through much easier and he's going to be a great one.
<Question> <Positive> And in that process you had to deal with a couple of Democratic senators: Kamala Harris, Dianne Feinstein. And the report is that you have agreed or the White House has agreed, your White House counsel, to giving Democrats a say in who gets to be on the Ninth Circuit. There's a Wall Street Journal editorial about this and so people like Erick Erickson have come out and have criticized this decision because they're saying you're basically giving up two seats on the Ninth Circuit when you're not renominating the people from before.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I know nothing about it. That I can tell you. I would not do it. I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do that. In fact, you can tell them for the first time, I will not do that. It's a false report. I've had many false reports from the Wall Street editorial board. Like, as an example, right now we're negotiating with China.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're doing very well. Wall Street -- they don't like tariffs. If we didn't have tariffs they wouldn't even be talking to us. They would not even be talking to us. You understand that?
<Question> <Negative> Well, on that issue, let me ask you about China. At the end of this, if there is not intellectual property protections in the deal, will you push the tariffs?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, what happens is that right now China's paying 25 percent on $50 billion worth of goods. Mostly high technology. And I was going to charge them 25 percent on $200 billion worth of goods and then I'd have $267 billion leftover where I'm not charging them anything. At their request, and subject to this deal until March 1st, I'm charging them 10 percent on 200 billion.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You've got the 50 and the 25, then you've got 200 and I'm charging them 10 percent until March 1st. After March 1st it will go up to 25 percent. So yeah, that's very important to me. You know, billions of dollars are being poured into our treasury. Billions. We never had five cents come into our treasury.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now we have billions of dollars and in addition, and very importantly… The president returns to the issue of the Ninth Circuit court.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Ninth Circuit is so much in one direction that you couldn't make that deal. Look, I've lost … the United States has lost so many cases in the Ninth Circuit and, you know, I had an argument -- a slight argument, which, I think was not too much of an argument -- with Justice Roberts about the Ninth Circuit.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I did that, what are we doing? We have to catch up because we are so far behind on the Ninth Circuit. So I would never make that deal. And I can tell you, if it is made I would end it, but it wasn't, you know, not that I know of. No, the answer is: I would not do that. You don't catch up by making those deals.
<Question> <Positive> Let me ask you about religious bigotry. I want to read a list to you first and then get your reaction because I think you're going to want to react to this. A number of high-profile Democrats have recently attacked people of faith for their religious beliefs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Terrible.
<Question> <Negative> You've got anti-Semitism in the leadership of the Women's March, sitting members of Congress who've expressed or condoned anti-Semitism, attacks on Second Lady Karen Pence for teaching at a Christian school, attacks by Democratic senators on your judicial nominees for being Catholic or members of the Knights of Columbus, attacks on the boys of Covington Catholic High School for being Catholic and Trump supporters.
<Question> <Negative> Does the Democratic Party have a crisis of bigotry and how should they handle it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's a crisis for our country because there's never been a time -- I saw where today, I believe it was a congressman, took "in God we trust" --
<Question> <Positive> "So help me God."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> "So help me God." Took the phrase off of a document. And I said, "Where are we going?" I think it's a terrible thing for our country and I think it's certainly a terrible thing for the Democrats because I don't think they're going to be able to get away with it.
<Question> <Negative> Another thing, sir, Virginia Govenor Northam actually right before this, suggested a mother who wants to have an abortion while in labor should instead be allowed to let her baby die after delivery if that's her choice. Do you think that would be infanticide?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I watched that this morning. I watched the person testifying and I felt it was terrible.
<Question> <Neutral> The Virginia delegate?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. Do you remember during the debate I said Hillary Clinton was willing to rip the baby out of the womb just prior to birth? And I used the term "rip'? That's what it is. That's what they're doing, it's terrible.
<Question> <Positive> Do you think this is an embrace by the Democrats of this type of abortion agenda?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think this is going to lift up the whole pro-life movement like maybe it's never been lifted before. And the pro-life movement is very much a 50-50, it's a very 50-50 issue. Actually it's gained a point or two over the years, but it's been very much 49-51 and vice-versa. I think this really will lift up the issue because people have never thought of it in those terms.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Cause she actually said, you know, the day of, virtually the day of birth.
<Question> <Neutral> Northam suggested that today too.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh did he? So he confirmed that?
<Question> <Neutral> And he's a pediatric neurosurgeon.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm surprised that he did that. I've met him a number of times. I'm surprised that he said that. I saw the woman do it -- who ever that was, was that the attorney general?
<Question> <Neutral> She's a delegate. Kathy Tran, a delegate in Virginia.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I was very, very surprised that they would say that and allow that.
<Question> <Positive> Could you give us an exclusive preview of the State of the Union? What can we expect? Who are the guests that are going to be in the gallery?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, in fact, we're making up a list very shortly. But I will say that some of them will be border-related, some of them will be people who have suffered very badly because we didn't do what we should've done in a very dangerous part of our country, and so that's going to be a part of it, absolutely. At the same time, the world is not doing well and we're going great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You look at the numbers, we're hitting highs. I get no credit for it. It's like, when do you ever hear them talking about -- we just hit 25,000 and you won't even hear a thing about it. If President Obama were there -- and don't forget, he was paying no interest. We're actually paying interest. You know, he was paying no interest.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He didn't have liquidity being drained out of the market in order to pay it down, which we have. How about 50 billion dollars a month? $50 billion a month. If I had a no interest, no liquidity situation with respect to the market, I mean, forget it. It would actually be incredible, the numbers. Big difference.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Tremendous difference.
<Question> <Positive> The Super Bowl this weekend, I just want to get you on that because you're an NFL fan. I'm just going to stick to the Patriots here for a second. What makes Kraft, Brady, and Belichick so much better than everybody else and how are they always back in the big game?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, it's talent, it's chemistry -- they have a great chemistry with each other -- I mean, I like all three of them, as you know, I'm very good friends with them. Coach Belichick endorsed me, you remember that? Belichick is so tough and Kraft is a great guy. The three of them they just have -- how good was Brady, I mean, the last game?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Not the last game, the last two games. Brady plays better under pressure than he does in a regular game. I mean, that last two minutes the way he was throwing the ball down the field -- they were bullets. And I've seen how hard that ball comes at you, those guys were doing a great job. They were catching that, you know?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That ball is whipped.
<Question> <Positive> Have you noticed that all of the kneeling basically stopped this year and the ratings went up and the revenue went up? Is there any part of you that says, "Yeah, I won that fight'?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I don't want to take credit for that. You know I get along very well with the NFL. I helped them in Canada, you know that story where they were having a dispute for many years with Canada. And as part of NAFTA, you know, the termination of NAFTA and the new -- but as part of NAFTA, which is now the USMCA, I was able to get their dispute settled because they're a great American company and I don't want great American companies to have problems.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> In fact, Commissioner Goodell called me and he thanked me, you know, they were working on that thing for years. It was having to do with the advertisements for the Super Bowl, it was a long-term problem and I got it solved. I think it's great what they did, it looks like it's straightened out. I think that may be famous last words, let's see what happens, but I think in the end it really worked out great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, you know what, their ratings went up along with -- as that problem went down, their ratings went up.
<Question> <Positive> So you're satisfied with Goodell's performance? You don't think he should go?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I think -- look, I think that worked out very well. I was very pleased that he called me to thank me for helping him with Canada and yeah, it looks good. And their games have really been good other than one call. It was a little bit -- I feel badly, it was a great state that voted for me, Louisiana. I feel very badly for Louisiana because that was maybe the worst call I've ever seen but I guess there's nothing they can do about that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you might say it, I feel badly for Louisiana.
<Question> <Positive> One final one on 2020 if you don't mind. Who is your dream candidate in 2020 to run against?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well so far a lot of them. I don't mind. I think that there's a lot of talk about -- it looks like Elizabeth Warren has not caught on like they thought she would. She fell into a trap. It's called the Pocahontas trap. There's so many of them. The truth is there are some I'd love to run against.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Thank you so much for joining us. Let's talk about priorities for a second term. Do you have anything left that you need to accomplish, in terms of campaign promises? And what are your priorities for a second term?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we have a lot of things. We've done, I think, more than anybody in three years. And now you know with regulation, tax cuts, and so many other things, we've rebuilt our military, $2.5 trillion on the military. But we have a military like we have never had before. We're going to be doing a middle-class tax cut, very big one.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to be doing that. We have to win the House. And I think we can. I think we will win the house. I think the whole hoax with the impeachment hoax, I call it, I think that -- it really helps us in terms of the House. So we'll be doing--
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Was that a tax cut for the middle class? Or would you just want to make that permanent?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no, I'm going to make a tax cut, and we're going to probably make the other permanent. It's got a long way to go, in all fairness, but we're going to make that permanent for the middle class, so we'll be doing that. We'll be announcing it over the next 90 days. That's to me very important. We have great health care initiatives coming up. We've done well with health care anyway.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We got rid of the individual mandate. And if you look at that, that was a big thing with Obamacare. That was the end of Obamacare. But that was a thing that people couldn't do. They couldn't afford it. They didn't want it. They were forced to pay a number and then not get health care. So we got rid of that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we've done really well with health care, but we're coming up with a plan that's going to be fantastic.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> What about in terms of your trade initiatives? You met with the European Commission president.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right, I did.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> What do you want Europe to do, buy more agriculture, in order for you to hold back on additional tariffs?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we -- we've made some great trade deals. The China deal is amazing, and we'll be starting Phase 2 very soon. And as you know, I left the tariffs, large -- 25 percent tariffs on because it's good to negotiate for the Phase 2. And they want to start Phase 2 right away. And so do I. So we'll start that right away.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> USMCA, great. We made the $40 billion deal with Japan, also. We said we won't do the tariffs, but we'll do 40, and Japan is a tremendous buyer now. South Korea. But we find, I find that the European Union is tougher to deal with than anybody. They've taken advantage of our country for many, many years. It was actually formed for the purpose of taking advantage of the United States, if you really think about it. But they've taken advantage, have been very, very tough to deal with.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But for me, they're very easy to deal with. And I told them, I met with the new head, who's very nice. And I dealt with Jean-Claude for a long time. And I didn't want to do China and Europe at the same time. I said, let me finish China first, and when I finish with China -- and, frankly, Mexico and Canada -- as soon as we do that, I'll do Europe.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They've been very difficult to deal with. But ultimately it'll be very easy, because if we can't make a deal, we'll have to put a 25 percent tariff on the cars, 20 percent or 25 percent, and I'm sure they're going to make a deal. So I don't want to alarm--
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Did you get any sense that she's going to do it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have to do it. I mean, they have no choice. They really have no choice. And I say this not as a wise guy or anything else. They've treated us very badly. We've lost $150 billion over a period of many years. We've lost $150 billion with them a year, in terms of deficits. They have to do it. It's the right thing to do, and they have to do it. And I did tell her, I said, look, I know we're going to make a deal, but if we don't, we're going to have to tariff your cars and other things coming into the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they want to have, like, an emergency meeting, and we'll -- we'll make a deal.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Let me ask you--
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, without that, zero chance, just so you understand, zero. But with that, 100 percent. Well, let me say 99 percent.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Let me ask you about 2020. Bernie is leading in New Hampshire, Biden is up in Iowa, and then there's Michael Bloomberg. Who do you think the Democrat nominee will be?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, mini Mike has spent a fortune. OK, I knew him very well. He used to like me a lot until I ran for office. And he thought, you know, they all think that -- they all thought Mike was going to be secretary of state if Hillary won. And that was the deal they supposedly made. And Terry McAuliffe was going to get it, so they sort of gave him false information.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But he's spending a lot of money, but it's having no impact. I'm having right now my best poll numbers -- as you know, you see them -- because of the impeachment hoax, my poll numbers are the highest they've ever been, because it's a phony deal. And the fundraising for the Republican Party is by far the most -- I mean, the numbers are bigger than any numbers that we've ever raised.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think they're bigger than -- at this point, bigger than any numbers any party has ever raised. And that's because of this phony deal on the impeachment.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> But at the same time, Bloomberg says he's willing to spend up to $2 billion to take you down. He said he would convict if he was in the Senate. What kind of an impact does that kind of money have?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, right now it doesn't have any impact. He's wasting his money. He's not going to win, because he can't. He's a terrible speaker. He can't speak properly. And he's -- he's not a charismatic guy. He's got money. He'll spend as much money as he can. And he's got a real thing. I mean, he's got some kind of a -- he's got some kind of a deal going.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he wants to spend a lot. So I'm making a lot of my broadcaster friends wealthy. That's the way I look. But it's had no impact. He's actually gone down in the polls. You look at his recent ones that came out today, Bloomberg's gone down in the polls. I don't know exactly, but I can tell you, if you go, before I ran for office, take a look at some of his statements.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd love to give them to you. He said the best things about me. He said great things about me. And I've helped him in the past. But he seems to have a problem. And that's OK. I think that the other ones, crazy Bernie, I don't know, maybe he's really surging. He really is. Elizabeth Warren seems to be going in the other way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And Joe Biden doesn't seem to be doing too well, from the standpoint he can't -- it'll be very interesting to see whether or not he makes it.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Hillary Clinton, about Bernie, she said, No one likes him, no one wants to work with him, he gets nothing done. Pelosi has him, of course, in jury duty at the impeachment trial. Are they colluding against Bernie again?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they are. They're really trying to take it away from him again. I mean, when Hillary says nobody likes him, nobody likes her. That's why she lost. I mean, nobody liked her. She had every advantage. She had this big machine behind her. She had the Obama. She had -- she had everybody behind. And it wasn't even close.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at 306 to 223. She's the one that people don't like. I mean, I think if -- if I had my choice, in terms of personality, I might take him over her. But I probably would take neither.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Onto the impeachment--
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And Biden is going to be interesting, because he can't string together a sentence. And if he makes it, if he makes it, you know, he seems to have a little bit of an edge right now, but it's rapidly disappearing. Bernie is surging. There's no question about it. And Bernie seems to be the one the party wants.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But my attitude is whoever it is, it is.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Mr. President, I couldn't believe that the impeachment was still going on as we were getting here this morning.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Crazy.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Your critics are up to the same. They say that Pat Cipollone is now a material witness. They're accusing McConnell of colluding with you to cover a crime. Are you concerned about getting a fair trial?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These people are crazy. They have gone totally nuts. McConnell, they talk -- they say things about him with Russia. Jill Stein -- now, I don't know Jill Stein, Green Party, they said Jill Stein is an agent of Russia. Then they said Tulsi Gabbard -- I don't know her, but I know one thing. She's not an agent of Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they said she was an agent of Russia. That's what they said about me. These are people are crazy. They've gone nuts. And they've gone far left. And Nancy is a woman who -- I call her nervous Nancy for a reason. She doesn't know what the hell's happening. She's lost her party. She didn't want to do this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we're doing very well. Look, you know, I always say very simple, read the transcripts. And then on top of reading the transcripts, speak to the president of Ukraine or the foreign minister who say nothing happened. Absolutely nothing happened.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> So what's the best--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Remember this, they got their money and they got it early. But I want to make sure, also, in addition to collusion, there's something else I'm always stressing. Why isn't Germany and France and U.K. and all these other countries in Europe that are much more affected than us, why aren't they paying something?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're always like the fools. So I asked that question.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> So you got them to pay more?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I got them to -- well, you look at what I did with NATO, $530 billion more. Not total. More. My biggest fan is Stoltenberg, secretary general. The head of--
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> He'll be on the show.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, you know, you should put him on the show.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> What do you think is the best outcome here? Is the best outcome a quick dismissal? Or is the best outcome to get the witnesses, get the vote for witnesses, and then be acquitted by the American people?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I guess acquittal fairly quickly. These people are liars. They're horrible. I watched this guy, shifty Schiff, I watched him for a little while. So yesterday I had meetings all over the place. But in between meetings, I'd get to see. And I'd watch his lies. I watch where they've actually played a rerun, which they shouldn't even do, it was so bad, where he goes before Congress, and he makes a statement that I made, and it was a total fraud.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I never made it.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> He made it up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's why I released the conversation, because if I didn't release it, people would have said that I made the statement that he made. This guy is a fraud. He's a corrupt politician. So I think, you know, I'm pretty much going to leave that to the senators. I have a lot of respect for them. I can say this, the Republican Party has never been so unified.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You've seen that, too, 195 or 196 to nothing in the House, twice, three Democrats came to our side, and I think we're going to have some people come to our side. You know, it's a hoax. It's a terrible thing. And it's a hoax.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> And it's been going on from the get-go.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's been going on from before I ran.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> But it's not ending. Al Green said, look, if we don't get him this time, we'll keep going. Maxine Waters said the same thing. We'll try to impeach him again. How are you going to deal with this for the rest of your presidency that they're constantly trying to take you down?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I think most people are now agreeing, nobody has done so much as I've done in the first three years of a presidency. I don't think anyone -- when you look at regulations, tax cuts, rebuilding the military, taking care of the vets, right to try, right to try is such a big deal. So many things I've done, nobody has done anything like it. You look at what we're doing on the environment.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're doing great on the environment. You know, people don't want to talk about it. But nobody has done what we've done. And that's despite having this constant harangue. I saw Maxine Waters, what she said. I saw this guy, Green, he said, we have to impeach him because we can't beat him. He said we can't beat him, we have to impeach him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's the only way we're going to win. Can you imagine this is what I have? This is what I have. But you know what? We'll just keep it going.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> You have a 51-vote threshold in the Senate. Do you think there are four Republicans in the Senate that will vote for witnesses?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. We'll have to see what happens. I hope that they realize it's a hoax. I think it would be very bad for the Republican Party if we lost that great unity that we have right now. Some of them are running, and I think it would be very bad for them, but I want them to do what they feel is best in their own heart.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But nothing was done wrong. I think you'd know that better than anybody. I want to thank you, because you have been so incredible on this issue, and I want to thank you. I know it's not appropriate to thank you. You're a great journalist and you're a great reporter, and congratulations on six more years.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They did a fantastic -- I don't care what they pay you, they got -- they made a good deal.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> We've been seeking truth, and that's why the show is doing so well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, you have -- you have been --
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Because people know that I've been honest about this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- you have been so fantastic. I appreciate it.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> It's because of this issue. There is some question about this China deal. Some people feel like it doesn't have enough teeth. That, you know, you're not going to be able to get China to stop stealing intellectual property, it's their culture.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But here's what I do -- OK, you ready? We have tremendous policing -- we have a policing aspect to this deal that's the strongest anybody's ever had. If that happens, I'll terminate the deal. If that happens, I'll charge tremendous tariffs. We have tremendous policing action, so it could happen. I mean, I'm not a baby, I understand China has a reputation for being cute, but I have a great relationship with President Xi. I don't think it's going to happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think already we've seen a difference on the Fentanyl, I said you -- it's not in the deal, but I said, you've got to do me a favor. You've got to stop the Fentanyl. And now they're putting criminal penalties on people that deal in Fentanyl, which they never had before and it's having a big impact. If it -- if this happens, what you're saying could happen, of course it can always happen.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We can terminate or we can put tremendous tariffs on them.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> What about investing in Chinese companies? There's this proposal for the Thrift Fund, $500 billion of 401(k) money for military, past and present. They want 10 percent of that, $50 billion, to mimic the MSCI index, the Morgan Stanley World Index. There's Chinese companies in there, some of them are sanctioned, some of those companies are making weaponry for the Chinese government.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Do we want our military to be investing in Chinese companies that are making bombs and et cetera for the Chinese military?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. No, and I've been very tough on Huawei, nobody's been tougher on Huawei than I have. I've called 10 countries and gotten them not to buy it. But, you know, at the same time, getting along with China is a good thing. You know, I can do something where nobody's ever going to do anything with China -- getting along is a good thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, there was a real chance that we couldn't have made a deal. You know, they're having the worst year that they've had in 67 years, right? That's because of me. I don't want that to happen. But getting along with China is a great thing and I like that. I think it's wonderful. So, if the people on Wall Street, the people in the military, if they have problems they're going to come and see me. They haven't come and seen me. But, if they start having problems with that we'll stop doing it. But, having investments in China, that's not bad.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Letting them invest in our country is good, but we have to be careful of the military aspect of it, because they're very much into the military, as you possibly know.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> What about this coronavirus? What can you tell us about this? How worried should we be? And what is the administration doing, in terms of protecting our passengers at the airport?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, we have one person right now, as you know, quarantined, and we got lucky, actually. But, we're in great shape. We have -- CDC did a fantastic job. Immediately got the person and we think we're in good shape. And I think China's in good shape too, by the way.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> So, do you think that people should be worried when they're traveling in the airport?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, not at all. I don't think they should be worried. This is one person out of tens of millions of people that travel and we just announced it yesterday, and it's all taken care of. And China's working very hard on the problem, we spoke about it, and China's working very hard on it.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Nancy Pelosi's also trying to criticize and take down A.G. Barr. A.G. Barr says that there are some things that were done in the investigation that are not included in the Horowitz Report. He's looking at Brennan. He's looking at other Obama officials. How far up the line do you think this went? That they framed you, tried to target your campaign during the election?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it went right to the top. And I think that what they did, is they spied on my election. What they did is so illegal. Like in history there's never been anything like this. They tried to defeat me before I got elected and then in the insurance policy kicked in. You remember the famous insurance policy?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If he wins we'll go get him here, and that happened. That happened. There has never been a thing like this. If this were reversed and this was Obama, President Obama, where this happened to, people would be in jail right now for 50-year terms and 100-year terms, or they -- who knows? But if this were President Obama instead of President Trump, if this were the other side, people would have long ago been in jail.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will tell you, we have a great attorney general. He's highly respected. He's a highly ethical man. He's doing a fantastic job. Let's see how it all comes out. Nancy Pelosi's a disgrace to our country, and she ought to spend more time trying to look at San Francisco, which is going to hell. You look at what's going on San Francisco.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People don't even recognize it as a city. This was one of our most beautiful places. It's with all of the needles and all of the everything else that we're not going to talk about.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> We were just there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And by the way, it's washing into the ocean, and they have beaches, and it washes into the ocean. And our EPA is fining them, tens of billions of dollars. What's happened to San Francisco is a disgrace, and that's where she is.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> What about New York? I mean, how do you feel about this new bail reform where three-quarters of all inmates are being released?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I think it's crazy.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> Governor Cuomo and de Blasio put this into effect.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's crazy.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Neighborhoods don't even know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's crazy, and I think Virginia is crazy. They want to take away the guns in Virginia. You have a governor that's -- I just can't believe it -- but Virginia's very much in play. I think we're going to win the state of Virginia. They want to take everyone's gun away in Virginia. You can't do it. You can't do it. People need that for safety.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They need it for hunting and other -- but many people need it for safety. They need it for security. They're playing with our Second Amendment. Frankly, they'd get rid of it. I watched him on an interview. He would get rid of the Second Amendment if it was up to him, and you have many Democrats saying the same thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're saying it quietly, but if they win these elections, they're going to try and get rid of the Second Amendment. It will never happen as long as I'm here.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> What about Iran? There's a lawmaker there now who's offering a reward for somebody to come and take you down.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> And then, of course, I wanted to ask you about Iran selling 70 percent of its oil and gas to China. How does China get away with that when you've got sanctions on companies and countries doing business with Iran?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I talked to China about it the other day when we did the signing, and they're going to be changing very much. Don't forget, we had a very tough patch with China. You know it better than anybody. You know, you'd say some days the deal's going to happen. Some -- I'd walk out of a lot of -- I've walked out of a lot of meetings.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They walked out also. We had a deal that was almost finished. They walked out. This deal is better. This deal is a portion of that deal, but a very big portion. You know, we cover intellectual property, finance. We cover things. Nobody thought -- they thought it was all a farm deal. It's not. This is a massive deal, Phase 1. Now we'll go to Phase 2, but no. China's working with us very nicely.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Negative> Do you worry that the technology companies are going to cheat in the election? Ted Cruz said this on my show the other day, and he said that he's watching some of these big companies that have the ability to put their finger on the scale by shadow banning and all of this other stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I do. I do, and I see it, and Mark Zuckerberg was in the White House two weeks ago and he said, you're number one on Facebook. I said, Thank you very much. I said, who's number two? He said, Modi. Modi of India, and -- prime minister. I said, well, he has 1.5 million people. We have 350. But so -- we can also use it in a sense, but no, I see it. I see the numbers where Facebook and Google and Twitter -- you know, Twitter -- I mean, Twitter's been very good for me, but I see what's going on. No, we're very concerned about it, but I was concerned about it when I ran three years ago, too, when we won.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, we won and we won easily.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Mr. President, congratulations, and happy anniversary.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Very nice.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> How beautiful those pictures are on Instagram of you and the First Lady.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right, yes. She's done a great job. She's a great First Lady.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Neutral> How has it been living in the White House with your bride these last three years?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's been great. I mean, it's been constant haranguing and constant witch hunts, so I've had a witch hunt from before -- I believe from before I came down on the escalator with then our future First Lady. But hey look, I love it. You know why I love it? Because we've done so much. We've done so much.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Do you have a Super Bowl pick?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't really. [Laughs]
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> OK, you can't take a side.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I really don't. They're a little bit of a surprise, but I think for me to take a, you know, side would be a little bit tough. But it's going to be a great game. I hope it's a great game.
<Maria Bartiromo> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
