<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you so much for being here today. We really appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Laura.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> I know you're heading to Pittsburgh tomorrow and Rabbi Jeffrey Myers from the Tree of Life Synagogue said last night the following.
<Jeffrey Myers> <Negative> [Prerecorded] I want to address some of the political leaders in the room tonight. Ladies and gentlemen, it has to start with you as our leaders. My words are not intended as political fodder. I address all equally. Stop the words of hate.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> So given his words, what do you think your role tomorrow will be and should be?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm just going to pay my respects. I'm also going to the hospital to see the officers and some of the people that were so badly hurt. So -- and I really look forward to going. I would have done it even sooner, but I didn't want to disrupt anymore than they already had disruption. But I look forward to going to Pittsburgh tomorrow.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> You said over the weekend you might even tone up your rhetoric -- the media today seized on it, at Sarah Huckabee Sanders' press briefing. They're pointing fingers at you saying, look, you could do more. You're the leader of the free world. What do you say to that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well you know, I did a rally and I said, in fact, I was thinking about canceling it; I also did the Young Farmers and it was great doing that and then I had a rally afterwards and then I said, you know, you make them too important if you start canceling. I remember Dick Grasso wanted to get the stock exchange opened as soon as possible; he did a great job and other things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Once you start doing that, once you cancel -- so you're doing a rally and rallies are meant to be fun. Rallies are meant to be everything and I said, "Tone it done," and then you saw the group saying, "No, don't tone it down, don't tone it down." So we had a great rally in Illinois, for some great people and frankly, I think that's probably the way it should be.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You should go about your life. You can't let these people disrupt anymore than they already have, which is disgraceful; what he did is disgraceful. You can't let it happen. As far as what the rabbi said, I agree with him.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> The word "nationalism" has taken off, for the Left, this connotation of feeling anti-Semitism, hate, even violence. Do you think that is fair? And do you want to further clarify -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> -- what "nationalism" means to you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. To me, I don't have to clarify. It means I love the country, it means I'm fighting for the country. I look at two things, globalists and nationalists. I'm somebody that wants to take care of our country, because for many, many years, you know this better than anybody -- our leaders have been more worried about the world than they have about the United States and they leave us in a mess -- whether it's the wars, whether it's the economy, whether it's debt, whether it's all of the things that they've done, including putting in the wrong Supreme Court Justices and we're -- we've really put two great ones in -- no, I'm proud of this country and I call that "nationalism"; I call it being a nationalist and I don't see any other connotation than that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, as soon as you make any statement nowadays with the political correctness world, they make a big deal. I'm not a globalist, but I want to take care of the globe, but first I have to take care of our country. I want to help people around the world, but we have to take care of our country, or we won't have a country, including -- we have to take care of our country at the border.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> When you hear people use the phrase "anti-Semitism" to describe anything connected to you, you have a Jewish daughter, you have grandchildren who are Jewish -- what's your reaction to that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I just received an award from the State of Israel from Bibi Netanyahu, thanking me because I moved the, as you know, the embassy to Jerusalem, making Jerusalem the capital of Israel and I just did that -- now how many presidents said they were going to do it and they never did it? Many, many presidents. I won't go over the names but I can tell you every one of them; I can tell you what every one of them said.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just opened up -- and we opened it up; we didn't just name it -- you know, it was going to take years and years to build and it was going to cost over a billion dollars -- I opened up a beautiful building for $400,000, already open, saved well over a billion dollars -- and it's opened after four months.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> And you were criticized for that, too -- you were criticized at the time, I believe for being too pro-Palestinian, and now you're criticized on the other side.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. And in fact, this horrible human being, this terrible person that did the shooting, he was not a Donald Trump fan, because he said I was too close to Israel. So, ah… that seemed to be his reasoning. So I will tell you, I'm going to show you, right after this, I'm going to show you the most beautiful plaque -- it just came; they must have known you were going to be doing this interview -- but it was sent by Bibi Netanyahu thanking me for opening the embassy in Jerusalem, which as you know, is like the biggest deal.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> The phrase "enemy of the people" -- another phrase that's been seized upon by many in the media -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Many at CNN, but not just CNN. There was a woman who was on CNN a short while ago saying that you have radicalized more people than ISIS -- that was CNN today.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that's must be some kind of a sick woman. When I say "the enemy of the people" I'm talking about the fake news and you know it better than anybody. You have news out there that is so fake and I can do the greatest thing ever, North Korea, as an example -- we would have been going to war -- normal would have been going to war with North Korea.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think President Obama would have gone to war very -- if he had an extra year he would be in right now a war with North Korea -- he told me it was by far, and I'm not knocking him for this, he said it's by far his biggest problem. Look at what we've done. And yet, when they talk about North Korea, they say, what's taking so well? [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> But you know they're going to be biased. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, but [Inaudible] -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> But you know they're going to be biased.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] -- for 70 some odd years now -- and they say, I left, I left Singapore, where we had our meeting -- where we really had a very good meeting and a good relationship -- like what, four months ago -- they say the new line is, "What's taking so long?" I say -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> How does that help expand your base, to call them "the enemy of the people"? How does it help America heal from things like this? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's a very good question, very fair. Before we finish, though, so we've done a great job with North Korea. Then they said we can't get him on anything because the sanctions are wrong, we got everything, there's no missiles, we got our hostages back, we have the remains coming back, everything. So now they said, he met, the new line is… I met -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Of course. But why are you expecting they're going to be fair to you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but think of it, how -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> They're never going to be fair to you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But Laura, think of it. I met. [Laughter] Okay? That's their new line. I shouldn't have met. So you know. And if you go back to before I got here, it looked like we were going to war, a bad war, with North Korea. So -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> But I was here with Reagan, I worked for Reagan -- they called him stupid, dumb, slept in the afternoon, incompetent, a war monger -- and he always kind of -- [Crosstalk] [Inaudible] But he was, he --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to [Inaudible] -- No, but he didn't have social media.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Yeah, that's true.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He would have fought back. He didn't have social media. When they -- it's my form of telling the truth. Here's the problem. We have a lot of supporters -- you know that better than anybody. All you have to do is look at your ratings, ok? But you know it better than anybody -- those supporters know that they're lying. I watched Meet the Press this weekend -- everything was so falsely put, putting words in people's mouths.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Are they trying to hobble you in the Midterms? Because you're the best -- [Crosstalk] -- closer for this party. That's what the Republicans are saying.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're going at it away -- and I'm getting 25 and 35,000 people to these rallies -- nobody's ever seen -- there has never been a -- this isn't bragging -- there has never been anything like what's happening. I went to Illinois -- you oughta see -- a Boeing 747 -- this massive hangar packed -- and they had to use a second hangar for the overflow, nobody's seen [Inaudible] for now -- and always -- look what happened for Ted Cruz; who's doing great now -- we left Houston, he's now doing great -- they don't even talk about that race and his opponent is not very good.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> The bomber who sent the letters to CNN and the Democrats, was a fan of yours. He obviously also seems insane, completely insane -- so what do you say about that? You put "bomb" in quotes -- they went crazy over that, too, over the weekend, because you seized the word "bomb" in quotes --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look at it [Inaudible] -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Would you like to kind of --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, look -- he was insane a long time before -- you look at his medical records -- he was insane for a long time. Bernie Sanders had a fan who shot a very good friend of ours, Steve Scalise -- and other people -- he was a total maniac -- nobody puts his name in the headline, Bernie Sanders in the headline with the maniac -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> In fact, Nancy Pelosi said, "Do not politicize this," back at the time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was in the headline of the Washington Post, my name associated with this crazy bomber. Trump bomber or something. But I was in the headline… when they got him. They didn't say -- bomber found -- they talked about Trump in the headline. Now they didn't do that with Bernie Sanders when he had -- they didn't do that with the Democrats when other people came at -- they didn't do that with President Obama with the church, the horrible situation with the church -- they didn't do that. They put my name in the headlines. It's -- when I say "enemy of the people" I'm talking about the fake news and it is fake.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> For which [Inaudible] organization -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> My people understand. One quick story. So a reporter for the Washington Post, there's a story that -- a place that I was doing, an arena was empty and he shows a picture; not a very good crowd, Mr. Trump, something to that effect. And then it turned out that he took the picture five hours before the people started coming into the arena. The arena was packed and there were thousands of people outside. They had to retract it. But this is the kind of dishonesty that we have. [Commercial Break]
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> We looked at some individual races, Florida, obviously so important to 2020, but important, period -- Andrew Gillum against Ron DeSantis, Ron DeSantis, Congressman, strong supporter of yours -- over the weekend you called Andrew Gillum, you referenced him being a thief. [Crosstalk] What did you mean by that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] Well, the FBI offered him tickets at $1800 apiece and he took them -- he took a trip with the same FBI agent -- I guess he was posing as a developer or something -- the man stone cold took this stuff. I don't even think he should be allowed to continue on with the race.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> He responded today by calling you "weak" -- you're howling because you're weak, that's what he said in a Tweet.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I haven't heard that one lately. That's OK, good, that's a change of pace. Look, here's a guy that, in my opinion, is a stone cold thief. And his city, Tallahassee, is known as the most corrupt in Florida and one of the most corrupt in the nation -- he's a disaster and how he's even close to being tied is hard to believe.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But Florida can't have -- if Florida has a governor like that -- and I know Florida better than I know practically anywhere -- Florida will become Venezuela; it will be a disaster. And you have Ron DeSantis, who is a Harvard/Yale guy, he's had a really terrific -- you know, he's a very good person; he's going to be a very -- he's going to be a very good to a great governor.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This other guy is a stone cold, in my opinion, he's a thief. How can you have a guy like this? And you just look at his record. Also, look at his -- the job he's done as the mayor of Tallahassee. He's a total disaster.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> John James, of course, running for Senate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A star.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Beto O'Rourke is down in the polls since you came in Texas, but John James is only eight, nine points off -- [Crosstalk] -- his Senate bid. He's an -- [Crosstalk] -- Army combat veteran.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right, right.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Why do you think he's not getting the play by the media?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's doing so well that I'm trying to get to Michigan. That's how well John James -- John James is a star. African American. Great guy. And you know how John James, he was one of four or five people running -- and I'm watching television and I see John James, I said, who is that guy? He's running in Michigan. Let me see it again. And I said, that guy is great. He's a star. Now, she, I don't know, she's just a clone for -- all she is, is a -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Obama is kind of following you on the campaign trail. He was in Wisconsin.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How are his crowds?
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Yeah. Wisconsin, going to Florida this week -- and he brought up the issue of the caravan and he said the following:
<Barack Obama> <Negative> [Prerecorded] Now the latest, they're trying to convince everybody to be afraid of a bunch of impoverished, malnourished refugees a thousand miles away -- that's the thing, it's the most important in this election? Not healthcare? Not whether the folks are able to retire," etc., etc., "rebuilding our roads, bridges, putting people back work?" We're scare-mongering people on the border. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a problem [Inaudible] -- yeah. Well, he's trying to do the opposite. It's the problem with our country -- when you look at that caravan and you look that caravan and look at largely, very, you know, big percentage of men, young, strong -- a lot of bad people, a lot of bad people in there. People that are in gangs -- we don't want them in this country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If they want to come into the country, you have to apply, like other people. We have millions of people coming in, they're applying, they're coming in legally. We have a very strong border. I called up the military. This caravan is not -- they're wasting their time. They are not coming into the country. [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> What's the military going to be able to do? Obama and -- [Crosstalk] -- Bush both sent the National Guard; it's had no effect. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But they're not me. This is the -- I'm sending up the military. This is the military. And they're standing there and one thing that we'll have --
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> No lethal [Inaudible] -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When they are captured, we don't let them out. What has been happening and we're not as of pretty recently -- we're not letting them out. What happens is they would catch and release. We're catching, we're not releasing. So they want to come over. But we're not even doing that. We're not letting them into this country. We're not going to let gang members -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> But what if they're applying for asylum? Isn't the law, because Congress didn't change the law? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If they applied for asylum, we're going to hold them until such time as their trial takes place.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> Where? We have the facilities?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to put up -- we're going to build tent cities. We're going to put tents up all over the place; we're not going to build structures and spend all of this, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars -- we're going to have tents; they're going to be very nice and they're going to wait and if they don't get asylum, they get out. And very few people -- they don't actually -- if you want to wait, they don't usually get asylum; you know that.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Eighty percent. [Inaudible] [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The problem is -- they release them in and then they have the trial three years later and nobody shows up. But we are going to -- unlike Obama and unlike others, we are going to take the people, we're going to put them in and they're going to wait. And you know what? Two things happened. When they find out that that happens, you're going to have far fewer people come up. And also, President Obama separated children from parents. Nobody talks about this. You talk about -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> [Inaudible] Judge came along and said, can't do it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No-no. He separated, no, President Obama separated --
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> – in the beginning.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay. Just so we all understand. You know, they -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> But you're kind of saying the military, Mr. President, being called up by you is an election year play. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're being invaded.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> Is this politics or is this real?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When you look at that thousands of people -- somebody said, you know, now on that one, they build it down -- I'm pretty good at figuring out how many people -- thousands and thousands of people -- on the bridge, when you looked at that bridge loaded up with people -- that's called an invasion of our country. This has nothing to do with elections. And I've been saying this long before election -- I've been saying this before I ever thought of running for office. We have to have strong borders. If we don't have strong borders, we don't have a country.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Democrats are worried about the Latino vote suddenly. They're worried they're not going to get the numbers -- [Crosstalk] -- show up.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They should be, they should be.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Why are the -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know why? Because the Latinos, the Hispanic Americans have the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers in the history of our country. The African Americans have the best employment and unemployment numbers in the history of our country. Asians, best employment numbers in the history of our country. Women, 65 years -- you know, all of these things -- women have the best numbers they've had in 65 years. They should be worried.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> How are you going to expand into these traditionally Democratic areas? [Crosstalk] Kanye West spent some time here. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] -- Brown -- yeah, they were great. [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> How big of an effect is West on this push for African American support?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, a person came into my office who does poll numbers said, I do not believe how good these poll numbers are with African Americans. And you see what's happened with my poll numbers. But here's what also happened. When we have the best employment numbers, the best median income numbers, for all of these groups? I mean, we have the best numbers we've ever had. And I sometimes jokingly say, it's going to be awfully tough to beat me in a debate when I have the best numbers ever produced. So I think they should be worried. They should be worried about the African Americans, because they're going to lose them.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Will you do some events in the inner cities?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm doing them, yeah. I already have them scheduled.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> One thing that I think a lot of us are very concerned about is what's happening with the market this year. It's flat for the year, down a little bit, off its record high -- both the S&P and the Dow -- I know you've complained about the Fed before -- how much is cheap credit globally as a part of this problem?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, remember this. Obama, President Obama had the worst recap that we've ever had since the Great Depression, okay, in terms of coming back. But he was dealing with zero money, zero interest money. We actually created value for money, so the people that have money in the bank and did it the way you're supposed to do it, they're actually getting interest on their money now. The Fed is being very tight.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now in one way you have to say that's very conservative. That's a good thing from the standpoint of conservative. I don't like it. Because it closes it down a little bit. But we're up, we were up almost 50 percent from the time I got elected, almost 50 -- in fact, more in some instances. And now we're down just a little tiny bit.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we have such a strong -- when you go job numbers -- when you go companies moving into our country -- we have so many companies, big ones like Foxconn and like the car companies -- they're moving back to Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida -- they're coming back and nobody's ever seen this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You've never seen it before. They left and they had no intention. We just signed a deal with Mexico and with Canada. We did a new deal with Korea.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> How about Jair Bolsonaro? You talked to him last night. [Crosstalk] What can we expect for --? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was great. Oh no, he was great.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> He's called "the Trump of South America" [Inaudible] -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] I told him I'm honored. But we had a great conversation. And he's now the -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Straight deal?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The head of Brazil. Yeah, I could see that happening. You know, Brazil's treated as very tough because they charge very big tariffs. Brazil has been very tough. So we'll be able to straighten that out. But -- and we have, of course, what's happening with China. China has been really hurting our country. Economically. And you see, we're going to win that one. It's going to happen. We're going to win that one.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> How confident are you? About the deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd like to make a deal right now. I just say they're not ready.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> $250 billion, additional tariffs if that deal doesn't go through. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> $250 billion and I have $267 billion waiting to go if we can't make a deal.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Are you optimistic? Scale from one to 10. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think that we will make a great deal with China and it has to be great, because they've drained our country. We have really helped rebuild China. They've take up -- they've been taking out an average of $500 billion dollars, billion, a year, for many years. Not going to happen anymore.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Who's your dream person to run against in 2020? You've already raised $100 million. Dream, dream candidate to run against.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, so far I like them all. I don't see anybody that -- [Crosstalk]
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Hillary's not going -- apparently she's not down and out. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like her, too; I like her, too. I'd be very happy with Hillary. I like them all. I don't see anybody that I wouldn't enjoy running against. And you know, that could happen. But I don't see it right now.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> A couple other questions Fox viewers really want to know. Declassifying those documents -- they were kind of kicked over to the Inspector General -- [Crosstalk] Why not declassify them and get it all out?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're getting very close to doing what we have to do. I want to wait till after the election.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Why are you and Rod Rosenstein such good friends now? Seems like everything's been settled.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, look -- I'll tell you -- I do get along, but this should have never, there should never been a Special Counsel. In my opinion. It's an illegal investigation totally. A lot of people agree with me. A lot of people on your show and other shows agree. There was no collusion. There was never any collusion. Jair Bolsonaro shouldn't have ever happened. But with all of that being said, I do get along and I have made everything available. You know why? Because I have nothing to do with Russia. Hillary was a lousy candidate and I did a very good job.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> You're going to do written questions? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She didn't go --
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Written answers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She didn't go to Wisconsin, she didn't go to Michigan enough; she didn't do what she had to do to win. And it's just one of those things. But we have nothing to do with Russia and I think you -- you probably know that almost better than anybody.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> The co-written questions to Mueller's -- [Crosstalk] [Inaudible] answers to his question --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] -- I mean it's ridiculous that I have to do anything because we didn't do anything. But we will probably do something, yes, where we'll respond to some questions.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> How is Melania doing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's doing fantastically, really good. She's doing a great job. Just got back from Africa. And she saw some things that were very eye-opening and tremendous poverty. Tremendous poverty. So we're trying to help.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you, Laura.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Really appreciate it.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Welcome back America. It's Hugh Hewitt. Joined now by Donald Trump. Donald Trump, welcome back to the Hugh Hewitt Show, it's always a pleasure to talk to you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Hugh.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> I would thought that today, this is our sixth interview, I'd turn to some of the commander-in-chief questions. Are you ready for that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, fine.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Are you familiar with General Soleimani?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, but go ahead, give me a little, go ahead, tell me.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> He runs the Quds Forces.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, okay, right.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Do you expect his behavior...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Kurds, by the way, have been horribly mistreated by ...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> No, not the Kurds, the Quds Forces, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Quds Forces.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, yes.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> ...is the bad guys.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Do you expect his behavior to change as a result...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I thought you said Kurds, Kurds.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> No, Quds.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said Kurds, because I think the Kurds have been poorly treated by us, Hugh. Go ahead.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Agreed. So Soleimani runs the Quds Forces. Do you expect his behavior is going to change as a result of this deal with Iran?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think that Iran right now is in the driver's seat to do whatever they want to do. I think what's happening with Iran is, I think it's one of the, and I covered it very well. I assume you saw the news conference. I think Iran is, it's one of the great deals ever made for them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's one of the most incompetent contracts I've even seen. I'm not just talking about defense. I'm not talking about a contract with another country. I've never seen more of a one-sided deal, I think, in my life, absolutely.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Well, Soleimani is to terrorism sort of what Trump is to real estate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Many people would say he's the most dangerous man in the world, and he runs the Quds Forces, which is their Navy SEALs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Is he the gentleman that was going back and forth with Russia and meeting with Putin? I read something, and that seems to be also where he's at.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> That's the guy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's going back and forth meeting with other countries, etc., etc.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> That's the guy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not good.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> And so do you think...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not good for us. And what it shows is a total lack of respect, I mean, that the other countries would even be entertaining him, and they're entertaining him big league, big league.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> So when you went before the Senate, and I always tell people my favorite testimony of all time is when Donald Trump just schooled the Senate on the construction of the U.N. remodel.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> You know that stuff. You know every developer in Manhattan. You know everything about building buildings. You could build the wall.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> I have no doubt about that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. By the way, and nobody knows how easy that would be. And I mean, it would be, it would be tall, it would be powerful, we would make it very good looking. It would be as good as a wall's got to be, and people will not be climbing over that wall, believe me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> You know, I'd buy that, because you're a builder. But on the front of Islamist terrorism, I'm looking for the next commander-in-chief, to know who Hassan Nasrallah is, and Zawahiri, and al-Julani, and al-Baghdadi. Do you know the players without a scorecard, yet, Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, you know, I'll tell you honestly, I think by the time we get to office, they'll all be changed. They'll be all gone. I knew you were going to ask me things like this, and there's no reason, because number one, I'll find, I will hopefully find General Douglas MacArthur in the pack. I will find whoever it is that I'll find, and we'll, but they're all changing, Hugh.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, those are like history questions. Do you know this one, do you know that one. I will tell you, I thought you used the word Kurd before. I will tell you that I think the Kurds are the most under-utilized and are being totally mistreated by us.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And nobody understands why. But as far as the individual players, of course I don't know them. I've never met them. I haven't been, you know, in a position to meet them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If, if they're still there, which is unlikely in many cases, but if they're still there, I will know them better than I know you.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> That's what I'm getting at, because the Islamist extremism is metastasizing. Nasrallah's been there a long time, and al-Baghdadi's running ISIS. And so I wonder if you're going to throw yourself into the details of this during the campaign the way you did into the U.N. deal, because you knew that stuff cold.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know, and unfortunately, I said I'd build it for $500 million. They were at $3 billion. And it ended up costing $6 billion, and I told them that would happen. And it was a disgrace.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Frankly, that whole U.N. situation was a disgrace. They ended up spending $5-6 billion dollars to renovate a building that I would have done for $500 million, and I told them I would have done it, and it would have been better. Now as far as what you're talking about now, I will know every detail, and I will have the right plan, not a plan like this where we're probably going backwards based on everything that I'm hearing, but we're probably going backwards, zero respect.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have, we are not a respected country, and certainly as it relates to ISIS and what's going on, and Iran.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Now I don't believe in gotcha questions. And I'm not trying to quiz you on who the worst guy in the world is.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that is a gotcha question, though. I mean, you know, when you're asking me about who's running this, this this, that's not, that is not, I will be so good at the military, your head will spin. But obviously, I'm not meeting these people. I'm not seeing these people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now it probably will be a lot of changes, Hugh, as you go along. They'll be, by the time we get there, which is still a pretty long period of time, you know, you start, let's say you figure out nominations, and who is going to represent the Republicans in, let's say, February, March, April, you'll start to get pretty good ideas, maybe sooner than that, actually. But that will be a whole new group of people. I think what is really important is to pick out, and this is something I'm so good at, to pick out who is going to be the best person to represent us militarily, because we have some great people, militarily.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I don't know that we're using them.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> All right, well, let me expand it, because you know, it's not gotcha. I'm trying not to do that. But I wanted to see if you...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it sounded like gotcha. You're asking me names that, I think it's somewhat ridiculous, but that's okay. Go ahead, let's go.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, good. Now have you ever been to Israel? And how often?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I've been to Israel once.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> And if Israel acts unilaterally against Iran because they view this deal as so bad, will you unequivocally stand by the action of the Netanyahu government?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Of course, I will. In fact, he's a friend of mine. I did commercials for his reelection. And according to what he said, I'm the only celebrity, he's used the word celebrity, this was a while ago, that did commercials, that he asked to do commercials.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But he's a good man, and I would absolutely stand with him. But you know, we have a problem, because according to the deal, and this is hard to believe, but we're supposed to be protecting Iran against any invader. And if Israel invades, nobody knows exactly what's going to happen, because if Israel invades Iran, I don't know if you know, but we have a clause in that agreement that the way I read it, it's almost like we have to go, and by the way, I can guarantee you that clause, first of all, should have never been there, maybe they had it taken out, but we didn't win anything. But do you know there's a clause in there that in theory, we're supposed to help them fight Israel?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yup. Yeah, it's in Annex Three. We agree to cooperate in the security of their nuclear installations. It's remarkable, and I'm glad you know about it.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> And I'm glad you'll stand with Israel. Let me ask you about Saudi Arabia and Egypt. I don't know if you've been able to get to those countries, yet, have you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have, yes.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> And so do you...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think the biggest, you know, I think it's terrible, first of all, with Egypt, and with Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia in particular, was making a billion dollars a day, one billion dollars a day. Now let's say they make half of that number because oil prices have been so depressed. But Saudi Arabia was making a half a billion dollars. It was a billion dollars a day.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why aren't they helping us out? When they asked, and you may not like this, but I like it, because when we owe now $19, we're up to $19 trillion dollars, I certainly like it, and I like protecting...why aren't they helping us with the costs? We get virtually nothing from Saudi Arabia. Every time somebody raises a rifle in the air and points it in the direction of Saudi Arabia, or, by the way, South Korea and other places, every single time that happens, and I mean without exception, we start loading up and getting ready and sending ships and sending all sorts of things. We get nothing. And you know, maybe you'll explain why, but we get nothing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I don't like that.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> I'm curious, though, if we need them, in your opinion, as strategic allies Ð Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan. Do we need them even if they're not paying us money for their defense?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you need, I think Egypt and Israel get along, and they're starting to get along pretty well. Mubarak should have been frankly, probably, taken care of better than he was. That sent a bad signal around. But I think in terms of Israel, Egypt starts getting very important.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Maybe we don't need the oil to the same extent as we did, and pretty soon, if we allowed, if we allowed what we have, technologically, to go forward, we wouldn't need them at all. You know, we have potentially the greatest oil reserves in the world right here, and we wouldn't need them at all. You know, we used to need Saudi Arabia for oil, and that part of the world. It all started with the oil, and it sort of ends with the oil.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But now, we're at a point where we're going to be doing ten million barrels. It's very interesting. We're probably, very soon, if we allow our people to get going, we're probably not going to need them for the oil. So we don't need Saudi Arabia nearly to the extent that we needed them in the past.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Okay, looking to Asia, if China were to either accidentally or intentionally sink a Filipino or Japanese ship, what would Commander-In-Chief Donald Trump do in response?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I wouldn't want to tell you, because frankly, they have to, you know, somebody wrote a very good story about me recently, and they said there's a certain unpredictable, and it was actually another businessman, said there's a certain unpredictability about Trump that's great, and it's what made him a lot of money and a lot of success. You don't want to put, and you don't want to let people know what you're going to do with respect to certain things that happen. You don't want the other side to know. I don't want to give you an answer to that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If I win, and I'm leading in every single poll, if I win, I don't want people to know exactly what I'm going to be doing.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Fair response. Good response.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Part of the problem with Obama, he says we're going to do this, we're going to do that, we're going to attack here, we're going to do this. Every time they capture somebody, they make a big deal out of it, and all of the other people, like for instance, they hit somebody with a drone, and they start making a big deal over the fact that they took out a mid-level accounting person, and now everybody else goes and runs, and it makes it harder. I don't want to explain, and I think it's a very bad thing. I think we do too much talking, and not enough, do you understand what I'm saying in this, Hugh?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Oh, it's a great point. It's a very good answer.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We do too much talking. General Douglas MacArthur, I was watching as President Obama was talking about, I won't go into great detail, was talking about attacking at a certain time in a certain place, and I'm saying can you imagine General Douglas MacArthur, General Patton, they must be spinning in their graves when they hear it. So when you tell me a ship is attacked, I don't want to tell you exactly what I'm going to do. I don't want people to know my thinking on that, and I do have very spoken...thinking on it.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Fair play.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I don't want people to know my thinking.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> All right, next question. Presidents respond to disasters. Governors respond to disasters. What disasters have you, Donald Trump, responded to?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I've responded very much to disasters. I've had, you know, fires in buildings, big buildings. I've had economic changes where the world crashed in the early 90s, and I came out stronger than I was before. And I didn't go bankrupt like many people they were forced into bankruptcy, and they were forced into, like, you know disasters never to be heard from again.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I came out stronger than I was before. There was an old expression in the early 90s Ð survive Ôtil '95 that I made up, and I gave. And I actually became much stronger. But I've gone through, I've watched economic problems happen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Eight years ago, nine years ago when I was buying and everybody else was selling because they had no money and I did have a lot of money and I bought a lot of great assets. And you know, I've gone through a lot of different things, and I've come out on top always.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Very good. Now some political questions. Do you own a gun?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> What kind?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'd rather not say.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I have a license to carry. I have a license, you know, I have a concealed license, I have a license to carry concealed.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Didn't know that. How do you define assault weapon? This is important to our 2nd Amendment friends out there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, yeah, I think that you know, the word assault weapon, and a lot of people, there's been a lot of controversy, but I wouldn't give you exact, I am in favor, I have two sons that are members in very high standing at the NRA.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I would ask them for a definition, but I am in favor of allowing, I'm very, very pro-2nd Amendment. And if you want to ask that, I would go to the experts. All I can tell you is that I am totally a 2nd Amendment person, and totally in favor of not doing anything. You know, an interesting thing happened.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When the two prisoners escaped in upstate New York, Hugh, people that really were very much against guns all of a sudden, they have these two prisoners, and they are someplace up there and nobody knew where, and a woman who said she used to fight with her husband all the time, she didn't want guns, all of a sudden, they felt so safe because they were sitting with guns, and they were able to protect themselves. Now nothing ever happened, and ultimately, they caught the one and they killed the other. You know the case I'm talking about three months ago.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> You bet.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it was very interesting to watch this woman who was totally, and I mean absolutely totally against guns, and all of a sudden, she felt safe because they were able to have guns in the house. So it's interesting. No, I'm totally pro-2nd Amendment.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, now the age question. Hillary's had to face it. You should as well. You're 69.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> How's your health? And is it legitimate for people to worry about you being president at 69?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, my health is very good, and my father was 94. My mother was 89 when she passed away, and my father was in great shape until he was really like almost 90. My mother was in great shape almost until the end, and mentally, her capacity was 100%, so from a genetic standpoint, very good. I'm in the process of getting some documentation from doctors that have taken care of me over the years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've never had a major problem. I've had almost no minor problem as I knock on wood. But my health has been very good and very strong. And maybe you get to see that, because people say boy, you have a lot of energy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're able to do so many things. Don't forget, in addition to running a campaign where it's number one in every poll, I'm also running a business, which I'm rapidly giving over to my executives. I have a very big business, and I'm rapidly giving that over to my executives and my children.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> All right, now every GOP candidate for high office gets this question, Meg Whitman most recently. It's the illegal alien employment question. Usually, about six weeks before an election, so Donald Trump, have you or any of close member of your family hired an illegal alien in close proximity to your family?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not that I know of, no.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Okay. Archbishop Chaput of Philadelphia blasted you yesterday without naming you -- he's a very well-respected Catholic cleric -- for belligerent bombast about illegal aliens. He's a man of the cloth. What do you say in response?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think that's fine. I mean, he can feel that way, and I understand that. And he's not the only one, but I feel we need borders. I feel that we have to, the word illegal means we're a country of laws.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You saw that at my press conference today, and illegal means illegal. They're not supposed to be in the country. And we're either going to have a country or we're not. And if we're not going to have strong borders with a wall, which will make it very strong, by the way, and walls do work if they're properly built, not the little 11 foot walls that we have up right now, and they're not walls, they're fences.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There is a difference. But you know, I can understand him saying that. And other people have said it, too. But I believe we either have a country or we don't.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We either have laws in the country or we don't.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, now some personal stuff in our last few minutes, because people are curious about Donald Trump. What's your, what was your worst health crisis to date?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> None. I mean, none. I really haven't had...
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Wow, are you blessed. What's your worst business decision that you've made?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Worst business decision? Well, I've made some business decisions where markets changed, but in virtually every case, I was able to take those decisions and make them good, and take those jobs and make them good, which I think is a great test. I mean, I've had buildings going up and the market crashes, which is not my fault, and I go back and I negotiate with the banks, and I negotiate tough and I negotiate hard, and I've taken some jobs that were, that could have been disastrous and made them better than if the market had stayed the same. So I don't know, I view business, I view that question as something you have to learn from it, and you can never make a decision that's going to take you down. In other words, you're not going to do something that if it doesn't work out, because the best businessmen in the world, I know all of them, the best businessmen in the world have had difficult times, and they've had bad deals.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you can never allow a deal, Hugh, to take you down. You just can't do it. So you have to know what you're doing. But one of the things, and I get a lot of credit in the world of business, I've taken deals that should have been bad, and I've made them great, better than if the markets stayed good.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Made them work.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'll tell you one thing, I bought deals for very low prices, like recently Doonbeg in Ireland, this incredible piece of land on the Atlantic Ocean, and other things, I've taken deals and bought deals that, and I bought them for very low prices, and turned them around and made them fantastic. So you know, I think you have to learn from business, and ideally, you want to learn from other people, not from yourself.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> All right, now President Obama is President Obama today, because when he ran for the United States Senate, his principal opponent, Jack Ryan, had divorce and custody records that had been sealed unsealed. Is there any smoking gun sealed away in records that could come out about Donald Trump down the road to destroy the Republican nominee after you're the nominee, if you're the nominee?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I don't think so, and I think one of the things you know about me, I've been a very public person. While I'm private, I've also been a very public person over many years. I mean, people know me. I'm very well known, and whether it's the great success on The Apprentice, where it was one of the top shows on television for a long time, and by the way, NBC renewed it, and is not in love with the fact that I didn't do it, but they renewed me for The Apprentice for many, many shows on The Apprentice, and you see the kind of money I made on The Apprentice, and I turned it down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said I'm going to run for president, I'm going to make America great again. They were not happy that I did that, so they're stuck in limbo. But they renewed The Apprentice. I didn't do it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think nothing. I'm a very public person, even though I'm private. I think you have seen me, and long before we met and spoke, you've seen me, and you know exactly what I'm talking about. So I would say nothing.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> all right, last question, I want to go back to the beginning, because I really do disagree with you on the gotcha question thing, Donald Trump. At the debate, I may bring up Nasrallah being with Hezbollah, and al-Julani being with al-Nusra, and al-Masri being with Hamas. Do you think if I ask people to talk about those three things, and the differences, that that's a gotcha question?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, I do. I totally do. I think it's ridiculous.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> That's interesting. I just disagree with that. I kind of figured that...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right, I think it's ridiculous. I'll have, I'm a delegator. I find great people. I find absolutely great people, and I'll find them in our armed services, and I find absolutely great people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And now on the bigger picture, like the fact that our Kurds are being treated so poorly, and would really is the one group that really would be out there fighting for us, I think, and fighting for themselves, maybe more importantly to them, I understand that. But when you start throwing around names of people and where they live and give me their address, I think it's ridiculous, and I think it's totally worthless.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Well, I wouldn't do that. That's crazy. I agree.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, and by the way, the names you just mentioned, they probably won't even be there in six months or a year.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> I don't know. Nasrallah's got such staying power.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, let's see what happens.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> And so I think the difference...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know what? In that case, first day in office, or before then, right at the day after the election, I'll know more about it than you will ever know. That I can tell you.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Oh, I hope so. Last question, so the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas does not matter to you yet, but it will?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It will when it's appropriate. I will know more about it than you know, and believe me, it won't take me long.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, that, I believe.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But right now, right now, I think it's just something that, and you know what, if you ask these candidates, nobody's going to be able to give you an answer. I mean, there may be one that studied it because they're expecting a fresh question from you. But believe me, it won't matter. I will know far more than you know within 24 hours after I get the job.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Donald Trump, congratulations on taking the pledge today. Your numbers are going to go up as a result of that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, let's see what happens. I mean, I'm not sure that that's true. I think my numbers are very high now. But I'm not really sure that that's true, but I know you feel that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hope you're right. I mean, let's see what happens.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Donald Trump, thank you, always a pleasure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi Brady. How are you?
<Brady Mallory> <Positive> Hello. Mr. President. Thank you for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nice to see you. Thank you very much.
<Brady Mallory> <Positive> Welcome to South Dakota.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Great honor.
<Brady Mallory> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good.
<Brady Mallory> <Negative> So we are a big ag state, and farmers have said the last four years has been really tough and the tariff war isn't helping many things --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Brady Mallory> <Positive> -- from what they told us. What can you do to make sure that farmers can keep farming, so they can feed the world?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the farmers are going to be in very good shape as soon as I finish the various deals. The farmers have been shut out from the EU, which is basically Europe.  They've been shut out from Canada, as you know, Canada is charging tremendous tariffs, almost 300 percent on dairy products. They've been shut out, to a large extent, in China while they do business with China, they're still shut out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And what we're doing is, we're knocking down those trade barriers, and the farmers are going to be the biggest beneficiary.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And remember this: before my election, if you look at soybeans, five years before my election they dropped 5 -- or down -- each year, they were dropping down 10 and 15 percent. They ended up dropping 50 percent, and that's just for a period of five years and that's before we ever got here. So whether it's soybeans, or corn or any of it, I think the farmers are going to have a much bigger market.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I have to get the trade deals done. I have to say this -- these countries have been really ripping the United States for a long time. They are very spoiled, but now they're learning. Those barriers are coming down and they're coming along. We've made our deal with Mexico. Canada is negotiating with us right now, and we have a lot of cards, as you know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think the farmers have been terrific, because they say, look, President Trump knows what he's doing. It was time that somebody did it. We're going to open up the markets
<Brady Mallory> <Positive> Well, for farmers who want certainty now, I -- I know that is coming -- for certainty now. It's hard to make a profit on commodities right now and farmers are worried about that. Can you give them any certainty now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you have to remember they've been worried for 15 years. For 15 years they haven't been doing well and for 15 years, they've really been hurt by the trade practices of other countries. And I will tell you that I think the farming business is going to be very good as soon as I finish up with the things we're working on right now. And if you push it too fast, you're not going to make the right deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I don't want to push it too fast. The farmers are great patriots. They know exactly what I'm doing, and they've been behind me 100 percent. And I said this even during the -- as you remember -- during the primary campaigns, and during the campaign I said we're going to take care of the farmers we have to make new trade deals. The trade deals that we have in this country NAFTA and others are absolutely terrible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So they're being renegotiated to the benefit of our country.
<Brady Mallory> <Negative> And so for family farmers here who are worried about losing their generations-long farms at the end of the season or early retirements. Any words of comfort for them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they would have lost them anyway because they were being hurt so badly with the trade barriers. We will tell you they are going to be in a very good position very soon.
<Brady Mallory> <Negative> I want to talk about jobs. Now you have been touting low unemployment numbers in the country, and you say they're good. They've been good here in South Dakota for quite some time. Our problem is we need workers to fill those jobs. So how do we get the workers?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, what we're going to do -- and you have that problem, and so do a lot of -- because we're at 3.9% even 3.8% percent unemployment, which is great in most respects, but for businesses, a lot of people are going to be coming in through a merit system of immigration, which we're working on. And I think I'm going to be able to have it done very quickly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we want people to come into the country through merit, not through lotteries and not through other ways. We're going to have a lot of farmers, a lot of help for our farmers. And I think that's going to take place very soon. But I want people coming into the country through the merit system, not through a system where we have no idea who we're taking.
<Brady Mallory> <Positive> And you're referring to your position on securing the border?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm talking about securing the borders, and we have largely. I mean, the borders are doing much better now, even though we have horrible laws. We have horrible, horrible laws. But the borders are doing much better now. But we want people to come in -- I want people to come into the country, but I want them to come in through merit.
<Brady Mallory> <Negative> The other thing -- one of the other things you've been talking about is the opioid crisis in America. That has hit South Dakota very hard --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Brady Mallory> <Negative> -- up 10 percent in the state. And I know the Senate is working on a bill to target specifically fentanyl. You know, what are you going to do to help us tackle those problematic numbers?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm working on the bill with the Senate and that's going to be an important bill. We're also working through the postal system, because you know what's going on with fentanyl it's and you know where it's coming from, mostly coming from China, and we're working on a very strong stop act within the postal system. In addition to that, I had $6 billion approved to fight -- and to help -- with the opioid problem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we got that in the last budget. So we're doing a really big job. Most areas tend to be down, you know, with doctors and with other prescription type of things. So most areas -- I'm a little surprised that you're up -- but most areas tend to be down. We're fighting it very hard. We have $6 billion now, just got approved. We've got $6 billion now to fight the opioid crisis.
<Brady Mallory> <Neutral> Is it -- do we have that money?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. It's all been approved. It's all been approved. It's starting to flow in.
<Brady Mallory> <Negative> I wanted to talk about your visit here today. Why -- why was that important for you to come here to support Kristi Noem?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think she's a terrific leader. She's been a terrific Congresswoman. She's done a great job. She's been very supportive of me. She's a tremendous leader. And I can tell you, she loves your state. She really loves your state. South Dakota is very important to her. And she left a very big job. You know, she is highly respected had good positions in Congress, she left that to become governor.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think she'll be a great governor of your state. And she has some of the things you're talking about. She's very much talking about them, including ethanol which we discussed at great length at a meeting just now.
<Brady Mallory> <Negative> She's been in politics for a long time. She's served in our state since 2007, and then she's been in Congress since 2011. Why is -- is she not part of the swamp then?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, actually she's very much of a rebel within Congress. I mean she was somebody that would oftentimes go against Congress. And, I think that's why she probably did so well in terms of her primary election. She -- she's very much of -- and I use the term very affectionately in a sense -- she was very much of a rebel. She wanted things to change in Congress, and she helped.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She was terrific. She was a highly respected Congresswoman. And a lot of people are going to miss her.
<Brady Mallory> <Positive> My last thing, you know, in his speech today, former President Obama mentioned you. He talked about the powerful -- this is a quote -- the powerful and the privileged to want to keep us divided and angry. He mentioned you by name. He says you are not the cause, but a symptom. What's your response to that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think we've done a great job. On the economy we've done great. Our military is now being rebuilt. It was in shambles after eight years of President Obama. The military was absolutely in shambles. A lot of bad decisions were made, and they weren't renewing -- and we have done a tremendous job with the military, including the vets where we have choice, where we have so many other things that we've got approved that he was unable to get approved.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, now we have Veterans Choice. We have veterans accountability. I think that we are probably less divided than we were when he was president. If you look at the divisions now, a lot of them are artificial. A lot of them are put up by people running for president in two years. And I think we probably are a lot -- lot less divided. But I can tell you this: our country is doing much better.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean if you look at the economy you look at all of the numbers 4.2%. You look at the GDP numbers which I think are going to go substantially higher. We have tremendous potential in this country, and I think he sees what we're doing, and I think he's probably saying, wow I wish I could have done that.
<Brady Mallory> <Negative> When we have people who are talking about racism and Nazi sympathizing, do you feel pressure to say don't do that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure I always would say that. But if you look at President Obama, look at what took place during his presidency, it was -- it was actually terrible. So, I think we've come a long way. Thank you very much.
<Brady Mallory> <Positive> Thank you so much for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Take care of yourself.
<Brady Mallory> <Negative> You too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you.
