<Howard Stern> <Positive> There's somebody on the phone I want to thank personally for being very nice and giving me that picture for the back of my book, which was taken at his wedding. Me and O.J. It's, uh, Donald Trump, the famous developer and former presidential candidate himself.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Hey Donald. How you doing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> How are you? I'm good.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I mean Mr. Trump. Excuse me.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What's going on?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> First of all, thanks for giving me that picture up on the back of the book.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Aw, that's great.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Which was weird, because you know what? I forgot that I had, you know, I didn't even realize that I took a picture with, you know, O.J. Simpson at your wedding.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I know how much you like O.J. and I know how, how innocent you feel he is.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> [Laughing] Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And because, you know, don't forget, there wasn't that much blood found in the Jeep. There was only about 50 drops.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yeah, that's not, that's not that much. That could...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, it's a pretty sad deal, I'll tell you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That could have been planted somehow.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah it could have been. Fifty different people could have planted it.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. Unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think the LAPD is that smart.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Hey, you know I was talking with Robin about this Colin Powell thing, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And, remember when your... your first book came out?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Like, remember everyone was saying you were run for president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's uh, it's amazing.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It's like a, it's like a hype, right? You weren't going to run for president.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I never even had a... I made a speech.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I made it for a friend, and perhaps it was a decent speech, and all of a sudden everyone said I was a presidential candidate. Showed you had hard up they were. One good speech and you're president.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, and then of course with your book coming out it got you tons of national publicity right? And it sold the book.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, you know ,when you look at what's happening now, it's so sad. When you look at what Japan is doing, when you look at this whole fiasco with the cars. We had 'em. Finally we had 'em. And all of a sudden America backs down again. You know, there's so much, there's so much to be left. There's so much to be done.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Now this is a speech, Donald.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Hey, there you go, I'll vote for you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I, I just...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You know what's really funny about me? I don't even know what Donald's talking about? I don't even know what happened in Japan. That's how out of it I am. I'm so busy selling the book.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're probably better off.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> [Laughs] Yeah.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You can remain [Inaudible].
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And by the way...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi Robin.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Donald, I don't... I don't know if you know this, Ivana is running for Senate. Did you hear?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I haven't.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, she just announced.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, well that's good.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She thinks it will help us more jewelry.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I'll tell you, that's good. I'd vote for her.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I bet you would. You know she was on Conan last night. It's amazing how, you know, if you marry Donald Trump it's amazing how long you're own thing can go.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Will you marry me Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would marry you and I am a great... I love creating stars.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He does. He really does.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love creating stars. You know, you marry, you star, but...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I've said it a bunch of times and Donald's not looking to mix it up with Ivana. She's the mother of his children and everything like that. But at the same point, you do have to kind of laugh that Ivana is still Ivana Trump.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> She wouldn't even marry that other guy. Losing that name would...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, she, she backed out of that one.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> How great would that be? How great would that be?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm sure he's a very nice guy, but she backed out of that one.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I'll bet you a billion dollars, which you have and I don't, but I bet you a billion dollars that if Ivana married that other guy, she would have kept the name Ivana Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she said she was going to get rid of the name Trump but for some reason that never happened.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, I wonder what reason?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Very difficult
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Like every once in a while I'll ask her: "What happened?"" That's all right. She's all right."
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hey look, you're getting along...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> She's a lot of fun. She's selling a lot of jewelry.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's selling some things on whatever the hell that station is?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, right. That's always a great way to make a living.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> She's got a gut now...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She's in there... I'll say this. She's in there pitching. A lot of people sort of hang it up. She's in there pitching.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Hey listen, in fact, I just bought a beer stein from her.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh really? Good.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> An Ivana Trump beer stein.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How is your book doing?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> My book's doing very well, and I never gave you this prediction. Had Ivana married that other guy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I bet that guy would have taken the Trump name.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> There would have been another Trump.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Antonio Trump or whatever.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, that's a major bust. I don't think it would be beyond him.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> The book is doing very well. It is the fastest selling book in the history of books.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> How is it going compared to your first book?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It's outselling my first book.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was surprised by the cover. I mean, I don't see that as you.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, t's me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't see that as you. I, you know, I'm your big fan. I was on television the other day, and
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Do you...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I made the mistake of saying "How's Howard"" I was on E!. I don't know
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And people around me went nuts. Some loved it. Some hated it. I mean, there was no... nobody... nothing in the middle Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> A lot of men don't like to cover my book because, Donald, they find themselves attracted to me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you certainly look very attractive.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. That's...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it certainly is very different.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I didn't choose... I didn't choose the picture because it looked attractive. I thought it looked like an evil clown.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well it's interesting. Well, look, you told me it's selling fast.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know of it would have been my choice for a picture, necessarily. I don't think I would have the courage personally. But it's selling, if you tell me it's the fastest selling book, you made the right choice.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's all. And, uh, It's perfect. Now listen, the reason Donald Trump is calling in, not to congratulate me on my book, but he is the grand marshal of the nat... You get into some weird stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, it's, it's wild.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I don't know....I don't know what this is. You're the grand marshal of the Nation's Parade. It is... now what I know about it. It's the closing ceremony of the four-year long program honoring the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Correct.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Now.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Wow. How'd you get to be the Grand Marshall?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it seems that they went to numerous corporate people in America and a lot of people didn't step up to the plate.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You did.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I've, I've been involved very strongly with the Vietnam Veterans, and I guess to a certain...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> By the way Donald Trump is a Vietnam veteran, and served in that war and, uh...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I did?
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I was gonna say, wait a minute? I don't remember...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And personally killed... personally wiped out three villages and killed like 50 gooks. Himself.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh boy. Howard...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You got how many kills?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Howard, you'll never change.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> How many kills you got Donald? How many kills? Brag a little. Come on.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Kills, well they're usually kills from you know, like New York business vicinity.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yeah, but you've killed your, you've killed your share, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I guess I've thought about it. Anyway...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right. And let me tell you something. Even, all the businesses Donald Trump own you never held a grudge. You would even employ the Vietnamese.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will absolutely. No question of that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> He would. He does. Very big of you. Even though...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It might not be too easy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, you know, during the Vietnam War, I got very lucky. I had a very high lottery number.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yes, you and Jackie the Joke Man.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Jackie, did get lucky also?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, he had that...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We were watching the same television set many years ago.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Jackie actually convinced the doctor that he had a bad knee. I love that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that was a good job Jackie. But...
<Jackie Martling> <Positive> Thank you Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I've always felt a little bit guilty, but I help a lot, I guess, the Vietnam Vets. And there's, nobody is thankful of them, Howard. It's been interesting. Because, you know, you do so get to so many charities and everything. And...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And about 15 seconds after it's over, they forget. The Vietnam vets have never forgotten.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Now I see, I see that other people are involved in the you. Ed Asner, Red Buttons, Ossie Davis, James Garner ...I write about him in my book. I call... what do I call him? I don't even remember. I... I... so many vicious things I call him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why? You don't like James Garner?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He's an animal.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Is he really?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> He's an animal. Don't talk to him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Really. No, he sounds like... I always thought he was a good guy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'll... I'll read you what I wrote about it. Does anybody have a copy of the book? [Inaudible] thank you Jackie.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Poor James Garner. He needs this right? All over the Nation's Day Parade, this is what he gets.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well, here, wait, I'll tell you what I wrote. Tell me if you think it was too harsh.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Now here's what James Garner said about me. He said "Howard Stern is the epitome of trailer trash. He is absolute slime. Every time I see him
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I would say that that's not very nice.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Now, you want to know what I said?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Oh, I can imagine.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I took the high road.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Laughs]
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No I really did.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> The high road on the low road?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm sure you took the high road. Nobody takes the high road.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I did. I said I can't believe this guy wants to go to war with me. He should be busy worrying if he's going to have a solid bowel movement. And that was the end of it. I mean that is the high road for me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, am I supposed to give you, give him your regards when I see him?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Please do. No... No harm no foul.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay, so now we've got Jamie Garner totally destroyed over this parade, Robin. Now that he's got...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I know. I don't know how you're going to handle that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Who else does Howard dislike? Yeah right, out of the celebrities, who else does Howard dislike?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, Donald...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Is Kathie Lee Gifford going to be there?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, Kathie Lee Gifford.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what, can I tell you? On that one. I know her, well, she's really nice Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I bet she is.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm telling you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Let me read to you what I wrote about Kathie Lee.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh no.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Let me read to you what I wrote about Kathie Lee.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, she's great. Go ahead.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> On the first page of the book, I call her the C word. No, you know what, a woman from Entertainment Tonight asked me last night. She said to me, is there anyone you really hate? Like Kathie Lee Gifford. I said, I don't hate Kathie Lee Gifford. I don't hate her, but she is everything that is wrong with show business.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You really believe that?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, she is the epitome of this vapid sort of, oh, you know, like, the other day they had her on the cover of USA Today hugging a black baby, and with a big smile on her.... I don't know, she's the epitome of every sort of, she's almost like a presidential candidate. She doesn't really say anything to offend anyone. She's milquetoast. Everything is beautiful. My son watches Bible tapes. I'm raising him to be, I don't know what she's raising him to be. I only hope that kid grows up, you know, to be an alcoholic, so I can say, look Kathie Lee didn't do such a good job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't know, I don't know James Garner, so I can't disagree. But I'll tell you what, on Kathie Lee, who I know, and Frank...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You do know Frank?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's absolutely a great guy.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, Frank I write beautiful things about.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what I'd... I know, I can imagine. But I would, I would love... I'm gonna set up a lunch for you, Frank and Kathie. This is a good story.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> That would be the art of the deal, Donald. You can [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now let me ask you this, okay...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> If you could do that, you should do it, you should do it at Trump Plaza... and... it's no longer Trump Plaza. You should do it at the Taj Mahal, and we'll make it a pay-per-view special.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Let me ask you. Would you show for that kind of a lunch? Let's say, we had Kathie Lee and Frank. Would you be there?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I don't think I'm that brave. You know, listen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're really good people.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm a really good guy who I appreciate you doing this for all us vets. I'm a guy who was in the jungles of Vietnam and I did three tours of duty, and I'm going to tell you something: I was less scared being in Vietnam than I was thinking of the idea of sitting down to lunch with Kathie Lee and Frank.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Ah Jeez.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I got to tell you I got you something.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have to change your mind on those two.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Let me tell you something: bringing peace to Beirut would be easier.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You go to Dayton and talk to those people about Bosnia.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. I can do that if you want to... if you want me sitting down doing that. I mean, first of all, she would never sit down with me, number one. She...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I'm saying that Donald should try to make it happen. I don't think...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, let's say, Robin, let's say I made it happen. Let's say, just by luck I made it happen.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Would Howard be there?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I don't think he can take it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he'd like him. If you got to know him, you'd like him, I'm telling you.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I think I'd rather...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't say this about a lot of people, Howard, hey Howard, I'm almost as sick as you.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Let me tell you something. Manson...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I dislike people by the dozen. This is a good women and he's a, he's an unbelievable guy. I mean, it's really a nice family.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Manson before Kathie Lee. I would rather sit down with him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Wow.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I will send Robin, who I've changed her name to Robine...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> No no no no no.....
<Howard Stern> <Positive> She is the great peacemaker.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Robin, we'll do this as a first step.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, let Robin meet with them and we'll go...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I've got to listen to to all the things they have to say about what you said about them?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well, listen, you're no innocent yourself.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. I'm gonna, we'll work on Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well, listen. Donald Trump will be the grand marshal of the Nation's Parade. Now, I assume that this is going to happen somewhere.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> This is happening in New York on the 11 o'clock on Saturday. it's up 5th Avenue...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Oh...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're gonna close down 5th Avenue?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I know, can you imagine?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Oh, for God's sake...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> At least... at least it's a Saturday.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Anyway, it's 11 o'clock on Saturday up 5th Avenue, it starts around 42nd, 43rd street and it goes all the way up towards the 80s and it will...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Will there be floats?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There will be a few floats. But...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Now as grand marshall...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ...but there's gonna be... there's over 110,000 people. It's gonna be the largest parade in the history of New York City from what they tell me.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Will there be an underdog float?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Uh...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I love Underdog.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Underdog, over dog.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Wait a minute, no. I want to know as grand marshal, is there are special costume?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Ooh, you gonna be one of those goofy hats?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm supposed to wear short shorts. I think, one of those little things that you put over your breasts?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, like a breastplate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, like... that the women wear during the cheerleading sessions.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> What are you going to wear? You going to have a big...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have... I have no idea. I'm just gonna walk down the parade because, you know, they are really incredible people.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> But let me ask you a question.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> It is a good cause and everything and we should honor the Vietnam vets.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well this isn't only the Vietnam vets. This is really the World War II vets.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's all vets. As far as I'm concerned, it's all vets.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So the point is: if they hand you a giant hat with a fez on top of it...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Like you're the grand poobah.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> And the horns.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And the horns on it. Will you wear it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll wear anything they want me to wear.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You really will?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> 110,000 soldiers.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> That's fantastic.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Joint Chiefs of Staff. I mean...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You know what, you know what you ought to do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is great.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You want to have fun?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You set off a few firecrackers and watch the vets... the vets will go bonkers.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And watch everyone run?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Everyone will get a flashback. It's gonna be giant flashback.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> These guys, I'll tell you what. These are brave guys.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> These are the bravest guys.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A lot braver than me.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Let me tell you something. I served alongside these kind of men, and I'm going to tell you something. They deserve to be honored. A lot of them... hey listen. I served with guys who...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You could be there since you're a vet.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> A lot of guys who served boats during Vietnam, they never saw any action.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But I'm going to tell you something. I'm talking about the grunts now, the guys who were in there, in the jungle.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> On the ground. Taking fire.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Not on a boat sitting and painting the cabin. I'm talking about... these are the bravest men alive today.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I agree with you Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> And I can't believe it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I agree. So are you going to march?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I cannot. I'm out promoting my book.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Forget the book. Forget it. It's gonna be the number one bestseller. Is it number one yet?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, I think it will debut at number one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean even if you only had, you know, when my book first came out, it it also went to number one. But the problem was, the first week, it was only out for two out of seven days.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So you're probably out for two or three out of seven days.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's all.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You've got to hit number one even in two days.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, I certainly hope so.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think you will. How did the O.J. picture work out?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well, take a look at the back of the cover. I mean everyone is reacting to it. And in fact, that was a guy who wrote me that, in fact he was on a train, he had just bought the book. He was reading the book, and he didn't realize there were black people sitting across from him on the train looking at the back of the book, and they started... they started yelling at him.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Tell him though what it says across the picture.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Howard Stern, getting... then it says, "Getting Away With Murder."""
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, wow.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> With me and O.J. It's like a phony book cover. So if you don't like the picture of me, you can make that your book cover.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Alright, that's, that's...
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> It's very inventive.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the whole thing is just terrible.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, yes it was.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Does it get worse?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Will O.J. be at the grand... at the national?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No I don't think so.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You don't think so.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I have a feeling probably not. I have a feeling he won't be.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You know it's funny. I can't believe O.J. did to his wife what I did to so many Vietcong. And, you know...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, It is amazing you get away with it Howard. You're the only one. You're the only one. I sit here and listen.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> Listen, Donald...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Every time I call Howard I get in trouble and all I do is listen Robin. And they say...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Who do you get into trouble with?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...where I was a part... Listen... hey Robin, I was part of a conversation.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> That's right
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I listen. I didn't fight him. Oy, yoi yoi..
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Donald, no, I think it's admirable that you are part of this parade.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'd be honored if you would wear my gook testicle necklace that I made while I was in Vietnam.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oy yoi yoi.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> If you would wear it. But I want to say something that it is important to remember all the vets. I happen to agree with you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That is true.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And I think it's admirable that you are there, and you're not just, you know, busy with your life like I am and ignore them.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> And, and Donald can't wear that necklace Howard, because that would mean you were engaged or something.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No, I don't think so.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Robin, now you're... why don't you march Robin? C'mon.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Robin, I'm surprised you [Inaudible]
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Where am I this Saturday Howard?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> You're horseback riding. She has a horseback riding lesson.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, forget it. I don't believe in horseback riding.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> No in all seriousness, can I say...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're too strong... They're too strong and too big Robin.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> They're too strong and too big Robin.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true, they are big and strong.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I'm not saying this to protect Robin's image, but on Saturday you know Robin volunteers at a AIDS, babies with AIDS crack den.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's good. You know what...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Seriously she does. And I know that she has that commitment and she doesn't like to talk about it on the air.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How's she doing with her new boyfriend? You were talking about her new boyfriend, that you were late for dinner like an hour and a half late for the poor guy, Robin. And I never heard the ending to this. Did you ever go out with him?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> We are going to get together.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You mean you still haven't? That was like four weeks ago.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Well, you know, there were a lot of traveling involved.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> C'mon Robin. He sounds like a nice guy.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Actually, he called me. He heard Robin yelling at me this morning and he said he wants to cancel the date. He got scared off.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The guy waited an hour and a half. She never showed up. Robin you really have to give him a shot.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> It was not Robin's fault showing up late. It was his fault.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> You know what Howard? You're just being too nice. You don't have to make excuses for me. It was an accident. Forget about it. There's no way to make up for...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yes. Absolutely. You... No... It was not your fault. They didn't tell you what time...
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> There's no way to make up for what you wrote in black and white Howard. So, that's it. That's done.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I see. I offer no apologies. The thing that I'm insulted about... But Robin doesn't like what I wrote about her in my new book. But I will... The reason I am insulted by this...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> See he always manages now to find a way to...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Donald, can I tell you why I am insulted?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Because Robin will not allow me to tell you why. Because that she would even think I have a vicious bone in my body toward her.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That she would think that I somehow have ill feelings toward her, hurts me so much so greatly that I can't even.. I can barely talk to you.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Well, you know, we're both... we're both having problems, aren't we?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I'm not really talking to you, and you're not really talking to me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now Robin, seriously... he wrote something offensive to you?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes, Robin did not like what I wrote.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I can't believe it. That's...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, I... maybe it's my ineffectiveness as a writer, but I meant some very nice things about Robin, but she has taken umbrage with.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Uh oh. I think Robin's probably right too.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah. You would think...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hey Robin, I'm gonna try...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You would think I was [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right. You know how it is.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, every once in a while it's a little tough...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I mean today's been a rough day for me and Robin. In fact, today I had to call O.J.'s and ask him to be my co-host, because it would have been easier going.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Robin, I can't believe this.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> I can't believe it either.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> So what is Ivana selling on...Hey, let me ask you something, Donald. Do you ever secretly tune in QVC and watch Ivana sell that jewelry?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I did. I did actually last week.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> The Home Shopping Channel.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I did last week and I watched her for about a minute and a half.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And what happened? You threw up?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Oh c'mon man, Isn't it kind of tacky? It is kind of tacky.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know... I kind of respect... somebody else would have said [Inaudible], take the money. She took money and she still continues to work, okay? Most people would have taken the money and not worked.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> And gone home, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, you have to, you know, to me, I respect that quality.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> But it is a little tacky.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd say, well...
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> And what about her advice... she has an advice column in The Globe.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> She can't give that up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That one is tacky. I think it's okay if you sell something on home shopping whatever, but the Globe and the advice column, I think she could have done without that.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yeah, you're not kidding. As a matter of fact, she couldn't hold on to a great guy like you, so what kind of advice can she give to me?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I wasn't that easy though, Howard. It wasn't a picnic.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Aw, c'mon.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She didn't have a picnic.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, yes she did.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> But what kind of advice can she give...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Although she had an economic picnic.
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> That's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But in every other way, probably not the greatest.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> And she is selling everything. I tune in the other night, I didn't even tell Robin this. I don't know if you saw it. She was selling a hologram of Donald on the toilet.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Oh no.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> I swear to you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not surprised.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You can have him in 3D in your house.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And by the way, I didn't say this, but please give my love to Marla.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I will.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Who has gotten better looking with marriage.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's good. That's good. That's a good sign, because it can go the other way also.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> You know what I love best about Marla? You know what I love about Marla?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Tell me.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> This is not lewd. No accent. Because, I love... you know that can make you bonkers after a while.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That... Especially when they're asking for money.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> That's it. Where is my money, The Donald?
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> You know, whenever I do hear that accent, I do laugh.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You know what it was? When, when Donald was on the ski slopes and he first met Ivana, that was downright attractive. It was cute. It was different. He brought her home to the family. Ooh, she's so European, what a novelty. And then all of a sudden ,a couple of years later, it becomes where is my money.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> The Donald.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Where is my money. It's not so cute anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you understand life.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, I know it. I know it. And let me tell you something, I would love to know the volumes you took up with your new pre-nup. I mean, this a smart man.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's very long. It's very complex.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> The transcript is longer than the Watergate hearing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well it's complex. Hopefully, not too complex.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Well, I'll tell you something. That Ivana changed with marriage, and that's why Donald is not at fault and that's why Donald is not at fault with that divorce. I've always said it.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Very rarely do you say that.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yup, I rarely say that. I usually blame the man. But...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the world was against me and said what a horrible guy I was, Howard was right out there. In fact that, I did that crazy program we you had me with everybody.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're damn right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was one of the wild... You know, you go on live television, Robin. You're supposed to be a little bit nervous. This is the first time I've ever, like, done something totally, like, where I'm totally laughing so hard, you couldn't respond.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I put you at ease.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He hit me with every woman in the world.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Is that right?
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I sure did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I was... women that I never even heard of before.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Oh, yeah sure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And they all they all looked good.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well listen...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They all looked good.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You're a man that's been through a lot. I think a lot of guys can relate to what your situation was in marriage. No I think so.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Wait a minute. How can you relate?
<Howard Stern> <Neutral> I tell you how I relate, because...
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> Are you saying everyone... Donald lives a different life...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Because the very... Everyone. Let me tell you something Robin. He's rich. Some people are poor, some people are middle income. I'm not talking about the wealth. I'm talking about the marriage. And, and what this whole concept of what was cute when you first meet a girl usually becomes the one thing that irritates you most. One day ,the accent is cute, and the next day you're married to Dracula's sister. It works that way. And the guys know what I'm talking about.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know...
<Howard Stern> <Negative> One day you have a boner...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Robin, the guy has an insight on life that's like scary.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> ...and the next day you're calling immigration. You know what I'm saying? Am I right? Am I right Mr. Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Ah, Howard, you're right, you're right. I agree.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Donald Trump is doing something good. He is the grand marshal of the Nation's Parade. It is the closing ceremony of the four-year long program honoring the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II where all vets will be honored this Saturday. There will be a parade. Come out and honor the vets. And you know I would be there if I wasn't going to that indoor pool this weekend.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> Yes, but your shrapnel wound is acting up.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Yes it is. But I served, so I have a right. But now actually, congratulations.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It'll be good.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> It sounds like a lot of fun.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, it's going to be a beautiful day. And they deserve it. They deserve it more than I do Howard, I can tell you that.
<Robin Quivers> <Negative> I might rollerblade through the parade.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know what, you should Robin. You're right there. Why don't you get the guy that you stood up. Get him. Bring him along.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Let me tell you something Donald. Robin has been rollerblading and horseback riding. Been doing a very vigorous routine, and she's thinking of actually putting the horse on rollerblades, and rollerblading into the parade.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Forget it Robin. The horses are too dangerous. I see too many... I have all my friends that are up in Bedford. They ride horses...
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Right
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They fall on their ass. They're all over the place.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Yeah, I mean, you know, look at poor Christopher Reeve.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They can... the horse has no... yeah, poor Christopher. The horse has no clue.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> By the way, I want to say something nice about Donald that nobody knows. When Christopher Reeve was injured on that horse, Donald went over to the hospital, he was one of the first people who went in there and donated a tremendous amount of medical equipment to Christopher Reeve's recovery.
<Robin Quivers> <Neutral> You know that for a fact?
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Oh, I do. How's that buddy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's pretty nice Howard.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Well, that's your payback for giving me the back cover of my book.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm thinking about that. Did that photographer ever try to hold you up for money.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> Not at all.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Howard Stern> <Negative> You must put the fear of God in him.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I put it in him.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> Okay, very good. Thank you Donald Trump and good luck...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have a good time Howard. Good luck with the book, and Robin, let me know how you like the guy.
<Robin Quivers> <Positive> Alright.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm really curious.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> And congratulations on being the grand marshal of the Nation's Parade.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you Howard. And I'll see you soon. Say hello to the family.
<Howard Stern> <Positive> I certainly will.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Alright, goodbye.
