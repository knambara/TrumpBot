<John King> <Positive> Tall billings are no stranger to one of two entrepreneurial titans I met with to discuss the decade. The other is reaching for the stars. Donald Trump and Sir Richard Branson, who perhaps surprisingly see eye-to-eye on one thing.[Begin Video Clip]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We are rapidly declining as a nation, in my opinion. [End Clip, Begin New Video Clip]
<Richard Branson> <Negative> America is a weak country at the moment. [End Clip]
<John King> <Negative> But their solutions could not be more different. I began my conversation with Donald Trump by asking what he thought we as a country got right these past 10 years, if anything. [Begin Interview]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very little. We got very little right. We are in two wars that we shouldn't have been in. At least one of them, definitely, we shouldn't have been in. We are losing ground rapidly to other countries, in particular China, but to other countries. We are rapidly declining as a nation, in my opinion, very strongly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we are just not doing very well. And people talk about jobs, but you can't have jobs when our products are made outside of the United States.
<John King> <Negative> Compared to the beginning of the decade, now that we're at the end of a decade, a steady decline on the test that you just laid out? Any bright spots in there?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I would say it's been a steady decline. It's been a solid, steady decline. And the decline is really taking place because other places in the world, which heretofore didn't really exist from an economic standpoint, you know, as competitors, they are just eating our lunch. And I see things happening that I've never seen before in terms of -- in terms of our economy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I sort of -- I don't smile because there's nothing to smile about, but I do listen to the economists and various of the morning shows, and they talk about jobs. And they say, how do you create jobs? They say, well, job growth, job growth. But how do you create jobs when China is making our furniture, when I order curtain walls and the glass is ordered from China, curtain walls for buildings, when so many other products are made outside of the United States?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Toys are made outside of the United States. They used to be made in the United States. Furniture is made -- tremendous amounts of furniture comes in from other countries, in particular, China. And we're rebuilding other countries. And nobody seems to do anything about it. And nobody really picks up the mantle.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, I'm very strong on it. I'll do your program. I'll do other programs. I'll talk about how China is taking advantage of this country.
<John King> <Positive> But what do you do about it? Whether it's your view that they're cheating or just that they are eating our lunch because they're faster, more nimbler, smarter, what do we do about it in this country? I assume you don't support protectionism. One answer would be just to wall off the country. But where does that get you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, no. I would tax Chinese products. Now, when you say cheating, they are cheating, because they're manipulating their currency. It's very hard for this country to compete -- companies within the country -- to compete with Chinese companies and the nation because, in many cases, some of these companies are the nation because of the manipulation of the currency.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I read the other day a little article that China is starting to make airplanes. And now they're going to make a plane to compete with the Boeing 737. And they're going to throw them out like gravy. And they have 100 orders already. This is the first. To be honest with you, I wouldn't want to own stock in Boeing, because between manipulation of their currency and other things, it's going to be very hard for Boeing and Airbus and others to compete.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's just a little article I read where they're making -- watch what happens. I hope you can rebroadcast this in five years. Boeing will suffer. Now, we think, oh, Boeing is a great exporter, and that's fine. And by the way, if our planes are better, and everything else, we'll still -- they're still going to have to buy them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Even if we do something with -- what I advocate -- I advocate a 25 percent tax on all Chinese products coming into this country. And if you do that, you know, people say, oh, but they're our banker. Sure, they're our banker, because we're giving them so much money. Think of it. We're giving them so much money, and then they're loaning it back to us.
<John King> <Neutral> So why won't the political leadership do something?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, I can only think of one thing because it makes so much sense. It's so simple. And I went to the Wharton School of Finance. I understand economics. It's so simple. I can only understand -- really think of one thing. Whether it's OPEC or China, it's called lobbyists. OPEC has the biggest, most powerful lobbyists in Washington.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I believe those lobbyists get the politicians to leave OPEC alone.
<John King> <Negative> If 9/11 is one big legacy of the last decade -- and it's the biggest, I would think -- another is the banking crisis. If there's a guy out there in middle America right now who wants to be the next Donald Trump, and has a good idea, can he get the money? TRUMP: John, I see it all the time, where people sign for a house, they put down a deposit, then they end up losing that deposit because they can't get a mortgage.
<John King> <Negative> And it's just as bad today as it was a year ago. And it's sort of interesting, because the regulators are very tough on the banks. And yet the banks, you know -- the banks took in all of this money. And if you want to just say, metaphorically, they took in the people's money, and now they're not loaning it back to the people.
<John King> <Negative> So I'm very disappointed in the banking industry. I think it's terrible, what's happened. But I will say, if you want to start a business, if you want to open -- now, if you have a company, a great company that has a AAA standard, then you get money for nothing. It's unbelievable. The interest rates are so low.
<John King> <Positive> But the only people that can get -- in theory, when you can't get money, the interest rates should be through the roof like they were many years ago, where the prime rate went up to, like, 18.5 percent. You couldn't get money, so, therefore, the rate went up. Here, you can't get money, and yet the rate is like -- I'm getting on CDs now less than one percent -- substantially less than one percent.
<John King> <Negative> I've never seen that before, and yet there's no money around.
<John King> <Positive> All right. Thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. [End Interview]
