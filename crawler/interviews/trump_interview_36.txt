<Moon Griffon> <Positive> How y'all are? Welcome to the Moon Griffon Show, as we rock and roll and of course, another beautiful day in Louisiana and boy, we are honored to have our special guest today, and it is, folks, the President of the United States, President Donald Trump. Mr. President, God bless. Thank you for coming to Louisiana and trying to help us out here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you very much and I have to tell you, Moon, you have a great reputation. All my friends down there -- I have a lot of them -- they're saying, call Moon. So, it's an honor to do your show.
<Moon Griffon> <Positive> Well, thank you, sir. Thank you so much. I promise you, it's mine. You know Mr. President, here's what I need you to help us with. We're in a great state. We -- people really love you here, and we had 340,000 people stay home in the first round during the Governor's election that voted for Donald Trump, Mr. President, and what do you tell the people here about how important this election is? Talk to your people, and let them know how important this is, not only to you, but for the state of Louisiana.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, Eddie is going to be a fantastic Governor. He was a tremendous businessman. Everybody knows him down there. He's really a household name pretty much anyway, but he was -- he was great, and you have a Governor, John Bel Edwards who's not -- who wasn't doing the job. The taxes are too high.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's got a couple of states that can't be -- that there's nothing you can say about him. Car insurance is the highest in the country, the worst, and the highest, you can't even get it, and that's, you know, unlike a lot of states where it's very, very cheap and plentiful. Another thing is you're rated number 50 out of 50 for economic development, and if you look at it, like, I was down recently.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I opened up a tremendous plant for the LNG, a tremendous one, of the biggest in the world, now they're going to double it up, I understand. But, even including all of that, you're at the bottom of the pack on economic development, and your taxes are way too high. So, you know, it's that -- he's the Governor.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's done a lousy job, and Eddie will do a fantastic job. He'll -- he'll be a tremendous Governor. He's just, you know, he's a dynamic guy, and he's -- he's somebody that really people like. They like him, and I like him and I'll be helping him a lot, I hope.
<Moon Griffon> <Negative> Well, you know, Mr. President, the Governor, just going back to the current Governor, and you did a speech that -- and you hit it on the head. I've been covering this for 26 years. I've never seen a Governor lie this much of my life. He's lied about taxes. He's lied about the budget. You know, it's an amazing thing.
<Moon Griffon> <Negative> You're a gentlemen that's going to understand this, because you're a business guy, but you know he keeps saying he inherited a bad budget. He inherited bad budget. Well, he was a legislator for eight years. He voted for six of the eight budgets, Mr. President. So that's not an inheritance. You know, when my aunt died, I came into --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Moon Griffon> <Positive> -- $25,000. That was an inheritance. But my car note, and my house note, I put my name on it. Governor was a floor leader for the previous administration. He -- he helped vote for this, yet he's -- he gets it away -- gets away with it, because of the same thing that happens to you. Our media is so one-sided.
<Moon Griffon> <Negative> They give nobody else a chance, and they've been pushing him, and -- and you know, when you talk about lies, he has lied so much and that's my frustration with the whole thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he got a little bit lucky to win. You know, he had sort of a crazy race, and there was somebody running that was, I don't know, wasn't maybe a great candidate, and he got -- he sort of lucked in. He hasn't done a good job, and you know, frankly, having somebody like Eddie, where he's friendly with the President, and -- and you work with federal government as opposed to fighting federal government -- I see it all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Having a relationship is a very important thing with the federal government, especially like, especially for a state like Louisiana, where there's so many things, and so many big federal projects, and the potential, but having that relationship is a very positive thing for the state, and I tell you what: he'll be a fantastic Governor.
<Moon Griffon> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he'll be -- I think Eddie will be a fantastic -- you've got to get your car insurance down. You've got to get your taxes down and you've got to get -- you know, look, the country is doing phenomenally well, but they're rated 50 out of 50 --
<Moon Griffon> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- in terms of economic development. That's not good. That's not good.
<Moon Griffon> <Positive> No. Mr. President, you know, you -- you -- by the way, if you're just joining us, we're speaking live with President Donald Trump. He's talking a little bit about the Louisiana election and, Mr. President, you know the one thing you did when you went in was you changed our economy, and it's really been changed.
<Moon Griffon> <Negative> Louisiana has lagged so far behind. Outmigration is still there. We're losing jobs. You helped the energy sector really grown. I know you mentioned LNG, but oil and gas here has died because of the lawsuits and the trial lawyers, and --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Moon Griffon> <Positive> We have no tort reform and yet, look what you did. So our state has went along a little bit with the national economy, but we kind of trail it. We used to lead it, now. we trail it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yup.
<Moon Griffon> <Negative> And, I think what you're talking about is a -- It's a good thing. We just need to get there. We can't get there with John Bel Edwards.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, you have a couple of advantages. [4:30] Number one, you have two great senators, and they're both going to be there tonight, by the way, but you have two great -- I mean those two guys are phenomenal people too, but they love your state and they produce. That's a big advantage. You know, I have states where it's like, I'm not -- I'm not exactly in love with people that are representing the state, and it's harder for a state.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you have two great senators. You have a great location, and that location is important. You look at where you are, that's why we could do LNG plants, where you couldn't do them in other locations. I mean, they wouldn't work. You couldn't do 'em. So you have so many advantages because of where you are, and that location that, I think, will turn that around.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If Eddie gets in, I think we'll turn that around so fast, Moon, your head will spin.
<Moon Griffon> <Positive> Yeah, and I think that's important. We just losin' the best and brightest kids to jobs. I mean, Texas has taken a lot of people, and you know we lost -- I don't know if you know this, Mr. President. We lost two congressmen over the last 20 years. The census next year is going to be important -- it's going to be important to have a Republican Governor looking over that census, and talk a little bit about how important that is, not only for that, but also for your re-election next year.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I won Louisiana by a lot ,and it was, you know, it was something really, it was great. I love the state, I love the people, I love the whole thing, and that's why I'm involved here, and I think that we're going to have a tremendous rally tonight. It's going to be in Monroe. But, you know, I'm doing two rallies.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm doing one now for early voting, because, you know, early voting in your state is 30, 40 percent. I was shocked. It's one of the highest in the country. People vote early. They go hunting over the weekend. I don't blame them. My sons would like to go with them, okay? But -- so, we do one that we're doing tonight in Monroe, it will be a really big rally, and then again, before before the end, you know, before Election Day, I'm coming in. I think it's the Thursday instead of the Friday.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we're coming into Thursday before, we're going to do another big one, in a little bit of a different part of the state, and I think that's now being finalized and set up.
<Moon Griffon> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm actually coming in twice, because I think it's so important. Normally, you wouldn't do that for a Governor --
<Moon Griffon> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You do it for a Senator, you know, if you're President.
<Moon Griffon> <Positive> Yes sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But, I know Eddie. I know -- I know how he's going to turn the state around so fast, and that's -- that's good for our two great guys that are working so hard, and so I'm -- I'm going all out for Eddie. I think we'll have a big -- hopefully, we'll have a big impact. You know, he's a great businessman. He knows how to make money,and that's what -- it's the same thing I mean for the state.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's actually easier for government than it is if you're private, I mean, to be honest with you, it's easier. So, we're going to do a job.
<Moon Griffon> <Positive> Yeah, Mr. President, he -- he reminds me a lot of you, when he comes from the business side of the community, and I'm going to be honest with you. The biggest thing Louisiana needs right now is a totally different business culture.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Moon Griffon> <Negative> It's the only state, since about 2004,, 2005 that GDP has grown half as much as state government. You can't have that. It's catching up with us, and that's why -- that's why Edwards has raised all his taxes, and -- but Rispone has an opportunity to change the state and you -- and you hit that on the head.
<Moon Griffon> <Positive> By the way, the event that you're gonna be coming to next week, I think, it is at the CenturyLink in the Shreveport-Boosier area, which is another big area, and those people need to hear you.That's your voters as well in the state of Louisiana.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Moon Griffon> <Positive> So, I just want you to keep encouraging -- one more time, and I know you got to go in a minute -- but encourage our voters one last time how important this is with everything going on.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think if you have the right Governor, and Eddie's the guy, I mean, look, there's not going to be anybody better in the country. He's smart, he's good, he's a good person. I just helped a lot. I picked up 19 to 20 points, a gentleman from Kentucky. The problem is, he was, you know, not a popular guy, but he was a great Governor.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He did a good job, but he wasn't popular, and I actually picked him up by 19 or 20 points. But now I guess it's in dispute, the final race, it's very interesting. It was a -- it was sort of a long shot. But -- but you know, you still need that -- that way, and Eddie's got that way, he's got the combination.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he's going to be fantastic. Look, your taxes are too high. Your car insurance -- that's all I hear about. With Louisiana, I don't know what it is, because you know, you go to other states, you never hear the words car insurance, or auto insurance, but all I hear about down there is car insurance, and so I bring it up. But your car insurance is -- is way through, it's, I mean, your much higher than anyplace else.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't even know why, but it's -- it's a Governor. You have to have the right Governor. Taxes are too high. Your economic development isn't good enough -- that's jobs, but it's not good enough, and you number 50 in the nation. Now one other thing with Eddie: he loves your military. You're big with the military down there.
<Moon Griffon> <Positive> Yes sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he loves your military. He loves your vets. You know, I got them choice, so they have now choice. They can go see a private doctor if they're -- if they have to wait on line too long, they go out and see a private doctor. I also got accountability, where you can get rid of people that aren't taking care of our vets.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, there was no way with civil service and unions that you could do that. But Eddie is going to be a great -- he will do a fantastic job, and you match up the three of them, your two Senators and your Governor ,and you're going to have a tremendous -- you'll have an unbeat -- you won't to have a better combination in the country.
<Moon Griffon> <Positive> Well, Mr -- Mr. President, before I let you go, the last thing I'll tell you, and this is kind of on the light side. I've got -- I've heard from people -- 'cause we announced that you were coming on. I've heard from people I ain't heard from in 30 years. But you know what a lot of them are asking mee to ask you, you ready?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What? Yes.
<Moon Griffon> <Positive> Mr. President, when you go to LSU-Alabama game, wear an LSU hat. [Laughs]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, that's funny. That's funny. Well, you know what? I love -- I love football. I love those two states, those two states. You know, Alabama has been very good. I think I won it by 42 points.
<Moon Griffon> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Which is like, unheard of, and you guys, I won it by tremendous also, sort of like that. And, it's going to be great. I think I better remain neutral on that one, Moon. [Laughter] What do you think? Should I take a little bit of a neutral position? [Crosstalk] But we're going to have a good game. Who's favored to win that game?
<Moon Griffon> <Positive> Right now, Alabama's favored by six, but LSU is up in the Power Rankings. All the experts are picking LSU, but Alabama is really good, and Nick Saban is good --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Your quarterback -- is your quarterback as good as they say? They say he's great.
<Moon Griffon> <Positive> Oh, Burrow, Burrow's had a really, really awesome year, Mr. President. Great shot at being the Heisman Trophy -- I think if they win this game, go defeated, he's gonna be the Heisman winner, but, look, Alabama's good. It's gonna be a lot of fun. I had to mess with you on at least on one question, but listen, Mr. President, it's been an honor, been a great pleasure.
<Moon Griffon> <Positive> We will see you tonight I'll be in Monroe tonight.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good, Moon, I'll look for you, and you just take care. We're gonna have a great night, and we'll see you vote Eddie. He's good man. He's going to do a job. He's going to do a job like you wouldn't believe.
<Moon Griffon> <Positive> All right, Mr. President, God bless. Thank you so much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you Moon. Take care of yourself.
<Moon Griffon> <Positive> Yup, thank you. Yes sir. All right, that is the President Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How are you?
<Paul Murray> <Neutral> Mr. President, how are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi Paul.
<Paul Murray> <Positive> G'Day. Paul Murray. Lovely to meet you sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nice to see you. Good. Nice to see you.
<Paul Murray> <Positive> You had a good day with -- with your Aussie mates?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We had a great day with your great Prime Minister. Really something special. We had a special day, and right behind you, we're having an evening celebrating Australia.
<Paul Murray> <Negative> What -- what do you want to say to your many Australian supporters who wish you nothing but the best in November 2020?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's a great country. I think that it's one of the truly great countries, actually, a beautiful place. I was there, and I was there a couple of times --  have a lot of friends there. Have a lot of friends here from Australia, and very special people. Very strong, great people, and we're going to have a fantastic night tonight celebrating Australia at the White House.
<Paul Murray> <Negative> You wouldn't have seen it, because you were in -- in full -- full engagement mode, but there was one of a [Inaudible] in our Prime Minister's face when you were taking on part of the fake news media today.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [Laughs]
<Paul Murray> <Positive> You look like you had fun in there today in the Oval?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have fun but it's -- we have a very strange media group of people, and they don't always put the truth out, and we like the truth, and -- and you, by the way, speaking of truth, you have very good references, I have to tell you that.
<Paul Murray> <Positive> [Laughs] Thank you sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have very good references. But, no, we had a good time. We had a great day. It was a really an amazing day that we had, in honor of Australia.
<Paul Murray> <Negative> About China, you know that Australia is -- is invested in both sides of this. What concerns you most about China? Is it tariffs, or the potential of tanks one day?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think really what we have is the trade, but everything equalizes, if you think about it. You know, China's -- we've paid China hundreds of billions of dollars a year, much more than we should have. Other Presidents should have done something about this. But I have a very good relationship with President Xi ,and we'll see if we can work something out. They've had a very rough year. They've had a very, very bad year -- worst in 57 years, and they're losing a lot of jobs. Their supply chain is breaking. We're getting tens of billions of dollars in tariffs, and our economy is doing fantastically well, as is yours, by the way. But our economy is doing fantastically well. So, we'll just keep it going. We'll see what happens. But we're charging China a lot of money now to do business with us.
<Paul Murray> <Negative> You've experienced two Australian Prime Ministers as President. Pretty obviously, you prefer the current one to the former one. Why is that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I liked Malcolm. You're talking about Malcolm.
<Paul Murray> <Positive> Yes sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like Malcolm very much. But I'll tell you: Scott is -- and I really think they're both very good people. But I've had -- I've developed a very special relationship with Scott. He's a great gentleman. Jennifer, his wife, is somebody that loves your country very much, I can tell you that. We spoke for a while, and she truly loves your country. Scott's a very strong man, a very good man, and I think he's somebody that's respected very much in your country, and he had the kind of election that I had, so we have something in common. It was a little bit of a surprise, and it was a very big victory.
<Paul Murray> <Neutral> When are you coming to Australia.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll be there, and I know you have the President's Cup coming, and that's exciting. But I'll be there pretty soon.
<Paul Murray> <Positive> Last one, sir. What's the best thing you've ever ordered from the kitchen downstairs?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they have great food, I will say, but I would say the steak they make here is about as good as it gets, although in Australia, you probably have better come to think of it.
<Paul Murray> <Neutral> We'll try and show it off for you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Paul Murray> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a great honor. Thank you, Paul. Thank you.
<Paul Murray> <Positive> Thank you sir. Thank you sir.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Joining us now is the president of the United States, President Trump. Sir, good to have you back on the program.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi, Sean.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You know, I watched you last night. You seem to really love what you did last night. Explain -- you know, why is this important to you? And why -- there is a phenomenon that people show up at your rallies. We don't see the same thing at the Democratic rallies. Why is that in your view?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There was tremendous energy in that room last night. And there was -- and we’ve had a lot of energy in virtually every rally. But there was just a special energy. I announced we are going forward with the second term as you know. But the level -- it was like being at a world championship college football game where the score was tied going into the last minute.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was the entire rally. It was an incredible scene. And outside, there was thousands of people. And, I mean, we were asking people not to show up, we were saying, please don't come, letting the word -- because we had 121,000 people who I guess it holds 20,000 or 25,000 people inside if you include the basketball court which was loaded up with great, loving patriots.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And it was just an electric evening, Sean.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You know, I want to ask you, I don't know if you saw the show on Monday. But Monday, we had our friend Lawrence Jones down there or I guess it was Tuesday night -- no, it was Monday. And it looked like a tailgating party and people there, 40, 45 hours in the pouring rain before the event. I actually kind of regretted not going because I wanted to hang out with the people outside because they were having a blast.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They are people that love our country and they love seeing what's happening. And it was in a way a tailgate party for the country. Not for a team -- although it's a team when you think about it. But it's a tailgate party for our country. And it was just -- the feeling was -- it was like love. But it's love for what we are all about, for the things we stand for.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was a beautiful -- it was a beautiful evening. It was -- and even the enemies, and, you know, we have a lot of people that don't like us so much. You possibly have heard about that, Sean, I’m not sure, but possibly.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> I might have read about that. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The people were even saying --
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- some say that they never seen anything like it. It was special. And you know it was pouring, they had a monsoon -- I don't think one person walked off line. They had a rain like you haven't seen. And it didn’t -- nobody left. They just sat there and stood there and some brought tents. They were there for two days waiting to get in, incredible evening.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I bought a painting from this guy in Utah. His name is John McNaughton and it was called "The Forgotten Man".
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I have the original copy, I paid a lot of money for it, and I bought it because it mattered to me. If you recall in 2015 and 2016, I told everybody what the Biden-Obama record was after eight years. I said it almost every day on radio and TV for a year, 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more in poverty, worst recovery since the ‘40s, lowest homeownership rate in 51 years, lowest labor participation rate since the ‘70s, more debt than 43 presidents before them combined, and they never hit one year 3 GDP growth, for a year.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And those are all real people. You talked at length about record low unemployment, the best employment situation from 1969. I know that the media talks about Russia still after four investigations, they want a fifth. But what does it mean to you that we now have 2 million more jobs available than people that are on unemployment?
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> What does it mean to you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the media isn't talking about Russia so much. You know, the Mueller report concluded on Russia, there was absolutely no collusion. And, frankly, they led to the conclusion by the great attorney general that there was no obstruction. It’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard. It's a hoax. It was a hoax, a witch hunt, but a hoax, the whole thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Gregg Jarrett said it very well when he named his book "The Russian Hoax." And it's disgraceful that they are allowed, and they are very upset now because it didn't turn out like they thought because we did. We had 18 angry Democrats that hated Trump and many of them contributed to Hillary's campaign. And it came out there was no collusion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, they don’t -- I don't hear Russia much anymore. You know, they've given up on that one. But, you know, they did something that is a disgrace. I will say if the other side had won, if Hillary had won, you would instead of being up almost 50 percent since election, 5 million jobs plus, plus. Five million jobs, that's unthinkable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I would've said we were going to create 5 million jobs in two and half years, people would have said how ridiculous. It would have been skewered by the press. All of the things that have been done that we’ve done, nobody has seen it. We have the best and lowest unemployment rate for African-Americans, for Asians, for Hispanics.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nobody has ever seen numbers like this. We have the best numbers on living standards for African-Americans. The best numbers we have ever had in history. So many things are -- I mean, just one thing after another. If the other side would have won, we would have gone into a depression and we were headed that way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We were headed that way. The rules and regulations -- we've cut more regulations than any president, and unmeaningful regulation. We want regulation, but it's got to be meaningful. It stymied our country, Sean. We weren't able to do anything. Jobs numbers would've been a disaster. Instead, we have more people working today, almost 160 million people than have ever worked in the history of our country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Think of that. That's a great number. So, it’s really been something. The other side, you would've had -- I really you would have had a crash.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You know, Mr. President, I come from blue-collar roots. Ten years in the restaurant business. At 12, I was washing dishes by hand. Ten years in the construction business, every job imaginable. So, I really identify with the forgotten man and women, and I think everybody in this job in the media were overpaid and most of them are lazy.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> And I just want to -- you know, when you think back on those statistics I gave you, it’s 13 million, 8 million, those are real American citizens --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> -- real lives and now they are really doing better. And I think one of the best things that is understated is we are for the first time in 75 years, energy independent, which means we don't have to go kissing the ass of --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> -- countries that don't like us. And we don’t have -- we are now a net exporter of energy. And, by the way, if Putin remains hostile and Russia remains hostile, I think we out-produce them and we bring their economy to its knees.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we are now number one in the world and energy. It used to be Saudi Arabia, then Russia. It’s now -- we’re number one and soon -- as soon as I get the pipelines in Texas approved which I’ll do pretty quickly, it would have taken 10, 15 years. I’m going to have it done quickly. We could increase our production by 30 and 40 percent in terms of sale.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, it’s -- you know, what we have done in the last two and a half years has been great. We've had a lot of great people and they have worked hard. But the great people are the people of the country. They were being strangled. If you look at what we have done, just energy all -- energy all over, all types of energy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> LNG now is -- we are the hottest in the world, there's nobody even close. So, it’s been an honor. It’s been honor. We freed it up. But you would've had, I really believed you would have had a depression or very close had the other side won.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Mr. President, all this -- Devin Nunes wrote a column, who was the former House -- ranking member of the House Intel Committee. In 2014, warning the Biden-Obama administration about Russian interference in the 2016 election, he laid it out perfectly in 2014. This all happened on their watch.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> All of it happened on their watch. And my question to you, is there really was some collusion, wasn’t there? There was Russian interference, we know that. But we also had a bought and paid for Russian dossier.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And we didn't look into that and the whole two plus years of Mueller. The media has ignored it. And even "The New York Times" suggesting it was likely Russian misinformation from the get-go, the dossier. What are your thoughts about that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think it's a disgrace. It’s turned out to be totally discredited. Steele was sued by somebody, I understand a wealthy gentleman in London. I hear what was revealed was incredible, just a total phony deal. And yet, they didn't look into any of that. One of the things that amazes me because it's so simple, and, you know, it’s -- when you get right down to it, the whole thing is very simple what happened.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The fact is they were spying on my campaign, using agencies to -- intelligence agencies to do it, going after Page and George Papadopoulos and probably others. I’m trying to -- we are trying to find out whether or not they actually listened in on my calls, that will be the -- that would be the ultimate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We’ll see what happens. I think if it happened, we’ll probably find out. We have a great attorney general who was working very hard and we’ll see what happens. I stay uninvolved. I like to stay uninvolved. But a lot of things are going to come out. I mean, if they spied on my campaign and they may have, it will be one of the great revelations in history of this country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I will tell you, it's going to be very interesting, I think we’re going to find out. Can you imagine if it were the other way around and I spied on President Obama's campaign? Could you imagine what the repercussions would be? Or I spied on Crooked Hillary's campaign. Can you imagine with the repercussions would be?
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Let me ask you specifically, I want to stay on this topic because I think this abuse of power is very dangerous. You addressed it last night. Sir, your campaign was spied on. In October 2016, Hillary's dossier, bought and paid for Russian dossier, paid for by her and the money she controlled at the DNC that was funneled through a law firm that hired -- op research group that hired a foreign national -- we now know that Bruce Ohr testified behind closed doors that everybody was warned that Christopher Steele hated you, that Hillary paid for it, and that it was not verified.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> That was August of 2016. Fourteen days before Jim Comey signed the first FISA application and a FISA application I’m told says the word "verified" on it. Before he signed it, he was warned by Kathleen Kavalec of the State Department who met with Christopher Steele. So, my question to you is, you are spied on as a candidate, during your transition, as president and then, abroad, we had Stefan Halper spying on Carter Page, Sam Clovis, George Papadopoulos.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> So, those are just ways we have already verified. It’s not in dispute anymore. Your campaign was spied on. Your transition was spied on. Jim Comey, three months after he signed that warrant verifying the Russian dossier bulk of information is true, he then came to Trump Tower and told you it's salacious but unverified -- the opposite of what he was telling the court.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Do you believe there was a premeditated fraud committed against FISA court judges in these applications?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, again, people are looking into that. If you're asking just my opinion, I would say absolutely yes. It would seem to be yes. And, you know, when you get the Strzok-Page, the two lovers who put right out on the public waves, I mean, they put the insurance policy -- well, we have been living through the insurance policy, that she was going to win but just in case she didn't win, we needed an insurance policy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's to subvert government. What they did was unbelievable that they could do a thing like that. And they reported to McCabe who I think is a terrible, terrible guy. And, you know, the FBI, you have some of the finest people in the world, and you know that, and we sat all the time. I bet you if we took a vote, I would be so high in that poll, you wouldn't believe it. They’re great people, I know so many.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But at the top, people were terrible, they were leakers, they were liars. I mean, look at the leaking and look at the lying. Comey admitted he leaked. Think of it, the top of the FBI, he leaked. And when you look at what went on, Sean, it's disgusting. But the whole concept of they wanted insurance policy just in case she loses -- well, that’s what we've lived through.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We’ve lived through the insurance policy. And yet, the House committee which I understand today was in a very close confidential meeting with the wonderful Hope Hicks, she's a wonderful person, she has been through hell. They put this young woman through hell. She has had to pay for legal fees and everything else.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hear they were taking pictures of her. Congressmen, two congressmen in particular that I see on television all the time. I won’t mention their names, we don't want to make them any more famous. But two congressmen -- but they were taking pictures of her --
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Oh, good grief.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- with their cell phone and then leaking the pictures of her testifying. And this was in a closed room. Look, it's out of control. These people are absolutely -- you know, they use the word, it's a good word, I guess -- unhinged -- what has happened to the Democrats, and in the meantime, they’re not doing any work in Congress.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We could do legislation to lower drug prices very substantially, easily. We could maybe almost like the thing we need the most quickly is border security. We've done an incredible job but I have to do it myself. I can’t get any -- we can't get any votes from the Democrats. We can’t get any votes. And infrastructure, we could do it so easily.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they are so busy interviewing Hope Hicks and taking pictures of this incredible young woman and putting the pictures out to the press of her testifying. And they’re not allowed to do that, it's probably illegal. It's a terrible thing going on, Sean.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Sir, there have been four separate investigations, let remind you. The nine-month FBI investigation, the one that Peter Strzok said there's no "there" there. Lisa Page said we had nothing after nine months as it relates to collusion. And there was a House Intel Committee investigation, no collusion. Then, a bipartisan Senate committee, no collusion.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Then the Mueller report, directly quoted it, no collusion, no conspiracy. You -- I had wanted you -- I’m a talk show host, so I sometimes do straight news, we do investigative reporting, sometimes sports and culture. And I give strong conservative opinions. I’ve been a conservative all my career, we don't hide that fact.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> But I have wanted you to declassify the 302s, declassify all this information, the FISA applications, declassify the Gang of Eight, declassify exculpatory information. You have done so but you gave it to the attorney general. Why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, because I think he's a very honorable gentleman who wants to do the right thing. And he is allowed to under my agreement -- he's allowed to give it out to whoever he wants. But I think it’s really -- you know, maybe some of this, you need to have for purposes of other countries because I think other countries were involved.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think they -- perhaps just based on what I’m seeing, they use other countries because they didn’t want to get caught doing what they were doing in this country -- you know that very well.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Mr. President, I believe -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I want to give to Attorney General Bill Barr. He's got it totally, everything he can do in terms of opening it up and making it transparent as the politicians like to use that word, transparent. I’m the most transparent president in history. I let Mueller have everything they wanted. If you think of it, 500 witnesses, interview our attorneys, interview whoever you want, I think 2,500 subpoenas.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't use presidential privilege because I didn't speak to Russia. Russia has -- when I was winning is Wisconsin, when I was winning in Michigan and Pennsylvania and Ohio and Florida and all of these states, North Carolina, the last person or group I ever thought of calling would be Russia. It's a hoax.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It’s a terrible hoax and that should never happen to another president because many of them would not be able to handle it, I don't care who they are. Many of them would not be able to handle it. If you think Joe Biden could handle it? I mean, Joe Biden right now, he looks like he’s got some big problems.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you think -- can you imagine if this happened to Joe Biden? It wouldn’t be good. But it should never happen to another president what happened to me and it should never happen -- nobody should ever allow this to go forward again. And people have to learn -- there has to be a lesson taught. There has to be a lesson taught.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It should never be allowed. It's so bad for our country.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Mr. President, I do have a question about this because you didn't invoke executive privilege. You handed in 1.4 million documents. You encouraged your staff to cooperate with Congress, to cooperate with Mueller. I never liked Mueller's team. I could not for the life of me understand how does he hire Andrew Weissmann, the worst record of any lawyer I’ve ever seen.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> People like Jeannie Rhee who was once Clinton's lawyer on the Clinton Foundation. And you gave written answers. You even let your White House counsel Don McGahn testify for 30 hours. I was a little shocked, to be honest. Why would you allow that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I let everybody testify. I wanted to be totally open because I knew there was nothing there. There was nothing there, nothing at all. But, you know, Bob Mueller was conflicted because he wanted to be the head of the FBI, the director. Again, he was already there for 10 or 12 years, but he wanted to be and I didn't allow that, I said no. I said it respectfully.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We had a business dispute in private life when he was out of the FBI. We had a commercial business dispute. How about having a business dispute with somebody? Think of this, and then he supposed to be ruling on you. But it was a business dispute and it was a nasty little dispute. You know, not the biggest one I’ve ever been in to be honest with you, but we had a real business dispute.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, you look at that, that's a total conflict of interest, how can somebody whom you have a dispute be ruling? And his best friend who very close to him is Comey and Comey played a big part of this, because McCabe didn’t do anything without Comey. McCabe was totally dominated by Comey. He did nothing. Andrew McCabe was a bad guy, but Andrew McCabe did nothing without calling Comey.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He wouldn’t -- there is an expression, he wouldn't go to the bathroom without getting Comey's approval. And so, Comey is in. And Brennan -- you take a look at Brennan. You took the horrible rhetoric, the horrible -- the horrible words he used to describe --
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> He accused you of treason, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then he said, well, I guess I was misinformed. You know, he was making all these predictions. And then when it said no collusion in the Mueller report -- which is amazing, because they had 18 people that were Hillary Clinton people, that -- I think all of them were anti-Trump people in one form or another.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But many of these people, they gave to Clinton's campaign, one or two of them were at -- including Weissmann -- were at the event which turned out to be, as you know, her wake -- it was a funeral. It was supposed to be a party at the convention center in New York. It turned out to be a funeral.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> He was at the victory party. Yes, the so-called victory party. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I saw the same scene as you did to. But think of it -- Bob Mueller was great friends with Comey, right there there's a conflict. He wanted the FBI job, and we had a business dispute. And I would tell everybody who’d listen, I told you a long time ago, I said, how could he be doing this? But despite that, let him do it. I said, let him do it because I had nothing to do -- they know that, they all know that, I had nothing to do with Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love our country. I love our country. By doing this, I’ve sacrificed a lot. I had a very simple life. I had a great company, great everything. Everything was great. I sacrificed a lot. But I’ve made a tremendous difference. You know, so many people come up to me, Sean, and they say, thank you, sir, for saving our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I used to take it with a grain of salt, oh, there was a -- but they said and they mean it. I went to -- the other day, I was the commencement speaker at the Air Force Academy, incredible young people, and I handed out a thousand diplomas to the senior class. That’s a lot of shaking hands and saluting, I will tell you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was a couple of hours, but it was great. But so many young, beautiful people, they’re young people, the beginning of an incredible life, they came up to me and they said, thank you, sir, for saving our country. I know exactly what they mean, our country was in big trouble and we’ve got to turn now in the right direction.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Mr. President, just as an aside, you did have the constitutional authority under Article II of the Constitution to fire Mueller who would have been replaced, and I would add --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely right. [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> It will be -- it will be interesting --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I had absolutely Article II powers. I could've done anything I wanted. I don't even bring it up because we don't even get there. Absolutely, I have Article II. We could have used that instead. I wouldn't even have to bother talking to you about all the other things. I wouldn't have to talk to you about conflicts.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I could have fired Mueller for conflicts. I could have fired anybody. But I didn't want to do it, because they said, let it play -- play out, it's a hoax. It’s a hoax. It's a disgrace.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> One of the --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And that they are allowed to go forward with, you know, interviewing people, having people like Hope Hicks and others, having to pay for a new set of lawyers?
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Same questions.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They just went through it with the Mueller report. Now, she was totally exonerated. She did nothing wrong. And now, they have to start paying for lawyers again? It’s a do-over because the report was terrible for them. And absolute do-over.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Sir, this will be -- Mr. President, this will be the fifth -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're not allowed to do-overs.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> This will be the fifth investigation. And you’re right, those Washington lawyers are expensive. I have had to hire a few of them in my day. But I just want to say one thing -- one good question I want answered. Did Italy, did Great Britain, did Australia, were they outsourced intelligence gathering by high-ranking people -- not rank-and-file -- to spy on American citizens and circumvent American laws?
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> It will be a big question. But I want to change gears here. I want to ask you about --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And Ukraine, take a look at Ukraine. How come the FBI didn't take the server, Podesta told him to get out. He said, get out. [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> They’re offering it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, how come the FBI didn't take the server from the DNC? Think about that one, Sean. Think about that one.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Let me ask you -- there are 20-some-odd candidates. I want to get your general thoughts on all of them and is there anyone in particular you prefer to run against, or do you care at all?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we have to see how it plays out. I mean, whoever it is, it is. I don’t know. I mean, I look at some of them, I don't see George Washington. I don't see Churchill. I don't see anybody in particular that I worry about. I think honestly, however it is, it is. We will -- [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> I don't see George Washington either, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You see the polls that came out today. I read a couple of actually legitimate polls that came out today. Not the polls that the media makes up. See, I’m fighting the Democrats and the media together. It’s not -- and you know that better than almost anybody. But the people know that. I’m fighting the Democrat Party and I’m fighting the media.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They’re partners. They are partners. I mean, that's why they don't go after Hillary Clinton with her emails where she -- anybody else would be in jail for what she did, the emails, to delete 33,000 emails after you get -- after, not before -- after you get a subpoena from Congress, you delete everything so people never got to see ‘em. But the media and the Democrats are -- and not all of it, but a big portion of it, they are a partnership.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And that's disgraceful. So, I’m fighting the partnership. I’m not fighting -- actually, fighting the media is much tougher than fighting the Democrats if you want to know the truth.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Well, Mr. President, I call them the media mob. You know, if you’re looking for example, I say it every second, every minute, every hour of every day, and they all lied and they all fell for the hoax in the conspiracy theory and they are trying to revisit it. But I want to just ask you this --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They didn't fall for the hoax. They know it's a hoax. But they write about it anyway. It’s not like they fell for it. These are very smart people. They know it's a hoax. And they write about it anyway. I watch when I have to, just to get a little ammunition, it’s almost like -- you know, you have to know where the other side is coming from.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I watch every once in a while, I will turn to MSNBC and I’ll see what they say. I know most of the people and it's a fraud. They go back and they meet and what can we make up? Remember when they used the word, everyone used the word "manufactured" and every newscast had the word "manufactured". But it's not a word associated with what they were talking about.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They were talking about something being manufactured. And every newscast started with "manufactured." And they did with numerous words. They come up with a word they put it out. They’re all together. It's a really disgraceful situation. Here's the good news: we are president. We’ve got -- we've done it, and we're going to do it again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When you see a crowd like that, Sean, no one has seen crowds like that. I mean, not only the crowd -- no one has seen the spirit, the spirit and the energy. It has been incredible. I said Republicans have far more energy -- you know, you hear about the energy on the Democrat side, they don't have energy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They are all fighting with each other. I say the Republicans have far more energy than the Democrats. I really believe that. I think they have a lot more energy than the Democrats. I call them the radical left, Dems. [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> A few of these Republicans, frankly, could use a spine transplant, in my view. But I don’t want to go there. Let me ask you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I agree, you know, but we have some great ones too. We have some great ones. But you are right, there are some really should -- look, Nancy Pelosi hands out subpoenas like they are cookies. Paul Ryan, nice guy but I will tell you when Jim, and when Mark -- Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan and Devin, and all these people, they are great people -- [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> They’re the amazing ones.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> when they went to Paul Ryan to get a subpoena because they found the same things that we are talking about, Paul would say, well, let's take it easy, let's not this, let’s come back in a week, let's see if we still think -- let's do this -- it was impossible. You couldn’t get a subpoena. She hands out subpoenas like they are cookies.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Let me ask you this, sir, about the Democrats --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a big difference. They fight a dirtier fight. The Democrats fight a dirtier fight. It's too bad.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right. The Democrat debates begin next week. They're supporting this New Green Deal. In 10 years, they want to get rid of the lifeblood of our economy, oil and gas. Everything is going to be free. They are talking about a 70 percent top marginal tax rate for individuals, and 90 percent top marginal rate for businesses, and a wealth tax on top of that.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And when you die, you got to pay a tax. And again, everything is free. They all seem to support some version of it and Medicare-for-All. But you can't buy private insurance according to, say, Kamala Harris, how did Obamacare work out for everybody? But what is your reaction to this agenda?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all, with Obamacare, we took out the individual mandate which is the worst part. Obamacare is a disaster and we’ve managed it really well. That’s why you don’t hear so much about it. But we've really done a great job. Secretary Azar has been incredible the way they’ve handled Obamacare.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I got rid of the individual mandate which was the worst thing in Obamacare. That’s where you pay for the privilege of not having to pay for insurance. It’s a bad insurance, OK? Bad health care. So, you know, it's one of those things. No, I think -- I think that when I meet somebody who even doesn't like me, let's say it's a business person and they are not Trump fans, they say, you have no choice, you can't vote for anybody else because they want to turn this country over to -- I mean, we will be a Venezuela, it will take 10 years or 15 years, but if the wrong person got in, I’ve turned it around, Sean.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I’ve got rid of these rules and regulations that stifled everything. I approved the Keystone Pipeline. I approved numerous other pipelines.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> ANWR.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, they are environmentally good as opposed to trains running across, you know, the Plains and all of the other things. No, I approved so many different things that are actually good to. Do you know that a report came out, our water and our air today is cleaner than it ever was, because in many respects, we are great environmentalists.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I’m an environmentalist. But a different kind, a real environmentalist. But our water is crystal clean. Our air, it's the best that ever was.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I would agree, sir, we all need to be good stewards of the greatest country God gave man.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have to do that.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Are you really going to live tweet -- are you really going to live tweet these Democratic debates, sir?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wasn't going to but I read about in "The Wall Street Journal," or some place, and it's fake news. No, I wasn't thinking about it, maybe I will now. You know, might as well make them right. But, no, I was not thinking about it.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Well, if I can cast my vote, I’m a "yes". I think it would be a great idea. Let me ask you a question --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they wrote about it as though it was fact. I’ve never even thought about it, it’s just so ridiculous. But, you know, maybe I’ll do it.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> I see --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Instead of fake news, I will make them correct news and that's OK.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I think it would be a good idea. It would be very interesting actually. I see, for example, that you promised that ICE next week will begin the process of removing millions of people that didn't respect our laws, borders --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> -- sovereignty. Ninety percent of heroin in this country comes across our southern border. Now, fentanyl, we are losing 300 people a week in this week.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> My question to you is, there are some people who will ask about you and they’ll say, well, you've known him for over two decades, which I have, and I’ve known you a long time. And you said you’d be conservative and you are right and we didn't believe you and you are pro-life and you -- conservative justices and tax cuts and the deregulation, and energy independence -- all things I believed in 30 years in media.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> So, now, you're fighting for the border wall and people say, well, maybe Donald Trump should maybe tweet a little less and not fight so much on the personal level, and -- but yet take the fight against China, against Mexico, you are kind of standing alone saying you hit them with tariffs if they didn't stop these migrations from happening.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> So, my question to you is, how do you respond to that? That people want you, I guess, to turn off the switch, that you fight for the borders, and you fight for your agenda, and -- but they don't want you to maybe fight on Twitter?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, if I don’t have -- I don't use the word "Twitter", I say social media. If I don't use social media, I have -- outside of you and a few other great people -- I call them patriots actually. You're not really patriots as much as you want ratings. I mean, you’re getting great ratings, in all fairness, Sean.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It’s like last night you got tremendous -- I heard the speech got --
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Oh, yes, they were massive. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- ratings you put on. That was an easy night. You and Tucker and everybody else --
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> It was simple, I just showed up.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- having to, you know, do it and you did it.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it was a great evening. But, no, I think -- I view it as a social media, a way of getting the word out. Look, when you have the lies and the frauds committed by the other networks, many of the other networks, you look at what's going on, it's disgraceful. This way I get the word out and I’m getting it out strongly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, I have hundreds of millions of people that see this. Plus, as soon as I do a tweet, it gets broadcast even in the places you would least expect it because they are desperate for news. You know, they’re desperate to do anything for news. So, it's really a way of getting the truth out because the media has gone loco.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They have lost all control. They don't even call a fact check. You know, I remember 10 years ago, 15 years ago -- I actually used to get great press, if you want to know the truth. But 10, 15 -- before I decide to become a politician and one on the conservative basis because that's what it is. That's what we are doing so well at. That’s why the country is doing so well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, we’re probably doing better right now in our economy -- wages are up, haven't gone up in years, in decades. Wages are up over 3 percent. Think of things that -- things that have happened: the jobs, the unemployment, the amount of people working, companies are pouring back into our country from Japan.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're coming back from -- frankly, they’re coming back from China because of the fact that I put the tariffs on. In order not to pay the tariffs, they are coming back into this country. So many things are happening. But the way I get the word out is through social media, and it’s a great thing. I don't know that I would've been successful if I didn't have it. And, you know, when I make a speech like last night, there was a fantastic woman in the front, she had, "please keep tweeting, Mr. President, it matters." That was her sign.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Please keep tweeting, it matters. And I think it does matter. I don't do it because I enjoy it, I do it because when someone says an outright lie on MSNBC or CNN, both of whom are really suffering in the ratings which is very interesting -- it's incredible, because they have lost credibility. But when they put out lies, I can counteract those lies and I have many more followers than they do. So, it’s a great thing.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Let me ask you, you know, you said you were going to begin the process of removing millions of illegal immigrants.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I also want to get to the status of the border wall. I know there has been miles repaired and miles built. You know, is it going to be finished with your first term? Because they were not able to override your veto and you were able to reallocate funds.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, you know, the Democrats are doing everything possible to stop the wall. And they lost a big lawsuit last week. I won a big, big lawsuit against Nancy Pelosi in the House. The House actually brought a lawsuit. Can you believe that? The House, the Democrats, Nancy Pelosi brought a lawsuit. And we won the lawsuit as you probably read.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We will have -- we have four other lawsuits against us, all semi-related and related to each other. We are building a tremendous wall right now. We are renovating vast areas of wall that collapsed, but it's good if you renovate, you save a lot of money by renovating it. But -- and we are taking down the wall and putting up new wall, some areas you can't renovate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we’ll have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year which is very quick. It’s rapidly approaching. We have three sections being built right now. We are building them in sections in different areas in different states. New Mexico has a tremendous problem with people pouring across New Mexico, and I’m hearing because of this, New Mexico is actually in play for me and for the Republicans because of what’s happening.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's horrible what's happening to New Mexico.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> If you get 400 though --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have sections that started and are about to start in New Mexico.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Uh-huh.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We just finished San Diego, as you know. San Diego in California, they are so happy. The mayor was just up in my office, a great guy. He came up to thank me for having done the wall because has made such a difference. He says it's like day and night. He said people are flowing across and now nobody can come in.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Well, let me ask you this --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We are able to redesign the wall where it's stronger, bigger, higher, you know, it’s at actually got a little bit higher if you remember that. But it’s a better wall, and it costs less money. It’s actually a stronger wall, costs less money. So, we are doing really well with the wall and it's a very important element and we are doing well overall.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we are going to start removing all of these people that came in because the Democrats will not under any circumstances, they won't fix asylum -- asylum is a big problem. They won’t fix it. We could fix it in 15 minutes. And they won't get rid of the loopholes because they want us to fail. It's more important that we fail than the country succeed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you have drugs and you have all these other things. But what we are doing is as the people come up and as we get the necessary paperwork, we are moving people out of the innards of the country and we are bringing them back. And the countries that see this and they see it happening, it is already started on a much heavier fashion next week.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, we’re gearing up. It's, you know, sending a signal that you may get in, but you're not getting in for long and you’re going out. And the other thing finally is Mexico for the first time ever, for the first time in many, many decades, they are respecting us. And we had a big fight and it worked out great.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Let me ask you about --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Mexico now has 6,000 soldiers on the southern border, on their southern border, stopping people from coming in. And they have been really stepping it up. And, you know, frankly, I was going to put tariffs on if they didn't. If they didn't do that, I would have put tariffs on. And I still will if they don’t. But they have been doing a really good job and people on the border will tell you that the traffic has really dropped down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, a lot of good things are happening. But if the Democrats would meet for 20 minutes, 15 minutes, I would say, it used to be 45 -- it's a very short meeting. We could solve the border problem but they don't want to do that because they think it's bad politically. I think what’s bad, Sean, what is really bad as what they are doing, I think it's terrible politically.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People come in, it's a crime, it’s drugs, we can stop it all so fast, but we are going to stop it anyway even if we don't have the Democrats.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I say that Nancy Pelosi is speaker in name only, and that Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has really become the biggest star, and she even got to Joe Biden to come up with a New Green Deal plan. What are your thoughts on her and Congresswoman Omar and the position that Nancy Pelosi is in?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don’t really agree with you. I think Nancy Pelosi probably has control of it, I hear different things but I really think she does. And she knows what she's doing. So, we’ll see how it all comes out. But, look, we have the USMCA, the Mexico and Canada trade deal, which is a phenomenal deal for our country and it's good for them too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it's a phenomenal deal for our farmers and manufacturers and even unions. Everyone wants it. So, the Democrats could do that in a bipartisan way. Mexico approved it today, you probably heard. They just approved it. Their House just approved it in a big vote. So, you know, we're just waiting to see whether or not they will put that up for a vote.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, think of it -- can you imagine if they did? It’s something that everyone wants. It will be a very bipartisan approval. But Nancy --
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> But let me ask you on -- sorry.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- and all of the folks in the House, they have to put it up for a vote and they will vote. It’s great for the farmers. Everyone wants them to do it. So, we’ll see. Again -- do they want to do what's right for the party? They can take credit for that bill, because, frankly, we’d make it bipartisan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We’ll all vote for it. But it’s a big deal. Canada is approving it. Mexico just approved it. A very, very big deal. And it means hundreds of billions of dollars to our country and thousands and thousands of jobs. And it replaces NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever made.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Let me ask you about foreign policy, if I may. You made promises to Israel, Jerusalem is now the capital. Many other presidents promised it. They didn’t deliver. You recognize Golan, which other people promised and didn’t deliver. You promised you get us out of the Iranian deal. I don't think you're going to drop $150 billion in cash and other currency on the tarmac of mullahs that chant "death to America". I worry about Iranian hegemony.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I worry about Iranian proxy wars and terror. I worry about their alliance with Vladimir Putin and I’m not sure where China shakes out in all of this, as you look at the geopolitical workup -- Iran, Russia, China, tell me your concerns.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't worry about a thing. Everything is under control. Don’t worry about a thing. You are right, we did that for Israel. Jerusalem, as you know every president said, we’re going to -- you know, move the embassy to Jerusalem, it becomes the capital of Israel. Every president said, we’re going to do it, we’re going to do it, none of them did it. I did it. The Golan Heights -- for 52 years, they talked about the Golan Heights.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I did it. They didn’t do it. And I understand why, because you get here, there’s a lot of people calling, begging you not to do it for other countries, heads of countries. But presidents of all practically, all said they were going to do Golan Heights, they were going to do Jerusalem, they didn't do it. And then terminating one of the worst deals ever made, the Iran deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was made by President Obama, paid $150 billion -- paid $1.8 billion in cash. I terminated that and Iran is a much different country. I will tell you, much different today than when I took over. When I took over, it look like there was no stopping them. Right now, they’ve got problems.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Will you say they will never get nukes? They’ll never get nuclear weapons?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we’ll see what happens. I would say, if I were you, don't worry about a thing.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> What about Putin and China?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they were forced together by President Obama, and you never like to see that what they were forced together by his attitude and by what they did. When I got here, they were getting very close. But we are doing things that nobody will be able to compete with in so many different ways. Second of all, we’re going to have a good relationship with Russia and we’re going to have a good relationship with China.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It’s very important that we do. They are powerful nations and we are a very powerful nation. And I’ve rebuilt our military to a level that nobody thought possible -- $716 billion last year. Nobody thought -- it was depleted when I got in. They had planes that were so old, they couldn't fly. And our military is almost completed in terms of being rebuilt.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We are doing missile --
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> A lot of money.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- and missile technology that nobody’s even seen before.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Mr. President, I would --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And think about do we announce it or do we not announce it? But we have tremendous -- you know, the levels of sophistication like you've never seen. With all of that being said, I want to get along with Russia, and I think we will. I want to get along with China, and I think we will. I’m meeting actually both of them next week in Japan at the G20.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Mr. President -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- the United States gets along. The Russian witch hunt really hurt us in terms of our relationship with Russia. I think it was just hurt -- I think it hurts in terms of relationship with a lot of people, but we have very good relationships with countries, and sometimes countries you wouldn't think so, because I’ve said, you have to pay for NATO.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, the United States is paying for NATO. You have a lot of countries that were delinquent in their payments to NATO. I got them to pay over hundreds of billions of dollars toward NATO. But I think we are going to get along with a lot of countries, but those two in particular, I think we’re going to have -- I hope we’re going to have a good relationship.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we are a very strong country again, and we are respected again, Sean.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I hate to interrupt you, but I actually took 15 minutes of Laura Ingraham's show. But I want to tell you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know that, Laura must not be happy right now.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> It's her birthday today, sir. I thought you might want to know that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's a great person. I tell you what, I know her for a long time and she’s a great person.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> So, you can tell Laura yourself happy birthday and thank you for being with us. Laura, happy birthday for me. And the president I think would like to wish you a happy birthday.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That’s right.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Hey, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, happy birthday. Wow. That’s right. We've known each other a long time, and congratulations on your show. It's a big success, Laura, big success.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> I appreciate it. Thanks so much, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> If you want to stay on for another few minutes, that's fine, but I don't want to take Hannity's interview and take the baton -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Could you imagine if she has the baton, we hand off to Laura.
<Laura Ingraham> <Neutral> All right, Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want to thank you both. But I’ll tell you what, you’re great patriots, you love our country, and you know what’s happening, and I really appreciate it, and so does everyone else. And that’s why you do as well as you do. They do appreciate it. They really get it. The people of this country, they get it. They are smart.
<Laura Ingraham> <Negative> Mr. President, did you get briefed on this Syrian attack or planned attack on a Christian church in Pittsburgh yet? News broke this evening --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have been told about it and little detail, and I’m going to meet a little later about it, actually, tonight.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> It looks like tragedy was averted, thankfully.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, that's right.
<Laura Ingraham> <Positive> Another concern. Mr. President, thank you so much.
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> The New York Times is saying that a tabloid publisher's deal to hush money is now endangering Trump even more. I'm paraphrasing a little bit. You know as you look at this, what do you want the nation to know about your former attorney being sentenced yesterday?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think -- and I have to go check. I don't think they even paid any money to that tabloid. I don't think we've made a payment to that tabloid. I was asking the question last -- I don't think we made a payment, and then you have the other situation and every lawyer -- look Trump didn't violate campaign finance laws and neither did the president -- Trump [Inaudible]. So they're saying that --
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> Oh, wait. I interviewed him on my program the other day.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK.
<Harris Faulkner> <Neutral> Hans Von Spakovsky.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's another one. Michael Cohen plead guilty to something that isn't even a crime.
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> So --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Wait a minute. These are campaigns. Nobody except for me would be looked at this like -- nobody. What about Congress? Where they had a slush fund and millions and millions of dollars is paid out each year. They have a slush fund -- millions they don't talk about campaign finance or anything -- have you ever heard of campaign finance list?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Have they listed that on their campaign finance sheets? No.
<Harris Faulkner> <Neutral> All the ones I've covered -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Number one they say it's not a campaign finance violation. Number two or it's not even under campaign finance -- number two if it was, it's not even a violation. Number three it's a civil matter. You know President Obama had a really big one from ten times more money -- much more money and you know what?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He paid a fine. I'm the only one that this happens to.
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> So Robert Ray, former Special Counsel for White Water --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a good man.
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> -- was telling me on the program yesterday what you're saying that if this happens he said he couldn't see grounds for impeachment over that. He couldn't see grounds for indictment over that. That's his opinion, but it's an --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody can.
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> -- informed opinion that I've seen that there's not settled law in that anyway. But I --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These are the people that ran the FEC, Federal Elections Commission. These people writing stories that Trump did nothing wrong, I did nothing wrong.
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> So Mr. President let's get into if we can -- Michael Cohen. He was your attorney. Three years he was sentenced yesterday and it may seem like he got a break because it could have been twice as much but it's still three years in federal prison, $500,000 in restitution. This was someone who surreptitiously recorded you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Terrible.
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> Is now known as a criminal liar, yet this is someone who was in your inner circle.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, well it happens. I mean look, it happens. I hire usually good people but it just happens.
<Harris Faulkner> <Neutral> Why did you hire Michael Cohen? He was known as a fixer --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Years ago, I'll tell you what first of all --
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> That was his title. [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He did very low level work.
<Harris Faulkner> <Neutral> Why did you need him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He did more public relations than he did law. But he did -- so if you'd see him on television, he was OK on television, but years ago, many years, like 12, 13 years ago, he did me a favor. He was on a committee and he was so responsive and so good. And I said, he's a nice guy. I should --
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That was the favor?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Years ago.
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> Because, people have been asking, well, what is the favor that he did the president? He was on a committee with you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh no. He was on a committee, it was a condominium committee many years ago and he was a very big supporter of mine on that committee. I did a great job, Trump World Towers, a very tall building right opposite the United Nations, and when you build a building people always get together at the end and they make a settlement with the owner.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They say the ceiling wasn't painted the right color or something. Sometimes serious stuff, but in my case it was a great building. And he was on the committee, I think he was a great guy. I thought he was really a nice guy. He was very supportive. And I liked him and he was a lawyer, and because of that, I did it. And you know what, in retrospect, I made a mistake.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because what he did was all unrelated to me except for the two campaign finance charges that are not criminal and shouldn't have been on there. They put that on to embarrass me. They put those two charges on to embarrass me. They're not criminal charges, number one. Now, that's according -- Harris, that's according to the top people.
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> And I've interviewed people who've told me this, that they're not criminal. So, you watch the program you know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So what happened is either Cohen or the prosecutors, in order to embarrass me, said listen, I'm making this deal for reduced time and everything else, do me a favor, put these two charges on. They're not criminal charges.
<Harris Faulkner> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they weren't for President Obama either.
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> I want to move on. I have one last question. Michael Cohen says that he lied in order to protect you. What's your response to that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me tell you, I never directed him to do anything wrong. Whatever he did, he did on his own. He's a lawyer. A lawyer who represents a client is supposed to do the right thing, that's why you pay them a lot of money, et cetera, et cetera. He is a lawyer, he represents a client. I never directed him to do any incorrect or wrong.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he understands that. Look, he did some bad things, unrelated to me, maybe related to his other clients. I wasn't his only client, he had other clients. He did some bad things and -- income taxes evasion, I heard about taxi cab -- I heard about a lot of things. Now, I'm not reading about any of that stuff, because what he did is he made a deal to embarrass me. In order to embarrass me they cut his term down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Pretty terrible stuff. Let me tell you the other thing, his father-in-law is a very rich guy, I hear. His father-in-law, I thought, was the guy that was the primary focus. Well, what did he do? Did he make a deal to keep his father-in-law out? Did he make a deal to keep his wife, who supposedly, maybe I'm wrong, but you can check it, did he make keep -- make a deal to keep his wife out of trouble?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, how many people, when they say, "Listen, if you embarrass the President of the United States we'll give you a deal, your father-in-law, your wife, we'll cut you a deal." That's all it is. It's a terrible system we have. It's going on right now with General Flynn. The FBI said he didn't lie.
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> I saw you tweet on that about --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But Mueller said he did lie, so they took a man who's a General and a respected person and a nice man -- and I don't even know what he said about me, because maybe they scared him enough that he'll make up a story, but I have a feeling that maybe he's a tougher kind of guy than Cohen, but they took a General that they said didn't lie and they convinced him he did lie and he made some kind of a deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And now they're recommending no time. You know why? Because they're embarrassed that they got caught.
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> All right, let's move on. So you mentioned Ohio, so I'm going to bring up John Kasich and I'm going to bring up Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, because they say they may run against you in 2020.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I hope so.
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> But look at the new Fox polling today which has your -- your approval rating at 46 percent, which is just a couple tics off of your highest point in '17 --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was higher than Obama.
<Harris Faulkner> <Neutral> -- What -- what is your -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know it was higher than Obama.
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> -- what is your reaction today to getting that number? It's still below 50, but 46 percent approval.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think it's amazing because I only get bad news. I only get bad stories. You look at the paper, it's all nonsense. It's campaign contributions that if it were -- even the campaign contribution is totally legal. You look at stories one after another, they're all legal. The great lawyers that do that stuff are saying there's nothing illegal.
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> All right, we'll get to that in a second --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. No, but wait a minute. I mean, I get such bad news. So when you tell me I'm at 48 -- like Rasmussen, I was at 50 in Rasmussen -- when you tell me I'm at 50 percent, I say how can I possibly be at 50 percent? When I open up China, like I'm doing right now, nobody reports it. Now, the Wall Street Journal --
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> Well, we're talking about it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes -- well, that's because, you know, I'm here and we're talking about it. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, no, it's on the front page now of The Wall Street Journal --
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- because there's never -- nobody's ever seen anything like this. But it won't be a big story on NBC, or ABC, or CBS and CNN won't even cover it -- you know, that's total fake news.
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> What do you say to these men who think they have a shot in 2020 and you're sitting at 46, and it really hasn't moved all that much and let's be honest, there's been some bumpy trails along the way and weathering that with this type of approval rating, what do you say to --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I have the greatest base in the history of politics. I have people that I love and that love me, frankly, that includes a lot of women. I've got a tremendous percentage of women last time, remember? I wasn't going to get women. I wasn't going --
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> I interviewed some of the women for Trump, yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. I got women that -- they're the greatest, and I have tremendous women support, but if you remember the last election I was worried I wouldn't get one women in the United States to run -- and I got tremendous -- I mean Hillary wish she had my numbers, OK. Hillary got trounced with women. And I'll tell you something, the news and the polls are really fake, but I have the greatest base in history because the 46 and 48 percent, those people they never wavered.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In fact it was your poll, and frankly Fox is always giving me a bad poll, I don't know why that is but --
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> Really?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think they've treated me fairer than most, but the polls have always been lousy.
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> But there's positive news in this though.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No -- well the economy was really positive. I just saw the poll, the economy was very -- look I've done a good job on the economy, but I've done a very good job in foreign relations. We're respected again as a nation. PART 2
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> I had the pleasure of meeting your Chief of Staff this morning, General Kelly, and I know you're getting ready to make a position change there. You've said some glowing things about him this week. What are you looking for in the next chief of staff?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I want somebody that's strong, but I want somebody that thinks like I do. It's my vision -- it is my vision after all. At the same time, I'm open to ideas. We've had an incredible run. Nobody's done what I've done, and what this Administration has done in the first two years, and we're not even that close to two years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have a ways to go. And something interesting, I just see this in the front page of "The Wall Street Journal" which just came out. China opened -- it's going to open its policy, a big policy shift. They're going to open the whole country, that they want to please President Trump, that they want to do things that they have to do and that people should have been after China for years, I mean frankly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I've established a fantastic relationship with President Xi, who's the head of China, the absolute head of China, and I think we're going to work a fantastic deal for both countries, but a fantastic deal for us. We're going to get China to open up.
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> So, let's spend just a moment talking about the economy right now, because this goes along with the reporting that there has been a little bit of movement during this 90 day ceasefire. How are things going with what you have with China and the tariffs and all of that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, we had a tremendous meeting. It lasted for four hours. It was in Argentina during the G20. I met with President Xi at the end. And we had a fantastic meeting. It was just a great meting.
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> What makes it fantastic?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The relationship that I have --
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> I mean what does that conversation like --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But what really makes it fantastic, is that we have placed tremendous tariffs on China that when China sends things in to America now, they're paying 25 percent interest on everything they send in. And we've only gone to a certain charge, $250 billion. It's 25 on the first $50 billion, and then it's 10 on the rest.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it goes to 25 on January 1st. But I relieved them of that temporarily until the end of the 90 days to see whether or not we can make a deal. But just one thing, after that, I have an additional $267 billion worth of taxes essentially to put on China. And they don't want that. That would be devastating for China.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they have now agreed to go and buy soybeans, tremendous amounts of soybeans. You see that already happening.
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> So, that helps take the pressure off the American economy a little bit in terms of how it --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't think there is any pressure. Everyone's doing so well. I mean there's not a lot of pressure. If you look at unemployment numbers the best in 50 years. If you look at African American unemployment --
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hispanic unemployment, Asian unemployment --
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> Lots of bright spots that you're talking about --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Best numbers ever. Best numbers ever.
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> So, the Dow Jones though, and the S&Ps and the markets, it's been said well, if you take credit for when they're soaring, you have to take credit for fixing --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sure.
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> -- them when they're not. So, we're at a point where we have lost the gains on the Dow for 2018. But in your presidency, we're up nearly 25 percent --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, 33 percent even --
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> -- in that. So, do you feel -- or what is your strategy if you will, for bringing it back at this point?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have a very simple strategy. We were up almost 40 percent and we had lost a little of that because of trade. I mean, I am doing great trade deals.
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> And you're willing to do that. That's different. Is it busy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Well, I'd rather do it when we're up 40 percent and now let's take a little bit off the table and fix it because we cannot continue to lose $500 billion a year to China. And I had a fantastic meeting with President Xi. This was a four hour meeting where everything was agreed on. Now if we get it down in paper, that'll be another story.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think we will --
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have great strength. Nobody's ever done what I've done. I went in --
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> So, that's --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I went in, Harris, and I said look, we're going to tax all of your product. And by the way, you saw the study that just came out, America is paying for 4 percent and China is paying for 21 percent.
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> Is their economy in trouble?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not even affecting -- it's not even affecting us. You look at inflation, it's very low. Hopefully the Fed won't be raising interest rates anymore, because if you compare us to, as an example President Obama, he had zero interest rates. Anybody can make money with zero interest rates. I am almost at a normalized interest rate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And yet, our economy is soaring. Our jobs are soaring, our businesses are doing tremendously. Apple just announced they're going to be investing billions of dollars in this country. That just happened.
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> So, two follows -- two quick follows. Is China's economy in trouble? And have you kind of gotten in -- the timing is interesting. Like it's been auspicious, you've kind of gotten in there when they would --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, China is -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's -- look, I have greater respect for President Xi. He's not a capitulator. But I will tell you this, China's economy if it's in trouble, it's only in trouble because of me. That's the only reason it's in trouble, because I have placed billions and billions -- we have taken in $11 billion worth of taxes that I taxed China -- $11 billion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We haven't made any money with China, we lost money with China. In the last four months, we've taken in almost $11 billion of taxes, nobody's ever heard of that. Nobody knows that people don't report on that, they only report on nonsense.
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> I -- I love this. Because I hadn't planned to ask this but you were calling out companies and whatnot, and the nation got to see you as GM said, "You know what? We're going to wipe away 15 percent of the workforce right before Christmas." And you said "I want to talk to Ms. Barra".
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. I told her I don't like what you did. I think it's --
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> Yes, the CEO Ms. Barra.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- it was nasty. It doesn't really matter because Ohio is under my leadership from a national standpoint. Ohio's going to replace those jobs like in two minutes. But I don't that General Motors does that. And they're going down to Mexico to make cars. Now, the new deal, the USMCA that I made really makes it very uncomfortable for people to go out of the country, and it will be very uncomfortable for them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think she's making a big mistake. They've changed the whole model of General Motors. They're going to all electric. All electric's not going to work. I don't run a car company, but all electric is not going to work. It's wonderful to have it as a percentage of your cars but going into this model that she's going, I think, is a mistake.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But to tell me a couple of weeks before Christmas that she's going to close in Ohio and Michigan, not acceptable to me. And she's either going to open fast or somebody else is going to go in. But General Motors is not going to be treated well.
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> All right. This is your wheelhouse, everybody knows this and we see the energy and the electricity as you talk about these issues. The economy though is big, so are there other areas -- and I want to move on to other things here -- but real quickly, are there other areas that you want to focus on as you go into 2019?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm focusing on everything. I mean, I think my strength thus far, even more than the economy -- and the economy, by the way, will get incredible when I make the deals with China, with Mexico and Canada, when they all kick-in -- but --
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> Why are you so confident about that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because I know what I'm doing. I mean, it's business. Nobody even went to China and said, "Listen, you're stealing our intellectual property. You're doing all sorts of things that are wrong. You're taking out of our country $500 billion a year, not trillion, not -- not million, you're taking away -- $500 billion away; you can't do it. You can't take $500 billion out of our country."
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> So when they threaten to put more tariffs on us, you're not worried about that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, because what's happened is the disparity is so great. We do $525 billion with them, they do $100 billion with us. So they do five-times more, it's really more than that. We charge them very little tax. Let me tell you what just happened. They just lowered the tariff on their car from 40 percent to 15 percent, it's not acceptable; 15 percent is still too high.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We -- but it's a move -- [Crosstalk]
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> But -- but better --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- If they weren't --
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> -- yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- you know that -- yesterday. By the way, you know what we charged them? Two and a half. Now, you know what we charge them? Twenty-five percent.
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> All right, I'm being told I have to wrap with you, and I wanted to do a few rapid fire. So, can I just do one?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Just one.
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> What do you love about being president?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I love getting things done for the people. It's a nasty job because I get hit so hard, so unfairly by so many and I mean really unfairly. When you look at what we've done with with taxes, what we've done with regulations, what we've done with China and national defense and so many other things -- including the environment, did you see last year, we were the only country that had fewer emissions, despite the success of --
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> Your critics would say things differently.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh no because -- hey, the Paris Accord --
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> So when you get up in the morning, and you say, I get to go do this, what you love?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me tell you, the Paris Accord s not working out too well for Paris. Take a look at what's happened over there.
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> France is struggling on a whole [Inaudible] --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because of the Paris Accord, that whole country is burning down, OK? So -- and I was the one that kept us out of the Paris Accord. If I was in the Paris Accord, we would be paying trillions of dollars, trillions of dollars for nothing, and I wouldn't do that. And my people love the job I'm doing.
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> Yes, you have such energy for this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do I have a choice?
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> Well, yes you do, actually. You do, not every president would have worked six and seven out on a campaign trail --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know I work hard, but --
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> Some don't. Which you do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what, I like to say I work hard, but hopefully I work smart, because I know a lot of people, they work -- you have to work smart too, and we're doing great. The country is doing great and we're respected again.
<Harris Faulkner> <Negative> All right, I'm being told we have to wrap, but I'm hoping to come back at some point.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would love that.
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> And you and I traded a lot of papers and it's been a good conversation, thank you, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> In the oval office a few moments ago, very fun, I got to see a little bit of things here. So thank you, I appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, great having you.
<Harris Faulkner> <Positive> God bless you and your family, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Begin Video Clip] I am going to be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. Remember that. If I get elected president, we will make America great again. The weakest person on this stage by far is Jeb Bush.
<Jeb Bush> <Negative> You want to talk about weakness? It's weak to disparage women. It's weak to disparage Hispanics.
<Ted Cruz> <Negative> Donald has this weird pattern. When you point to his own record, he screams, "Liar, liar, liar."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This guy will say anything. This guy lied about Ben Carson when he took votes away from Ben Carson in Iowa.
<Marco Rubio> <Neutral> Building a hotel overseas is not foreign policy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Every guy that attacked me so far, they've all gone done. We've got to keep it that way, right?
<Announcer> <Negative> MSNBC presents an exclusive town hall with Donald Trump. Here now are Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. [Applause] [End Video Clip]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Good evening, and welcome to an exclusive MSNBC town hall event. We are here in Charleston, South Carolina, where in just three days the voters of this state in the first-in-the-South primary will choose who they want to be the Republican nominee for president.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Boy, Mika, this is about as big as it gets.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> It is.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> New Hampshire was big. This is going to determine so much.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Well, tonight we sit with the front runner in that Republican race, who despite a debate performance that some analysts, including us, called disastrous...
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> I thought it was terrible.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> ... he's still a strong favorite.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> I thought it was terrible.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> I thought his head was going to explode. Seriously, I was really -- I thought it was horrible.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Really surprised.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> But, he's a favorite here in the Palmetto State. Joining us now, the Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump. [Applause] All right.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Great to see you, Donald.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Good to have you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I thought I did great in that debate. I actually thought I had a great...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> I just didn't think it was good. I was like, what is going on?
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> A meltdown.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought -- nah, I thought it was good. I mean, I was being hit from every side. It was tough. I mean, I was -- you said I was too tough, but I thought I had to be tough. I thought I did well.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Let's start with this question. Now that as we said this morning on the show, if you look at a lot of the polls, a lot of people are starting to say you could be the Republican nominee. So we need to step back and ask a lot of questions...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> ... a lot of questions about your general philosophy. Why is it that you feel it's necessary to attack Jeb Bush, to attack John McCain, to attack all these people?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't attack John McCain, actually. I do attack people when I'm attacked. I have -- I don't care too much about Jeb, except he spent $22 million on negative ads.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, every time I turn on a television, I see a negative ad. He's got money from all of the different donors and special interests and lobbyists. And they've put a lot of negative ads, and that's Jeb, more so than anybody else.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I hit Jeb because he's sort of easy to hit, to be honest with you. If he weren't doing the negative ads, I wouldn't even be talking about Jeb, to be honest with you. Now, you know, Ted, I -- we go back and forth, but Ted -- what he did to Ben Carson I thought was disgraceful in Iowa, where he said he was out of the race.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Essentially, he said he was out of the race and this race is over, come with me, come with me. I thought that was bad. I thought the voter violation fraud document that he did was -- I thought it was horrendous. And he's told lies. I mean, he tell lies. In fact, Rubio, he came out and he accused Ted of being a liar.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I said, oh good. That's good, because now I can do it, also. It's just perfect.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> So let's go over some polls and we'll follow up with some of these questions. There's a brand new Monmouth University poll out. It actually finds you with a 16 point lead in South Carolina, 35 percent to Cruz's 19 percent, to Marco at 17. A new Bloomberg Politics South Carolina poll that was just released tonight puts you ahead of Ted Cruz 36 percent to 17 percent, with Rubio again in third place at 15 percent. However, a new NBC News-Wall Street Journal national poll that was taken after Saturday night's debate...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> National poll.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> It's a national poll showing Ted Cruz with a slim 2 point margin, 28 to 26 percent, with Marco Rubio in third at 17.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Are things closing in here in South Carolina?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think most of these polls were taken after the debate, and they worked out good for me. And it was taken after the debate. I have never done well in the Wall Street Journal poll. I think somebody at Wall Street Journal doesn't like me, but I never do well with the Wall Street Journal poll. So I don't know. They do these small samples, and I don't know exactly what it represents. But I am really honored by those poll results. Those are great poll results overall.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Today Ted Cruz came out and attacked you and said that you were the king of frivolous lawsuits. And, Mika, what exactly did he say?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> He says, "I have to say, Mr. Trump, you have been threatening frivolous lawsuits your entire life. Even in the annals of frivolous lawsuits, this takes the cake."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, you know, I've had great success in business. I've had great success with lawsuits. I've had great success in things I do, and I don't know that we're going to have a lawsuit, but we certainly want to keep somebody honest. And, you know, when he makes statements about -- like, as an example, I'm pro-life and he said he's not pro-life. He can't say that. [Crosstalk]
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> But your opponents would say, though, you haven't always been pro-life.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, that's true, and so was Ronald Reagan likewise, so...
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Right. So what happened? When did that change come?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It changed years ago. And what happened is I saw things with people and people that I know and people that I respect that made me change. Ronald Reagan changed. If you look at Reagan...
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, he said he evolved. He used that expression.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Ronald Reagan actually used to be a fairly liberal Democrat, and he began a fairly conservative conservative. I mean, fairly. But he became a great president.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> But Ted Cruz says, we can't count on Donald Trump in the future, especially in picking Supreme Court justices...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well...
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> ... if he's changed in the past. So how do you convince...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm the only one -- by the way, during the debate...
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> How do you convince a Republican like me...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's fine.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> ... that if you were nominated...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> ... you're not going to nominate the type of Supreme Court Justice that always seems to flip?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. So if you look at me as a conservative, OK, and I'm not sure that that's necessarily the most important word, but I say I'm a commonsense conservative. I'm the most conservative on the border.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nobody tougher than me on the border. In fact, Sheriff Joe just endorsed me from Arizona. And when he endorses you, you're pretty conservative, you're pretty good on the border.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think I'm the strongest on the military, most conservative on the military, strongest on the military, the best with the vets. I have more veteran support than anybody else by far. We're going to get rid of Common Core. I'm very conservative on that issue. Common Core is going. We're going to have local education. It's going to be much better, much less expensive. On the Second Amendment, I am absolutely the strongest in the group on the Second Amendment...
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So let me stop you there. The second amendment, very important in this state. Heller, the decision that the Supreme Court passed that -- or decided on actually found out that the Second Amendment -- ruled that the Second Amendment went -- meant what a lot of people have long believed that it meant, that Americans have a right to keep and bear arms.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Will you make upholding the Heller decision a litmus test in Supreme Court nominees...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, I would...
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> ... that you send?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I would. And I talk about it all the time.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So you -- so you won't nominate...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely...
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> ... somebody to the Supreme Court unless they agree with Scalia on the Heller decision...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Correct...
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> ... that the second amendment means Americans...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Correct...
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> ... have the right to keep and bear arms?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I give that commitment right now, absolutely. And I've been very strong. I'm a member of the NRA. My sons, Don and Eric, are members of the NRA for a long time. They're hunters. They're great members of the NRA.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, if in -- if you take California, if in California we had somebody having guns on the other side, where you had the two radicalized people, and if we had guns on the other side, bullets coming the other way, you wouldn't have had the 14 people killed. I mean, the best example is not this country. Paris has the toughest gun laws in the world, they say.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> France has the toughest gun laws as a country, they say. If you take France and all the bad guys have the guns, nobody had guns in the room, they sent into the various rooms people, 130 people killed. It was like, "Come on over here, boom.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Come on over here, boom." If people on the other side had guns, Joe, it wouldn't have been that way. And, you know, people really seriously wounded. You know, it was many more people in Paris.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you look at it, if they had guns on the other side with the bullets flying the other way -- and I have this argument with people all the time from New York, because a lot of New York, they say, "Get rid of the guns." The fact is, they can't argue. They can't beat me in the argument. It's impossible to beat. And then the next day, I'll say, so did I convince you? They always say no. They always say no.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> So we're going to get deeper into your policy positions coming up.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Want to get a sense of the state of the race, though, as we move on here. President Obama even talked about you saying, "I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president. And the reason is, I have a lot of faith in the American people, and I think they recognize that being president is a serious job. It's not hosting a talk show or a reality show. It's not promotion. It's not marketing. It's hard." The sitting president, Mr. Trump, thinks your candidacy is an aberration or a joke.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think he does at all. I tell you what, if I would have run four years ago, he wouldn't be president right now. I don't think he thinks it at all.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, it's very interesting. It's very interesting with President Obama. Going to go down as one of the worst presidents in the history of this country. He was -- has been a disaster on the military. You look at what -- we can't beat ISIS. He's been a disaster on health care, because Obama's got to be repealed and replaced. And I'm just talking about not even from my standpoint. Rates are going up. Your premiums are going up, 25 to 35, 45, 55 percent. People are getting killed...
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So you're going to repeal Obamacare?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He lied about -- repeal and replace. Absolutely.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> What do you replace it with?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Health care savings plans, one way. We have to get rid of the lines between states. I do tremendous health care. I have so many employees. I have thousands of employees. I've employed tens of thousands of people. I built an unbelievable business. And one thing that has come out, when I filed the documents with the FEC in terms of my business...
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... I built an unbelievable business. So I have tremendous numbers of people...
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So let's clarify...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Joe, we have to get rid of the lines. We have artificial lines.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right. So you're talking about letting people shop from one state to another...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have to.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> ... to get insured. So let me ask you this, though. There is a guarantee now that all Americans get health care. This has been -- well, in New Hampshire, it was supposed to be a big problem for you... [Crosstalk]
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Are you going to guarantee all Americans health care?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Joe, Americans aren't getting health care right now. You know, people tell me that all the time.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> No, no, no, but I'm asking -- but that's just what I'm asking you. Just like you've guaranteed -- what you've guaranteed on the Second Amendment. This has been a fight within the Republican Party and what it means to be conservative.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure. Sure.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> But you have constantly said, even in New Hampshire, the Live Free or Die State, that every American should get health care. Is that your position?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me tell you, no, that's not what I said. That's not what I said. Here's what I said.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to have great plans. They're going to be much less expensive, and they're going to be much better, because the Obama plan is unaffordable and it's a disaster. And by the way, in '17, it's going to die, unless the Republicans continue to fund money like -- it's not affordable by the country, not affordable by people. But what I say is this: We're going to have great plans. But there will be a group of people that is not doing well, that has no money. We cannot let them die in the streets.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we'll work out either through Medicare, which we'll save, or something. We will work out a plan where instead of having people dying in the streets -- and I say to the Republicans all the time. And by the way, I get standing ovations from Republicans, from Republican groups. I got one yesterday. I said we can't let people die in the streets. We got to work out a deal with the hospital or with somebody in that community, where if somebody is sick, and really sick, and they don't have housing, and they don't have...
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... all -- we can't let them die. We're going to take care of them.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> So all Americans will get health care of some sort...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to take care of them. We have to take care of them. Now, that's not single-payer. That's not anything. That's just human decency. And I'll tell you what. Every single time I say that, I say to people in the audience -- I say, "So what do you think?" They all stand up and give me a standing ovation, OK?
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So some people will take that and they'll say, "Oh, that's terrible, that's terrible." What we're going to have is we're going to have private plans. We're going to have maybe the health care savings plans, which are very good. We're going to get rid of the lines. You know what happens when you get rid of the lines? You have tremendous competition, and the price goes way down. The reason the lines are there is because the insurance companies are making a fortune having monopolies in the various states and make a fortune.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> All right. So we're going to get back to that. We're going to ask how you pay for that and a lot of other things, but we need to go to break. [Crosstalk]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> We're just getting started here in Charleston. When we come back, we're going to be asking Donald Trump about how he would handle the FBI [Inaudible] to break into one of the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone. You're watching an exclusive town hall with Donald Trump here on MSNBC. [Applause] [Commercial Break] [Applause]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Welcome back to our town hall with Donald Trump. We are taking questions from the audience. We're going to go to Barbara, who is an independent. Barbara?
<Question> <Positive> Hi, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hello, Barbara.
<Question> <Neutral> Hi. I wanted to ask you, when will we ask our allies to help fund the U.S. troops stationed in their country for protection?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, I talk about it all the time, Barbara. We have so many countries -- South Korea -- you know, I order thousands of television sets a year for different projects, and they're all made in South Korea, other than Sony, which is Japan, but, I mean, for the most -- LG, Samsung -- it's such a great question, because these countries are making a fortune. And we take care of Saudi Arabia.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We take care of Japan. We take care of Germany. We have -- you know, when you look at our budget, for military, it's 10 times higher, it's so much bigger than anybody else in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But what do we do? We take care of all these other countries. The question is such a great question. I talk about it, and I just can't even understand. Saudi Arabia was making a billion dollars a day, prior to the oil collapse, so now they're making half, OK, they're making plenty. And yet we take care of them. They pay us peanuts. [Crosstalk]
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> So should we force Germany and Japan to start carrying their load, build up their own military, and start funding their own defense, instead of the United States?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, at a minimum -- Joe, at a minimum, I think it's fine what we're doing, but they have to at least pay us for it. They have to pay us so we don't lose tremendous amounts of money. We have...
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> If you go in and fight, have the country -- our country lead the war against ISIS...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> ... as you've said you're going to do, will you do what Bush 41 did and force countries like Japan to write checks?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would do that. And I would want other countries -- you know, the Gulf states, if you look, the Gulf states aren't doing anything, and they're big beneficiaries, and they have more money than anybody else. We have $19 trillion in debt.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's going to be $21 trillion because of the horrible budget that was just passed four weeks ago, which is shocking that they just did that, so we're going to have $21 trillion in debt. We can't keep doing this. And if we're taking care of Saudi Arabia, they're going to have to pay us. And if we're taking care of South Korea, which makes a fortune -- you know, it's an economic behemoth...
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... and we have the madman right next to him, and we have 28,000 soldiers on the line, we're going to have to do something.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> I've got to ask you -- I know we've got to go to the studio audience. I wish we had three hours, we don't, so I'm going -- I've got to dig into a couple of things you've said here really quickly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, go ahead.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> First of all, you talk about the $19 trillion national debt. If I listen to the people I've been listening to for years on these issues, they tell me that your policies would add another $10 trillion, $11 trillion to the national debt.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're wrong. I mean, they're wrong.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> How are they wrong?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> All I'm saying is, my policies, I'm going to reduce taxes, OK? And the taxes is going to bring jobs back, and we're going to bring jobs back into the country, big league, and we're going to have a dynamic economy again. You know last quarter...
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> But are you going to cut spending, too?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Joe, we had no growth. Joe, we had no growth.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Are you going to cut spending?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm going to cut spending. We're going to cut spending big league. I mean, you look at some...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Where? Where?
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Where is that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So many -- Department of Education. We're going to cut Department of Education. We spend more money per pupil than any country in the world by far, and we're ranked number 30 in the world. You have all of these countries, whether it's...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Bless you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I thought she was a -- she sneezed.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> It wasn't a protester. [Laughter]
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> You're so used to protestors, somebody sneezed, and you're ready to throw them out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I immediately said the camera's going to go over there and show what a big crowd I have. That's the only way to show a big crowd. That was a healthy sneeze. She's a healthy person.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Yes. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you look at -- we're number 30 in the world, Department of Education cuts, because I said, we're going to bring education back...
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> But, I mean, that won't balance the budget, though. [Crosstalk]
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> You've got to look at entitlements, though, too, do you not?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Joe, what we're going to do more than anything else, we're going to bring, we're going to cut -- we're going to cut tremendous amounts of money -- let me give you an example. Drug companies. Now, you take somebody like Woody Johnson, good guy, Johnson & Johnson.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These people are in charge of -- meaning Woody -- is in charge of Jeb Bush's campaign finance, OK? He's the head of campaign financing. Jeb Bush raised $148 million, total waste of money. He might as well throw it out the window.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Wouldn't it have been nicer if instead of running a failed campaign, he gave it to the Wounded Warriors or gave it to somebody? But the problem is, we don't negotiate -- we're the largest drug producer, and -- we're the largest drug buyer in the world. We don't negotiate. We don't negotiate. You pay practically the same for the country as if you go into a drug store and buy the drugs. If we negotiated the price of drugs, Joe, we'd save $300 billion a year.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, these candidates -- I self-fund, I'm going to do it. These candidates are all controlled by the drug companies, the lumber companies. They're never going to do that. They're never going to do it.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Sorry, let's...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Just one thing. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's tremendous fat. Joe, there's tremendous fat in our budgets. Tremendous fats. Beyond belief. But the candidates are all controlled by the people that make money off the fat.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Really quickly -- and I know I've got to go to the audience, but entitlement reform, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> ... combined.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> ... are going to consume every dime that goes to Washington, D.C.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Waste, fraud and abuse.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Well, that's not going to take care of it by itself.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a huge number. It's a huge number. Waste, fraud -- you know people have paid...
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> What about raising the retirement age?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hey, Joe, I'm not going to...
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> People are living older than they ever have.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not doing it. Let me just say. Waste, fraud and abuse is massive in Social Security and Medicaid.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So why aren't you going to -- why wouldn't you raise the retirement age, if Americans are getting older and are living longer and longer?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because people didn't -- I'm not doing it. I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. Two reasons. Number one, I don't want to do it. And, number two, the Democrats aren't going to do it. You know, the Republicans also have to get elected? You do know that. And if you watch Bernie and if you watch Hillary, they don't want to only not cut, they want to increase Social Security.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, I'm not doing it for that reason. I'm just saying this. We don't have to do it. We're going to make our economy strong; we're going to make our economy rich. And we're not going to have to do it.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> You know, tonight I know, Mika, why we have the three-hour program...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Yeah, I know.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> There's not enough time to follow up.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> The two of you.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> But we have -- this is Kevin McCarthy. Not that Kevin McCarthy.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Well, it's not -- yeah, exactly.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> But Kevin McCarthy.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Republican.
<Question> <Negative> Mr. Trump, jobs are a big issue you talk about a lot. Some of these trade agreements like NAFTA and others have been very destructive for the working class. My question is what specific steps would you take to help renegotiate those deals or help protect American jobs?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Our trade agreements are a disaster, partially because, again, contributions to the various people that run things, like the senators, et cetera. TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership, is a disaster because they don't talk about monetary manipulation and devaluation. They don't talk about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The number-one way that countries are killing us is with devaluations of their currencies, and our companies can't compete. You take a look at what's happening in Japan with the devaluation of the yen, just look at this. Caterpillar is having such a hard time competing with Komatsu, which is a big tractor-maker from Japan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The -- a friend of mine bought all Komatsu. All his life, he's bought Caterpillar, big contractor, big contractor. He bought, his whole life, he bought Caterpillar.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now he's buying Komatsu, not because he wants to. He said they devalued the yen to such an extent that it's absolutely impossible to compete. So he bought it, and he's very unhappy about it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a disaster, and it shouldn't be signed. The NAFTA agreements and trade agreements that we have generally will be fully renegotiated by me. We have right now a deficit with Mexico, a -- trade deficit, $58 billion, with Mexico. We have a $500 billion deficit with China. You can't have this. We will renegotiate. And, you know, Carl Icahn came out, he endorsed me, said Trump is the one that knows what the hell's going on. We have another problem. We have corporate inversions, where you have companies that are leaving our country...
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Let...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's a big -- that's a big problem.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> It is a big problem. Let's talk about China, though, for a second. You've talked before about slapping tariffs, 40 percent, 45 percent on China, if that's what it took, but wouldn't...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not actually what I said. The New York Times said I said that, but honestly, I was at a meeting with the New York Times. I didn't say that.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said it is a threat that I would use against China.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> OK, but...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> For instance, China can solve the North Korea...
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Do you understand though that if we get into a trade war with China, that that could hurt a lot of working-class Americans who depend on cheap products from China to be able to get by?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's going to hurt China more than it's going to hurt anybody. We have all the keys, we have all the power. Look, China has absolutely -- it's been one of the great thefts of all time, what they've done to the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I have great relationships -- I sell condos for tens of millions of dollars to Chinese. I have the largest bank in the world which is from China as my tenant in one of my buildings in Manhattan. I bought a building -- I have a building through China, the Bank of America Building in San Francisco. I mean, I do a lot of business with China.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So they're pulling me to break. I want to ask you something, though, because before we go to break...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We can't let China continue to get away with what they're doing to our country.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So are you talking about with China -- whether we're talking about tariffs -- are you talking about more threats than action?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a threat. No, no, it's a threat, but you have to be able to put it in place. What China has done to us with devaluation of their currency is unbelievable. And nobody thought they were going to do it again, and then four months ago they had the largest devaluation that they've had in 20 years. The largest in 20 years. Now they're going to do it again. Our companies can't compete. They are devaluing their currencies. Our company can't compete.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> OK.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right, we're going to take a break. They are just days away from heading to the polls here in South Carolina. [Applause] And, you know, half of votes have yet to make up their minds. When we return, we're going to hear more questions from the audience. And we'll dig into Donald Trump's economic plan to see if the numbers add up. You're watching our exclusive town hall with Donald Trump, right here on MSNBC. [Applause] [Commercial Break]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> They are just days away from heading to the polls here in South Carolina. [Applause] And, you know, half of votes have yet to make up their minds. When we return, we're going to hear more questions from the audience. And we'll dig into Donald Trump's economic plan to see if the numbers add up. You're watching our exclusive town hall with Donald Trump, right here on MSNBC. [Applause] [Commercial Break]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> And we're back here in beautiful Charleston, South Carolina. We're taking questions from voters ahead of Saturday's primary here. So, Donald Trump, we have Cullen Baldwin who is joining us. He's an independent, correct, Cullen?
<Question> <Neutral> Yes, ma'am.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> OK, Cullen, take it away.
<Question> <Negative> Mr. Trump, multiple past presidents have attempted to establish a peace agreement between both sides of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. And the one common theme is that they've all been unsuccessful. What specific steps would you take to establish an agreement between both sides?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, I think it's probably the toughest agreement of any kind to make. It has been going on for many years. Many friends of mine have been involved.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're very, very good businessmen, good negotiators. A lot of people say an agreement can't be made, which is OK. I mean, sometimes agreements can't be made, not good.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, you know, you have both sides, really, but you have one side in particular growing up and learning that these are the worst people, these people are the worst people, et cetera, et cetera. It is a very, very tough agreement to make. I was with a very prominent Israeli the other day, says it's impossible because the other side has been trained from the time they're children to hate Jewish people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I will give it one hell of a shot; that I can tell you. But of all agreements -- I would say if you can do that deal, you can do any deal. But that's probably the toughest deal in the world right now to make, and it's possible, it's not makeable, because -- don't forget, it has to last. You know, it's wonderful to make it and it doesn't work. But it has to last. To make lasting peace there, probably the toughest deal of all, but I'm going to give it a shot.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Whose fault do you think it is [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I don't want to get into it.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> You think Israelis or the Palestinians?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't want to get into it for a different reason, Joe, because if I do win, you know, there has to be a certain amount of surprise, unpredictability. Our country has no unpredictability. If I win, I don't want to be in a position where I'm saying to you and the other side, now say, "We don't want Trump involved, we don't want" -- let me be sort of a neutral guy, let's see what -- I'm going to give it a shot.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It would be so great; I would be so proud if I could do that. I don't know if it's doable. I have friends of mine that are tremendous businesspeople, that are really great negotiators, they say it's not doable. You understand, a lot of people have gone down in flames trying to make that deal. So I don't want to say whose fault is it; I don't think it helps.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right. We're going to take a question now from Stephanie Brumit. She's an independent. Stephanie?
<Question> <Positive> Hi, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi, Stephanie.
<Question> <Positive> Thank you for being here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Question> <Positive> My question is in regard to political civility. So we have -- I think you've been really successful in tapping into the kind of voter who wants a politician to tell it like it is, wants a politician to be honest. And so I think you've done a successful job of tapping into that passion. My question is, where do you think the line is between boldness and honesty, and disrespect and rudeness? And does that line change...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> I think she's alluding to your cursing. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it's -- you know, a lot of -- I'll give you an example. One of the speeches, we're having a great time -- I never said the word. I went like -- I opened my mouth, and they go -- all of your networks go, "Beep," and they thought I said this terrible word. I didn't say the word. That was a real bad word. I didn't say it at all and the place... [Crosstalk]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> But you whispered it, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I never whispered it.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> You whispered the word.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The other one, I actually, you know, you can give me a negative credit on this one. I actually repeated a word. I said, "I didn't say this word, I didn't say this word," and then I was... [Crosstalk]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> You called that a retweet.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> I'll give -- but hold a second.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> No.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Let's talk, though, about civility, though, towards other people...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> .... because you like hammering other people. As a politician, I always had a rule, you couldn't be at war with more than one person at a time. Your rule seems to be you have to be at war with at least a dozen people at a time. What happens if you're president of the United States and...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Changes.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> ... and -- you look at Barack Obama, one of his problems, biggest problems, people on the Hill, Democrats and Republicans will say, is that he doesn't have friends on the Hill.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He doesn't have friends. [Crosstalk]
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Are you going to have friends on the Hill?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah. I started out -- I was one of 17 people, and we're not including the Democrats. It was coming at me from every which way. I was very strong and very bold, and I hit a lot of people. I knocked out Lindsey Graham. I knocked out Perry. I knocked out a lot of people, Walker, we knocked out a lot of people...
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> You're still hammering people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And now I have to, because I still have six left.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> OK, but if you knock everybody else out, and you're president of the United States, then you have to deal with 535 people that are going to be hammering you every day.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Do you have the temperament?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The problem -- I have a great temperament.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Do you have the temperament to be the president of the United States?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a great temperament. I think my biggest strength is... [Crosstalk]
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Jeb Bush would disagree.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Jeb Bush -- look...
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Lindsey Graham would disagree.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Jeb is a sad case, OK? It's sad.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> See, there you go again.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Donald. [Crosstalk]
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> There you go again.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not saying anything -- I'm just saying it's a very sad thing. I said he's a low-energy person. Look, people...
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> You walked right into that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In a year from now, people will respect what I did. I had Lindsey Graham, he was at 7 percent. After I hit him, he was at nothing and he left the race. Now he's an angry person. I see him on television saying things, it's like -- I mean, he's like an insane person. [Laughter]
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Again. You're not proving... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Joe, our country doesn't win anymore. You're so worried about being nice and being politically correct. So what would you rather have me do? Be nice to everybody and now instead of all those people getting out they're still in, still hammering me? You get up. You have to win.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> It's not what I want. It's not what she wants.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Our country is not winning.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> The question is, do you have the temperament...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Yes.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> ... to deal day in and day out with 535 people...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I have a great temperament.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Finger on the button.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Finger on the button, OK, finger on the button.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> OK, because during the debate, I was thinking, should this guy have his -- the finger on the button?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> During the debate? I was being hit by the announcers, John Dickerson. I was being hit -- you know, everybody was really being sort of culled to go after Trump... [Crosstalk]
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> But you're going to get hit by world leaders.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They were asking, your brother was told to do this and this by Donald Trump, and they have to respond. I was being hit by everybody. Finger on the button. I'm the one, the only one that said don't go into Iraq. So don't tell me about finger on the button. I want to build our military so strong, so powerful that nobody's going to mess with us.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> So what does that mean? Is that more money, too?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's more money, but it's cheap compared to what we're doing right now. Nobody respects us right now. They don't respect us...
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> But are you talking about bigger defense budgets? Because right now, we're already spending over $500 billion...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm talking about better negotiated defense budgets. Do you know that we're buying equipment that the generals and the colonels and the people in the field don't want because these companies have political contacts? So much of it has to do with the fact that I'm self-funding my campaign, I can do whatever I want. We're buying equipment that we don't even want because certain companies have better political skills.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you see it all the time. They're getting a plane, they don't want it. They want the other one, or they could have gotten it cheaper, but they get this one because -- we are going to have a better, stronger military. And we're going to watch it so much, we will save so much money. Joe, there is so much corruption. There is so much waste and abuse in the military and elsewhere. But we're going to build our military strong. It's the cheapest thing we can do.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody's going to mess.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> When we come back, our final questions and thoughts here. You're watching a special edition, an exclusive MSNBC town hall with Donald Trump from Charleston, South Carolina. [Applause] [Commercial Break]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Welcome back to our town hall event with Donald Trump in Charleston, South Carolina. We have a few final moments with Mr. Trump.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> I wanted to describe a candidate to you. The candidate is considered a political outsider by all the pundits. He's tapping into the anger of the voters, delivers a populist message. He believes everyone in the country should have health care, he advocates for hedge fund managers to pay higher taxes, he's drawing thousands of people at his rallies, and bringing in a lot of new voters to the political process. And he's not beholden to any super PAC. Who am I describing?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Or any special interest or any donors. You're describing Donald Trump.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Actually, I was describing Bernie Sanders. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's good.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Is it insulting...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll tell you...
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> There are some similarities.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're different in one primary -- I'll tell you, there's one thing that we've very similar in. He knows that our country is being ripped off big league, big league, on trade. The problem is, he can't do anything about it, he's not going to be able to do, whereas I'm going to do things.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Why not?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because he doesn't understand it. I mean, he doesn't understand what's happening. But he does know that China and these other countries are ripping us off -- Mexico. You see Carrier moving down, they're moving down to Mexico. Nabisco is moving. The whole thing is crazy, what's going on with Mexico. He does understand that, much more so than many people, but he'll never be able to do anything about it.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Would you rather run against Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's a great question. I think I'd rather run against Hillary, just because I'd love to beat Hillary. I think I can beat Hillary so easy. [Laughter] But -- but honestly... [Applause] ... I -- I don't know. I mean, I'm pretty good with the legal stuff, and I don't know how she gets out of that quagmire of the e- mails. I think it's a...
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Do you think -- do you think she'll be indicted?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think maybe she will, but I think if she isn't indicted, the only reason is because the Democrats are protecting her. She is being protected 100 percent. Because you look at General Petraeus, you look at all the other people that did a fraction of what she did...
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Would you ever consider -- speaking of General Petraeus, would you ever consider General Petraeus possibly as a vice presidential candidate if you won the nomination?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We can't, now. He's been so badly hurt.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> What about a general?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's been so horribly -- well, look, he did a nice job. But he's been -- it was just -- he had bad judgment. But she has much worse judgment than he had, and she's getting away with it. It's unfair to him. And by the way, I came out -- they wanted to take away further rank, they want -- and I was, for the last month and a half, I was saying leave General Petraeus alone, he's suffered enough. Leave him alone. And now they're -- I said go get ISIS, don't get General Petraeus.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Donald, you have said you're going to build a beautiful wall and Mexico is going to pay for it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Right.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> But you never say how.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's so easy.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> You say believe me, they are.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's so easy.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Believe me is not an answer. How?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Believe me. Let me tell you. Believe me.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> How are you going to make Mexico pay...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Can I tell you? Can I tell you? You have to stop, and I'll tell you.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Tell me. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. We're going to have a trade deficit this year of $58 billion, OK? The wall is going to cost a fraction of that, maybe $10 billion or $12 billion, and it's going to be a real wall. It's going to be a high wall. It's going to be a beautiful -- it's going to be a wall that works.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> How do you get Mexico to pay for it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very simple. You have five different ways. Number one -- here's the key. They are making, right -- if you look at it a company -- $58 billion. The wall is a -- a year. We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion. All I have to do is start playing with that trade deficit, and believe me, they're going to pay for the wall. You watch.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> You're talking about a possible trade war with Mexico?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm talking about negotiating with them. I'm not talking a trade war with -- I'm talking about Japan. We have all the cards, Joe.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If we -- I was in Los Angeles. I see these massive ships coming in with cars. We have all the cards. We don't play them. We don't have the politicians that know how to play them. We're negotiating against great negotiators. China, Mexico, Japan, believe me, we're going to start doing great with those -- that trade. And that's the thing. Bernie Sanders can't do it. The bottom line is, I think he would be easier to beat than Hillary...
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... because I always wanted to run against a socialist in this country. I can't imagine it. But I think he'd be easier to beat.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> So let's get some final questions from our audience. Rebecka is a Republican. Rebecka, take it away.
<Question> <Positive> Hi. Hi, Mr. Trump. I was just -- I'm a college student, so education is really important to me. And I was just wondering, since there's so much going on right now in the rest of the campaign, I was just wondering how you are going to -- what -- like, what are your thoughts on Bernie's higher education plan and how he's going to reduce the cost --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The problem with Bernie -- thank you. That's a very good question. The problem with Bernie's plan is everyone's going to pay 95 percent taxes. I mean, you know, you have that and you have all the other things that he wants to do, and you're going to have...
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> So then let's talk about the cost then.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... you're going to have a tax rate of 95 percent.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So how do we reduce the costs for colleges? It's insane, the inflation rate...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're right.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> ... for higher education is...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know why?
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> ... is absolutely insane.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Because the students are a conduit to get all this money to the colleges. The colleges have gone crazy. You look at the fees they're paying, you look at the kind of numbers that the administrators make.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Colleges have gone up practically more than anyone, because the students, they're the real losers in this thing. They go borrow the money from the government, and the colleges charge more and more and more, disproportionately more. They have to bring down their costs. We have to help the students, Joe, because what the colleges have done, their costs have gone up more than anything, because the government basically gives them the money to do that through the students, but the students have to pay back the money. It's not fair to the students.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> OK. We've got -- we've got Hiral now...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good question. Thank you.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> ... who has a question. He's a Democrat. Hiral, take it away.
<Question> <Positive> Hello there, Mr. Trump. Thank you for being here. My question is, you're facing stiff competition from Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. How do you think you will set yourself apart from those two candidates? And how are you going to go and win the general election against, say, Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I will set myself apart because my policies are better, I'm a much better businessperson than they are. They've never employed anybody, ever. I think I'm a better leader.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm going to bring the country together far better than they're going to do, far better than they're going to do. You look at a guy like Ted Cruz, he's a nasty guy. He can't even -- he doesn't have one Republican endorsement from the Senate and he works with the Senate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Think of it. Hard to believe. Not one senator has endorsed him, and he's a senator.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it's fine to stand on the floor of the Senate for a day or two days and have everybody else in the Senate laughing at you and you do nothing. I mean, he accomplished nothing with that. He went out and he, you know, talked and talked for two days, he filibustered for two days, he got nothing out of it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will bring the country together. I will take care of our country. I'm going to make our country rich again, and then I'm going to make our country great again. But we have to become solvent. We have to become rich again before we become great. We owe $19 trillion. We've got to start paying it down. We've got to start balancing budgets.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right. Our final question is from Brenna. Brenna, take it away.
<Question> <Positive> Hello, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi.
<Question> <Neutral> My question for you is, why did you decide to run for president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My theme is make America great again. I want to make America great again.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want to make it strong -- because I love the country. I didn't need this, Joe. Believe me, I have a wonderful life, I have a wonderful company, I have a wonderful family...
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Is it worth it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, it's been certainly interesting. It's not easy. It's a lot of work. I mean, I'm here. I could be someplace else, to be honest with you. OK, I'm being drilled by the two of you. I could be someplace else. [Laughter] But so far, I think it's really been worth it. It's been one of the most interesting experiences -- probably the most interesting experience of my life. I've enjoyed it. I think I've done well. And we'll see what happens.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> That does it for us here in Charleston.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Thank you, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> We appreciate it.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Thank you to the audience.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Thank you, guys. We appreciate it.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Thank you so much. [Applause]
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> A great audience.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Our thanks to Donald Trump for taking the questions. Thank you very much. [Applause]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> We're going to be back with you live, starting at 6 o'clock Eastern tomorrow, live from Charleston here. "The Rachel Maddow Show" starts right now.
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> Yes, yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Tax, other things.
<Gerard Baker> <Positive> Yeah. Economy, trade, fate of the world -- world economy, market --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> As we speak.
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> Consumer confidence at a 17-year high.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What did you say?
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> Consumer confidence at a 17-year high.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Can you believe it? Isn't that nice. There's good reason for it, too, and I think we're doing pretty well on health care. We'll see.
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> Yeah, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I call it a motion to talk, you know. It's not a motion to proceed.
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> The Senate view --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's not -- basically, it's a motion to talk. But once you get that motion, it's in pretty good shape, once you get in. It's hard to get in, but once you get in. So we're going to see. John McCain was a great help, coming in as he did. And so it was something I very much appreciate, and we'll see what happens. We're going to know in about two hours.
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> What have you been doing, Mr. President, sort of behind the scenes?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A lot. A lot.
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> I mean, what do you think the crucial conversations have been?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Many conversations. I just had one with a certain senator that was very convincing to that senator. So I've done a lot. I mean, last night -- last night it was amazing. I was at the -- you know, I was in West Virginia doing certain things and making a speech to the Boy Scouts, and that was some crowd. That was an incredible crowd.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I've been working hard, trying to get the senators to go along with it. And I -- you know, I think I -- you know, look, just don't quote me on this unless it happens, but I think we have a pretty good shot. And that vote's taking place at about 2:00 today, right? 2:00?
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> A little bit later, yeah, exactly.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A little bit later?
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> All depending on McCain's plane landing.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> If you get the vote -- if you get the vote today to go ahead, what will be the next hurdle that you Ñ
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, then you have to go and decide on what plan you want, which way you're going to go. You want to decide on is it repeal or repeal and replace. If it's repeal and replace, which one do you want to go? Which form of existing conditions? I mean, there's many things. But once you're in there, then you can really negotiate. This is actually the heart, though. Once you're there, you can, you know, Gerard -- oh, say hello.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> Hi, Gerard. How are you?
<Gerard Baker> <Positive> Oh, hey. How nice to see you. How are you doing?
<Ivanka Trump> <Negative> I heard you were here. I wanted to come by and say hi. [Crosstalk]
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> How is your Arabella?
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> Oh, very -- [Inaudible] . She just got back from Costa Rica. She was there for two weeks. And how's -- and how's yours?
<Ivanka Trump> <Negative> Oh, very good. [Inaudible]
<Gerard Baker> <Positive> It was nice to see you out in Southampton a couple weeks ago.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So you do, you have a -- is it the same spelling?
<Gerard Baker> <Positive> I have an -- exactly the same spelling, Arabella. Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How did that happen? I think you named your daughter after --
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> It's an English name, but it's not particularly common, so.
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> It's not very common, yeah, no. Actually, we were there first.
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> You're the first.
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> Mine is -- mine is 15. How old is yours?
<Ivanka Trump> <Negative> Oh, OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So he's -- I think you copied.
<Ivanka Trump> <Negative> So I copied that. [Laughter]
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> Yeah, yeah, no, it's actually --
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> And I liked your editorial today, very nice. [Laughs]
<Gerard Baker> <Positive> Oh, good, good. Well, you see, you know, my colleagues write those, so they'll be -- they'll be Ñ
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You did a good job.
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, you really did.
<Gerard Baker> <Positive> Thank you very much. Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You did a good job. He's a good -- he's a good boy.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> They wrote a very nice editorial, so very good.
<Gerard Baker> <Positive> Thank you.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thanks, Honey. Stay around if you want.
<Ivanka Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we'll have the vote today at probably 3:00 or so. And we have the head of Lebanon coming in; that'll be interesting, a little -- a little change of pace. We keep it interesting. But so we'll see what that's all about.
<Gerard Baker> <Positive> Are you recommending to the people that you talk to a particular -- do you want -- are you saying do this and then go for repeal, or are you going --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd rather see repeal and replace because I -- I can do either way. If you remember, it was -- you know, it was an idea that I had very early on, repeal. Trouble with repeal is you'll have millions of people out there that -- well, it's like we just got the highest confidence in many years; you know, people out there that will say, well, you know, how do we know we're going to have health care? And I hate to do that to people.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> But you've been concerned about that, right --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've always -- I'm always concerned about that. I don't like it. I don't like it from that standpoint. Now, with that being said, you might be able to make a very good deal because I think there's a lot of pressure on the Democrats. But the Democrats are nothing more than obstructionists. That's all they can do. That's all they seem to be good at. So they're obstructionists, so what they will do, even though it's for the good of the country, they will obstruct. They can't do anything about Obamacare, and I understand that. They don't want to vote against it. But now, once it's done -- it was my original theory: Once it's begun, now they can get together. They can do something. But they won't do that. There's too much -- and this isn't with respect to me; this is years. This is years, Gerry. I mean, if you look at what's been going on over the last long period of time. I actually asked people that are political people -- I could ask you people -- you know, is it the worst you've seen it? And I've had every single person, no, actually there's certain other times that were worse. There were certain times in Obama's administration that were worse.
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> The partisanship, you mean?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You think -- yeah, the partisanship. So, anyway.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I'd rather see -- I'd rather see replace. I'd rather add the replace. And we have a very good plan. That's the one thing, we really have a good plan. We've covered a lot of territory. It's a very, very difficult situation because you move a little bit to the left and you lose four guys, you move a little bit to the right all of a sudden you have a bloc of people that are gone. You have about a one-inch road and it wheels through the middle of the valley, and if it's even slightly off. It's a very difficult -- it's a very difficult thing, always has been.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, if you think, Hillary Clinton, smart person, she was the first lady of the country, her entire life was spent -- her entire eight years was spent trying to get health care. Never even came close. Obama -- and one thing I have to say, I'm here now exactly six months. Obama took would you say a year-and-a-half?
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> He took a year and a half, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because people were saying, Trump has not produced. I honestly believe for six months I have done more than just about any president when you look at all of the bills that were passed, 42, 43.
<Gerard Baker> <Positive> What are you most proud of in the first six months?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A lot of things. I think I'm proud of the Supreme Court choice. And that's not just a nomination, that's getting him through. I'm very proud of opening up regulations. One of the reasons you see optimism is because people can actually use their land. They can farm their land. I've had tremendous and tremendous -- look, I had 45,000 people there yesterday. It's the biggest crowd they've ever had, and they were -- they were going wild yesterday in West Virginia. But people can actually use their land and they can build.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think one of the things that I have to be very proud of is the VA. I think we have a great, great administrator, OK --
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Shulkin.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... and a great secretary, David Shulkin. He's -- he was actually approved 100 to nothing, by the way.
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> What about your disappointments? Any disappointments in the first six months?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd have to let you know. I have to see where we are with this. Let's see. Maybe it doesn't work, but I think it's going to. And, you know, it is -- it would have been easier to start with taxes, but this is better if it works, OK? If it works, this is better.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> More general -- generally.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think, you know, depending -- so if you asked me that question in a month or really at the end of the year, because we hope to get this. We hope to get taxes and then infrastructure. And then I'm going to do a very big -- we're doing very big trade deals, and we're looking forward to that. But we want to do, ideally, this first.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, a lot of people said you should have started with taxes or you should have started with infrastructure. Well, infrastructure, I'll actually have bipartisan support, and I can use infrastructure to carry other things along. So I don't want to waste it at the beginning, if that makes sense.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Can I ask on that? I mean, are you confident? When you say the Democrats are obstructionists, and obviously they're looking ahead to the midterms next year, it doesn't seem like politically for Democrats there's a lot of incentive, even on a bipartisan thing like infrastructure, that might be popular -- [Inaudible] . How tough a road is it going to be? In any case, it's hard --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they tried -- they tried it with me. She spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads. She didn't do a positive ad, virtually. And she lost easily, you know, 306 to 223 I think, right -- 223, something like that. ...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, honestly, they -- the ads were coming at me. Hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of negative ads. And when people went into the voter booth, they didn't know what she stood for. I always said that. I said if I can take this onslaught personally, it's going to be a great thing because nobody knew what she stood for. So now, they're trying to change their message a little bit, you know. I mean, it's -- it's one of those things, but now they're trying to change their message and we'll see what happens.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think that we're doing very well. Every indication is that in every one of our swing states we're substantially up, like Ohio. Tonight I'm going to Ohio -- Youngstown, Ohio -- and we'll be up -- we're way up. You know, I won the state by 9 or 10 or something, by 9 or 10 points, without any governor support, OK? So you have the governor of Ohio not supporting you and you win by almost 10 points, which is pretty good because Ohio's not -- if you remember, you guys were always saying you have to win Ohio, right?
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, right, no, it's -- it was -- and we won, you know, by a landslide.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> [Inaudible.]
<Gerard Baker> <Positive> Yeah. [Laughter.]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we're up. We have now -- are you going tonight? Are you going to the speech in Ohio tonight?
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> We were in West Virginia yesterday.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, you did? Was that a scene, though? Huh?
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> That was a scene, yes. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Biggest crowd they've ever had. What did you think?
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> I thought it was an interesting speech in the context of the Boy Scouts.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> They seemed to get a lot of feedback from former scouts and --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Did they like it?
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> It seemed mixed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They loved it. [Laughter.] It wasn't -- it was no mix. That was a standing --
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> In the -- you got a good -- you got a good reaction in --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, you know, he writes mostly negative stuff. But that was a standing ovation --
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> You got a good reaction inside the arena, that's right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... from the time I walked out on the stage -- because I know. And by the way, I'd be the first to admit mixed. I'm a guy that will tell you mixed. There was no mix there. That was a standing ovation from the time I walked out to the time I left, and for five minutes after I had already gone. There was no mix.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Yeah, there was a lot of supporters in the arena.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I got a call from the head of the Boy Scouts saying it was the greatest speech that was ever made to them, and they were very thankful. So there was -- there was no mix.
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> Sir, can I ask you about taxes?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Gerard Baker> <Positive> So, you know, we're awaiting the outcome of health, we'll get a vote. I know you want to get tax reform done. Gary, you talked about it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, very much. Very important.
<Gerard Baker> <Positive> So can -- what's -- I mean, you've outlined the principles of tax reform. Can you tell us what you -- you know, what you want to achieve fundamentally in tax reform?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure. I want to --
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> What are the -- what are the main goals?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want to achieve growth. We're the highest-taxed nation in the world, essentially, you know, of the size. But we're the highest-taxed nation in the world. We have -- nobody knows what the number is. I mean, it used to be, when we talked during the debate, $2.5 trillion, right, when the most elegant person -- right? I call him Mr. Elegant. I mean, that was a great debate. We did such a great job. But at that time I was talking $2.5 trillion. I guess it's $5 trillion now. Whatever it is, it's a lot more. So we have anywhere from 4 [trillion] to 5 or even more trillions of dollars sitting offshore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We want to get that back, No. One, at a very reasonable cost. And that cost is going to be 10 percent. And right now, it's so high that, No. One: You would never do it on a business basis. But, No. Two: Bureaucratically it's impossible. Did you know that? I have friends that try and get their money back. They say they have to go through years of writing out forms and this and that to bring money back into the country. We're going to make that one -- like a half-a-page document. It's going to be very easy to bring your money back in. And it's going to be taxed at 10 percent, which is a rate that's -- it's within reason. And so that's one of the things we want to do. That'll be an easy one. That's one that -- you know, it's -- when you talk about a country that's broken or a system that's broken, there's something -- the $5 trillion, let's call it -- that the Democrats and the Republicans agree should come back in. It's been out there for years. Nobody ever did anything about it. I mean, Obama ...
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Well --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Obama could have gotten that money back in very easily, even if they did a separate bill. But nobody ...
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> Right. But a 10 percent corporate rate, that's ...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Ten percent.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Ten percent repatriation.
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> Repatriation rate.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> A repatriation rate. A 10 percent repatriation rate.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> What do you think is a reasonable corporate rate? We've heard 20 percent, but Ñ
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, we're going for 15 [percent] . We're going to see, and we'll see. But, you know, I don't want to say anything about negotiation. I mean, we are asking for 15 percent, and we think we're going to grow tremendously.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I deal with foreign countries, and despite what you may read, I have unbelievable relationships with all of the foreign leaders. They like me. I like them. You know, it's amazing. So I'll call, like, major -- major countries, and I'll be dealing with the prime minister or the president. And I'll say, how are you doing? Oh, don't know, don't know, not well, Mr. President, not well. I said, well, what's the problem? Oh, GDP 9 percent, not well. And I'm saying to myself, here we are at like 1 percent, dying, and they're at 9 percent and they're unhappy. So, you know, and these are like countries, you know, fairly large, like 300 million people. You know, a lot of people say -- they say, well, but the United States is large. And then you call places like Malaysia, Indonesia, and you say, you know, how many people do you have? And it's pretty amazing how many people they have. So China's going to be at 7 [percent] or 8 percent, and they have a billion-five, right? So we should do really well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But in order to do that -- you know, it's tax reform, but it's a big tax cut. But it's simplification, it's reform, and it's a big tax cut, 15 --
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> And on the personal side, the Treasury secretary back -- way back at the start of the administration said --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, we want to do personal.
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> Yeah, want to do personal taxes and want to make -- so whatever cuts in the rates that there are -- the marginal rates there are will be balanced by the reduction in deductions, so that the people who benefit from especially at the high end would not -- overall would not be net beneficiaries of tax cuts, right?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right. Yeah, that's -- we don't want --
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> And that's still the aim? That's still very much the aim?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I shouldn't say it with everybody in the room, especially Gary, but -- [Laughter] -- this is --
<Gary Cohn> <Negative> Yeah, let's all worry about me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The truth is the people I care most about are the middle-income people in this country who have gotten screwed. And this upward revision, it's going to be on high-income people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I was with Bob Kraft the other night. He came to have dinner with me. He's a friend of mine. And as he left, he said, Donald, don't worry about the rich people. Tax the rich people. You got to take care of the people in the country. It was a very interesting statement. I feel the same way.
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> Well, Gary's a middle-income -- [Inaudible] . [Laughter] He works for the White House. He's on a --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He had to pay 200 million in tax, Gary. Gary wrote a check for 200. [Crosstalk]
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> There was some focus -- Steve Bannon was saying that maybe you want a higher income tax than the 40 percent, you know, that you might be --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, that was not right. That was not a correct statement, no.
<Gary Cohn> <Negative> That was not a -- that was not a correct --
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> OK. OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We want -- look, the job producers we're going to take great care of, but we have to take care of middle-income people in this country. They built the country, they started this whole beautiful thing that we have, and we have to take care of them. And people have not taken care of them, and we're going to.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I mean, I have wealthy friends that say to me I don't mind paying more tax. And I'll tell you what I sort of don't like, is when they -- you know, you'll do your charts in The Wall Street Journal and they'll be brilliantly done, very nice, and they'll show that a rich guy who made, you know, $25 million last year is going to pay less than he was. In a certain way, I don't like that. I'd rather take that difference and put it into the middle-income and put it into corporate.
<Gerard Baker> <Positive> You should be able to get Democrat support for that, right? I mean, you can reach across the aisle --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, except they're obstructionists. If they weren't obstructionists, I would normally get Democratic support. So we don't anticipate that. We don't --
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> How would you rate your chances of being able to make those permanent as opposed to temporary?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, do you mean 10 years versus? So it hasn't really come up. I mean, the last time it was 10 years. When George Steinbrenner died, like with the estate taxes, the estate paid nothing. And if he would have died like two weeks later, they would have paid 50 percent of the Yankees. That would have been the end of the team, right? He had very fine tax planners. But it hasn't come up. We'd like --
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Or doctors. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We would like to make them permanent, but I assume you're talking about like a --
<Unidentified Male> <Positive> So if it balances in the 10-year window, it's permanent. The only way you have to end the tax plan is at the end of 10 years if it creates a deficit. We are working towards a plan that is permanent. To get the capital investment that the president wants -- and that's how you create jobs, and that's how you create economic growth -- businesses have to know it's a permanent tax change. So that is our objective.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Does that -- [Inaudible] -- for businesses?
<Unidentified Male> <Negative> We think -- we've spent an enormous amount of time working as a group to make sure that we get permanent tax change, simplification, and lower rates.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We think we're going to have tremendous growth. We think money's going to come pouring into the country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, we're losing companies. People don't even realize how bad it is, but we're losing companies every single day where they're leaving because the taxes are too high. When we do this, we'll have companies -- I know companies that have left. They go to Ireland, they go to other -- I own a lot of property in Ireland. They go to Ireland because of these incredible tax rates, and other places, right? We'll have companies pouring back into our nation. I mean, it's going to be -- you know, it's going to be beautiful.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I hope we can -- I hope we can do the 15 percent, actually. By the way, 15 percent is not by any means the lowest, but at least we would go from the highest to one of the lower, lower taxes.
<Ivanka Trump> <Positive> Another area of real focus has been skill training, as well, to ensure increased workforce participation and ensure that people are trained with the skills necessary for the jobs -- [Inaudible] .
<Gerard Baker> <Positive> We've read a fair bit about that.
<Ivanka Trump> <Negative> So you've been covering that a lot, but it's so important. It's one of the number one things we hear from the private sector, that they don't have people to fill the jobs they have and they are looking to fill. So we're working to close that gap.
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> Which is what makes immigration --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But one of the things we're doing that, so Gary and I are working -- because I said, you know, Gary, we're going to have Foxconn come in. We're going to have a lot of companies that are coming in. Foxconn's coming in with a big plan. We have Tim Cook I spoke to, and he's promised me three big plants -- big, big, big. I said, you know, Tim, unless --
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Really? Where?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We'll have to see. You can call him. But I said, Tim, unless you start building your plants in this country, I won't consider my administration an economic success, OK? And he's called me and he says, you know, they're going forward, three big, beautiful plants. You'll have to call him. I mean, maybe he won't tell you what he tells me, but I believe he will do that. I really believe it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I said to Gary, I said, you know, Gary, you go to certain sections and you're going to need people to work in these massive plants that we're getting, that are moving in. Where do we have the people? You know where we have the people? In New York state that can't get jobs, in many other places that can't get jobs. And people are going to have to start moving. They're going to move to Colorado and they're going to move to Iowa and Wisconsin and places where -- like if Foxconn goes to Wisconsin, which is one of the places they're very strongly considering -- but if Foxconn goes to Wisconsin and they have a very low rate and the governor's done an excellent job, you're going to have a situation where you got to get the people. But they're going to start moving. And I'm going to start explaining to people when you have an area that just isn't working -- like upper New York state, where people are getting very badly hurt -- and then you'll have another area 500 miles away where you can't -- you can't get people, I'm going to explain you can leave, it's OK, don't worry about your house.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, a lot of them don't leave because of their house. Because they say, gee, my house, I thought it was worth 70,000 and now it's worth nothing. It's OK. Go, cut your losses, right?
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> While we're on the economy, can I ask you, we're coming up very soon to the time to decide whether or not to reappoint Janet Yellen as the --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> -- chair of the Federal Reserve or to appoint somebody else. Are you – have you reached a decision?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a lot of respect for her, and I like her. I've met her just a couple of times, but I like her. It's early to make the decision. She doesn't come up until February/March?
<Unidentified Male> <Neutral> End of June.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> February. February 1st is --
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Yeah, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I have a lot of respect for her. I like her. She is --
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> Does that mean it's possible you would keep her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do like low interest rates. I mean, you know, I'm not making that a big secret. I think low interest rates are good. I like a dollar that's not too strong. I mean, I've seen strong dollars. And frankly, other than the fact that it sounds good, lots of bad things happen with a strong dollar.
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> So she's definitely -- she's definitely in the running to be replaced this time?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say -- you mean to stay?
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> To stay.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would say yes, she is in the running to stay.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Is Gary a candidate? [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He doesn't know this, but yes, he is. [Laughter]
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Are there other candidates?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I actually think he likes what he's doing right now.
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> That's what he tells us.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Don't tell Gary what I just said.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Are there other candidates?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, there are two or three. But she is -- she is in the running, absolutely. I like her. I like her demeanor. I think she's done a good job. I'd like to see rates stay low. She's always been -- you know, she's historically been a low-interest-rate person, a believer.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Do you have a time frame for announcing a decision?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say sometime by the end of year, probably.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> So you're going to wait till it's pretty --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think so.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> So you're not --
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> It would need a confirmation process, which will take time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, but it'll go quickly. We're starting to get them much quicker. You know, they've been really holding up -- I mean, nine months, they have really been -- that's all they can do well. You know how many people I have in there? I have -- I have a lot of people in there, and they complain to me. Like Woody Johnson. He's the ambassador to the Court of St. James, which is England, you know, et cetera, et cetera. And I mean, he said what they did to him was unbelievable. The process was so ugly. I've had three or four people to be ambassadors, tremendous people, very successful people. They called me and they -- their whole life they wanted to do this, and they gave up. It's, you know -- [Crosstalk]
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Are there other names?
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Are there other names you might offer who are in the mix for the Fed?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd rather not do that.
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> Kevin Warsh has been mentioned. Can we -- [Inaudible] --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I haven't -- I'd rather not get involved. But I would say she is, certainly. And Gary is somebody that I've gained great -- I've known Gary for a long time -- but I've gained great respect for Gary working with him. So Gary certainly would be in the mix. I just don't know if he'd like -- this is off the record -- if he wants to sit down. Interest rates will be moving up one-eighth of a point --
<Gerard Baker> <Positive> That's the exciting stuff. [Laughter] That's the exciting stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Right? Yeah, exactly. And then you leave. By the way, then the market crashes and it goes through the roof. You know, what you say. And then he goes off and he'll play golf and relax for the next 30 or --
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> So, Gary, Yellen, and there are other contenders you're thinking of?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, there are people that are highly respected that I would certainly think about. I don't know that Gary would want it. I think Gary loves what he's doing, you know, and he's doing a very good job.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Who else --
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Sometimes needs to get a comment from Gary. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You want to comment? [Laughs]
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> On the record. On the record.
<Unidentified Male> <Positive> This is an interview with the president. This is an interview with the president.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> We'll call your office.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> This is an interview with the president.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Can I ask another economics question, while we're on the subject?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> You tweeted this morning about trade talks with Britain.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Can you tell us more about what's going on?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but I can say that we're going to be very involved with the U.K. I mean, you don't hear the word Britain anymore. It's very interesting. It's like, nope.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> I work with a Brit.
<Gerard Baker> <Positive> I'm English. We always make that point. You're right, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Is Scotland going to go for the vote, by the way? You don't see it. It would be terrible. They just went through hell.
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> [Inaudible] -- but they're going to be --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They just went through hell.
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> Besides, the first minister's already made it clear she --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What do you think? You don't think so, right?
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> I don't.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> One little thing, what would they do with the British Open if they ever got out? They'd no longer have the British Open.
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> [naudible.]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Scotland. Keep it in Scotland.
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> We just had a -- [Inaudible] .
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By the way, are you a member there?
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> No. I've played there, but I --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I thought that course showed well.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> It's a gorgeous, gorgeous course.
<Gerard Baker> <Positive> Did you see Jordan Spieth's amazing --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I -- well, I saw his first four holes. And I said, man, that's the end of that, because -- you know?
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So for a guy to go -- you know, to me, that's almost worse than, like, a triple bogey, because -- but for a guy to go through these horrible holes, hit a bad drive like I've never seen -- I mean, he was 150 yards right. I don't know what that --
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Come on, you and I have hit worse drives. You and I have hit --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> No, no, but for -- I know, but for a tour pro it was very unusual. But for a guy to then go birdie, eagle, birdie, birdie, that's a special --
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> He could -- he could be a career major -- he could be the youngest guy to do the career major --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he's actually sort of -- he's in with Tiger and Jack. He's essentially even, you know, with a number of terms and a number of majors.
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> Anyway, are you looking forward to doing a trade deal with the U.K.?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. I have a great relationship --
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> It would be after, right? They have a time frame.
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> The one thing is there's a -- the one thing is there's a ticking clock with Brexit, so.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Well, yeah. Your tweet made it sound like you're really talking and so you have -- [Inaudible] -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have a very good relationship. I have a very good relationship with the prime minister. And we are absolutely looking to do a major trade deal.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Would the idea be that the trade deal will kick in pretty much as soon as Brexit happens?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> As soon as it's appropriate to have it kick in, absolutely. And it'll be a big trade deal -- much, much more business than we do right now, many, many times.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Are there keys that would be the important pieces of it? What would -- can you highlight specific --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There'll be certain pieces. It's not -- there'll be certain pieces. I mean, one of the things that -- I have a very good relationship with the EU people and all, but they are very, very protectionist. You know, our farmers and others can't even deal with -- you know, you can't sell in. It's very unfair. And that's what I've been talking about for a long time. It's so stacked against the United States. Now, the EU was conceived to the point that they wanted to do something to compete with the United States. Well, you know, you could say that's a friendly act or an unfriendly act. But it's very protectionist. Among the most, we have farm products that you just can't get into the EU. And we don't do that to them.
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> So you'd include an agriculture deal with the U.K.?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'll tell you, you know, I did -- I did thing that nobody even wrote about -- although, you did. [Laughter] But when I was with President Xi, who I have a very good relationship with, I said: Do me a favor. Would you allow cattle, please, to come in? I was last night in West Virginia, and I had farmers coming up to me and hugging me and kissing me because of the cattle stuff. They actually weren't from West Virginia; they were from other places. [Laughter] But, you know, it was the Boy Scouts, so they came from all over the country, but --
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> Could you do a services deal with the U.K.? Could that include services?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. It would include everything.
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> Including financial services?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, no, it would be very -- it would be -- it would be very all-in with --
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> That's a big deal.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Because we have a lot of financial companies already paring back their numbers, moving people to Frankfurt, already clearing out of London some. Do you think that's a good idea right now, ahead of this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's up to them. But we're going to have a very good relationship with the U.K. And we do have to talk to the European Union, because it's not a reciprocal deal, you know.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The word reciprocal, to me, is very important. For instance, we have countries that charge us 100 percent tax to sell a Harley-Davidson into that country. And yet, they sell their motorcycles into us, or their bikes, or anything comparable, and we charge them nothing. There has to be a reciprocal deal. I'm all about that. And you know, it's very interesting, at the border -- people may have problems with border, but when you say reciprocal, everybody says, oh, that's fair. So people have a problem with charging a 10 percent tax, which they shouldn't have but they do. But when you say you're going to charge reciprocal charge -- in other words, what they charge we're going to charge -- all of a sudden these same people -- it might be much more money -- but these same people, all of a sudden they're OK with it. So we have got to be much smarter.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, our country was built, to a large extent, on protecting our manufacturers. If you go back to Jefferson, you go back to all of these great, great people that ran the United States properly, it was really based on a certain form of tariff and a certain form of protection. We're just the opposite now. We're the people that are getting beat up -- one of the reasons I think I'm talking to -- I'm sitting behind this beautiful desk as opposed to somebody else.
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> What about -- just, very quickly, on tariffs. On steel tariffs, you committed to imposing steel tariffs. You haven't done that, but you still --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we're waiting -- we're waiting till we get everything completed. We don't want to do at this moment. We're going to -- we're going to wait till we get everything completed here. We're going to see. It's a very unfair situation. They're dumping steel in our country. It's extremely unfair. But we like to keep it as simple as -- we like to keep very complicated subjects as simple as possible. So we're waiting till we get everything finished up between health care and taxes and maybe even infrastructure. But we're going to be addressing the steel dumping at a very -- fairly soon.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We -- just so you understand -- we have massive reports. You know, a lot of this stuff you can't just walk in and say I'm going to do this. You have to do statutory studies. And then you have to wait 90 days. And then you have to do another. And you have to wait another 20 days. It doesn't go that quickly. It's like NAFTA. You know, you have a six-month termination. I was ready to terminate NAFTA. I was looking forward to it, frankly, because NAFTA's a horrible deal for the United States. And then I got a call from the president of Mexico, who's a terrific guy, and I got a call from the prime minister of Canada. And they heard I was getting ready to terminate it. And they said: Would you have a meeting with us first? I said, yes. And if you look at my speeches, I've always said, either renegotiate it or terminate it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, renegotiating it is easier. And we're in the midst of a renegotiation right now. So we'll see. And maybe we'll have to terminate it. I happen to think NAFTA's one of the truly bad deals -- I mean, outside of the Iran deal, which is one of the worst deals in history --
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Do you think it's salvageable? Do you think NAFTA's salvageable?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It may be salvageable.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> What do you need for that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would say -- I would say it may be salvageable. But certainly, I have an obligation to give it a shot.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> What are you looking for specifically --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm looking for fairness.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> But what does that -- can you give an example?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it means -- look, our automobile industry has just left us and gone to Mexico -- I mean, a big chunk of it. And it's very unfair for them to take our companies, built their cars, and then sell the car back into our country with no tax. It's very unfair. They fire all our people in Michigan and Ohio, and they take it, and they build a car. And now they sell the car back in with no tax. It's not fair.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Do they get that --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have a $70 billion trade deficit with China, as an example.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> What does the president of Mexico say when you say that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's not thrilled. But that's OK. I wasn't thrilled about what he said to me.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Does he -- but does he disagree with you about that view, or does he --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, there's not much to disagree with. Look, we have a $70 billion -- we have a $70 billion trade deficit. What is anybody saying? With China, we have 350 to 504. Nobody can really define it, deficit. We have a trade deficit of $350 to $504 billion each year. We're not going to be -- it's just not going to happen that way anymore.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> You mentioned the Iran deal, but it's been certified as in compliance twice now. It comes up again in September. Would you -- is there going to come a point where you just --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're doing major studies. Oh, I would be very surprised if they will be -- look, we've been extremely nice to them. We've been extremely nice to them in saying they were compliant, OK? We've given them the benefit of every doubt. But we're doing very detailed studies. And personally, I have great respect for my people. If it was up to me, I would have had them noncompliant 180 days ago.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Do you expect them to be declared noncompliant the next time?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Personally, I do. I do.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> In September?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think they'll be noncompliant. I think they're taking advantage of this country. They've taken advantage of a president, named Barack Obama, who didn't know what the hell he was doing. And I do not expect that they will be compliant.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Will you overrule your staff on that, if they come back with a recommendation --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, sure. Sure. Look, I have a lot of respect for Rex and his people, good relationship. It's easier to say they comply. It's a lot easier. But it's the wrong thing. They don't comply. And so we'll see what happens. I mean, we'll talk about this subject in 90 days. But, yeah, I would be -- I would be surprised if they were in compliance.
<Unidentified Staff> <Negative> Mr. President? I'm sorry. We just have time for a few more.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Mr. President --
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> OK, if I may, can I ask you quick, Mr. President, we've talked about your achievements and disappointments. I was reminded of President Eisenhower, when he left office, said that his two biggest mistakes in officer were both sitting on the Supreme Court. From things you've been saying in the --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So far I can't say that, right?
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> From the same -- from the things you've been saying in the last week or so, and tweeting, it sounds as though you may think that maybe your biggest mistake is running the Justice Department. Is that --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm disappointed in Jeff Sessions, yes.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Do you want him to leave?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Number one, they should go after the leakers in intelligence. I don't mean the White House stuff where they're fighting over who loves me the most, OK? [Laughter] It's just stupid people doing that.
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> Anthony's already taken care of that. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know, that's just -- and Anthony will handle that. [aughter.] I can -- Anthony can do that out of his back pocket, OK? I'm talking about intelligence leaks. I'm talking like the story about Syria that was in The New York Times the other day. I'm -- which by the way, was a decision made by people, not me. But, you know, they wrote it 100 -- it was in the --
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> The Post, I thought. It was in The Washington Post.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It was in The Washington Post. That was not something that I was involved in, other than they did come and they suggested. It turns out it's -- a lot of al-Qaida we're giving these weapons to. You know, they didn't write the truthful story, which they never do. So all of those things are very important. But, no, I'm very disappointed in the fact that the Justice Department has not gone after the leakers. And they're the ones that have the great power to go after the leakers, you understand. So -- and I'm very disappointed in Jeff Sessions.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> You can fire him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, Jeff -- I could. But we'll see what happens. But I was -- I appointed a man to a position. And then shortly after he gets the position, he recused himself. I said, what's that all about? Why didn't you tell me that you were going to do that, and I wouldn't have appointed you? But I appointed him. And shortly thereafter, he recused himself. So I think that is a --
<Gerard Baker> <Positive> You also suggested in Cleveland today they should be going -- or, yesterday -- they should be going after Hillary Clinton. Is that --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I didn't -- I wouldn't have wanted to. But I see the way they go after us on a witch hunt, you know? The Russian -- the Russian story's all an excuse for the Democrats losing. In fact, if you read the book, "Shattered," they have a whole chapter where they sat the day after the election and they said: Yeah, Russia. It was Russia. And, you know, Trump was involved. OK, the one thing interesting, you never heard me even associated with anybody. But, no, that's a total witch hunt, the whole Russia story. It's a hoax. It's a hoax. We had no collusion with Russia. We never dealt with Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> People that were on the campaign, like Corey, came in yesterday. It was very interesting. He was being interviewed. He said -- I was watching, Corey Lewandowski -- he says: I was here from the beginning. And I must be honest with you, I never dealt with any Russians. He was only the campaign manager. I can even look at Hope. She was here from virtually the same day that Corey started, those two. Hope, how many Russians have you seen involved in the campaign, OK?
<Hope Hicks> <Positive> None. [Laughs]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK? You know, I mean, it's sad. So they do that. And I say, that's fine. But then we should really look at real crimes, because real crimes are what Hillary did with 33,000 emails, where she deleted them and bleached them after getting a subpoena. Real crimes are what's happening and what happened with the uranium deal. And also -- I mean, you can say the speeches made while she was secretary of state where they paid her a fortune, Podesta owning a big company in Russia -- they talk about me. I have nothing to do with Russia.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I put out a letter from a very -- from the biggest law firm saying Trump has no involvement with Russia. I don't. I have no involvement. I mean, I had Ms. Universe there, like, nine years ago, eight years ago, something like that. But I have nothing to do with Russia. So -- and it's very funny, because all of these people that have been on the campaign, some of them right from the beginning -- Anthony's another example. You've been there. You know --
<Anthony Scaramuci> <Negative> [Identification unclear] [Inaudible] -- I said from the podium on Friday that's there's nothing to the Russia story. I said on the weekend there was nothing to the Russia story.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, Anthony came in to see me before it all began. And he said, I want to back you for president. This was before the June 16th day. I said, Anthony, I'm not really sure that I'm running. I'm not sure. I may, but I'm not sure. He said, you got to run, you got to run. I want to endorse you. I said, but I'm not sure. This was a few months earlier than when I ran. And he was leaving and he was disappointed. I say, Anthony, what are you going to do? He goes, I got to back somebody, because that's the way he is. That's his personality. And he went to a very good guy named Walker.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Then I came after the hedge fund business. So he wasn't in love with me for a short period of time. And he backed Bush. And that was OK. But his first choice was Trump. I think it's important to say that because, you know. Is that a true story, by the way?
<Anthony Scaramuci> <Negative> [Identification unclear] I was hitting you a little bit -- [Inaudible] -- hedge funds first.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Give me those notes, Hope, come on, just give -- I can't read it. What do you think, I have 20/20 perfect --
<Hope Hicks> <Neutral> I was just saying, you self-funded.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Huh?
<Hope Hicks> <Neutral> You self-funded.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, yeah, I self-funded much of my --
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Just on Sessions, just one thing. Would you like to see him step aside? Would you like to see him resign? Would it be in the country's best interest just --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm just very disappointed in him. I'm disappointed in, you know, a number of categories. I told you, the leakers. He should have -- he should be after them. So many people say to me: Why are they going after you on nothing and they leave Hillary Clinton alone on, you know, really major things? And it is -- so I'm disappointed in him. And don't forget, when they say he endorsed me, I went to Alabama. I had 40,000 people, you may have been there, remember, in Mobile?
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> I remember.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I had 40,000 people. He was the senator from Alabama. I won the state by a lot, massive numbers. A lot of the states I won by massive numbers. But he was a senator. He looks at 40,000 people and he probably says, what do I have to lose, and he endorsed me. So it's not like a great, loyal thing about the endorsement. But I'm very disappointed in Jeff Sessions.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Are you willing for the status quo to continue, though? At what point do you say enough?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm just looking at it. I'll just see.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> What about Bob Mueller?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a very important, very important thing.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> I mean, but, Bob Mueller is also really the one leading this investigation. It's his job to see --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're going to see.
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> And he's investigating Russia -- your Russian connection --
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> He's the Russian guy. So Sessions has recused himself, but is Bob Mueller's job safe? There is speculation --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, we're going to see. I mean, I have no comment yet, because it's too early. But we'll see. We're going to see. Here's the good news: I was never involved with Russia. There was nobody in the campaign. I've got 200 people that will say that they've never seen anybody on the campaign. Here's another -- he was involved early. There's nobody on the campaign that saw anybody from Russia. We had nothing to do with Russia. They lost an election and they came up with this as an excuse. And the only ones that are laughing are the Democrats and the Russians. They're the only ones that are laughing. And if Jeff Sessions didn't recuse himself, we wouldn't even be talking about this subject.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Would you consider --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, it was very interesting. Trey Gowdy said today -- again, he's a very straight shooter, he's a good guy -- he said, no, I understand the president. He was on Fox. He said: I understand the president. You put a man in office who really wanted that job. I actually said to him -- and you know some of my lawyers, it's not -- you know, off the record, it's not exactly -- right? You know some of them.
<Gerard Baker> <Positive> I know Marc quite well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, but a lot of them. But I put a man in office -- and he said this. And he goes in office, then he immediately recuses himself. I fully understand the president. You know, and a lot of people do, a lot of people. He -- you know, I don't go to loyalty. I think it's disloyal to the office of the presidency, not necessarily me. I think it's very disloyal to the office of the presidency. And if he didn't do that, you wouldn't have all this stuff. You know, you wouldn't have it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, just a couple of things before we finish. Just -- I'm sure you love Stuart Varney. But he just came out, $4 trillion in value in the stock market. RNC has more than 80 million in cash, whereas the Democrats owe money, OK, although they're trying to come up with their new campaign. Trust me, it won't work. And I said it the last time [Inaudible] . Immigration went down 78 percent at the border -- 78 percent at the border. Kelly's done a great job.
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> You going to veto the Russian sanctions legislation?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I haven't seen them yet. I haven't seen them in final form. I will say this, Congress, if they're going to negotiate, they make the worst deals I've ever seen. They made NAFTA. They made -- you know, they allowed the Iran deal to go through.
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> You said you're opposed --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I make good deals. I don't make bad deals. I make good deals. So, but, I haven't made my -- I have not seen them. I have to see.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> By the way, a lot of things have taken place in that agreement that are a lot different from what it was two weeks ago -- a lot of things.
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> You also -- you brought in Anthony, obviously. Are you planning other changes -- are you planning other changes in the White House? After you brought in Anthony, are you planning other changes?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, we'll see. We'll see. I do say this, I believe we've done more than just about any president of the United States in six months. And I was going to tell you before, so a lot of times I'll turn on television or I'll read in The Wall Street Journal, right --
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- what's Trump doing? He hasn't produced health care. I'm not even six months yet, right? So these guys went eight years -- Hillary Clinton, eight years, got nothing. Obama went a year and a half, almost two years, and they had to sell their soul. They had to give away the state of Nebraska in order to buy that vote. And that was two years. I'm six months. They got to give me a little break, OK? And today we're having a big vote, and we'll see what happens. But today's vote is big, because once you get in -- once you're allowed to talk a lot of --
<Gerard Baker> <Neutral> But we can't expect any more staff changes in the immediate -- in the immediate future?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think so.
<Gerard Baker> <Negative> No?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I'm very happy with Anthony. I think Anthony is going to do amazing.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Would you consider pardons, Mr. President, given the investigation is --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what? I don't even think of pardons. Here's why, nobody did anything wrong. Look at Jared, everybody -- we do appreciate the editorial -- but everybody said Jared Kushner. Jared's a very private person. He doesn't get out. I mean, maybe it's good or maybe it's bad what I do, but at least people know how I feel. Jared's this really nice, smart guy, who'd love to see peace in the Middle East and in Israel, OK?
<Wall Street Journal> <Negative> Gerry, yeah, Gary and are bouncers from -- [Inaudible] . [Laughter]
<Gerard Baker> <Positive> Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Mr. President.
<Wall Street Journal> <Positive> Thank you, Mr. President. Thanks.
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Tom Barrack as Mexican ambassador?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm thinking about it. What do you think? Do you like him?
<Wall Street Journal> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Tom Barrack, yes? Call him up, tell him I'm giving it to him. [Laughter.]
