<Phil Donahue> <Negative> For $800 million bucks. I read it in the paper. And you're not even -- are you 40?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm 41. Yes, 41.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> 41. I want to show you what he just bought. He bought Marjorie Merriweather Post's 150 rooms, 56 bedrooms, this guy's got in Palm -- show 'em, Brian. This is Mar-a-Lago, that's an aerial view. Now listen to this, I think we got -- there two pictures here on that. You've got to see this place. Look at this.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> He has a staff of 50, 30 security guards, and this guy can't buy your lunch after Black Monday. How did you do that? You must've lost your shirt. Come on.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I was lucky. I was out of the market pretty much. Like you, like you and like a lot of others. I think most of the people in your group. I don't suspect too many of you are in the stock market doing a little cred. A couple were, a couple were. I wasn't. I like real estate better.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> This -- he -- when you graduated from high school, he had 200 -- from college, he had $200,000, went to the Wharton School of Finance, University of Pittsburgh. I'll tell you --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> University of Pennsylvania.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> I'm sorry, University of Pennsylvania. I'll tell you this. You know, I -- I kind of -- after reading your book, I kind of like your father better than you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a nice guy. You have good taste. He's a good guy.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Show him number one. Let's just try and briefly give you a bio here. This is Fred Trump age 80-something.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, he's 81.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Eighty-one. He built middle-income housing in Queens and Brooklyn. And little Donald goes along and rummage around the construction sites. And obviously, his father taught him a thing or two along the way. Look, uh -- let's see number three. Here -- here's 12-year old Donald inspecting and checking out the geology.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> I don't know what you're doing there. But now listen to this. Your parents, enlightened as they were, sent you to -- next slide. The New York Military Academy. Only you went -- not in this uniform. Is that somewhere in the computer? There you -- oh, look at the proud parents. And obviously, the strap is so you'll keep your mouth shut.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Something -- and your graduation photo, next slide. Just give him a quick trip here. Look at this. So, you came out disciplined. You probably said yes, sir, no, sir, and all those --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was a good education. It was a good training. It was a good training. I enjoyed it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Uh-huh. You didn't get married until you were 30-something.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Thirty-one years old.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> You lived in a small apartment in Manhattan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A little small apartment. I had a lot of good time in that apartment. There was a lot of fun. I've had more fun in that apartment than I have in Trump Tower, as good as Trump Tower.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Your dad would build medium-priced housing and the rules, as I understand the game, as you explain it to us in this book, Trump: The Art of the Deal, and not a few folks are rolling the dice on this one too. The front page of The Wall Street Journal today tells us that they're printing 150,000 copies. Tweak your cheek a bit.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> You said there were 200, exaggerating Mr. hype.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'll tell you truthfully. I thought it was 200 and I think it will be 200, but I'm not sure what it is. I don't know what it is exactly. It's 150,000 to 200,000. I guess. I don't know.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> Are you going to sign books in the stores? Are you going to do all that stuff?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Every once in a while I might have to do it. Whatever it takes. All the money's going to charity. I'm giving all of the proceeds to charity. So, it's nothing for me, but it's something very important. I'd like the charities to get a lot of money and I'd like to also make it nice and successful because I like having successes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like success much better than failure somehow. I don't know.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Show them, Mrs. Trump. Number seven that is in our computer. Ivana is her name. She was a top fashion model and a -- yes, she was. Looking at here and also a skier. I believe a near Olympian.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, she was. Yes, she was.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> I -- here you are on your honeymoon, next slide. Where did you go on the honeymoon? You probably went to Atlantic City?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We were in Hawaii.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Oh, Hawaii. You -- you really have caught the attention. You're a star, Mr. Trump and you're a businessman, and you do not run away from publicity. We can only speculate on how long you may have posed for these rather flattering --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Not long.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> Not long, just --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A good thought about being -- I don't have enough time to do a lot of posing. And fortunately, we have some pretty good photographers. So, they get good pictures, but it's not -- not a lot of time, Phil. I just don't have the time, unfortunately.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> You -- your father had to come in at the right price and he also was entitled to 7.5% profit is that what I am --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Basically, that's right. Yes.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> And so, he had to really count the nails just --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A much different business. There's no question about it. I mean, I count the nails also, but I count them in a different sense. My father build low- and moderate-income housing in Brooklyn and Queens and it was a tough business. And today, that kind of a business really doesn't even exist. Unfortunately, you don't have the government programs that allowed you to do this years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> My business is much different than that and it's turned out to be wonderful, but it's much different. It's a much different kind of a business.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> You say that in order to ensure that he was profitable, this made it extreme. It's made it very necessary for your father to be -- he was at the site at six, wasn't he, in the morning?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was there early in the morning and he'd leave late at night and every nail was going to be counted and he knew every contractor, as I do really. You have to know what you're doing. You take a look at the City of New York, they can't build an ice skating rink. An ice skating rink was under construction I guess for a period of seven years, the Wollman Skating Rink in Central Park and they couldn't build it. They spent $12 million or $14 million, it was supposed to cost $2 million, and we did it for about four months, as you know, for a very small amount of money.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And you know --
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> It's a big, big success story, no doubt about it. You came in and came in under and you did it months when the city was fooling around. It was -- it was a very interesting statement on government bureaucracy et cetera, et cetera. And boy, you looked like a Republican businessman standing there when they cut it -- cut the ribbon.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> But who's to complain? That -- they're skating as we speak, in Central Park. Now, you try to get in. You're single and you're out of the Wharton School and you've moved to Manhattan.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Leaving your roots, we might say. Ahem, we can only speculate how your father felt about that. And you want to join the club, Lake Club.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you know that club. You're there all the time, and you know, he's -- he's putting on there a little lack of pronunciation here. You were never in the club, huh?
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Call me anything, but never call me a hypocrite. I've never been to Lake Club, but I'd be proud to be there someday.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK. Good play. Good play.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> I just -- I don't need -- fine. You meet -- Now, who is this guy, Trump? He's 27 years old. The guys says you know, we don't -- it's you know. So, he calls the President, he gets them to have a drink with them. They go to 21 and these guys are drinking. Now, I just wasn't used to that. You say, listen, fellows, I got to go home.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> They say, no, let's have one more. No, I wasn't used to that, you say. I have a father that has always been a rock, very straight and very solid. I believe that. My father would come home every night at 7:00, have his dinner, read the newspaper, watch the news, and that was that. Swedish. Swedish?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Swedish, German, a lot of -- a lot of different things. Mostly good, right?
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> His -- his -- when his, his --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good, strong, good, solid man.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> And his father probably plowed his road straight or whatever they --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very strong, his marriage.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Right. And I'm as much of a rock as my father. This was a totally different world. I remember wondering if every successful person in Manhattan was a big drinker. I figured if that was the case, I was going to have a big advantage. The guy's almost passed out. You helped him home and you got in the club.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I got in. Later on, I got in, yes.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> You're a rock. You don't drink at all.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, when I say rock. I mean, I think, I think of myself as being a solid guy. You have different definitions of people nowadays. You have the word flake. You have people that are strong, people that aren't strong, and everyone is fine. I'm just saying that I would say that I'm rather solid and I'm proud of that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was a little -- when I came into Manhattan at first, I saw people that were not of the same ilk in the sense that in certain instances, they just weren't what I grew up with. In terms of a very strong father figure, a very wonderful mother figure, and I was seeing different kinds of people. And it was interesting to me, but I thought I might have an advantage.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Uh-huh. Do you drink white wine to -- while you're still --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I really don't drink at all.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> You don't drink at all?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't -- I don't drink for a lot of reasons. I don't like what it does to people. I figured it can't be good and I just don't really enjoy the taste, perhaps most importantly, but I don't like it. I've seen so many people over the years that I had great respect for, and then, we'd go out and I'd see him totally lose control.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And all of a sudden, I say, why would a person subject themselves to that? I mean, I've had people who I have tremendous respect for, and then, you go out to dinner and you have to literally carry him from the -- from the table to the house.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Not a good thing. We all agree.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I don't -- I don't like it.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Mike Wallace called this to your attention during your 60 Minutes piece on you. You're always dressed up. I mean, at the poolside, in your Greenwich home, and the Sunday afternoon you come up with the silk tie and that's just who you are, huh?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's just -- I don't know. I tend to be formal. I like being formal somehow and I'm not always dressed up. On a Sunday I'm not dressed up and on a Saturday depending on what I'm doing. But generally, I tend to be doing business and usually for business, I feel that you should be sort of attired a certain way, and I've always been somewhat formal in that regard.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd rather be a little bit too formal than not formal enough.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> You're -- I bet you, you pick up your socks and your underwear too. Don't you or do you? I don't know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I never gave it much thought but I guess I do now that I think of it.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> Do you deposit them in the appropriate --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I put them -- I put them wherever they go.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> How did, did -- did the New York Military Academy do that for you or we were always like that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think and maybe this is a part of the book and what's happening. I think that people tend to be what they are. If a person's neat, if a person's orderly, they tend to be that way throughout a life. And if they're not, they tend not to be. I've always been pretty neat and pretty orderly and pretty, pretty well adjusted from that standpoint.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, I've just -- I've had good training. But I really believe that in many cases and perhaps that's not a good example, but in many cases, people really have it or they don't have it, and that's what I'm trying to get through to an extent in the book.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Yeah. I -- your mother is of Scottish -- Scottish by birth and you tell us here. I must say there's very -- some personal information in here, not a lot, but it's an interesting look.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like to leave it out as much as possible.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Well, that's getting more and more difficult when you're going to be worth $1 billion, you've got to start answering some questions here. Your mother watched the coronation, didn't she, of Queen Elizabeth?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I guess. Yes.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> '53, I think somewhere in there -- don't. And your father is -- for God's sake, what are you doing? She just sat in front of that set all day. Didn't she? Watching in that --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's really a wonderful woman and she's got the little showbiz, and perhaps, that's -- I mean, I was obviously very young, but just in thinking back, I believe that whatever I have in terms of the dramatic whether it's a Trump Tower or doing a Trump Park or whether hotels or whatever it might be. I think I've gotten a lot of that from my mother actually and my father was a very strong, solid, meat and potatoes guy --
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Excuse me. Where are you in this shot? Is that you with the hair?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'm on the left.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> All the way on the left?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I'm on the left.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> Uh-huh. Go ahead. You were saying --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, my father's a little bit different type. He gets things done and quickly and all, but he's less, perhaps, less promotional oriented. So, it's a good combination I think. Getting, getting -- if you get the best traits of both. That's a really good combination. I hope.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> You -- your father was -- was there a lawsuit -- you didn't have enough black or he didn't have enough blacks in his project. There were blacks in his housing development, but the federals, the government, and that upset you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I didn't like it because it was in fact and I decided to fight it. And this was a lawsuit against numerous landlords in New York. Many, many years ago and I didn't like it because it wasn't true. In fact, in one building they went, and there was a preponderance of blacks, as opposed to whites, and I remember being asked a question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The question was asked about people. How many blacks do you have? And we said some huge number like 70% or 65% and they almost fell off the chair. Here they are suing us and we're saying the said number. We've never discriminated. We don't believe in it. And I just thought on a principle ground, I should -- I should fight, and other landlords didn't.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we settled and it worked out very well.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> One of the people you meet at Lake Club, I got to get to this place, was Roy Cohn. May he rest in peace. You liked him. He was feisty.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I liked Roy from the standpoint that he was a very loyal guy. When you see things happening nowadays, you see very little loyalty. When you see an Ed Koch leaving everybody that gets in trouble in New York immediately. He doesn't know his commissioners, he doesn't know Morris, and he doesn't know anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He doesn't want to know about it. You know he just drops them like they never existed. The one thing I'll say about Roy is he was an extremely loyal guy and he was a very unusual guy in that respect. So, he was loyal and loyalty is a great trait. In my opinion, it's a great trait. It's a trait that maybe can cause problems, but it's also a great trait.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Right. Well, this is interesting because as you know, you're the fat-cat developer and you know the book on you is that you throw little old ladies, who can't afford the rent out of the apartment.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't think that's the book on me if you want to know. Well, I think -- I don't think it is at all. I think probably it's just the opposite. We have very wealthy people in this particular building. We have a building on 100th Central Park South. The best, probably the best piece of real estate in New York in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we have very wealthy people, extremely wealthy people living in this building, a second home --
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> It's not quite accurate to say that every occupant is extremely wealthy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, but the ones that were complaining were the wealthy ones. The ones that were complaining, Phil, were the wealthy ones. These were people with a lot of money. One of them is a brownstone, a number of brownstones in East 66th Street. Yet, she's living in this building for a rent-controlled rent. The rent-control people, the people that need rent control, they're not the ones that are protected.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's people that are usually wealthy, with a lot of influence, that have the connections to get a rent-controlled apartment. People that might need it, they don't have rent-controlled apartments.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> Well, that's a little fast. I mean that's a little bit like saying, you know, those people were out of work because they're lazy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's not --
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> I think it may be -- all right. Well, first of all, let's look -- let's be -- the building on Central Park South has been settled. You own it and you -- you've made your deal with all the residents. Score one for you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're very happy. We're very happy.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> I'm -- back to this -- to this lawsuit. So, you hire Roy Cohn and he goes to work and you win it. Cohn doesn't like lawyers either because they always want to settle and you don't like that about lawyers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The idea of settling drove me crazy. The fact was that we did rent to blacks in our buildings. What we didn't do was rent to welfare cases white or black. I've watched what happened when the government came after Samuel LeFrak and other builder and he caved in and started taking welfare cases. They virtually ruined his buildings.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Welfare cases ruined his buildings. Isn't that actually pretty close here to looking like an insensitive guy from atop your Trump Tower, looking down on Wollman Rink over the vast holdings of your own empire? Shouldn't we have just a little more understanding from a man of your influence and wealth on the issue of making New York livable for all of us. Safety on the subway.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> These kinds of things. If that -- if the answer is absolutely, then, we can't continue to give you guys these big tax breaks and that would go for General Electric and NBC too.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> You tell us in your own book that you would make money on the Trump Tower in New York without the tax breaks.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When everybody else has -- no, when everybody else in the city gets it, but Donald Trump. When Koch and the administration tries to stop Donald Trump. And I don't say give me the tax breaks, I say, don't give everyone else the tax breaks. If every other building being built in New York City is entitled to a residential tax abatement and Trump Tower goes and I'm not entitled.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm the only building in the city of New York that's not entitled. I don't think that's appropriate.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> Look at the -- look at the location of your building.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What difference does it make? Phil, there are other wonderful locations also that are also getting tax abatements. I won the case, they didn't give it to me. It took me two and a half years in court. I won at seven to nothing in three different courts and I'm very happy about it. I didn't win it because I so much needed it as much as because on a moral principle, I was entitled to it. If nobody's going to get it, I'm satisfied.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If everybody is going to get it, I shouldn't be the only one that's not getting it, Phil. And I know you well enough to know that you wouldn't take it either. If you were in my position, you wouldn't take that. So, that's what happened.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Hey, let's hear it for the rich folks. But you tell us also in your book, you left Queens you left Brooklyn for Manhattan to get away from rent control. You're honest to tell us in this book.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm honest. Hey, I'm not running for anything, Phil. I'm not running for office. I don't have to lie in a book. I want to tell the facts, OK? I mean do you want me to -- do you want me to say little fibs and little this and little that and how much we all love rent control and what a great thing it's been for New York?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's been a disaster for New York. It's badly hurt New York. It's crippled New York. It's made it impossible for a lot of people to live in New York and you see what's happening. You look at the Bronx. You look at certain parts of Queens and Brooklyn. You see what rent controls has done and I think you know it as well as anybody else.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Rent control and I'm one of the few developers in the world that would ever say it. Some forms of rent control are sometimes necessary to protect the elderly, to protect people that truly don't have the money. But when you have multi-millionaires and not all instances of this. And Phil, there's not all instances, but if you go to Manhattan, the prime sections of Manhattan.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have rent control and rent stabilization all over. Those are wealthy people in many instances and I don't mean every instance, Phil. But I mean in many and I would say in a majority. You have multi-millionaires, in some cases, living in apartments for $200 and $300 and $500 a month that you'd be paying many times.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is going to sound a little unusual, but New York rents can be $10,000 and $20,000 a month. What does that mean? What does that mean, Phil? That means that the city can't tax because if a wealthy person's paying $300 a month, you can't really tax that beyond a certain point, 20% of that or whatever it might be. So, the city is always short of funds.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a joke what's happened. And the people that need rent control and there are some indeed, those aren't the people that have it. It's the people with the connections. Somebody knows Trump, somebody knows somebody else. They call up and they say, do me a favor. That's what it's all about.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> If -- if the Saudis want to get in here. Mr. Trump, sir, if your position is -- let's grant it given. No doubt about it. Under a rent-controlled circumstances, there's -- there are going to be certain people who don't need it who get it, not unlike Social Security. There are going to be some people who get it who don't need it. But to suggest that -- that rent control is somehow being pervasively abused throughout the island of Manhattan by people who don't need it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do you not have plenty of doubt?
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> I do have plenty of doubt.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Check the numbers, Phil. I mean I can tell you something. Now one little thing. All I'm asking for is a simple thing. Give a means test. If a person makes $150,000 a year working at a big advertising agency. If a person makes $200,000 - $300,000 - $100,000 - $75,000 a year, let it be a means test. So that that person will give the apartment to somebody that can afford it if you have to do that Phil.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why can't there be a means test? Why should multi-millionaires live for $300 or $400 a month when poor people are paying more than that and have to pay?
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> And how many people would have to work in the office to determine whether or not people are of means or not of means, and would you build the building? It would be a very large one occupied by thousands of bureaucrats trying to figure out who doesn't, because who doesn't.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> you wouldn't, you wouldn't need that.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> It isn't that simple just --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And do you know what kind of money you're talking about? If you emptied and made available to people they could have -- that need really this protection, the apartments occupied by very wealthy people in New York. You're talking about tremendous amounts of money. And I mean, if you're talking about a number of accountants in order to administrate a program, you're not talking about a lot relative to what we're talking about.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> OK. We've got a lot -- just a couple more things I want to get in. Let's see if we can briefly touch on some of these things. You should not have called Mayor Koch a moron. That was not good public relations.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hey, what can I do?
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> Well, it -- doesn't it -- isn't? Aren't you a little, don't you want to take this back at all?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't -- I don't think it's bad public relations. No, I don't take it back. When it comes to running the city, he's about as bad as anybody I've seen. Ed Koch has been a disaster for New York. People that live in New York understand it. Taxes have gone through the roof. Everything's gone through. You have whether it's a Wollman Rink or a subway system.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Whether it's a school that comes in it takes eight or nothing.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Excuse me, but here are you -- you're out with your folks at City Hall getting your picture taken. Was it good old days?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. Well, right. I guess he liked me in those days.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> No, I just think that -- and this is and I don't think you have to be passionately committed to City Hall or anybody just to conclude that this kind of language from someone of your power and influence is not good style.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Phil, from my standpoint, it doesn't really matter. Again, I'm not running for office. If the point is made better by saying that, let the point be made. He's done a lousy job as the mayor. Anybody from New York probably understands it and knows it. It's here, it's gone down now, and it's going down as the most corrupt -- hey, Phil, this is the most corrupt administration in the history of the city, OK?
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> They have their problem. I -- I have here a collection of some of your quotes from Newsweek. I'm happy to give them credit. On his enemies, if I -- if people screw me, I screw back in spades.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean is there something wrong with that? Tell me. Phil, is there something wrong with that?
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Well, a confrontational kind of gets you -- you son of a --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me give you a little example, if I can, OK? Let me give you an example. This country, as I walked into this room today, the stock market was down 75 points, OK?
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> We should say that we're taping on November 30th. We're going to scare the life out of people who watch it. We are taping on the last day of November in 1987, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's a lot of problems. You had Black Monday. You have the catastrophe of the 500 in April. Let me -- let me just give you one little example. We have countries out there that are our so-called allies, and I use the word so-called because they're a disaster for this country, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're making billions and trillions of dollars while this country is going out and borrowing money from Japan in order to defend Japan. They don't spend on defense. We defend Japan. We get oil into Kuwait, and then, they go out they buy 10% of British Petroleum.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I tell you what. Do you know what I --
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> I think they ought -- I think they ought to increase their defense spending a hundredfold and their economy will collapse just like ours has. Japan had -- wasn't Japan a partner in your TV City project?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Japan wanted to be a partner.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> 25%, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They want to buy it. They want to buy everything. Hey, for 20 years they've taken money out, and now, they're coming back with demands of a low dollar, caused to a large extent by them, and they want to put it back in.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> You had a $100 million deal with the Japanese. You went back to them you said you're changing the price to $160 million. They said we're out of this. You went back to them and said OK $100 billion. They said we don't want a deal.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Where do you read this? You read the newspapers. Do you believe the newspapers?
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> It must be true. I read it in the New York Post.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I thought that maybe, maybe is the case.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> Is it not true that you lost the Japanese partnership?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But nobody does a lot more business than me. Phil, let me just explain something. I build luxury apartments. We sold an apartment to a Japanese gentleman, a number of apartments for $21 million, OK?
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've sold other apartments for lots of money to the Japanese. They're some of my best friends, OK. And I just say, and I respect the Japanese, but they have taken tremendous advantage of the United States, folks. In case anybody doesn't understand --
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> And what do you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What do I want to do? I want us to be represented in such a way that we can compete with Japan. They've taken the money out for 20 years, and now, they're buying it back in. So, what they did is they took it out, and now, they're coming and trying to buy all of Manhattan, trying to buy anything. And Phil, I don't like being taken advantage of, OK?
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> On Michael Dukakis, on the other Democratic Presidential candidates, Americans are tired of the Seven Dwarfs. On Leona Helmsley, I feel sorry for Harry. On Trump, there is no one my age who has accomplished more. Everyone can't be the best and we'll be --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Did I say that?
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> That's what it says.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't believe it. I don't believe it.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> And we'll be back in just a moment.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't believe it. I don't believe it.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> To accommodate something like 17 people or 14 or a couple of bedrooms does it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is getting to be an embarrassing --
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> And you've got a -- and you've also got a yacht. I forget the number of the price on that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We wanted to get something back. Hey, Phil --
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Are you happy? Are you happy? What are you happy --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean I wanted to get something back from Saudi Arabia. So, I got one of their yachts. You know it's about time. We should take -- we should do more of it. Everybody is getting from us.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> Now, NBC is not, is not apparently, going to be in any agreement with you on the terms of its occupancy of Television City. A 150-story building, which you want to construct on the Hudson River. It would -- if you completed this project be the tallest building in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Wouldn't this be a great thing for New York? I mean you left Chicago, in all fairness, Phil. So, I mean shouldn't New York have maybe the world's tallest -- but wouldn't it be a nice thing for New York, Phil?
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Well, it depends.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> For those of us that are proud of New York or used to be at least.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> Now, how much tax abatement is it going to take to build Television City? How will it contribute to the long-term well-being of the city? What money is not given? How will the tax money, not forthcoming to the city to influence people who are not of wealth? All these are pretty important questions.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why would you say I'm asking for tax abatement for the world's tallest building? I'm not asking for tax abatement. You assume I'm asking for tax abatement.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> You're not asking for any tax abatement?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I'm not asking for tax abatement in the world's tallest building, and you know, not every job has to have tax abatements, Phil. That's one that pay. If they want to give it to me, I'd love to take it. But to be perfectly honest, I'm not asking for tax abatement on the world's tallest.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Well in what language --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, you're on the assumption that everything I do, I'm looking for an edge, and that's not necessarily correct. It's usually correct, but it's not necessarily.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> Well, what is the status of that deal. You and NBC have broken off --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, NBC, the process is going to be too long. I'm going for zoning on the Westside. It's a fabulous parcel of land on the West Side of Manhattan, fronting the water from 72nd to 59th Street, and I'm going for zoning. New York City is a very cumbersome process. This will be a very impossible --
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> This is here -- I think we have a shot. There it is.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There it is.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> This side hundred acres. Think about this in Manhattan -- on Manhattan Island. This is -- that's the Hudson River. Now, what do you want? What shall we do with this property and who shall decide? And how much and who will -- who will live there? Who will work there? Where will they park? And how -- what?
<Question> <Neutral> How are they going to get into the Broadway and &2nd Street subway station?
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> Well, they're not. It's going to be a great big empty building and nobody's going to be able to get to the stage. What -- just very briefly, what -- tell us. What is -- what is the status of this?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's going through a long process. The New York City -- in New York City, when you build something you have to go through a very agonizing long process. And it's a process that's putting New York, frankly, at a great disadvantage with other cities because if you want to put something up, it could take years and years before you do it. Work toward the middle, maybe even, rounding the corner on the end of that process.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I guess, over the next period of a year, hopefully, it'll be ready. And if not, I'll just sit back and wait a lot. Perhaps a more progressive administration comes in. I'm not sure. I may have to do that which would be unfortunate for New York. Everybody agrees this site has to be developed. It's probably the most important side.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You probably know it because you're in that area, but it's the most important site in New York and it's got to be developed and it will be developed. It's a question of when. It's a very important site for New York and for the future of New York.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Yes.
<Question> <Positive> What charities do you benefit?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I give a lot of money to charity and more and more so, and I think, that I'm going to be doing more in the future. I gave a lot of money to the Vietnam Veterans. Do you remember the big parade in New York? I gave $1 million toward that on a matching grant a year, a year and a half ago, whenever it was.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I think, if you asked any Vietnam vet what they think of Donald Trump, I think they'd think -- I hate to be talking about it, to be perfectly honest. Because I don't like to be bragging that I gave $1 million last year to the Vietnam vet -- and vets and it's not really my style. And perhaps, Phil and other people wouldn't like it even for my image because it's not the image that they want to project.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I gave a lot of -- I gave a lot of money to the United Cerebral Palsy, many millions of dollars. In fact, I gave him a building a lot of other money. I believe strongly that you have to put it back and I give I think far more money or more, in most cases, more money than just about anybody else comparably, OK? Thank you.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> You're going to have a you're going to -- you're going to have a very large party to celebrate the publication of your book. I am told that this party, incidentally, I do not have -- having reviewed all of the many invitations that I, of course, receive every day.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I just happen to have that.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> I have not yet. This obviously, you know --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'll have one -- I'll have one by four o'clock.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> Oh, thank goodness. It's probably the government again. The postal service, I'm sure lost it. Here's my question. You can't start this party in your atrium lobby of Trump Tower because that is a public arena. At least legally defined as such, until 10 o'clock.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> 10 o'clock is when it starts. So --
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Well, that's late for a book party?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it's not. No.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Remember the old days of Studio 54? When did you go there before 10 o'clock, if you ever went there? Maybe you never went there. You never went to Lake Club.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Here's the point. Do you think it's possible that Mayor Koch himself decided to enforce the law and ensure that you couldn't get your party started?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I tend to doubt it because he probably doesn't even know what's going on. So, I tend to doubt.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> And we'll be back in just a moment. [Commercial break]
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> So he disallows Hyatt from constructing a hotel in New York City or either of its end, including either airport forever?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Well, for the 40 years or so. I don't know if you call that forever, but for a long period of time.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> Hyatt cannot build another hotel in New York City?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That is essentially correct, yes.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> And that's because you put that into a deal that you struck with the Pritzkers in Chicago?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Yeah. Do you gamble?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hopefully, not too much. I mean to be perfectly honest. I speculate. We all speculate.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> Well, that's not what you hope your customers will do when they come to Vegas.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, they gamble and they win sometimes and I lose sometimes.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> But you don't gamble.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do not gamble.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> I assume you're disallowed from gambling on your own casino.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am. I'm not allowed to gamble and they're the only places I'd want to gamble at anyway because they're the best places, Phil.
<Question> <Negative> Donald, I was just wondering about what's the situation with the New Jersey Generals. Where they're at?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The court is -- we won the case and we only got $1.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> That was the USFL.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That was USFL.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> That was the USFL sued against the NFL saying you're a monopoly, and the court said you're right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Saying they're a monopoly.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> I'm sorry the NFL is a monopoly and the courts said they are a monopoly and the courts only awarded you one buck.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. The courts gave us $1 and so, we won the case, but we only got $1. That's on appeal right now and I think we're going to be hearing the decision very shortly and it is very possible. In fact, it's been up there for a long time and appeal it and it's very possible we're going to end up winning that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's very possible because I think it was an injustice. We won the case, but we didn't get the damages that we sought. And those people that followed the Generals, the Generals were a great success in New York and New Jersey. As you know, we had 45,000 people average attendance. It was a tremendous success.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And we'll see what happens.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> I assume you sided with the players during the NFL strike.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, I side with everybody, Phil.
<Question> <Negative> I happen to agree with your assessment of Mayor Koch in New York City. When do you think we'll finally have to happen to bring his downfall?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I have a feeling. Maybe it's more of a prediction. I think that the incompetence and corruption of the Koch administration will eventually lead to his resignation or his just having to be forced out because I think he's that bad. And as Phil says, I don't like mincing words because what difference does it make?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Again, I'm not running for office, so, it doesn't matter. I can stand up here, and unlike a lot of people that I watch, I can say what I think. But that's much of a prediction. I believe that the incompetence and corruption will ultimately lead to his having to get out.
<Question> <Neutral> Hold on just one minute.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Question> <Negative> You keep saying you're not running for office, but why don't you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I wouldn't want to run for Mayor of New York. I'd like to see somebody talented do that and there's a tremendous potential in New York. New York is the great city. It's one of the great places of the world, but I really have no intention of running for Mayor. Thank you.
<Question> <Positive> But you definitely are a political person whether you run for office by what everything that you say and do points in that direction.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do you know what it is? I don't like being taken advantage of, OK. And when I see a Japan ripping off this country, and I'm not saying that negative to Japan I'm saying it from my standpoint. I'm a businessman. I know how to deal and some of you folks do too. When I see a total rip off of this country by Japan, where they literally have no defense budget, where we have to borrow money from them in order to get them oil and defend the Persian Gulf, where most of the oil goes to Japan and other countries not us, we get 4% of oil.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When I see Kuwait, a total rip off. We're bringing the Bridgeton. Do you remember the Bridgeton? Their oil minister sat back and he laughed at how much money he's going to make. Why aren't we getting some of that money? Why aren't we getting it? They're taking in billions and billions of dollars and we can't even land a helicopter on Kuwaiti soil.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You tell me that's right. Saudi Arabia, they wouldn't even be there except for us. And in Saudi Arabia, we couldn't even use their minesweepers. Well, you know it. We said can we use your minesweepers? Ours are old, outdated, not worth a damn. They said, no, you can't use our minesweepers to protect the Persian Gulf.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean it's a disgrace what's going on. So, bottom line Phil, I don't like being ripped off and when I see something I let people know. Unfortunately, nobody else does very much about it.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> Are you open to the political discussion that is provoked by this question? Why are we protecting and risking the young -- brave young men in the Navy, when we're only getting 8% of our oil from that region? Why are we there in the first place and why don't -- why don't you pop off about that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I say it. I say it. I say it.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> We shouldn't have committed this armada in the first place to this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'll tell you what. It's not a question of committing. Before we committed, we should have had Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and a lot of other countries, and Japan paying us a hell of a lot of money. For us to lose and there's no money that can justify this, but for us to lose our men and to be spending billions and billions of dollars, and we're not a wealthy nation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're a country that's losing $200 billion a year. And we can't give farm aid, and we can't give welfare, and we can't give this and that, and write down the line, research on AIDS, and all of the problems, and yet, Japan is making hundreds of billions of dollars a year. Now again, I respect them. They have totally taken advantage of this country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You can respect them. You can dislike them. You can do whatever you want, but they are ripping off the United States of America. Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, they are ripping off this country, and I don't like seeing it and it shouldn't happen.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> And we'll be back. [Commercial break]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, they like to spread the word that they're not well in a mental sense and this and that. Well, that's nonsense. That's true in a certain percentage of the cases, a small percentage of the cases, but they just don't have housing. And you really need government programs to start up some housing. You need housing for low, moderate, and middle-income people.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> Did you tell the President that when you dined with him at the White House?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I tell anybody that will listen. I say it very strongly that you need those programs. And if they didn't --
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> Can you do that and have a 600-ship navy too?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You can do that. Hey, let me tell you the big problem, OK? If I might for a second. We're talking about $24 billion right now in this budget. It's peanuts compared to what we're losing, $200 billion more. Nobody really even knows. If we got the money that we're entitled to from Japan, from Kuwait, from Saudi Arabia, from all of these other countries that have taken such advantage of this great country of ours.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We would -- we wouldn't have to raise taxes. You could have all the Navy's you want and you could also have all the housing you want because that's the quinella. That's the big money, Phil.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> I'll tell you what you can't have, in my opinion, for the sake of this conversation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> You can't have Donald Trump buying 10% of Holiday Inn or Allegis or Bally, and then, the word gets out on the street. Here comes the big shark. Here comes Trump. Wham, all the stock goes up and you bail out. And everybody who went up with you is left in the lurch after it crashes. It's like a bunch of --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, who are the everybodies?
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Wait just a moment.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Who are the everybody's? Are the everybody's the arbs from Wall Street? Have you ever meet an arb? Do you think they're nice people?
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> You're talking about arbitragers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do you feel sorry for these people? Well, I don't think you feel sorry for these people.
<Phil Donahue> <Negative> This -- look I'm not pretending to be the first person to make this observation. This creates no jobs, makes no contribution toward the welfare and the future of of the country. It's like a three, four or five fat cats playing a board game with each other, using highly leveraged questionable paper and a minimum down payment.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> And you know -- how much you make on -- how much do you make on Holiday Inn? $35 million, I read.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Hey, Phil, it doesn't matter. It's too big a topic. Let me tell you something. What about the management? Do you have a stockholder and the management wants to fight? There was a deal offered last week to somebody for $55 a share. The stock market dropped. This year are down now to $30 a year. Management said for the good of the stockholders, we're not going to do it. Is it for the good of the stockholders or is it to keep their own jobs or tell me why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Why is it for the good of the stockholders that management not sell that stock for a huge price. So then, what they do is they put all sorts of anti this and anti that in there, and the stockholders get killed because the stock goes from $55 down to $25. Tell me who gets hurt, Phil? Tell me who gets hurt?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, there are both sides of that question and I'm not on either side. You know you seem to think I am, but I'm not on either side.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> So long as this game is available, I'm going to --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying you also have some very good companies that maybe shouldn't be taken over. But you have some very bad managements out there that should be and they're entrenched making huge salaries and killing the stockholders.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Yeah.
<Question> <Positive> Are you affiliated with any political party and what do you think of the Reagan administration?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm a Republican and the Reagan administration was doing a great job for the psyche of the country after we went through the catastrophe previous to that. But the last couple of years have been very bad for the Reagan administration, unfortunately.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> And Jim Wright, Jim Wright has asked you to host the Congressional Democratic committee, big hoola boola in Washington D.C. You turned him down right. Boy, I'll tell you. Did you call your father before you turned him down? Your father -- your father is, in my opinion, the personification of the entrepreneurial spirit working in partnership with the government that gave housing to all those hardworking blue-collar people in Queens and Brooklyn, and his beloved son, Donald, is building on Fifth Avenue.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> On CLOSE UP this morning, Donald Trump. The real estate tycoon says he's thinking about running for president next year, so I sat down with him as his apartment -- at his apartment on Wednesday to ask just how seriously we should take him.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Phil, you just don't have the programs anymore. You used to have a lot of government programs. I built a lot of the housing and I built it. Hey, hey maybe --
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> I'd say you're right. You're maybe -- you're absolutely right, but you turned it down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's absolutely necessary, but we can't be defending Japan and we can't be defending Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf and everybody else, and think that we're going to have low-income housing for people which is desperately needed. Other countries have to pay us for the services we're rendering or this country is going to go right down the tubes and that is a shame.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> And we'll be back in just a moment. [Commercial break]
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Yeah. This guy's something, isn't he? I made sure the whole complex was very clean and well maintained. As I said earlier, I've always had a personal thing about cleanliness, but I also believe it's a very good investment. For example, if you want to sell a car and spend $5 to wash it, polish it, and then, apply a little elbow grease, suddenly, you find you can charge an extra $400 and get it. I can always tell a loser when I see someone with a car for sale that's filthy dirty.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> It's so easy to make it look better. See what I could have been had I listened to this advice? Where are you? I saw -- whose hand did I see, someone? Yes, sir.
<Question> <Neutral> How did you leverage that $200,000 into this empire?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I was just asked that, and I must tell you, it's just been. It's a very difficult question to answer, actually. Just time and working, and a lot of luck and a lot of principle and I don't know. I just say I've had it.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> You say in this book. This arbitrage business is the easiest thing you've ever done. Is that so?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am serious. I've seen what's happened -- I've seen polls come out that say that I'd win and that would, you know, obviously before I did it I'd have to make sure I'd win. I really -- in fact, the National Enquirer, of all folks, did a poll recently and they said I'd win the election.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I don't know if that's true, I don't know if that's not true. But, you know, you have the Democrats that are too far left, you have the Republicans that are too far right, and I think I'm somewhere right down the middle. And I -- I just think it's something that we need, we need spirit in this country, and we don't have it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've just given spirit to everything I've done. Whether it's my business, whether it's whatever. And, you know, we go through good times and bad times, and I had rough times in the early '90s, and a lot of people went out of business in the real estate business, they went bankrupt and never to be heard from again -- my company is now bigger and stronger than it's ever been before.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> But in doing your business dealings along the way, you know, you have -- I don't want to use the expression, but there's a word for it, but you've aggravated a lot of people, you haven't done it without making enemies.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, but sometimes I enjoy that and sometimes I do...
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> But in politics you can't do that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think you can do that. I think we can aggravate some people, and I think that certain things have to be -- when -- when you look at our trade deficits, when you look at how Japan and France and Saudi Arabia and Germany and other com -- countries are ripping off this nation is -- is just really terrible. And I think somebody's got to get in there and fight for us a little bit.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> So when -- when people say the one thing about Donald Trump is that he's a wonderful self promoter and they're starting to get suspicious that this talk about running for the presidency is just the latest and greatest self promotion you've ever come up, you say?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, arbitrage or whatever you want to call it, buying stock is, obviously, not very easy. It's something you can do easily in terms of making money. It just seems to me, it just seems to me that if a person goes out, who's got credibility and buys 5% or 10% or 15% of a company, it seems to me that there's only one thing that's going to happen and that's the stock is going to go up. Now maybe, you can tell me differently, but it just seems that the stock is going to go up.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> But you only need what, 10% of the cost of the acquisition? Everything else is leverage.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not leverage. It's not leverage in my case. It's leverage in some cases.
<Question> <Neutral> Do you have any children and how many?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. I have three children.
<Phil Donahue> <Neutral> Two boys and a girl. Is that so?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's correct.
<Phil Donahue> <Positive> Yes, ma'am.
<Question> <Positive> You're nearing the top and your peak in your financial career. Do you have -- what do you see as a mountain peak in the future?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't. I hope I'm not nearing the top. --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I say this, I say that I'm doing a book and they're saying that's all self promotion, I'm building the biggest buildings in the city right now, as you know, and they say that's self promotion, it's building. I don't think I'm a good promoter at all, I think I'm a great builder, and I think that what happens is I do something, it works out well, and then everybody -- every time they say, oh, gee, isn't he a great promoter?
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> There's more to becoming president than -- than adding spirit to the country. Tell me what else you'd bring to the job in terms of experience. You've never been a politician.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've been on the fringes of politics all my life. I mean, I think I'm probably the largest campaign contributor in the country, or certainly one of them. I mean, every year they have a max and every year I'm at the max and I give tremendous...
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> It's one thing, though, to be behind a candidate and it's another thing to be a candidate.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, it's true, it's true, it's true. But I know the candidates and I know every one of the people literally running for office and some -- to some degree. I mean, I -- I have a big interest -- I think I'm the largest employer in the state of New Jersey and I know Bill Bradley and I understand that whole thing and I -- I just sort of know most of these folks that are running and I know most of the folks that are senators.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Do you expect people to take you seriously? I mean, you know, so much has been written about you, so much has been said about you, sometimes by you yourself. Do you think that people are going to stop and say, 'wait a minute now, Donald Trump for president, I could vote for this guy'?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think what's happened is the polls and the reason that everyone's sort of talking, and Newsweek puts it on the cover, is that polls came out recently, and a lot of polls came out and they said that I'd do very well. And one of the reasons Jesse called, Jesse Ventura called, is because they did a poll and the poll says that Trump does better than anybody else, so...
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Newsweek magazine, though, you mention that, all right, they asked people, they said, would you be very likely to vote for Donald Trump, 2 percent said yes. Would you be very likely not to vote for him, 73 percent said yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So how am I doing so far?
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Not so well in that poll.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Huh? I would say that doesn't sound too good. I haven't seen that one. I think I was on the cover and I haven't read the story. But I don't know if that's in the same issue. But I will say this, National Enquirer and about four or five other polls say that I'd win an election if I wanted to.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> But listen to what you're saying there, National Enquirer vs. Newsweek.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, but that's the people, that's six million people.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> But that's interesting, though, because Newsweek you think is something that's a little bit more politically sensitive and in tune.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I have 2 percent, how come they put me on their cover?
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> In the Reform Party, which candidate would make the most impact running for president? Do you know where you finished in this one?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have no idea.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Last. You finished behind 'I don't know' and 'I don't care.'
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I mean, Matt, I'm just sitting here doing -- listen, I'm just sitting here doing and interview and I really don't und -- I don't really know. I mean, I just know that the polls that have come out, the ones that I've seen and the ones that you've seen, have put me very high up in the poll, and that's why people are asking -- you know, it's interesting because you mention Newsweek and Newsweek came out with a poll that was asked in a certain way, I can do a poll and come out with 100 percent or nothing...
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Polls say what you want them to say.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely. And Newsweek puts me on their cover and then you open it and they have a poll that sort of doesn't look so great. So I say why do you put me on the cover if you're doing a poll like that? It doesn't make sense.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Because you sell magazines.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it sells magazines and maybe it sells votes, too, I don't know.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> You're a registered Republican, but all the talk right now is that you might join the Reform Party. What do you think of that party in the two years they've been around?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think right now it's looking not so great. I think they're having a bad moment. It's got a shot to be very important. I think it's got...
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Bad moment why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there's so much controversy, I mean Pat Buchanan coming out with 'I love Hitler,' other people making statements that are, you know, just not so great. Lowell Weicker, who does not do well in polls, you know, being perhaps a favorite son of the party.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> He said perhaps...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think Jesse is going to be fine.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> What do you think of his comments?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm not sure that they were -- you know, any time you do a Playboy interview, and I've done them also, you always get yourself into a little difficulty because you think you're catering to a certain audience and you get a little bit verbose, you get a little bit...
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Carried away.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...carried away. And all of a sudden they start releasing it as though it's mainstream New York Times stuff. And I think what he said -- I'm not sure what he said and I'm not sure he even said it, and I haven't read the interview, but I know him very well and -- and he's a believer, believe me, he is truly a believer. What he said about Tailhook and about this and that, I don't know, he says guys go out and they're flying planes at 2000 miles an hour, dropping bombs, and then they come back and they act a little bit wild and aren't we supposed to expect that? I don't know, is that so bad?
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Organized religion?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Coming back as a 38DD, he's having fun with that.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Organized religion a sham and a crutch for the weak-minded?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Organized religion is tougher. If he said it -- well, I don't know if he said it. I mean, I'm just not sure. And I disagree with him on that.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> I don't think he's apologized and said he has -- that he didn't say it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, I'm going to see him in a couple of days and -- and I'm sure that he did not mean what the press is sort of trying to make him...
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> If he did mean it -- are you a religious person?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm a religious person.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> How would you feel about the comment if Jesse Ventura looks at you and says, 'you know what, Donald, that's what I said'?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think there's a difference between believing in God and organized religion, number one. I think that God and the belief in God is more important than organized religion. But I think organized religion's important in that it keeps people in the straight and narrow. So I would disagree with Jesse on it. But he's got his views. I'm not sure that he didn't say it in a joking manner. You know, I'd have to see the way it was said.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> It's a tough joke, though.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'd have to see the way it was said, Matt, to be honest.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Do you think, though, that, at least temporarily, he has suffered some credibility damage?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think he's probably suffered a little bit. If you look at the polls, he's down a little bit on the polls. But I really think he's a very unique guy, and people want a straight-talker, and he's certainly a straight-talker, and people want that.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> You probably fit in that mold?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think I probably do. I mean, I think I -- I very much do.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Let's talk about some of the other people who are toying with the idea of running for the presidency. Warren Beatty. Is he presidential material?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I -- I don't know him. I watched his speech the other day, his speech was a little bit different than speeches that I've normally seen, you know, he didn't look very comfortable speaking, and I don't think he's comfortable -- I've seen him in interviews -- I don't think he's comfortable doing an interview, but I think he's a nice guy. I mean, I've met him once at a place called Mumba at 2:00 in the morning, and he shouldn't have been there and I shouldn't have been there, and he was great.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Anything -- you want to tell me a little more about that story?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I could really make this a much more interesting interview.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Go ahead. What were you both doing in Mumba?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Next. Yeah, next.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Bill Bradley.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Bill Bradley is somebody that I do know because of my New Jersey whole thing, and Bill Bradley was going to lose the election in New Jersey badly, and he dropped out. And, you know, he's -- he's a decent guy, but he was going to get killed in the election in New Jersey. So he dropped out and -- and then he started saying 'I'm tired of the Senate,' I'm this -- he wasn't tired of the Senate, he wasn't going to win.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> He's just broken, he said.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was not going to win. And so he used all sorts of excuses. And he did a smart thing in dropping out. Now he's the only alternative to the, you know, Clinton whatever it may be.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> He's gaining momentum, why do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he's gaining momentum because he's the only one. Now, if Gore was doing his job, he'd get one of his senator friends to run also, because you'd split up the vote -- the Bradley vote. And -- and, you know, your next question's going to be Gore, and to that I'd say very, very underrated. However, if he keeps going the way he's going, he's not going to be underrated at all, he's just -- I mean it's really terrible the job he's done as vice president.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Senator Moynihan said that he's a good guy, talking about Al Gore, but he can't be elected president.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that might be so. I will say this, if Buchanan gets the Reform Party nomination I think Gore possibly wins and possibly beats Bush. And I think the same can be said for Bradley. I think whoever becomes the Democrat -- I think if Buchanan gets it he'll take the votes away almost exclusively from the Republicans. And I've seen polls that show that Bush loses the election if Buchanan becomes the Reform Party candidate.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Now, if Buchanan becomes the Reform Party candidate, doesn't sound like you're talking to me as a guy who's thinking he's going to get that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm just saying if Buchanan gets in I think he would take votes away from the Republicans.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> If you get in...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Much more so than I would. I think I'd take more votes away actually from the Democrats, to be honest, for whatever reason, but I would take the votes away from the Democrats.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> Let's go back to Pat Buchanan. You feel pretty strongly that he may have shot himself in the foot with the comments he made about Hitler in his book.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've been on his show, I think he's a great guy, I think he's a nice guy, and, unless he was just trying to sell a book, I don't understand why he did this, because I think those statements were terrible.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> Do you think, as some critics have charged, that he is an anti-Semite? Based on what you've heard?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, there are some people, and I have some Jewish friends that have called me that are very high up in the world, and they say he's absolutely anti-Semite. I don't know that he's an anti-Semite. He certainly seems to respect and admire Adolf Hitler, which is, you know, not a very in thing to do, especially when you say I'm running -- you know, the guy comes out with a book, says all sorts of wonderful things, I mean the guy's having a love affair with this guy, and now he comes out and he says I'm going to run for president. The timing doesn't seem to be great. So he must have an ulterior motive because he's not a stupid guy.
<Matt Lauer> <Neutral> Registered...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And maybe that's the book, maybe he wants to sell books more than he wants to become president.
<Matt Lauer> <Negative> And he might look at you at this situation and say maybe the shoe's on the other foot.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah, the difference is -- the difference is I don't need to sell books.
<Matt Lauer> <Positive> And tomorrow, Donald Trump will talk about his position on specific issues, as well as George W. Bush and who he thinks would be a good running mate for him.
