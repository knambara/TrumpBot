<Jim Gray> <Negative> We're very pleased to be joined by the 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. This is an interview about the Super Bowl and issues important to sports fans. We will get to the news of the day shortly. Mr. President, how are you today?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm very good, thank you, Jim.
<Jim Gray> <Positive> Mr. President, you sit with Bob Kraft, you communicate with Bill Belichick, Tom Brady is a friend. Can we take that, from your personal relationships, that you're rooting for the Patriots today?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I guess you have to say that. They've been great friends of mine for a long period of time, and they're terrific people. And I have to tell you, the Falcons have terrific people also. But I've known them a long time, so I guess we're allowed to do that every once in a while. They are really wonderful.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's going to be a wonderful game, actually.
<Jim Gray> <Neutral> Have you communicated with Tom Brady or Bill Belichick this week? And if so, what advice have you given them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't have to give them advice. These are champions. These are winners; they know how to win. And I speak to them on occasion, but I don't have to really speak very much about winning. They know how to do it. And it's a lot of pressure on them, but probably less so because they've been there and they've done it before.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So more pressure always on the ones that haven't done it.
<Jim Gray> <Negative> Mr. President, how do you feel about the abuse that's being directed to Tom Brady because he's a friend of yours?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I haven't seen it. I mean, honestly, I've been so busy doing other things I haven't seen that. I haven't noticed it. But I can tell you that, generally speaking, that's a two-way street. There may be some people that aren't liking the fact that he may feel good about me, but there are a lot of other people that like him a lot better because of it. So that really has proven to be a two-way street.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There have been many instances of that, where people have sort of said—a little bit negative about whatever it may be, even a store or a chain, and the chain's business goes through the roof. I mean, we've had cases like that too. So it really is a two-way street, Jim.
<Jim Gray> <Negative> Mr. President, what are your thoughts on Deflategate and the way that Tom Brady was treated?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think Tom Brady is a great guy. And it's over with, and we don't have to discuss it, but it was a rough period of time, and it was very sad. I thought it was very sad. And look at the season he's had—missing four games, and look at the great season he's had. So I just think it was an unfortunate experience, and I think it was bad for probably everybody involved.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And that's all behind us, so that's a good thing. National Football League Commissioner Roger S. Goodell
<Jim Gray> <Negative> You've had some very strong negative opinions about Roger Goodell in the aftermath of his decisions on domestic violence and Deflategate. You're now President; he's obviously the commissioner of the NFL. If you were to see him and your paths were to cross, what would you say to him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd just say good luck, just do a good job with the NFL. I mean, he handled the various situations—this was prior to me running for office—and he handled the various situations in his way, and I hope he's happy with it. I think it's good if he is. But people can disagree on everything. I may not have disagreed—I may really have looked upon the way he handled it a little bit differently than others, but you know what, it's the NFL.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's going to do well. The game is going to be very interesting. We'll see what happens.
<Jim Gray> <Positive> You plan to pardon Tom Brady? [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Tom is always pardoned, you know that. Tom doesn't need a pardon. Tom—his game pardons him, and his talent. He's a great champion. So I think his game really pardons him. And frankly, I don't think he's somebody that has to be pardoned.
<Jim Gray> <Negative> With all the head injuries and concussions, a big concern now with football, would you allow your grandchildren and Barron to play if they wanted?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If they wanted, I would allow them to play, but I will say that they have to be very careful, because that would be the big risk to the NFL if it gets to a point where people are afraid to let their children play. That would not be a good thing for the NFL, certainly. But it depends on the level. I mean, I know—I played football at a certain level, and I will tell you, it's a rough game, it's a tough game.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And there's something really good about that in terms of competition and learning how to compete and win. But it's a rough game, and a lot of people are deciding the other way. But regardless, I would also leave it up to the young person in the family. I think I would have to do that.
<Jim Gray> <Negative> Mr. President, the NFL Players Association is fighting to legalize the use of medicinal marijuana for its players. These guys take a physical beating. Would you support them in this fight?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have no opinion on it. They're going to have to take a look at that. They're going to talk with the league; they're going to be talking to, obviously, government officials wherever it may be. And when it comes up to the level of the Presidency, I'll have an opinion.
<Jim Gray> <Negative> You know quite a bit, as a former casino owner, and you have a particular insight: Today an estimated $5 billion will be wagered, 4.8 billion, unregulated and untaxed illegally. What is your position and thoughts on making sports gambling legal nationwide?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, what I'd do is I'd sit down with the commissioners. I would be talking to them, and we'll see how they feel about it. Some would not want it, and probably others—and I've read where others maybe do. But I would certainly want to get their input and get the input from the various leagues, and we'll see how they feel about it. I'd also get the input from lots of law enforcement officials, because obviously, that's a big step.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we wouldn't do it lightly, I can tell you. It will be studied very carefully. But I would want to have a lot of input from a lot of different people.
<Jim Gray> <Positive> Jim Gray with President Trump. This interview was recorded just prior to kickoff. Mr. President, Los Angeles will bid for the 2024 Olympics in the fall. Do you support that bid, and would it be a good thing for Los Angeles and our country?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've been asked to support it, and I've actually spoken to the Olympic Committee in Europe. And they are—I think, were very happy when they spoke to me. They wanted to have an endorsement from me, and I gave it to them very loud and clear. I would love to see the Olympics go to Los Angeles. I think that it will be terrific.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The United States Committee's members have asked me to speak up about it, and I have. And I think I've helped them. And let's see what happens. But I'd be very happy and honored if they would choose Los Angeles, and we'd stand behind it.
<Jim Gray> <Negative> Do you feel your immigration policy and the recent Executive order might hurt the bid and cost L.A. some IOC votes?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't know, but we have to have—regardless, we have to have security in our country. We have to know who's coming into our country. We have to have people that are coming in with good intentions, Jim. If people are coming in with bad intentions, I want to be able to find out before they get here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You see what's happened in other countries, you see what's happened in our country. Take a look at so many different events, including the World Trade Center. So if people want to come into our country, they have to come in with good intentions. And we want to have strong borders. And we want to have extreme vetting, and we want to know what we're doing, frankly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And right now it's tied up in the courts. And I think it's a bad situation for the country. I think it's very, very bad. We have to know exactly who's coming into our country. And I think most people agree with me on that. And they may not express it, but you're seeing it more and more, people are agreeing with me. I want security for the United States.
<Jim Gray> <Negative> Now, Mr. President, many Russian athletes were banned from competing in the Rio Olympics last summer due to the Russian state-sponsored doping program. Should that ban continue in 2018 in Korea and 2020 in Tokyo until the Russians can prove that they're clean, and are you willing to express that to President Putin?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that's going to be really up to the various Olympic committees. They've taken a very strong stand, and that's going to be up to them, much more so than me. So we'll see what they have to say, Jim.
<Jim Gray> <Negative> Mr. President, leaving aside your desire to have a productive relationship with President Putin, your comments earlier today to Bill O'Reilly on Fox before the Super Bowl seemed to indicate an equivalency between the actions of our Government and the actions of the Russian Government. Can you kind of clarify that statement?
<Jim Gray> <Negative> The President. Well, I don't have to clarify it. The question was, do you respect him? He's the head of a major country. He's actually very popular in his country if you listen to various reports that are actually put out by polling agencies and various groups within our country, whether they like it or not.
<Jim Gray> <Negative> But they asked me whether or not I respect him. He's the leader of a major country, and you know what my answer was. And frankly, there are a lot of bad things going on in a lot of places in this world, and if we got along with Russia—I don't know that we will. I don't know the gentleman, but I've had two conversations or three conversations with him.
<Jim Gray> <Positive> He called to congratulate me on the Inauguration recently and called to congratulate me previously on the election. And it was very nice, and I appreciated the call. But I've been called by virtually every leader of the world. And we've been called by just about everybody, so I don't put a lot of credence to that.
<Jim Gray> <Positive> I will say this. If we got along with Russia and other countries—I mean, I want to get along with all countries—but if we got along with Russia, if we got along with China, if we got along with Japan—and the Prime Minister is coming next weekend. In fact, he's coming to the White House, and then he'd like to play golf, and we're going to come down to Florida, Palm Beach, and we're going to play golf.
<Jim Gray> <Positive> We're going to have a round of golf, which is a great thing. That's the one thing about golf: You get to know somebody better on a golf course than you will over lunch. So if we are able to get along with other countries, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.
<Jim Gray> <Positive> Will you have a bet? Is he a good golfer?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know. I think—I know he loves the game, and we're going to have a lot of fun. It won't matter. I'll just make sure he's my partner. [Laughter]
<Jim Gray> <Positive> Mr. President, people feel that divides are getting deeper in our country. The first couple of weeks in office, you see what's happening across the country. Today, in sports, right here on the field and in the military, we see people with different backgrounds come together for the common good. What concrete plans do you have to unite our country and bring our Nation together?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it's great that they come together. But I will say, we were a very divided country before I came along. And one of the reasons I won the election is because of the fact that we were such a divided country. And we had a tremendous group of people that—you look at issues and you look at what's going on, and there was such division in our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think a lot of people think that I'm going to be able to bring it together, and I think I will be able to do that. But we have been a very, very divided country for a very long period of time. And you know, I guess they consider me to be very much of an outsider, but it's an outsider that can bring us together.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I think I'll be able to do that.
<Jim Gray> <Positive> Is it tougher being a boxing promoter or President?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, boxing is an interesting—I've had many, many fights, as you know. I've been involved with just about everybody in that business, and I really enjoy the boxing, and I enjoy what they've done with the UFC, Dana White and all of the folks, the families that have done such a great job with that. And I enjoy sports at any kind.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I enjoy virtually every sport. And sports—nothing is easy. Sports isn't easy. And—but I have great respect for what they're doing and what they're doing with the—I think today's game is terrific, and I think it's going to be terrific.
<Jim Gray> <Neutral> You've now been in office a couple of weeks. Monday-morning-quarterback yourself, how would you assess how you've done?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I've done well. I think polls are showing that I've done well. It's been tough on a lot of people because we're breaking the glass a little bit. We're doing what has to be done. We're being strong on vetting; we're being strong on coming into the country. It's very easy if you just let it be the way it was, but the FBI has over a thousand investigations going on right now on terror and terrorism.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They've never had anything like that before. And that's been reported all over the place. And frankly, we have to have a safe country. But I think I've done very well. We have plants coming back and going into Michigan and Pennsylvania and Ohio; and the car companies are pouring back into our country. I've saved hundreds of millions of dollars in negotiation on the F–35 fighter jet and various military elements that I've gotten involved in the negotiation.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've saved hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. That will end up being many, many billions of dollars. I think I'm getting very high marks by a lot of people.
<Jim Gray> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it. It's an honor to have you join us and share your views. Enjoy the rest of Super Bowl Sunday.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much, Jim. Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you everybody. It's a big room. Thank you very much.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> OK. [Inaudible] How's Virginia Beach doing today? Yeah, great. Great. OK. We have a -- we have a busy hour upcoming here. We're -- we are going to go through a whole range of questions about our military, about our veterans, about our national security, a whole range of stuff today, so -- so this will be a really good event.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> And we do deeply, deeply appreciate everybody coming out today. This is a really important period of time for our country. Thank you. OK. I know that there's a whole bunch of groups here. One I do want to recognize are they -- are the military spouses that are here today. If you could just sound off. Yeah.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> Exactly. Thank you so much for your service, your sacrifice, and all that you do. Thank you so much. OK. So the -- the format here, just briefly. I'm going to just give a -- a -- just kind of an opening on the -- on what's going on around the world today and then r -- get right into a series of questions and we'll talk, again, about kind of the situation in the world and what is happening around the world and then how that affects our national security and certainly how that affects our military and our military readiness, etc.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> I think everybody knows that the world is -- is in one of the most complex states that it has ever been in. When we think about what's going on in China, in the South China Sea. We've got North Korea, and North Korea moving towards a -- a nuclear program. We have Russia pushing on the frontier of East Europe.
<Michael Flynn> <Negative> We have the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia is just an utter disaster actually. I -- I can't describe it any other way than it's just a complete mess. And we are facing probably one of the most complex times that our nation has ever faced. So one of the things that I want to do is I want to talk first about our veterans and I want to jump right in, before we get into some of the situation with ISIS and China and all these other things, I want to talk and ask the next President of the United States here, Donald Trump, who is just -- exactly.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> So -- so as -- as a -- as President -- as President -- as the next President, what can you do to reform the Veterans Administration and the health care for our vets? How can we take better care of our vets?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, General, thank you very much for being here. Mike, we really appreciate it, and we really appreciate all of those generals and admirals that today endorsed me. We have a --
<Michael Flynn> <Neutral> It's almost 90 --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- the fighters.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> It's unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Almost 90. And these are our fighters. These are our fighting generals and -- and they're actually a lot more to come. But I really appreciate everything from you and all of them. We have great respect for those people. These are great, great people. So if you look at the veterans situation, I have been so involved over the last year and a half, and before that, and seeing what's going on with the V.A. and it is a disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I become so friendly and helped the veterans in so many different ways, but it's such a big problem and we have no clue. Hillary Clinton said, "Everything's working just fine." She doesn't know that people are standing on line for seven days to see a doctor and dying, like they're dying on line. And we came out with a plan, a 10-point plan, and it's on the website, and you'll see it -- if you want -- most of -- I'm sure most of you have already seen it, but it's been really praised by the veterans and the veterans groups.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the fact is the V.A -- the V.A. is a -- the Veterans Administration and waiting and all of the problems, and you do have some good doctors in there, but people can't get to see the doctors because the administration, the bureaucratic workings of the Veterans Administration are a total disaster. And what I've done and what I've looked at and you know all about the rate of suicide and all of the problems and numbers that honestly are -- are not even believable when you hear 22 people a day -- 22 people a day.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These are numbers that you wouldn't even think are believable and a lot of it is because of the fact that they can't get better. They can't -- they have no service, whatsoever. And it's been really, really badly handled. One of the things that I've done is we allow, when that wait is so long and so horrible, and sometimes -- by the way, a simple procedure or a simple prescription, just a very simple thing can make a person's life wonderful health-wise, and they can't see the doctor, they can't get to see the doctor.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we have a plan where if you have a wait, you're going to leave, you're going to go across the street or down the road or a few miles away, you're going to see a doctor, a really good doctor, you're going to get taken care of, 100%, or you're going to go and you're going to go to a local hospital, whether it's public or private.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're going to get taken care of, and your government is going to pay your bill, and you're going to be all set. It's going to be very good. Very simple.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> It's a promise. That's great.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Should have been done a long time ago.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> Yeah. And along that line, specifically, because you've talked about this with female veterans and I think it's just -- this is very, very important because of the -- the size of the -- the scale, the number of females that we now have in -- in our military serving as volunteers. Talk a little bit about what you have described as how you would take care of them.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure. The -- the female veterans have been like the forgotten people. And I think it started because it was, you know, obviously, a while ago, there were far fewer and they haven't increased that capacity, and now you have tremendous numbers of female vets. And we are going to do procedures that they've never done, and -- but we are going to help the female veteran.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have not been helped. They've really been left behind, even more so than our male veterans. They've been left behind. And it's just not going to happen. We're going to straighten it out. We're going to give them also the right -- if -- if things are not being done right, they're going to have the right to go to a local doctor or physician or a local hospital.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And again, whether it's public or private, whichever one is most convenient then whichever one is better, frankly, and they're going to get themselves taken care of, whether it's male or female. And that's so important. And the other issue that's so important, Mike, is -- is health -- is mental health. Because the mental health problem is such a massive -- it's such a massive problem in the V.A. and that's something we're going to devote a tremendous amount of time to. And it's not just amount of money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, the money they are spending is -- is tremendously -- it's a -- it's a huge amount of money that they're currently spending. But there are people that are incompetent in the V.A., tremendous -- and they have people that are stealing. You've seen that. Well, if you look at Phoenix and what's going on in Phoenix where they can't even fire the people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They found people that are stealing and found people that are very dishonest, they can't even get rid of them. All of that's going to change. The V.A., you're going to be so proud of what you have. I mean, you -- we're going to take it and you're going to be so proud of what you have. Believe me.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> Yeah, and -- and just to highlight, one of the things that you have talked about is accountability of the people that are serving our veterans in the Veterans Administration and the Veterans Administration system, the whole system, and I think that -- I think for all of us, accountability is probably something, not just in the Veterans Administration, but in government as a whole.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> OK. So we're going to switch topics a little bit. We're going to talk about some of the refugee policies now that we see a bubble in underneath us here coming into this country. Some of the challenges that we face. What -- what do you think of Hillary Clinton's current refugee policies and how do they differ from your own?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, she's a disaster in so many different ways, folks. Disaster. I don't even -- I don't really even think she believes it herself. You know, she was brought so far left -- she was brought so far left by Bernie and the group and -- and I think we're going to get a lot of the Bernie people because of trade if you want to know the truth.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A lot of the Bernie people are coming with us because the one thing he was right about is the fact that our country is being ripped off like never before on these trade deals that are disastrous. NAFTA has been a disaster for the United States, it's destroyed our country. And that's one thing he got right, and a lot of people liked him because of trade more so than anything else.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But when it comes to immigration, first of all, she thinks that everything is more or less fine. She wants to allow 650% increase over and above what Obama is allowing to come in from Syria and the Middle East, 650%. And he's already allowing thousands and thousands of people in. And we don't know where they're coming from.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You people know because we're military people. We don't know where they're coming from. We're not -- you see the damage that one person can do. You just have to look anywhere. You see the damage done, whether it's Orlando or whether it's two people that just got married or they're married and they're, you know, from San Bernardino.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You see at San Bernardino, they're getting thrown a party -- a shower party or a baby party, and then a short while later, they go and they kill 14 people in the group. Look, we got problems, folks. We have to figure it out. And if we don't figure it out, we have to be careful and vigilant and strong. And she wants to allow a 550% increase.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I was -- very interesting, I was saying she wants to allow 500% more coming in from that region. And the press said I was wrong. I said, "What's the real number?" 550. So that time -- it was true. [Inaudible]
<Michael Flynn> <Neutral> You're close.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They said the number was --
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> Global.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> As long as they can prove you're wrong, they're happy. No. But 550% increase of people coming from Syria and that part of the world, and we can't do it. I want to build safe havens and we'll have other people build them, by the way. We'll have other people fund them. We'll lead the charge. But, you know, Barack Obama has -- has doubled during his fairly short period of years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's doubled our national debt. Doubled it. It's going to be close to $20 trillion when he leaves, $20 trillion. So we have to get rid of at least a good portion of that. So we're going to have other people. We're going to have the Gulf states pay for this because we're going to build safe havens. I mean, look, we all have big hearts.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We just can't allow these people into our country until we find out what's going on. We can't do it. We can't.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> Very good. And -- and I think that also -- as you have said, that they also impact our health care system, they impact all the other costs, so it's very, very important.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By the way, you have illegal immigrants -- I hate to say this in this room because you have a lot of vets in the room, but you have illegal immigrants that she wants and he wants treated better than veterans. You have -- these people are treated better than people that are in this room. You know it. They are treated better than veterans.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And let me tell you, folks, they got their priorities mixed up. That's going to change so fast. OK? It's going to change.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> Yeah. Good.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> General, we have a couple of people -- by the way, Mayor Rudy Giuliani of New York, who -- what a great Mayor. Stand up. Stand up, Rudy. Rudy. [Inaudible] They love him. Do we love what he did? He took a city that was a disaster. He took New York City and he made it great. Think of it, made it great again, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He made it great again. So Rudy, great to be -- to see you. And Eric Trump's wife, Lara, is here and she's done a fantastic job. Lara has been working very hard, in particular, in North Carolina, but helping also with Virginia. We have some people in Virginia, Mike Rubino in the group. They have done -- they have been amazing and, hopefully, get everybody registered because we have to win.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Virginia is a very important state. We have to win Virginia. Thank you.
<Michael Flynn> <Negative> OK. So speaking of disasters, the Iran nuclear deal. And Iran -- Iran has -- I mean, we're -- we're talking about putting nukes into the hands of an Ayatollah that says, "Death to America. Death to Israel." And they continue to fire ballistic missiles all the time in violation of this deal. But Iran has engaged in -- in growing hostilities.
<Michael Flynn> <Neutral> It has increasingly shown it, continues to have nuclear ambitions. And as President, what are you going to do about Iran?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> First of all, if you look at the policies of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, they have created what will be a world power, not -- you know, they're talking about a regional power. This could be a world power. They have become rich, they have become powerful. The deal is one of the worst negotiated deals of any kind that I've ever seen if you look at it, just study it. We give them $150 billion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How about the $400 million in cash that we gave them, flown in, obviously, for hostages. That was the big lie. Also, just like Obamacare was a big lie, this was a big lie. And -- 400 -- 400 -- think of it, $400 million in cash and they kept the hostages. Remember, it had nothing to do with the hostages, but the hostages weren't allowed to leave the airport until such time, and then they came.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Whoever heard of $400 million in cash? Different denominations, different countries. They were all different money from different countries. Who -- who even has the power to authorize something like this? So what we've done is created a monster, we've created in three years -- four years. If you look at -- if you take a look at Iran from four or five years ago, they were dying.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They had the sanctions, the [Inaudible]. They were being choked to death and they were absolutely dying. They weren't even going to be much of a threat. They didn't have anything going. And now, they're a power. We've made them a power overnight. We've made them a power. Number one, they're highly threatening to the state of Israel.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They are so bad for Israel. Obama has been so bad for Israel, but they are of great threat, and they're a threat to us, and they're going to have nuclear weapons. And this path, in my opinion, is going to be a quicker path to nuclear weapons. The deal is grossly incompetent. And then I don't know if you saw, the other day, we have the little boats going out and they're making all sorts of horrible gestures.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, they learned the gestures, I guess, they studied the United States and they gave those kind of gestures to our sailors and our captain on the boats and, boy, I bet those guys want to blow them out of the water. I'll bet you. I'll bet you they wanted to blow them up. And -- so you see these four little boats, circling, circling, going around, you know, taunting, taunting.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's like they've been emboldened. Here we are, we made a deal that's such a great deal for them and they now feel power. They feel power. Remember, the sailors -- the 10 sailors who were a little bit off, they were in the water. So instead of saying, "Hey, you're on our water. Please, you know, go over there." They -- they humiliated our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They humiliated those 10 people. And this -- and the owners, we got them back. Of course, you would have gotten them back very fast if I was President, that I can tell you. But the only reason -- the only reason we got them back was the payment the following day was due. A lot of the money the following day was due.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And stupid, they're not. And they wanted to get that. But just think of what's going on. Here we are, we made this deal, we just -- we made them a power, and we also happen to have given them Iraq because Iraq -- you know, I always say, Iraq and Iran, were very similar militarily, and they'd fight, fight, fight.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then they'd rest. They'd fight, fight, fight, and then Saddam Hussein would do the gas and somebody else would do something else, and then rest. We knocked out the one. And a lot of people don't realize that Iraq has some of the greatest oil reserves anywhere in the world. And so Iran is going to get whatever ISIS doesn't already have, and probably take that too, by the way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What we've done to create a major, major power through really stupid leaders. Stupidity is just shocking. It's one of the dumbest deals I've ever seen. John Kerry's a terrible negotiator. But somebody -- but don't forget, this was a deal -- this was a deal that crooked Hillary Clinton wanted. She wanted this deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This was a very important deal. And she wanted that deal. And most people don't even get it. You know, normally, you understand a deal and you'll say, "Yeah, I understand. We get this." We -- we get nothing. We get nothing. This was a deal at the highest level of incompetence. The deal with Iran was at the highest level of incompetence.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we'll -- we'll -- we'll solve that problem if I get the chance. Believe me. And if I get the chance, you'll be very happy. You'll be very happy.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> That's good. I mean, the least -- and just to remind people, Iran -- Iran -- just to remind everybody, Iran is still designated by the United States State Department as the leading state sponsor of terrorism and we've put them on a path to a nuclear weapon. So pretty amazing what we've done. St -- staying -- staying in the same region because this is something that all of us that have served in the armed forces over the last 15 years have been a part of, and that is fighting Al-Qaeda in Iraq, now fighting ISIS.
<Michael Flynn> <Negative> And -- and ISIS continues to expand their operations. They're -- they have this caliphate that they've established in Syria and in parts of Iraq, and they have launched attacks throughout the West. I think it's -- the latest count was somewhere between 22 and 25 countries that they have launched attacks in -- in the last, you know, probably 2-3 months.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> And that has resulted in somewhere between 7,000-10,000 casualties around the world. Just a stunning display of capability by ISIS. What -- what is your response to ISIS? What do you believe we should be doing?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, first of all, it wouldn't have started if we had proper leadership because what happened -- we shouldn't have been in Iraq, but we shouldn't have gotten out of Iraq the way we got out, where, literally, they announced we're going to leave by a certain date. I mean, the enemy couldn't even believe it. Actually, a lot of people thought it was a little bit of a deception because they couldn't believe anybody would say it. It turned out to be true.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we should have left a small force -- relatively small force. As much as I didn't want to be there, we should've left a small force. And really, ISIS just evolved out of all of the turmoil, all of the weakness, all of the stupidity of decisions from Hillary Clinton, from Barack Obama. And ISIS started off in a small area, now I read the other day, they're in 28 different states or nations, 28. Think of it. So they are spreading rapidly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A report came out where they were told within the government that they want to try and minimize ISIS and minimize, but the fact is, they know it's actually gotten very much out of control. And we have to do something about -- we can't allow the chopping off of heads, the drowning of people in steel cages, the -- the viciousness, the violence that we have to knock out ISIS.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have to knock them out good, that we have to get countries that are affected by ISIS. I mean, a lot of people say, as an example, Russia, you know, Hillary likes to play tough with Russia. Putin looks at her and he laughs. OK? He laughs. Putin -- Putin looks at Hillary Clinton and he smiles. Boy, would he like to see her.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That would be easy. Because just look at her decisions. Look how bad her decisions have been. Virtually, every decision she's made has been a loser. But -- but wouldn't it be nice, honestly, because Russia -- Russia doesn't like ISIS any better than we do. Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with Russia and you could knock them out together?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Wouldn't that be a good thing? As opposed to, you know, tough talk. She tries to do the tough talk and then she leaves. You know, she goes -- and I watched it yesterday on the airplane talking tough about Russia. Then she turned around and sat down, you know, which by the way, wasn't even played on the national media.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Wasn't that incredible? Wasn't even played. So we have to get along with people. We have to get along with certain nations, very importantly, because it would be awfully good to have Russia and others with us on major attacks on ISIS.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> And -- and to stay -- to stay on ISIS a little bit because this is a really -- I think this is an important topic and it's certainly at the -- it's -- it's one of the national security threats that our country faces today. You have described at times different components of a strategy: military, cyber, financial, and ideological.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> Can you just expand on those four a little bit?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's it. And, you know, cyber is becoming so big today. It's becoming something that a number of years ago -- a short number of years ago wasn't even a word. And now the cyber is so big. And, you know, you look at what they're doing with the Internet, how they're taking -- recruiting people through the Internet.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And part of it is the psychology because so many people think they're winning. And, you know, there's a whole big thing. Even today, psychology, where CNN came out with a big poll -- that big poll came out today that Trump is winning. It's good psychology, you know. It's good psychology. I know that for a fact because people that didn't call me yesterday, they're calling me today.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So that's -- that's the way life works, right? But I -- I think we're doing very well and I really thank the state of Virginia, so many different places have been so incredible, so I thank you very much. But -- but cyber has been very, very important and it's becoming more and more important as you look, and a lot of it does have to do with ideology and psychology and lots of other things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, we're in a different world today than we were in 20 years ago and 30 years ago, and one of the biggest problems or one of the reasons that we have to knock them out is because the weaponry is so powerful today. You know, in the old days, you could have said, "Well, look, they have rifles, we have rifles.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We shoot them. They have uniforms, we have uniforms." This is a whole different war. The weaponry is so powerful and we have to beat them over there. We're allowing people to come over here. We're allowing -- think of it, you're military people, we're allowing people to come over here. And, you know, I used to watch the migration and I'd see people with cell phones.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I say, "Where do they get cell phones?" And some of those people had very horrible things on their cell phones including the ISIS flag. And you say, "What are we doing? What are we doing?" But we're allowing people to come here and we don't know, do they turn on us. Are a small percentage of them bad? Because if a small percentage is bad, that's not acceptable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's not acceptable. We can't take the risk. Just a small percentage can do such damage. So we can't take the risk. So General, the bottom line is we have to get very tough and we have to get very smart or we're not going to have much of a country left, I can tell you that right now.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> Yeah. Good. So -- and staying in the -- in the same region of the world because there's so much going on and it's -- it is just unraveling i -- in front of our eyes, and this really has to do with Syria, and there's been a bunch of diff -- different discussion about what to do with Assad. Do you support regime change in Syria?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, we have a problem. It's called ISIS. ISIS is fighting Syria. Now we've built up Iran to be a big power. Iran is on the side of Assad, Syria. Russia is on the side of Assad, Syria. So we build these people up, we build -- we created this -- this strong power in Iran which seriously, folks, you know better than anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Four years ago, they were dying. They were gasping for air. And all we had to do is let them sit for a little longer. In fact, double up your sanctions, you wouldn't have had -- you could have really negotiated a deal. How Kerry never left that deal was incredible. Everybody knew it was bad. They're dancing on the streets all over Iran.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And literally, they're -- they're all celebrating, you know, shouting, "Death to America. The dumb Americans." The -- what they're saying is incredible. They're saying, "Death to Israel." This is in the middle of the negotiation. If I had a negotiation like that and say, "Let's check this negotiations. Something's not going very well." We just kept going right through.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He never left the table once. If he would've left that table and said, "I'm sorry you, guys." First of all, we should have gotten our hostages back before we started the negotiation, OK? 100%. And we should have said, very nicely, with respect, "Sorry, folks, until you do it", and then you leave the room because they're going to say, "No. We're not giving your hostages back." So that's OK. Don't worry about.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Then you get up, you leave. You get back to your plane, you double up the sanctions. They will call you before you arrive back in Washington or wherever you're going. "Turn the plane around in midair, your hostages are coming back." OK? Not 400 million in cash that we have to give. Believe me. A -- and it's -- and it's a 100% -- it's a hun -- it's not like 99%, it's a 100%. You leave.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You say very nicely. I always tell my -- you know, the story of my father who is a very good negotiator. He taught me so much. And he'd say -- are you listening to this, Ivanka? But he'd say, "Son", he thought I was too tough with things, right? He'd say, "Son, take the lumps out." Do you ever hear this story?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Take the lumps out. My father, Fred. "So just nice and easy, nice and easy. Just relax, take the lumps out." And so I was thinking, see in the old days, I would have said, "We're not giving you anything." You know, I would have made the room very angry. Now, I just say, "Sorry, we owe $20 trillion. We don't have the money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We can't do it. We can't do it. We--". It's easier. We don't. By the way, how do we pay them all those -- we keep the 150 billion, but with the hostages, you say, "We have to have it back." Look, our people want the hostages, your people don't care. Their people probably didn't even know they did because they played up the hostages, because that's a sign of, you know, the big brave Iran.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So what happens is you say, "We have to have the hostages back." They will say no. You leave the room and you double up the sanctions. Within 48 hours, you'll have your hostages back. Believe me. But they didn't do that. Kerry never walk. The only time he walked is when he entered a bicycle race. Can you believe this guy is 73 years old?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's real. He fell off his bicycle and he broke his leg and he was out of the negotiation for three or four weeks. And they probably did better in the negotiation when he wasn't there. That's the only time that he left. He should have left the negotiation and doubled up the sanctions and get what he want.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That deal is a disaster for us. It's a shorter road to nuclear weapons and it's an incompetently negotiated deal. So these are the things that we're stuck with, folks. But we will fix them.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> Great. And staying in the sort of the wider trans region, because I -- this is another important aspect because it is a place where members of ISIS now come in to Europe, they come in to the United States, and this really has to do with Libya. So since 2011, with the removal of Gaddafi, Libya has turned into a safe haven for ISIS.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> It is also one of the -- one of those shipment points for some of these refugees that are leaving, coming into Europe and into United States. What would you do in Libya to defeat ISIS? And just talk a little bit about your -- your Commander-in-Chief philosophy for how you would deal with this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's more of the same. I mean, just another place they've taken over. And this was a Hillary Clinton deal. We could have done a minor attack. You know, he was begging. He wanted to make a deal. He wanted to do whatever. And you -- this was just -- Gaddafi was so strong and wanting to, you know, because he knew what was going to happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But she was unyielding. And frankly, lib -- it's a total disaster Libya right now. You know, they have among the finest quality oils anywhere in the world. Their oil is so valuable, so good. And you know who's got a lot of that oil right now? ISIS. ISIS has it. So we knock them out. And ISIS now is all over Libya and they've taken over the oil.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Remember, I've been saying this for years, folks. Keep the oil. Shouldn't have been there. If you get out, keep the oil. And we should have kept the oil. And we didn't. We didn't keep the oil anywhere. We got out. We spent, you know, I've been saying two trillion for years. I know one thing. It's now -- I'm hearing four trillion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, you look at what we've spent, $4-5 trillion in the Middle East. And think of it, what do we have? Less than what we had 15 years ago. It's a disaster. It's a total disaster. On top of which you have the migration which is destroying Europe. Look at Merkel. I mean, what happened to her the other day in the election is incredible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I knew that was going to happen. I mean, how could -- what, she's supposed to be popular. Germany is a disaster now. France is a disaster. I have friends, they love, you know, the City of Lights, right? I said to one of my friends the other day, "So how is Paris this summer?" He always goes to -- says, "I don't go there anymore." He said, "It's not the same place." It's a totally -- that's not Paris anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're destroying our planet. We're destroying what's going on. We're destroying ourselves. And you look at the election results from Merkel, they were so bad. And people were saying, "I think she'll be okay." I don't think she'll be okay. I was saying -- two weeks I was saying, "Why would she be OK? Millions of people go into Germany.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The crime is unbelievable. The problems they're having is unbelievable." And Hillary Clinton wants to be the Merkel of the United States. OK? I don't think so. I don't think it's going to happen. I'll tell you what, I don't think it's going to happen.
<Michael Flynn> <Negative> I want to -- I want to stay on this issue because this is important. We still have an awful lot of troops deployed in this what I would describe as this perpetual state of conflict over in Iraq, in Syria, Afghanistan, and -- and elsewhere. And I think Americans -- I know Americans are just -- they're weary of this endless war.
<Michael Flynn> <Negative> So we -- right now, specifically, we have about 5,000 troops in Iraq, and in some cases, supporting the Kurds. I think through Hillary Clinton, Secretary Kerry, the Obama administration over the last eight years, they really have not developed any k -- kind of coherent strategy. What would you do as Commander-in-Chief?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all, as I predicted years ago, Iran is really controlling Iraq, and they're in there now and they have -- we have just, you know, they've wanted it for decades and decades and decades, they've wanted it, and we gave it to them. We gave it to them. Because you had two militaries that were equal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I -- I was saying before, they fight, fight, fight, they rest. They fight, fight, fight. They move 10 feet this way, 10 feet this way, they go home and rest. We've handed it to them on a silver platter. You know, when I say about the deal that we made for them or with them on, you know, on the whole, you know, the $150 billion deal, I always said that's one of the best deals I've ever seen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not really. The best deal is we have given them Iraq with among the largest and finest oil reserves in the world. We've given that to Iran. We've handed it to them. What we've done is incredible. If we would have -- if our presidents would have just stayed home and gone to the beach or even gone out and played golf every single day, played two rounds a day, OK? Which Obama almost does.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But -- I mean, I think he's played three -- look, golf is wonderful. I think he's played 300 rounds of golf or something like that, more than 300. That's more golf than many members on the PGA Tour. OK? So look, it's a very serious problem. But honestly, if they would have just done nothing, we would have been in much better shape.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Forget about much better shape, it wouldn't even be close. The Middle East now is a total catastrophe between the migration and all of the problem and all of the death. And I'm talking death on both sides, folks. I'm talking death on both. Look at the people. You know, they blow up a city and they say two people were wounded.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right. You know the real numbers. OK? The real numbers are astronomical -- astronomical. And we started this whole thing. And I'll tell you what, we are going to solve the ISIS problem, but we have to also get back and we have to solve it big league and strongly and swiftly. But we have to get back to rebuilding our country because our country is going to hell.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Our infrastructure is a disaster, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our hospitals, our schools. I mean, we'd go into Afghanistan and build a school, they'd blow it up. We'd build it again, they'd blow it up. We'd build it a third time, it's still there, barely. And yet, if we need a school in Virginia or we need a school in Brooklyn, New York or we need a school in Iowa, there's no money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. There's no money. What are we doing? What are we doing? So one of those things.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> Yeah. And I -- and I think that the -- the, you know, the real issue and you -- you have hit on this quite a bit, is how our homeland security and the things that we do here and domestically, you know, impact everything we do overseas as well, and I think vice versa. So --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The one thing, General, I have to say, the people in our military are amazing. They're amazing, the people. And we don't take care of them properly because the vets are not being taken care of. And we don't take care of them in the field either because the equipment is old and tired and, you know. A friend of mine has a son who's been in Iraq for quite a while, you know, going back and forth to different places over the Middle East.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the thing that -- I talked to him, he's a fine young man and hasn't been wounded badly, I don't think he's been really, you know, very much affected in that way. But he said the thing that is most discouraging to them over -- they are soldiers, is when he looks at the other side having better equipment than they do because, you know, we give the equipment to people that we think are on our side, and then a bullet is fired and everyone drops their weapons and runs and they come and pick up the weapons.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I always talk about the 2,300 Humvees, armor-plated. If our young people would have had those Humvees, they wouldn't be walking around without legs and arms right now. Believe me. Believe me. But they take them. They just take them. So -- and he said it's so discouraging for our soldiers when they look and they see the quality of equipment that the other side has, ISIS, but the other side has, and they see it's better than what we have, and it's our equipment that they've taken.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a very, very sad thing. And those kids, they're incredible people, but they really lose their spirit when they see this kind of thing. Believe me.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> So what would I want to do is I'm going to jump to the other side of the world now and talk a little bit about North Korea because North Korea is probably one of the most belligerent countries on the planet with Kim Il Jong. And so North Korea, they have -- they have grown increasingly belligerent under the Obama-Clinton administration and against them, and they have done just some unbelievable things over there with testing of some of what we believe is their nuclear capability.
<Michael Flynn> <Neutral> What -- what do you see just overall is your strategy for North Korea?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's not that they've done some unbelievable things, but they're in the process of doing some unbelievable things. Believe me. I mean, they're very belligerent. They have no respect for our country, none whatsoever. And we have a situation that's a potential catastrophe. We have somebody that truly does have nuclear and nuclear capability.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The -- the carrier maybe is not there yet, but it soon will be. We have -- we have a man who is -- I mean, he's took over 25 years old I guess or around then, and now it looks like he's getting more and more hostile. And what I would do very simply is say, "China, this is your baby. This is your problem.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You solve the problem." Because China can solve that problem. And remember this -- that's a big problem. China has virtually total control over North Korea. But they say they don't because they want to tweak us. Look at our President. They wouldn't even give him stairs to come out of Air Force One. OK? All right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And they probably say on that, "We couldn't get them there." You know. When I saw that yesterday, did everybody see that where he couldn't get off the plane? So he had to get off on the kind that dropped down, but that's really meant for the crew. That's -- so that when they fix the plane, they go up on those stairs.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The whole thing is just -- it's insane. You know, it's interesting with the President because I saw that yesterday with the stairs. He went to Saudi Arabia and the top people didn't greet him, right? He went to Cuba and Castro, the brother, was not there to greet him. And I said to myself, you know, if that happened, I'd land and hear he's not there to pay respect to the country, not to him, to pay respect to our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would say, "Thank you very much, folks. That's OK. Close it up, [Inaudible]. Let's go back to Washington." I would. I would. Let's go back to Washington. And the scene on the airport tarmac yesterday where this young woman is fighting with these Chinese people, and they're saying, "This is our country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This isn't your country." Wow. Wow. And just so you understand, we are very good to China. And I have great respect for China. I make a lot of money with China. China's great. So I -- I don't hold it against them. I hold it against our leaders for allowing this to happen with the trade and the -- the trade deficits.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The trade deficits are massive, $500 billion trade deficits. No, I hold it against our leaders. I respect China. I mean, our people should be doing that to them, but it doesn't work out that way. So, you know, nothing against China. I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine, I sell condos to people in China, I sold to everybody.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But -- but -- that we allow this to happen, and then we land on Air Force One. And I was saying, in the history of Air Force One, which is long and distinguished, these are the only three times where incidents like this have taken place. Think of it. Lands in Cuba, doesn't have high officials to greet him, lands in Saudi Arabia, which we protect.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If we didn't protect Saudi Arabia, they would be gone. OK. They would be gone. But lands in Saudi Arabia and they don't have the high officials to greet them, the highest officials. And I said to myself, that's probably the only time in the history of Air Force One where it goes into a country, lands, and you don't have the appropriate officials to greet, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I really believe that. And -- and that you're talking about a long history. But then, yesterday, they won't give him stairs to get off the plane.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> It's amazing. It's ama -- yeah, yeah. OK. So one more here, and I want to talk a little bit about, in this case -- in this case --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is hard to believe, you have say.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> Yeah, it is. It's unbelievable. It's unbelievable. So I want to talk a little bit about Hillary Clinton and the FBI. Last week, the FBI, on Friday before the three day weekend, they released notes from Hillary Clinton's e-mail investigation. What do you think that these new revelations say about her qualif -- qualifications to be Commander-in-Chief?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's such a long answer to that question. It could go on for days. 13 phones -- iPhones, whatever they were, and just banging the heck out of them. How about the acid wash of the e-mails that didn't mean anything? How about the 33,000 missing e-mails that were acid washed, OK, acid washed? And Rudy was telling me, nobody does it because it's such an expensive process.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK. 33,000. Now these e-mails had to do with the wedding. I give that five. The wedding, and the other thing, of course, was the yoga classes, right? Now, look -- look, folks, this is --
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> Serious.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These are very sad time, I'm telling you, for justice in this country. These are very sad time. I've never seen anything like it. Never seen anything like it. I mean, go a step further. How about, I guess, it was July 4th weekend. The interview takes place on July 4th weekend with no taping, no tape recorder, no nothing, and right on the weekend when everyone's like away or not watching.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then the information that they wanted was released on Friday before Labor Day weekend, Friday afternoon, so everyone's away. No -- no, this is a very, very sad situation that's going on here. This is a very sad situation. I've never seen it like this. We're like a third world country. We're like a third world country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Never seen anything like it. But on November 8th, we will cure this problem.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> OK. And finally, when I want -- what I want to do is I want to finish on a bit of a high note for this great audience here from Virginia, Virginia Beach military, veterans, spouses, citizens here at this local area. It's great, great group of people. Talk -- talk a little bit about building our military.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> What would you do to rebuild or the strength of our military?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. First of all, it's not like we have a choice. OK. You know, somebody said, "Well, we don't have to spend." We don't -- we're not going to have a country if we don't have -- this is one of the most dangerous times that we've ever had. Some countries are going our -- you -- you look at what's going on with the weaponry being produced or bought by some countries, and it's unbelievable, and we're not keeping up. So this isn't like, well, let's invest it someplace else or let's do this or that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> When we build weapons, we're also employing people. Remember that. So this isn't just a one way street. We're employing a lot of people. And when we have fighter jets -- I don't know if you saw the documentaries. About a month ago, there was a documentary on the fighter jets. They're so old that we can't get parts for them anymore, so they go to the plane graveyards and the museums where they have the planes in these museums, and they take parts off the planes in the museums.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then we have our young men and women flying these planes, and they were complaining. They said, "You know, when I came in, our planes were new and great, and now they're retiring. They're getting ready to leave." And some of them would like to stay. But they're getting ready to leave and they look at, you know, using old parts literally from plane graveyards and museums, this is where they get the parts.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is not the United States that we know, folks. This is not the United States that we want. This is not the United States. So -- so we're going to rebuild our military. We're going to rebuild it with -- with the finest technology in the world because we have the finest technology. We have the finest technology, but we're not paying for it anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And frankly, we're paying for too much. And sometimes, we're going to companies that are political and we're getting things that aren't as good. You know this for years. Things that aren't as good as similar equipment that's better for less money because they're politically connected, the companies. So, you know, I'm -- I've spent a tremendous amount of money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We -- we're going to announce very soon how much we've raised. We've raised a lot, but I've spent a lot. I've -- Iv'e put more than $60 million into the campaign and -- and -- and I'm going to be spending a lot more over the next two month, or think of it, we're down to 63 days. Hard to believe. Who would have thought?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This -- this started on June -- this started on June 16th last year. And now, we're down to 63 days. And I must say, with your help and with everybody's help, we're going to -- we're going to do something. We're going to make America great again. You know, it's about make America great again. So -- so I just want to thank everybody.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Really amazing people. And Rudy, I want to thank you very much, and Lara, and Ivanka for being here. And, of course, a truly great general right here. Mike, thank you. Thank you.
<Michael Flynn> <Positive> Ladies and gentlemen, the next President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Now, some people claim that no one remembers Barack Obama being born in Hawaii or in kindergarten there. Tomorrow, in part two of his special investigation, Gary talks to people who knew President Obama as an infant, as an American infant. And as we mentioned all along, Gary and producer Susan Chun asked the people that they talked to wherever they went in Hawaii and the dozens of people they talked to, they asked whether they'd also talked to Donald Trump's investigators. The answer in every case was no. In a number of interviews, Mr. Trump has talked about his investigation, but in many of the interviews, he refuses to say much about it. Watch.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have people that actually have been studying it, and they cannot believe what they're finding.
<Unidentified Female> <Negative> You have people now down there... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely.
<Unidentified Female> <Neutral> ... searching in Hawaii?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Absolutely. And they cannot believe what they're finding.
<Unidentified Female> <Negative> You say that you have sent investigators there. Have your investigators been able to unearth anything more that has given your argument credence?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will let you know that at a future date. I will let you know that at a future date. [Crosstalk]
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> You sent investigators to Hawaii and you said -- quote -- They cannot believe what they're finding. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to see what happens. [Crosstalk]
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> What have they found?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's none of your business right now. We're going to see what happens.
<George Stephanopoulos> <Negative> Have they found anything?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're going to see what happens.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> What have you come up with your investigators?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't want to say that now, but it's going to be very interesting. [End Clip]
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Well, today, I spoke with Donald Trump . He asked that we leave the conversation uncut. And we absolutely have. Because of time constraints, however, we're running it in installments, two tonight and one tomorrow. I started tonight by asking him about that investigation.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Mr. Trump, thanks for talking to us. You have said repeatedly that you have investigators in Hawaii looking into the president's birth certificate. You have said that you're looking into it very, very strongly. That's a quote. In another interview, you said that your investigators -- quote -- can't believe what they're finding. We have had a team in Hawaii talking to everyone from the state Health Department to the school where Obama's mother went to other families who were in the hospital at the same time as when he was born. None of them say they have been contacted by anyone working for you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, maybe they're not saying, and maybe they haven't contacted the same people, Anderson. There's a lot of people in Hawaii. And, frankly, it's hard to believe that he doesn't just issue his birth certificate. It would be so easy to do if in fact he has one. And a birth certificate is not a certificate of live birth, which is a much, much lower standard, as you know.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> But to the investigation, there's not that many people in Hawaii who have knowledge of this birth certificate. We have interviewed the former director of the Hawaii Department of Health, a Republican, one of two state officials who has actually seen the original birth certificate that you're talking about in the Department of Health vault. She says she hasn't been contacted by your people. Isn't that somebody they should talk to if they're there?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I've been told very recently, Anderson, that the birth certificate is missing. I've been told that's it not there and it doesn't exist. And if that's the case, that's a big problem.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Who told you that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I just heard that two days ago from somebody.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> From your investigators or...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to say who, but I have been told that the birth certificate is not there; it's missing. And I feel badly about that, because I'd love for him to produce the birth certificate, so that you can fight one on one. I mean, if you look at what he's doing as president with fuel prices and everything else, you can do a great fight one-on-one. You don't need this issue. But I have been told that the birth certificate is either missing or not there.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Can you name even one person who your investigators have talked to, just one name?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to do that. It's not appropriate right now.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> You can't say anybody who they have talked to?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it's just not appropriate, Anderson. You wouldn't want to do that either if I asked you that same question. It just right now would not be appropriate. It's too soon.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Do you actually, though, have investigators on the ground?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Anderson, I told you. And you made two statements at the beginning -- 100 percent correct. It's 100 percent correct. Of course I do. [End Clip]
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Well, up next, we go point by point with Trump over his claims about the president's birth certificate. As I said, we're not editing this interview at all. Let us know what you think.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> We're on Facebook or follow me on Twitter @AndersonCooper. I will be tweeting tonight as well. Also tonight, shocking developments in Misrata, Libya, brutal bombardment of civilians by Gadhafi forces.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Remember, on Friday, the Gadhafi government was talking about withdrawing? Well, we're going to talk to one of the few Western reporters risking her life right now in Misrata. She tells us they didn't withdraw, they got beaten back and now they're just shelling the place relentlessly. She tells us really stunning stuff of what she's seeing.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> And later, as William and Kate get ready for the big day, comments made by a palace guard online have gotten him booted from the wedding -- details on that and more live from London. Well, Donald Trump says he's gone from believing President Obama was born here to doubting it to saying Mr. Obama's original birth certificate might show that he's a Muslim, and now tonight for the first time suggesting the document might be missing or totally nonexistent.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Republican presidential polling shows a big chunk of GOP voters are either agreeing with him or like what he's brought to the race. We wanted to talk with Trump in depth, though, about his claims regarding President Obama point by point. Michael Bloomberg said over the weekend that he believes Obama was born in Hawaii and that you and other Republicans who make this an issue are making a terrible mistake by pursuing this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm a big fan of his and he was a big fan of mine on the same show. He was very nice. And he's like some people that think that they should forget this issue. And I wouldn't mind forgetting the issue. But I would like him to show that he has a birth certificate because a certificate of birth, you can get -- a certificate of live birth, you can get over a telephone. You can get it with a telephone call.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But that is the only form that the state hands out. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's not right. They issue a birth certificate.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> That's not true.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And the other amazing thing is if I go to your hospital where you were born or my hospital, I can tell you the room number. I can tell you the nurse's name. I can tell you how much my parents had to pay to bring me into this world, a bad day for the world. But I can do all of these things, Anderson. And nobody knows -- do you know his own family is fighting over which hospital he was born in. They have no records. They have nothing.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> What do you mean his family is fighting over it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> His family. His family in Hawaii was arguing over which hospital. They were disputing each other as to which hospital in Hawaii he was born in. And, you know, more importantly, his grandmother was saying that he was born right down the road. And I'm not talking about this country. I'm talking about a totally different country called Kenya, that he was born in Kenya, down the road, in the hospital. Fifty-one seconds go by. All of his handlers are in the room and all of a sudden they're all shouting and jumping up and down. And then she sort of said, I mean Hawaii, after 51 seconds. [Crosstalk]
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Wait a minute.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And he was close to getting the nomination, Anderson, so you had plenty of handlers in that room. It was like bedlam for 51 seconds.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> That story that you're talking about originated with a doctored transcript of a transatlantic phone call made by a pastor connected to a birther loyal -- the lawyer. This guy filed an edited transcript of the call...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Anderson, why did it take 51 seconds for her to change her mind?
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> I have got the tape. I will play -- let me play what you're talking about, so our viewers now. This is part of a court case that this birther guy was trying to make. It got thrown out of federal court, denied on appeal. The caller was saying Obama was born in Kenya. The grandmother actually corrects him and says, no, he's born in Hawaii.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, that's not right. She acknowledged it. And then, all of a sudden, 51 seconds later, she changed her mind.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> Well, let me just play this for our viewers.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, that doesn't -- let's talk about -- hey, Anderson...
<Caller> <Neutral> Was she present when he was born in Kenya?
<Unidentified Male> <Neutral> Were you present when he was born?
<Unidentified Male> <Neutral> Yes. She says yes, she was. She was present when Obama was born.
<Caller> <Positive> Well, whereabouts -- whereabouts was he born? I thought he was born in Kenya.
<Unidentified Male> <Neutral> No. He was born in America, not in Mombasa.
<Caller> <Neutral> Do you know where he was born? I thought he was born in Kenya. I was going to go by and see where he was born.
<Unidentified Male> <Negative> Yes. She said he was born in Hawaii. [End Clip]
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> So, I mean, it's through a translator. I mean, it's... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but the first time, it was Kenya. Then all of a sudden, it's Hawaii many, many seconds later. And the room was loaded up with his minions. So, I mean, Anderson, look, cases could be made both ways. The way you solve it is, let him produce the birth certificate, which I hear doesn't exist.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But this is a document, though, that the state of Hawaii no longer even recognizes as a legal document. They don't use the document you're talking about. They recognize the certificate of live birth, which is what was the passport office uses. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> If you go to Hawaii -- and you should, because you do a great job -- I'm a fan -- if you go to Hawaii, you get a birth certificate. That's your primary form. A certificate of live birth... [Crosstalk]
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> That's not true. We just did this. We just did this. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In many states, you can't even get a driver's license with a certificate of live birth.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But you can get a U.S. passport. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You can't get a wedding license, a marriage license.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> The federal government accepts it. And we did that, Mr. Trump. We just went to Hawaii. We got a birth -- a live -- a certificate. We asked for a birth certificate from a guy who was born the same day as Obama. We took him to the office, and we were given a certificate of live birth.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Are you talking about the twins? Are you talking about the twins?
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> No. We're talking about this other guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh. Well, the twins were born and they -- you should find out. They know room numbers. They know all sorts of other things that aren't in any file for Obama.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> You can't get...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a real problem, Anderson.
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> You can't get a driver's license in Hawaii with a long form.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, what I don't understand is why the press tries to justify it. Why don't you find out what's going on? Because he should have a birth certificate. Now, my strength is jobs. My strength is OPEC stopping ripping us off. My strength is China and the manipulation of their currency, because they're taking our jobs away from us. That's my strength. You wanted to start with this. I said it's OK. But, Anderson, he can solve the problem. You know, he spent millions of dollars on this problem with lawyers trying to stay away from it.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But wait a minute. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Millions of dollars. I'm not talking about he spends $2. He spent millions of dollars...
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Wait. That's...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> With top, top lawyers fighting this issue.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Why doesn't he just give his birth certificate? And I hear the birth certificate is either missing or doesn't exist. And don't forget, his governor, you know, who took a bullet for the party, his governor said he was there when he was born. I mean, give me a break. All right? He was there when he was born. But the governor, the same man, said he saw the birth certificate. So how could he see the birth certificate if now it's gone? Well, actually, the governor has not said he's seen the birth certificate. It's the former governor's health director who says she in fact has seen the birth certificate. We just interviewed her on camera.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Then why don't they show it, Anderson?
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Well, because they're not allowed to. Only the president...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, they are.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> No.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, they are.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Only the president can release it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're not allowed to unless they have the approval. Anderson, they are not allowed to unless they have the approval of the subject. I will give you an example. When this came up, I had to get my birth certificate. OK? So, I called the hospital. I then had the Department of Health call. And they -- it's totally private. They said, I'm sorry, sir. It's totally private. But you can give the approval to make it public. I said, I so give the approval. And within 24 hours and a $38 check, because I have to pay $38 -- it's a fee -- they made it public. And it was all over the place. He can do the same thing. I agree. It's private. And it should be, Anderson.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> But why should he be held... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But if Obama wanted to release it, he could do that.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Why should he be held, though, to a different standard as any other citizen of Hawaii?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's not held to a different standard. It says you're supposed to show your birth certificate, not a weak paper known as a certificate of live birth. Now, the only bad part is...
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> So, if someone comes to work for you, Mr. Trump, with...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The names are so similar, but the meaning is very different, because a birth certificate is a much higher standard.
<Anderson Cooper> <Positive> You say it's a higher standard. But it's released by the same people. I don't understand why you would believe another form...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Anderson, look, I know you're going to cut a lot of this out, but if you leave this whole conversation... [Crosstalk]
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> No, we're going. We're going with the whole...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... a lot of people -- and I hope you leave the whole conversation without cutting and cutting and cutting...
<Anderson Cooper> <Neutral> Of course.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... because that would be a great honor to me, because the fact is, a lot of people are troubled with this, just like I am.
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> Yes, but a lot of people believe 9/11 didn't happen, or... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The governor, previous governor, said that he saw the birth certificate. Now they're saying, oh, it wasn't a birth certificate. It was a certificate of live birth. There was supposed to be a birth certificate. I don't think it exists, Anderson. I hope it exists, but I don't think it exists. [End Clip]
<Anderson Cooper> <Negative> As I said, this conversation went on for a long time. We didn't want to edit it, so we're going to have more tomorrow. All right. Well, look, part of the problem with conspiracy theories is that believers cling to them in spite of the facts. Or when the weight of the real evidence gets too heavy, they find something else to object to, they change the topic. Donald Trump is now shifting focus from the President's birth certificate to his academic record, telling the Associated Press -- quote -- How does a bad student go to Columbia and then to Harvard? I'm thinking about it. I'm certainly looking into it. Let him show his records.
