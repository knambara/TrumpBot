<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> And I'm pleased now to welcome Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, welcome back to the Hugh Hewitt Show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, good morning.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> We're a little bit late, so I hope I get a little reprieve on the time that Hope gave me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, we're going to have to do that. I think we're going to have to do that. I did another show, and they just wouldn't let me off. As you say, I get the best ratings, or whatever you say.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> You're the best interview. You're the best interview.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They, Hugh, they would not let me off the show. I should have mentioned your name, okay?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Oh, well, I may do the same. I may have to just hold you hostage here. Okay, Donald Trump, let's get started. The obviously question, I want you to hit it out of the park again. You did last night. Did you intend to incite violence against Secretary Clinton with your comments on Monday?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, of course not, and people know that. Rudy Giuliani was there, and being a lawyer, he made a very good case, and actually, a very strong case, but absolutely not. We're talking about the power of the voter. We're talking about the tremendous power, and you understand this probably better than anybody, the power behind the 2nd Amendment, the strength behind the 2nd Amendment. And we're talking about the power of the voter. And the voter does have tremendous power. And the Democrats want to decimate the 2nd Amendment. They want to literally decimate it. And if they get in, they are going to decimate it. But they have to go through various elections, and we're going to see what happens. But the National Rifle Association, which endorsed me, you know, they're very concerned about the Supreme Court and many other things. And I think that I can tell you, they endorsed me, I think the earliest endorsement they've ever made, and they feel very strongly about it. And they've been terrific. And these are great people. These, Wayne and Chris and all of them, they're great people. These are people that love our country.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So we're talking about the power of the voter.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> All right, let me move on, then. Clinton is using against you an ad called Too Dangerous. I've seen it. If I've seen it once, I've seen it 20 times already. Are you too dangerous to be president, Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, the opposite. She is. If you look at her, and you listen to the Secret Service agent that wrote the book, she's a mess, a total mess. And she'll do an event, and then you don't hear from her. I think she goes home, she goes to sleep. You do, you follow her, just follow where she goes, and you know, she'll see, she'll do an event, she'll make a short speech off a teleprompter, and then she goes home and goes to sleep. I tell you, she is dangerous. And as far as temperament's concerned, you know, I've always been, I've always been, it's always been stated that I have the great temperament, because I have a winning temperament. I've been winning all my life. And that's what I do, is win. And that's what we have to do for our country on trade deals. We have to rebuild our military. It's totally depleted, as you know very well. We have to take care of our vets. We have so many things to do, it's incredible. And we're not a respected country. And you look at different countries, Russia hates us, they really dislike Obama so much, and other countries like China taking advantage of us, building a massive fortress in the South China Sea. You take a look at that, and you say how is that happening? And we can solve the problems. We can solve the problems easy. And then you look at the big problem where we have no growth. You look at it, I mean, look at the numbers that just came out. We have no growth. You know, Russia, if they have 7% or 8%, it's like a national catastrophe. So they devalue and they do lots of other things, and they get back on track, much to our expense, by the way.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, now my colleague, this too dangerous attack does stick. It's what they used against Barry Goldwater. My colleague, Robert O'Brien, argued over at Real Clear Politics this week that the way you blunt that is to name who's going to be your Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, and O'Brien suggested John Bolton for State and Jim Talent for Defense. Despite what some people say, that's not illegal. It's perfectly acceptable. It would help you tremendously. Will you name your SecDef and your Secretary of State?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it is not illegal. It's seldom done, surprisingly, but it is not illegal by any stretch, and surprisingly seldom done. And it's one of the things I wonder about. Why is it so little done? And I was actually given a very good answer, because once you name somebody, they attack that person viciously, whereas if you don't and you win, and then you put the same person in, nobody cares. So if you name, you know, pick a good name and there are plenty of them, we pick a good name, we put them into a position, everybody's happy, that person for the next 90 days gets attacked viciously. That's why people haven't traditionally done that. Does that make sense to you?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> But if John Bolton said yes, he would consolidate and telegraph seriousness and expansive knowledge. If Jim Talent said yes, you'd get all of his experience on the Quadrennial Commission/Review Board. I mean, those two guys would make Team Trump look massively experienced right away, and the Too Dangerous argument goes away.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that's true. I think John Bolton's a good man. I watched him yesterday, actually, and he was very good in defending me in some of my views, and very, very strong. And I've always liked John Bolton. Well, we are thinking about it, Hugh. I will say that. We are thinking about it. I mean, the negative is what I told you. But we are seriously thinking about it.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, now the NeverTrump movement says, I've been writing about how important the Supreme Court is.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Are they still around?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> (laughing) Well, I've been writing about the Supreme Court a lot, and they keep telling me we can't trust Trump on his list of 11, and I wrote hey, you don't have to trust Trump. If he departs from the list, I trust you, by the way, but if he departs, Mitch McConnell can block your nominee. First, can we trust you to live by that list? And second, if you didn't, would McConnell be justified in blocking your nominee?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, number one, I'm going to live by that list or very close to it. It is possible there'll be somebody outside of that list that has very similar principles, and I think you don't want to totally preclude that. But the answer is yes, I'm living by the list, and yes, he can do whatever he wants, because it'll be either that list or somebody that is very close to it. In fact, I'm thinking about actually naming four or five more people to the list. You know, we had it vetted from The Federalist Society, and we had, and actually got the names from the Federalist, and that's considered pretty much the gold standard. We have Jim DeMint and his group…
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> At Heritage, yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> …knows those names and respect those names. I have a lot of respect for Jim DeMint. And we have, you know, we have a great list. It's a great list of people. Yeah, I mean, if we veered from that, I would say block it, and I would be very happy with that. And I wouldn't even fight it, because I won't have to.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Now NeverTrump is still out there. Is it hurting you? Or is it hurting Republicans down the ballot at this point?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't know that it's hurting me. It's a very weak movement. It's a pathetic movement. I mean, if you just, you just mentioned it, the Supreme Court. If I don't get in, you're going to have, because they're being forced so far left by the Bernie Sanders crowd, if I don't get in, you are going to have, it could be four, it could even be five, there's a possibility, but let's say four or three Supreme Court justices named who are going to be super liberal. We're going to be Venezuela large-scale version. It's so important, that you would think that everybody should join the wagon.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Yup.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it looks like that won't happen, and that's okay. Don't forget, when I won, I didn't have the support of anybody. You know, I ran as an outsider. I happen to think I'm better off running as an outsider here, too. But you know, I'm getting along, and people don't really, you understand it, but people don't understand it. I have tremendous support within the party. I have many Senators, most of them, I have most of the Congress. I have tremendous people – Jeff Sessions and so many others. But if we have a rogue, you know, that announces we're going to not support Trump, that person gets their one day of publicity, but you know, and they don't write all the other people that are with. But with that being said, you know, I run best as an outsider. And I've said it.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> True, true.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You know, I don't…
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> I just think they're hurting down ballot races. I don't know that they're hurting you. People have their minds made up on you almost certainly. It might change because of stories like yesterday. I want to talk to you now about Gilbert Chagoury. I had never heard this name until yesterday, the Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire that got the Clinton Foundation guy, Band, to call up Huma and email Cheryl Mills. This guy's a bad guy. He was the aide to the Nigerian dictator. He had to pay $300 million dollars off to Nigeria to get off of charges. And in April of 2009, the Clinton Foundation calls up Hillary Clinton's staff and gets favors done for this guy. How come that's not front page everywhere, Donald Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, because they cover things that are, that should not be covered. And they seem to like to cover anything I say. They try and dissect the words, and CNN in particular has been incredible in their, you know, they're trying so hard to get ratings, and it's not working. But they'll take something that is a totally, a totally fine statement, and they'll make it look like oh, gee, let's analyze it. They'll analyze it 77 different ways. In the end, it's fine, and they go onto their next story. And yet a story like you just mentioned, they don't cover it. It's incredible.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> You ought to be demanding Gilbert Chagoury…
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have a double standard. We have a double standard in the press.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> You ought to be using his name every day, Gilbert Chagoury, and making people investigate it, because he's a…
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, but people don't cover it. The New York Times won't cover it, importantly, the various other newspapers won't cover it. I mean, they're very dishonest people. The New York Times is a very dishonest newspaper.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> No, Chagoury did show up in the New York Times, so I'll give them that. Let me ask you, by the way, about the media.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not saying that. I'm saying they won't cover it much.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It'll be a one-time hit, because they have an obligation, and then you won't see it again.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Let me talk to you about the media. You still have the media ban in place. I'd really love for you to get that off of the Post, because it's the American way. You've got nothing to worry about from these guys. They're going to be against you anyway. Why not let them into the rallies?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's something I don't even think about. You know…
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> You should let them in.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't even think. I should let others out.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Really, just because…
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't think about it. I mean, honestly, they are so dishonest that I say yeah, let them get in there. They can come in. By the way, they're allowed to come in. You know, last night, I had 10,000 people. You probably saw that.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yeah, I did. I played some of the rally.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The place was packed. And you know, they can come in like everybody else. I'm just, you know, it's something I'm not, I don't think about it. But the, when you look at the kind of coverage, everybody admits it's dishonest. Some people say hey, I've been in this business for 25 years. There has never been a pile-on like this. And that's okay. They're very dishonest. They've very much discredited themselves. People see what's happening. It's a pile-on, and I find it interesting. I mean, I'll talk about it.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Now…
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I talk about it. I talk about it at the rallies. But you know, it's something that is not of great importance.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> There was an old Roman ruler named Sulla, and he put on his tomb, "No friend has ever done me a favor, nor enemy an injury that I have not repaid in full." Is that Donald Trump-like?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, you know, I feel that if somebody's mistreating you, or if somebody's treating you badly, in this case, you know, constantly, I mean, just…you know, I'll have days where I say wow, did we do good, that speech was great, everything was great, you know, we're getting accolades all over the place, and then you'll see negative stories. I've seen it. I mean, I've seen it. I've seen it with the debates where I won every single debate and every single poll. I mean, I don't know if you agree with that, but every single poll, you know, they have Drudge and they have Time and they have Time Magazine, and they have, you know, like six or seven, and I was in 11 debates. And according to the polls, I won them by massive margins – 80%, 75%, and then to have somebody that I know would never give good, and they'll say, you know, they'll try and make it look like it wasn't a victory as opposed to it was. But the people get it. There's great dishonesty out there, Hugh.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> I know, but they're trying to make you appear dangerous. They're trying to make people afraid of you and an authoritarian. And the ban on the press, not only is it not in the American tradition, it plays into this, the enemies list. You know, she's got the enemies list. That's actually been published. She's the one who's vindictive. So I just don't want you playing into that. We've got to…
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Look, I understand that, but the press is 100% on her side.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Oh, I agree, well, not this show.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And she's no good. She'll be terrible.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Not this show.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There was a story in the Washington Post yesterday that was so bad for her. That was why I was so shocked to see it, because it was in the Washington Post, which you know, doesn't do that. And it talked about her four years, her first four years as a Senator of New York. The promises she made to get economic development started in upstate New York, and what a disaster it turned out to be, they lost jobs instead of, she was going to create 200,000 jobs. It was a disaster. If anybody reads that story, they can't vote for Hillary Clinton.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> All right, now let me talk to you about the debates. First of all, were you surprised by the meltdown at Fox News?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, when you say meltdown, you mean by Roger?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I was surprised. I was. Look, no matter what you say about him, he built one of the great, he was one of the great pioneers in the history of television. He built…
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Agree.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> …and incredible network in a relatively short period of time, and I was very surprised to see it, yes.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, now to debates, they're in kind of chaos there, so I'm going to leave Fox out of this for a moment. But if you negotiate hard, you can get Chuck Todd and Lester Holt. I think Jake Tapper and Wolf Blitzer were fair to you. I think Dana Bash is very fair to you. John Dickerson, Mary Katharine Ham, they did the ABC, I think all those people are fair. Yours truly, I think I was fair. Are you going to do these debates? And should you do more of them and ask for new moderators like the ones I just named?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, we don't know who the moderator is at the first debate. I mean, I have to say, and one of the things, I want to do the debates, as you know, I fully want to do the debates. I think they shouldn't have them against the NFL games, but you know, I think that's, I think it's stupid. Now we're going to outdraw the NFL. We're going to outdraw everybody, but why are they giving up 25,000, 25 million viewers? I mean, they're giving up 25 million viewers, mostly men, by the way. But they're going to give up a lot of viewers, and they'll still have this massive show. But why are they putting them, I mean, why aren't they having it on a non-NFL night?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> I agree. They're stuck in…
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Two of the three debates are against, you know, big NFL games.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Yeah, they're stuck in the past.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So you ask yourself, why would they do that, okay?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> They're stuck in the past, but I think if you got Chuck Todd and Wolf Blitzer and Jake Tapper and Lester Holt and Dana Bash and Dickerson, new people, Mary Katharine Ham, you could even ask for me. I'd be happy to do it again, even though we have some dust-ups on stage. Don't you think that you should just name the people you want and throw down on this commission and say bring in the new blood?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we can, and I think that will happen, and I think we'll agree on somebody. I don't like all of the people that you mentioned, but some of them are good.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> Who do you like?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to say that now. I'm not looking to insult anybody, but you know, I'm a person that doesn't like insulting people.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> No, but I mean who do you like, not who you don't like, but who do you like?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd rather not say. No, honestly, I'd rather not say at this moment. I've given some ideas to the commission. I'll be, you know, we'll be making a decision soon, but I do want the debates. Again, I think they should, and this isn't, you know, a real negotiation, but I think it's absolutely, it doesn't make sense to have them against the NFL. They're losing so many viewers. You're losing so many viewers, and we're going to set a record, but you'd set a bigger record if you didn't do that. It doesn't make sense.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> I've got two more questions. Last night, you said the President was the founder of ISIS. I know what you meant. You meant that he created the vacuum, he lost the peace.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I meant he's the founder of ISIS. I do. He was the most valuable player. I give him the most valuable player award. I give her, too, by the way, Hillary Clinton.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> But he's not sympathetic to them. He hates them. He's trying to kill them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't care. He was the founder. His, the way he got out of Iraq was that that was the founding of ISIS, okay?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> Well, that, you know, I have a saying, Donald Trump, the mnemonic device I use is Every Liberal Really Seems So, So Sad. E is for Egypt, L is for Libya, S is for Syria, R is for Russia reset. They screwed everything up. You don't get any argument from me. But by using the term founder, they're hitting with you on this again. Mistake?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, it's no mistake. Everyone's liking it. I think they're liking it. I give him the most valuable player award. And I give it to him, and I give it to, I gave the co-founder to Hillary. I don't know if you heard that.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> I did. I did. I played it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I gave her the co-founder.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> I know what you're arguing…
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're not, and let me ask you, do you not like that?
<Megyn Kelly> <Neutral> Seventeen candidates down and Trump is the last man standing. The presumptive Republican nominee. Let's begin.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> I don't. I think I would say they created, they lost the peace. They created the Libyan vacuum, they created the vacuum into which ISIS came, but they didn't create ISIS. That's what I would say.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I disagree.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, that's okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, with his bad policies, that's why ISIS came about.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> That's…
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If he would have done things properly, you wouldn't have had ISIS.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> That's true.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Therefore, he was the founder of ISIS.
<Megyn Kelly> <Positive> Thank you for sitting down with me.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. My honor.
<Megyn Kelly> <Neutral> It's been a long nine months.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It has been a long time, I agree.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> I want to ask you about the beginning of your campaign. There had to be a moment on stage at a campaign rally or one night after a win where it occurred to you I could actually be the president. When was that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think the debates were really a big thing, and not to bring up an unpleasant debate, but even that first debate was pretty amazing and 24 million people watching, a record on cable television, and I think that meant something. I think that first debate meant something because I felt very, very comfortable with the subject and I felt very comfortable with the people I was competing against.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> Let's talk a little bit about litigation because you have threatened to sue many people in the course of the campaign, but, of course, if you wind up president, you're not going to be able to do that either. Can you go four years without threatening to sue anybody?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What China has done to us -- maybe you -- you know, do you have methods of suing countries --
<Megyn Kelly> <Neutral> It's going to be a busy law firm.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, it's going to be busy, but it's a little different, and it's also a tactic for me. It's a business for me, and I have been successful, and I've, you know, used litigation, and sometimes I use it maybe when I shouldn't and sometimes I don't.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> And that's, I'd just use different language to communicate it, but let me close with this, because I know I'm keeping you long, and Hope's going to kill me.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But they wouldn't talk about your language, and they do talk about my language, right?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Well, good point. Good point. The stimulus – President Obama spent $831 billion dollars. I asked people what did he build? A Democrat actually told me he built the viewing stand for the dinosaur museum. $831 billion dollars. When you gave your big Trump Tower tax cut speech, I said it's a tax cut as big as the Trump Tower. What would you do with $831 billion? What could you get built, Donald Trump, with $831 billion?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, so much, so much. And by the way, it's really not enough to rebuild the infrastructure, but we need our roads, we need our highways, but we need them built, and this is so important, we need them built very rapidly. We need them built now. The roads are a disaster. You know, the trucks, these big trucking companies, they're losing their trucks because of the potholes and the problems and the roads. We need infrastructure, and it's got to be given out right. I'll give you an example. The old Post Office, which I'm building on Pennsylvania Avenue…
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Trump International…
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's ahead of schedule by a year, and it's under budget. And it's much better than ever anticipated. In other words, I went even higher end. It's going to be one of the great hotels of the world. But I'm under budget and I'm ahead of schedule. Wouldn't it be nice if we could spend money like that?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Do you think any Democrat knows how to actually, you start with the Trump Tower, you end with Trump International in D.C. In between are all these projects. Do you think any Democrat or Hillary actually knows how to build anything, you know, from the design…
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> Have you made any mistakes in this campaign? You had said publicly you thought the re-tweet about Heidi Cruz was a mistake. Let me just --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I said, I could have done without it to be exact. I could have done without it.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> You said a mistake. Are you walking that back?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. I'm not walking it back but I actually didn't say it that way. I said, I could have done without it. I mean -- [Crosstalk]
<Megyn Kelly> <Neutral> You shouldn't have done that, right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wish I didn't do it. Although, you know, I guess you could say she's fair game because she's very much involved with the campaign.
<Megyn Kelly> <Neutral> But that tweet was about her looks.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what, I have millions of followers @realDonaldTrump. I have millions of followers. I have millions of Facebook --
<Hugh Hewitt> <Negative> …from the, just doing the balancing and the grading? I don't think they understand it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, they don't know how to build, they don't know how to give out a contract, they don't know how to have no cost overruns. You know, there's a hospital, a Veterans Administration hospital in a certain place that I was in. I won't mention them, because they're great people, and I don't want to embarrass. They have a $1.2 billion dollar cost overrun on a hospital, not even that big. They have a $1.2 billion, I said you mean million, they said no, no, billion. We have a $1.2 billion dollar cost overrun, and it's way late, years late, it's totally out of control. $1.2 billion dollars. That says it all. And everything we build, it's the same thing.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> So you are definitely, let me wrap it up, then. You are definitely going to debate?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, yeah, sure, I'm going to debate, but I want to get the terms so that I'm satisfied with them. No, I want to debate. I want to debate.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> All right, so, and when you debate, you don't care who's in front of you, but you want new faces? I don't want the same old faces, Donald Trump, the same old guys. Do you want some new people?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Are you saying that? Are you saying that?
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> That's me. I want Chuck Todd and Lester Holt…
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right. Okay, well, look, okay…
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> …and Jake Tapper…
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> I'm familiar.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. You are. The thing that gets me in trouble is re-tweets. The re-tweeter is really more of a killer than the tweets. The tweets I seem to do pretty well with.
<Megyn Kelly> <Neutral> So that is one, the Heidi Cruz thing, let me just give you a list of a couple --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> -- and tell me if you have any regrets on it. The comment about John McCain, you prefer people who were not captured. The comment about Carly Fiorina's face. But do you regret any of those comments?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, I guess so, but you have to go forward. You make a mistake, you have to go forward. And, you know, you can correct a mistake, but to look back and say, "Gee whiz I wish I didn't this or that," I don't think that is good, and I don't think in a certain way I don't even think that is healthy.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> I want to talk a little bit about your family. Your older brother, Fred Jr., was an alcoholic and died at a relatively young age. When I say his name, what does that bring up for you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he was great. He was the most handsome person. He was a really smart guy, really, really smart guy. He had everything. But at a certain age he started drinking a little more, a little more, and ultimately it was a big problem, and he'd say don't ever, ever drink. And I'll tell what you, I never -- I have never had a glass of alcohol --
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> Never?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think Lester Holt is a good guy. I'm okay with having, to be honest with you, I'm okay with having new faces. I like some of the old faces, too, but I'm okay with having new faces. But I don't want to have people that are unfair. When you look at what Candy Crowley did with, you know, with Mitt Romney, that was so unfair. And she was wrong on top of everything.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> She was wrong. But Chuck Todd won't do that. Dickerson won't do that. Jake and Wolf won't do that. Dana Bash was very fair to you, didn't you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think she's had moments of great fairness.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Mary Katharine Ham, very fair to you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've never gotten along with her, no.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> With Mary Katharine?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Never gotten along.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Oh, well, we'll have to check in on that. Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, she is not a fan of mine, and I've never gotten along with her. So that…
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have other problems, okay? But --
<Megyn Kelly> <Neutral> What are they? Get specific.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want to talk to you about that. That I can't talk about. That would be too good.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> You've been divorced twice.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Megyn Kelly> <Positive> Did you learn something about relationships, about love, about yourself?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you have to put more into it. I put so much into my business that I didn't put enough into the relationship, and I see that. And I have learned that. I mean, I have learned that. Sometimes there's nothing you can do about that because that's the way you are. I mean, if somebody told you that you have to ease up, you can only work half the number of hours that you're working, I don't know if you'd be able to do that.
<Megyn Kelly> <Neutral> I'd give it a try.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But even if they'd say you'd have a better relationship with your husband, I hear it's just great, but you know, I mean, I don't know that you'd be able to do that.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Okay, I'll ask her about that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know her. I don't know her, but she says only bad things, so let's cross her name off.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I do not, I do not.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Neutral> You can put my name on…
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am not a fan. So listen, take care of yourself, I have to go. Just be good and keep up the good show and I'll do it again very soon.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Talk to you soon, Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay. Thanks a lot.
<Hugh Hewitt> <Positive> Thank you.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> Has anyone ever hurt you emotionally?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think the big thing would be maybe the death of my brother. That was, you know, the hardest thing for me to take. It was very tough because, you know, that's natural and he saw a certain potential and he would say, don't ever have a drink. Now, I don't carry that far with people. I never had a drink. But, you know, people can have a drink or they can do it socially, but, you know, that can lead --
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> You tell me if I'm wrong, I feel like you're trying to get out of bounds on the emotional question to the subject of alcoholism which we discussed. Has it happened that somebody has done something to you, you know, not a death in the family, but has done something to you to wound you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, I can say this. It would be something I could certainly think about and, you know, come back with an answer --
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> No, it's okay. I mean --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I will say this, when I'm wounded, I go after people hard, okay? And I try and unwound myself.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> Most kids between the ages of six and 16 have been bullied at some point in their lives. Were you ever bullied?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I wasn't. But I have seen bullying, and bullying doesn't have to just be as a child. I mean, I know people are bullied when they're 55 years old.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> It can happen when you're 45.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It happens, right? But you've got to get over it, fight back, do whatever you have to do.
<Megyn Kelly> <Positive> Let me ask you about that. Because most American parents try to raise their kids to not bully, to not name call, to not tease, not taunt. How can they effectively bring that message when the front-runner for the Republican nomination does all of those things?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I do it, really -- you know, I've been saying during this whole campaign, that I'm a counter-puncher. You understand that. I'm responding. Now, I then respond times, maybe, 10. I don't know. I mean, I respond pretty strongly. But in just about all cases, I've been responding to what they did to me. So it's not a one-way street.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> Let's talk about us.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay. [Commercial break]
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> Let's talk about us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Megyn Kelly> <Positive> We were always friendly.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. Good relationship.
<Megyn Kelly> <Positive> Right? And then came the August 6, 2015 debate and I asked you a tough question about women using only the words that you had used. I thought it was a fair question. Why didn't you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I thought it was unfair. First of all, I didn't think it was really a question. I thought it was more of a statement. That's the first question that I have ever been asked during a debate and I have never debated before. I mean, my whole life is a debate but I never actually debated before and I'm saying to myself, man, what a question. And then of course you have Bret doing his thing. So, I'm saying to myself, I have two hours of this? I don't really blame you because you're doing your thing, but from my standpoint I don't have to like it.
<Megyn Kelly> <Positive> Afterwards you said that you didn't feel that the moderators had been nice. But do you think it's the journalist's role to be nice to presidential candidates at a debate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Fair. I don't care if they're nice.
<Megyn Kelly> <Positive> You used the word nice.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, okay, no, I don't think so. I mean, I might have said they weren't nice but that doesn't mean they have to be nice.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> Uh-hm. You know, it's not a cocktail party.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, in a certain way what you did might have been a favor. Because I felt so good about having gotten through -- I said if I can get through this debate with those questions, you can get through anything.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> You seem to stay angry for months. Was that real or was that strategy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm a real person. I don't say, oh, gee, I'm angry tonight but tomorrow you're my best friend. See, I do have a theory -- and this could happen again with us. I mean, it could be even doing this particular interview. I have great respect for you that you were able to call me and say, let's get together and let's talk.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> To me I would not have done that. I don't say that as, you know, a positive. I think it's a negative for me, and you walk into Trump Tower. We didn't have like on a neutral site or over at Fox or something. That would be a whole different thing and I wouldn't have done it.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> I think the doormen are still recovering.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think the whole building is recovering. People are going like, this can't be possible. Right?
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> And this is the first you and I have ever discussed what happened between us over the past nine months because you and I did not talk about that in the meeting.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, we didn't discuss it. We didn't discuss it.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> So, when you look back on the past nine months from that first debate to now, any regrets?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Absolutely I have regrets. I don't think I would have discussed what the regrets are but absolutely. I could have done certain things differently. I could have maybe used different language in a couple of instances, but overall I have to be very happy with the outcome. And I think if I didn't conduct myself in the way I have done it, I don't think I would have been successful actually.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If I were soft, if I were, you know, presidential, okay, presidential. In a way it's a bad word because there's nothing wrong with being presidential, but if I would not have fought back the way I fought back, I don't think I would have been successful.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> You're no longer just Donald Trump, businessman or Donald Trump host of "Celebrity Apprentice." Now you're steps away from the presidency. Have you given any thought in this position to the power that your messaging has on the lives of the people you target and on the millions of people who take their cue from you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have. I have. And I see suffering. I mean, I see tremendous suffering and I understand. I have a very big heart. A lot of people don't understand that, but people that know me do. And we have to take care of our country, and I do feel America first. I mean, America has been fourth and fifth and ninth. I mean --
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> But you know what I'm saying. When Donald Trump targets somebody and says this person is bad, that person is bad, it creates a firestorm in those people's lives and many of these people are so-called civilians who haven't put themselves out there as public figures.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But it's in response to something they did --
<Megyn Kelly> <Positive> But you are so powerful. You are so powerful now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't view myself as that. I mean, I view myself as a person that like everybody else is fighting for survival. That's all I view myself as and I really view myself now as somewhat of a messenger. You know, this is a massive thing that's going on. These are millions and millions of people that have been disenfranchised from this country. I was in front of a group yesterday, at least 25,000 people. The place was going crazy, and I said, I'm like the messenger.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> It's true but they're listening to you, and they're taking their cue from you. So that's the question is whether now so close to the Oval Office, whether you will take that responsibility seriously and change your tone to try to be more unifying and less divisive.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do take it very seriously, and I understand what's going on, and when I see the fervor, when I see 25,000 people that have seats and not one person during an hour speech will sit down, I say sit down everybody, sit down, and they don't sit down, I mean, that's a great compliment but I do understand the power of the message. There's no question about that.
<Megyn Kelly> <Positive> I want to talk a minute about the tweeting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> Set the scene for me. Because I know where I was when I was on the receiving end on a lot of those tweets. But I've always wondered where you were. I picture a crushed velvet smoking jacket. You know -- lounge, slippers.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Maybe not as fancy as that. Maybe not as fancy as that. Maybe probably a lot less.
<Megyn Kelly> <Neutral> You said it's you if it's past 7:00 in the evening.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This weekend, I picked up 114,000 people.
<Megyn Kelly> <Neutral> Do you pick up your iPhone and actually tweet yourself?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Usually about 7:00 or 8:00 at night I'll do it myself. But during the day when I'm in the office, I have a number of people that I just call out a tweet to. It's always my right.
<Megyn Kelly> <Neutral> You call out exclamation point?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. I say exclamation point. You know me well. You know me well. No, I'll say exclamation point.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> I'm familiar.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, they'll type is out for me real fast, bring it in. I'll be in a meeting. Put an exclamation point and I'll send it out. So, I don't do the physical. Now after like 7:00 or 8:00 if I'm home, I'll do it myself, and I have fans, you probably learned, and I didn't do it for this reason but when you and I were having our little difficulty, you probably had some pretty nasty tweets sent your way. I don't want to say but I've heard that. I don't want that to happen, but my fans they really love -- we have an unbelievable bond.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> You re-tweet some of those. Not just the fans.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But not the more nasty ones. You would be amazed at the ones I don't re-tweet.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> Bimbo?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that was a re-tweet, yes. Did I say that?
<Megyn Kelly> <Neutral> Many times.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, okay. Excuse me.
<Megyn Kelly> <Neutral> What do you think with, I mean --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Not the most horrible thing. You know we're getting political. Over your life, Megyn, you've been called a lot worse, wouldn't you say? You know, you have had a life that's not been that easy, and --
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> Not about me. It's not about me. It's about the messaging.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no.
<Megyn Kelly> <Neutral> Young girls and to other women.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a certain amount of fighting back. You know, it's a modern day form of fighting back. I mean, it really is, but --
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> Are you going to stop that as president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm going to stop it about you now because I think I like our relationship right now, so I'm certainly not going to --
<Megyn Kelly> <Positive> Now you have my cellphone number. That is actually much more efficient.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You gave me your cellphone number.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> And you promised you would not use it for evil.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I promise. You will never see that. You will never see that.
<Megyn Kelly> <Negative> If you don't become president, will this all have been for nothing? Or will you have changed America?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I got a call from a great writer who said to me, congratulations. I said congratulations on what? He said what you have done has never been done before. I said what have I done? And he talked about different things. I said, well, unless I win, I can't do the changes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can't make America great again. I can't lower taxes and make our military strong and get along with other nations, frankly, that we don't get along with right now but do better with them so, you know, they're not ripping us off like they all are. But I said unless I win, I can't do that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He said, no, no you are wrong, what you have done has never been done before and it will go down in history. And I appreciate -- and I don't want to really talk about it because in case it doesn't work out, I'd rather have that narrative but I'm going to say this, if I don't go all the way and if I don't win, I will consider it to be a total and complete waste of time, energy, and money.
<Megyn Kelly> <Positive> Mr. Trump, thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Megyn Kelly> <Positive> Just fascinating.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Megyn Kelly> <Positive> I appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thanks, Megyn.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Joining us on the phone, the frontrunner, Republican race for president, Donald Trump.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Donald Trump, we're trying to figure out exactly -- there is that wonderful moment in Tootsie" where Bill Murray says he likes people that go to his plays and leaves in a couple days later and asks the question
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we had a great evening, Joe. It was an amazing evening. Amazing group of people.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And we had actually more than 2,500 people. We had a room that was filled. They had closed circuit televisions that were all over the place because they had areas of the building that the people couldn't get into the main auditorium.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was just an incredible -- it was an incredible place. And they're incredible people. And they are Trump voters. I was hearing you say before and Kacie, who is wonderful and all, but those are Trump people, those are people that are going to be voting for Trump, in my opinion. I would say - Let's say 99 percent of them, I guess you always have a few, but most of them. It was really like an evening of love. It was a love fest and we all had a great time and I left and then I found out, oh no, I have to call into your show this morning. And that was not good. And, you know --
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Did you just say -- Wait. Wait. Did you just say that was not good?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're saying such nice things this morning that I hate to break it up. I'd rather just listen.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> OK. Well I have -
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> I know you are uncomfortable saying nice things --
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> May I please proceed?
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Let's ask about politics first then we'll get to policy second round.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> OK. Go ahead.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> OK, John Heilemann?
<John Heilemann> <Positive> Mr. Trump, I'm curious, I know you talked last night a little bit about you heard some rumors, as we all have, that some of your Republican rivals might be getting ready to go negative on you and start spending money on television. How do you -- what's your take on that and what is your plan to respond? I know it's hard to respond until you know what they're saying. But I'm sure you have a general attitude towards that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, John, I've heard that they're going to spend about $10 million. The three names that I mentioned was Marco Rubio and Scott Walker and Jeb Bush.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I heard that. I don't know. And I bring it up because I want people to be prepared for it. When they see slanderous ads or ads that maybe aren't true, and in some cases maybe are true.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want people to be prepared for it. So I bring it up. Now it may or may not happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So far it's been, to me, very interesting. Lindsey Graham was at 1 percent. He attacked me viciously.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He went down to zero. I don't even know how you can get zero. How do you have zero in a poll? You know, you have thousands of people, not one person votes. The other one was Perry who really attacked me very strongly. And he went from 4 percent or 5 percent down to 2 percent. Looks like he's going to be out of the race. So you know, that's really the ultimate compliment when you get attacked and people go down. I assume they would go up, to be honest with you. But they both went down. They got tremendous air time in the attacks.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Yeah -- Jon Meachum --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it is a compliment.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Jon Meachum is with us from Nashville and has a question. Jon.
<Jon Meachum> <Positive> I'm just curious, besides books you've written, are there some important political biographies that you have engaged with in the past years that are helping you as you think about what's going on right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, John, I've always found anything having to do with Abraham Lincoln fascinating. I found, you know, many, many -- I will read anything about Lincoln. I just found that whole era fabulous and fascinating . You know, I studied it. I like it. You learn from it. But I found him to be a fascinating guy. Very complex person, as you probably know better than I. But you know, I -- I gave an answer the other day on Meet the Press" and I think it was a very good answer. I was a little bit criticized for it
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right. Michael Warren is us with. Michael.
<Michael Warren> <Neutral> We heard earlier in the show from Jeb Bush saying in his town hall down the street from yours last night that, you know, Donald Trump doesn't have a conservative record, that there are other candidates in this race like himself, like Jeb Bush, who can point to two terms as governor of Florida that actually accomplished a conservative record on policy.
<Michael Warren> <Negative> What's your response to that? How can Republican voters know that you're not just telling them what they want to hear, that you actually believe in these conservative policies that you've been espousing for the last several months?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. And it's a very fair question. And, you know, I live in Manhattan and I grew up in Queens, but I've lived in Manhattan, I left my father's business at a pretty young age. I moved into Manhattan.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everybody in Manhattan is a Democrat. Everybody. You sort of grow up in that atmosphere. And virtually you see races where Republicans don't even run.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> There's nobody on the line. If you get -- if you're a Democrat nominee, you automatically win the election, whoever gets that wins the election. So I grew up with that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And if you look at it and if you really think about it, Ronald Reagan was a Democrat. And really a Democrat with a liberal leaning or liberal bend and became a Republican and a pretty conservative Republican.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wouldn't say the most by any stretch. But a pretty conservative Republican. And that's where I am.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And when I started really getting involved politically was actually, you know, people don't realize it - I think Joe and Mika realize it -- but I've been involved in politics for a long time. Usually on the other side.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I actually got to know Ronald Reagan. I think he liked me. I liked him. But when you get down to it, I am a conservative person. I am, by nature, a somewhat conservative person. I never looked at putting a label on myself. Because frankly, putting a label on myself, it didn't matter. I wasn't in politics. It didn't matter whether I was a Republican or whether I was -- it was something that absolutely had no bearing on me. But if you look at my general attitudes in life, I think I would have certainly the more conservative label put on me.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right. Donald, I want to ask you about the American dream, your slogan is make America great again." I'm curious on the issue of wages
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So Mika, it's such a nasty question because the answer has to be nasty. We're in a global economy now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It used to be people would leave New York state and companies would leave New York state or leave another state and go to Florida, go to Texas, go to wherever they go because the wages, you know, all sorts of different things. Now it's not leaving New York or New Jersey or wherever they're leaving.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now they're leaving the United States and they're going to other countries because they're competing for low taxes and they're competing for low wages. And they're competing for all sorts of things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And one of the things that's happening is China with what they're doing with their currency with the devaluations. They're making it very, very difficult for companies to compete.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So what's happening now is people are shopping. Companies are shopping. I see companies where they have international finance years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People that live in London, they don't even -- they're not even citizens of the United States. They're shopping their companies to different places.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we can't have a situation where our labor is so much more expensive than other countries that we can no longer compete. One of the things I'll do if I win, I'll make us competitive as a country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But we are no longer competing against one state against the other. We're competing -- It's the United States against other places. Joe, where the taxes are lower, where the wages are lower, where lots of things are lower. Now -- I want to create jobs so that you don't have to worry about the minimum wage. They're do a great job that they're making much more than the minimum wage. But I think having a low minimum wage is not a bad thing for this country, Mika.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Okay. That's an answer. And then also on foreign policy, just overall, how you would describe the Trump doctrine? What does that look like?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, in terms of foreign policy, we don't get along with anybody, just so you understand. I mean, they've had a terrible number of years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We don't get along with anybody. And yet, everybody takes advantage of us. Whether it is trade PACs or anything, you look at the trade PACs we have, they're so horrible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's why I said I'm bringing Carl Icahn in. I'm bringing friends of mine in who are among the best -- that actually are the best in the world. We're going to straighten it out. But in terms of military, we're going to make our military so big, so strong, so powerful. We're never going to have to use it. Nobody is going to mess with us, Mika, and we're doing just the opposite right now. We're not a respected country. We're laughed at, we're scoffed at and everybody that deals with us takes advantage of us.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Let me ask you a question, Donald. It's strange, you actually have liberals and libertarians coming together over criminal justice reform. A lot of people on the right and left think it doesn't make sense that we have so many nonviolent offenders in prison and we spend $80 billion a year just incarcerating Americans. We spend four time the amount keeping people in jail than we do on educating Americans. Have you been following the talk about criminal justice reform?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Do you think we need to stop putting so many nonviolent offenders in jail and paying $80 billion a year?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have to say this, in terms of our cities and in terms of the violent offenses, we have to get a lot tougher. Because if you look at what's going on with Baltimore and with places like Chicago where we have great people - You know, I know the chief of police said these are fantastic people, they have to be able to do their job and if they do their job, if they're allowed to do their job the way they know how to do it, they'll stop the onslaught of crime that we have in this country --
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Right. So that's for violent offenders. What about nonviolent crimes? What about marijuana? Should a kid be thrown in jail because he gets busted for marijuana?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't really think so and I think that maybe the dealers have to be looked at very strongly. But then you have states all of a sudden legalizing it. So it's sort of hard to say that you're on one side of the border and you go to jail and you're on the other side and you can go into a store and buy it. So there is going to be changes made there, Joe. There has to be. But you just can't. So when you mention the marijuana, that is a very tough subject nowadays, especially since it's been legalized and it will continue to be legalized.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Legalized in some states, yeah.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Back to the economy. I'm just curious, I asked you this question last time. What is your position --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Don't do it, Mika. Don't do it. It's too early in the morning to ask that question. I know exactly what you're going to ask and it's very early in the morning. I'd rather talk about Mobile, Alabama, what's happening there. [Laughter] I was saying - You know, Joe, I said I know Mika is going to ask me her favorite question.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Yes, I am.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I looked at my watch and I said, you know, it's 7:00 in the morning, I got back late last night, and I said I hope instead she'll ask me what happened in Mobile where hopefully your brother will be there, Joe.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> My brother will be there. Listen, Donald, you know Mika and I know Mika, she has got to ask the question and then you do with it whatever you want and then we'll talk about Mobile, Alabama.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right. Go ahead, Mika. Let me have it.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> What is your position on equal pay for women and how you would address the ongoing problem of women getting access to capital?
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Glad you asked that question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Women should have absolute access to capital, Mika. When it comes to categorizing people, men and women into a group, it gets to be very dangerous. When you have to categorize men and women into a particular group and a particular pay scale, it gets very - because people do different jobs. If they do the same job, they should get the same pay. But it's very hard to say what is the same job. It's a very, very tricky question. And I talked about competition with other places and other parts of the world, Mika. This is one of the things that we have to look at very strongly.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> But you did just say, though, and I think this is what, Mika, you are getting at, equal pay for equal jobs. Because it is tricky.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Who would you pay more here, Donald? Just curious.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> With you or Joe, I would absolutely pay you more.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Oh, my god.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would pay you much more. Joe, I would pay Mika so much more your head would spin. Mika, I heard you talking about Mobile.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So what happened, Mobile, Alabama, is amazing. We took a barroom, we had 500 people, we thought, and they called and said we're being swamped. Then we took a room for 1500 people. And they call and they said we're swamped. Then they took the convention center and now I understand they're going to have, like, 30 or 40 or something thousand people. They ended up taking the football stadium. So it's going to be an amazing Friday and if your brother is around there, Joe, I have to meet him because you've been saying such great things about your brother. He must be a brilliant guy.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Well -- George is bringing three of his friends and he wants to -- He is definitely going to be there.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> He wants to bring more.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> He wants to bring more. I told him eight was a little too much. Let's go to Jon Meachum in Nashville. Jon.
<Jon Meachum> <Neutral> Now that you've been going around for awhile, what surprised you the most about being a candidate as opposed to being a -- someone who is flirting with the idea?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've had a lot of pleasant surprises, Jon. I've met great people. I've met tremendous enthusiasm. You know, people really want to see it. My theme is make America great again." I've even copyrighted it. Can you believe it? Nobody else can use it. At the beginning
<Jon Meachum> <Neutral> That's a lot of billable hours.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what? I've gained a lot of respect for some members of the press. I've seen a lot of, you know, I've seen a lot of dishonesty with the press. But I've also met some amazing people in the press that really are great political reporters and I'm a little bit surprised at that aspect of it. I'm not surprised that I've met some - I've met some people that write really falsely, you know, where something will be written that just didn't take place and I'm sort of amazed. Even at an event. But I've met some amazing people in the press, in the political press, that I'm very impressed with.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> So, you know, It's interesting -- As you know, Donald, we talk about everything on this show and we don't hide the fact that we've known you for a very long time. I've even told people on this show that I've called you up and I advised you early on - stop picking fights with people, stop picking fights with people, and you ignore all my advice and then you go up 30 points in the polls. But one thing that I have learned, John Heilemann, is very interesting, that Donald is like - well, actually - We're going to attach Donald to somebody else now.
<John Heilemann> <Negative> OK. Here we go.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Bill Clinton told me not so long ago, if you're going to be a good governor or good president, you have to have a short memory. Donald, if he's punched, punches back. But what I found out over the past month is very short memory. He's always looking for friends. And that's the one thing that always shocks me in politics, people that aren't looking for friends -- People that can forget what happened before and say, let's get together later. That's what Bill Clinton was a master of.
<John Heilemann> <Neutral> And still is.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, Joe, you have a great example in your studio. John Heilemann, I couldn't stand this guy, right? I could not stand him. What happened is through his cohort mark, I met John and I liked him a lot. And they did an interview. And I actually really like him a lot.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> Well, you might want to rethink that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it means I have a short memory. Hey John, who would have thought I would have liked you, right?
<John Heilemann> <Negative> It's inconceivable.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, you know, I mean, I do like him and I respect him. You know, you do have to have a short memory because a lot of times you'll -- I mean, you meet so many people. You just have to be able to forget it. And I think I'm able to do that generally. Sometimes I'm not. I will say. But generally speaking, I think I'm able to do that.
<John Heilemann> <Positive> I'll share the moment of bonding that occurred when Mr. Trump walked into the room and said, hey, Heilemann, we should like each other, we're both German. [Laughter]
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> OK. Donald - back -- Let's get serious.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> So John has a quick question.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right. Go ahead.
<John Heilemann> <Positive> I'm going to go back to policy for Mr. Trump. How big a problem is the budget deficit and if it's a big problem, Mr. Trump, what would you propose to do about it? And I specifically am curious what you think about entitlement reform and how important that is.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. It's important, but we have other things important. You know, we spend more money by many, many times on the military than anybody else. I've been analyzing this for the last month.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The money we spend is like protecting other places, like we protect Saudi Arabia. We protect South Korea.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We protect Germany. We protect so many other places. I'm saying what are we getting out of this? What do we get out of this? These are competitors of ours and they're economic competitors, you know, they're above ours. What are we getting? There are so many places where we can cut because we have these massive deficits.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have -- Now it's really 19 trillion. I've been saying 18 trillion. Now it's really $19 trillion that we owe.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We owe China -- Think of this, $1.4 trillion. We owe Japan $1.4 trillion. All of the stuff they sell us and we owe them money.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I say that's like a magic act. How do we owe them money? They take everything from us and on top of it, we owe them all of this money. So there are so many places, John, that we can cut that people aren't even talking about right now, that other candidates don't even know about.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm very proud of the immigration situation. By bringing it up -- and you know I took a lot of heat that first couple of weeks. Boy did I take -- your friend Rush Limbaugh, he said Trump has endured more incoming -- first time I heard that term talking about the press -- he's endured more incoming than any human being I've ever seen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And then it turned out I was right. And now immigration and illegal immigration is the big topic. I'm very honored about that because it should be. You had the horror shows going on in San Francisco with Kate and with so many others and people are seeing what's been happening. And now immigration is such a big thing. Now we're taking it to the next level with my policy. But John, there are so many place that can be cut that we can get this budget balanced and we can have a stronger country, a much stronger country.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So Donald, we have news breaking across the wire. We're going to get you to respond to this. A new Quinnipiac poll has just come across the wire.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Get this - and this is about Hillary and the problems that Hillary's been going through. Vice President Joe Biden is running as well or better than Hillary Clinton in general election matchups against top Republicans in Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> The three of the most important states. And his favorability numbers in general election voters in every state are a lot better than Hillary Clinton's. Let's -- Clinton is still crushing both Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden among Democrats -- but when you talk about who can win the general election, watch this.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> While you and Jeb were feuding in New Hampshire, you actually took the lead according to the Quinnipiac of Bush's home state of Florida. You lead that state's primary 21 percent to 17 percent over Bush.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Marco Rubio is tied with Ben Carson all the way down at 11 percent. So you're beating Jeb Bush in his home state of Florida, easily beating Marco Rubio in the home state of Florida. But the shocking news here is that now Joe Biden is doing much better in general election matchups than Hillary Clinton. Are we starting to see -- Do you believe we're beginning to see the decline of Hillary Clinton as a Democratic nominee - presumptive Democratic nominee?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that could be maybe the beginning of getting Joe Biden into the race. You would think he'd want to get into the race.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's always wanted to do it. He's run, I guess, two or three times and he's always wanted to do it. So this could be it. But I will say this, you know, Hillary, what she did, if you look at General Petraeus, what she did is far greater as a crime and it is a crime. The question is whether or not Democrat prosecutors will prosecute her. And everybody is watching to see whether or not they're honorable. Because frankly, if that were a Republican that did what she did, they would have already been in jail.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Look at Bob McDonald in Virginia. Didn't violate a state law. The Justice Department decides to go after him and puts him in jail for five, six, seven, eight years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very sad.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Because he got a Rolex watch and had a diet supplement event at the Governor's Mansion. He's in jail for six, seven, eight years. Comparing that with what's going on here with America's national security, I've got to agree with you. If this were a Republican, somebody would already be indicted.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This would have happened a long time ago, the indictment. And I think a lot of people are watching. And they know this is very serious, what she did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's at a much higher level. Had there not been a Petraeus and, you know, the catastrophic events that happened around him, it would be a different story. But Petraeus on documents that were not nearly as important and on far fewer documents, you know, his life has been destroyed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> His life has been absolutely destroyed. Now she has done something at a much higher with much more important documents and it's like nothing seems to be happening. So the world is watching.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you'll see now, what's interesting is that if a Republican wins -- hopefully it's going to be me - but if a Republican wins, you know, you have the statue of limitation that's at least five, but probably six years. Well, you know, Hillary might really have to win this election because if a Republican wins, I would imagine that their attorney general and their people are going to be their various prosecutors will be looking the this because it goes for years after the election, four years after the election.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So Hillary might be fighting for her life in more ways than one. Look, what she did is probably criminal. I think almost -- you could say almost certainly criminal. And it looks to me like she's not going to be prosecuted. And that's only because the prosecutors are Democrats.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Okay. We'll leave it there. Donald Trump, thank you very much. We'll be watching you in Mobile, Alabama. We'll see you again soon. Thank you.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> My brother will be seeing you there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. I look forward it to, Joe.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Thank you, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Mika.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Hi, everybody. I'm Geraldo Rivera and this, of course, is not our usual studio. This is the elegant, the extraordinary penthouse apartment on Fifth Avenue of Donald Trump. Mr. Trump is our only guest for the hour. How you doing?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hi, Geraldo.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Hi. Got that out of the way right away.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We did indeed. Good job.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> But isn't that something -- something crazy like that would so haunt you, shaking hands.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't want -- I don't mind shaking your hand, but the concept of shaking hands is not something I love, as you know. Do you mind?
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> I -- I don't really. You know, when you march in the Puerto Rican Day parade you swap bodily fluids with 300,000 of your closest friends, you can't mind too much. But, I understand, theoretically, you know, how germs can be transmitted. But you get stuck in something like that, and people think about that rather than your huge success in business or your political ideas.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's an amazing thing. The other night I was having dinner at a beautiful restaurant, and I see a guy coming out of a men's room. He just walks out. And he said, 'Mr. Trump, I'm a huge fan of yours.' And he puts out his hand. And, literally, I'm eating a roll, and the good news, I shook his hand and I didn't eat the roll. So I was very happy about that. Maybe we should do that more often. I have heard stories though. Clinton was shaking hands with 500 or 600 people, he then got into the back of the presidential limo, grabs a sandwich and he eat its, and no problem. I wish I could be like that. I just can't.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> But you don't eat at McDonald's though, I mean, do you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love McDonald's. Yeah.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> You do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, yeah, I can imagine what goes on there, but, I love McDonald's.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Nice digs.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Now you're going to give all this up for the White House. It's a step down. You're the only person I can think of where it would be a -- you know, a step down.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's something that we're looking at very seriously, as you know. And, you know, the polls have been amazing. I mean, it's just been amazing. Jesse came out and Jesse sort of started it. He's known me and he said, 'You know, you should do this.' And other people have said, 'Do it.' And then they do polls and then they do television ratings, and I guess I'm here for a certain reason, but they do television ratings, and they do all this, and somehow the numbers are amazing and let's see what happens. We're looking at it very seriously.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Donald Trump, of course, needs no introduction to the vast majority of Americans. We'll do it anyway. He is a billionaire real estate tycoon, a high roller, who controls a vast empire of skyscrapers, hotels and casinos. After plunging maybe $ 9 billion into debt at the beginning of the decade, he pulled himself out of a hole. He did it so spectacularly, that he turned that experience into one of his best-selling books, The Art of the Comeback. Now we watched as The Donald
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, it's a book that's much different from my other three. My other three were all best sellers and did great and I was very happy with it. But this is one -- a little bit of my views on the country and where we're going, and I think pretty detailed and we'll see how it does. It's very much different. It's not how to get rich, but it's how to keep the country rich and how to keep the country good. And I think it's something that's going to sell well without this.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> But this is, you admit, a great way to publicize, in a way that is priceless, not just the book, but the Trump brand. And that's one of the -- one of the suspicions, I guess, that the skeptics have, Donald, about your running.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It has actually been good for business, believe it or not. And the book will do well, and I think the book will do well with that. But the book doesn't mean -- from an economic standpoint, it means very little of anything to me. If it does great, it doesn't mean a lot of money. But this is just something I've really been thinking about. I've been looking at it. I've been looking at the realism of it from the standpoint that I do so well in the polls, and I'm going to give it a serious, really, consideration.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> I want to get to the news. We'll do the hour, I guess, in kind of segments. I want to talk about politics. I want to talk about your own, you know, ambition in life. What ambition does a billionaire have left. And talk a little bit about your -- your private, or social life. Let's start with the politics and then let's get the news out of the way. When will you formally announce a candidacy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we'll be thinking about it very, very strongly come January, February and March, the beginning of the year. We'll be announcing probably tomorrow that in California we're looking into the reform -- we're going to be filing for the Reform Party candidacy, and probably also in Ohio. There are certain specific dates.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we'll be doing that filing perhaps tomorrow. And I guess that's your little news break today if you call it a news break. But we are -- we're seriously going forward and seeing where it all stands.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We don't know who else is running. I guess Pat Buchanan's running because they threw him out of the Republican Party. So he has really no choice. I mean, he either does this or perhaps goes back to Crossfire.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> So you're saying November 1st, the California filing, which is the real first formal Reform Party requirement, you'll be doing that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's correct.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> So in California to file you just need a certain number of petitions?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That is correct -- signatures. And also, Ohio, and they need a specific date. So in order to stay in, we're doing that, and I think that's showing people also that I'm serious and I am very serious.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> Ohio in November 7th.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That is correct.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> So you're in both?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Correct.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> So are you in for the long haul?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're going to have to see. I'm going to have to look at a lot of things. At this moment, it certainly looks like it's promising. As you saw in the polls, I beat Pat Buchanan against Bush and Gore substantially, and I guess CNN did a poll, and Gallup did a poll saying that I would come out far ahead of Pat Buchanan and -- and everybody else within the Reform Party, so I was happy with that, and we'll just have to see what happens, Geraldo.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> The same polls you cite which did indeed show you slightly stronger than Pat Buchanan running against Al Gore and George W. Bush also show that 58 percent of the American people disapprove of you personally. Opinion of Donald Trump Favorable: 33% Unfavorable: 58% Source: CNN/USA Today/Gallup
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's possible. I mean, in -- you never really know. But if you look at some very popular politicians, they have -- I haven't run yet. I haven't done anything. I haven't spent 10 cents essentially on this campaign. I've done a couple of interviews. I'm done -- I'm now doing your show. I've done a few interviews; and I think we'll see what happens when I decide to run, if I decide to run. It's going to be very interesting.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> What do you think of Pat Buchanan, your likely opponent?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I -- I think that -- first of all, I always sort of liked him. I've done his show. His show was always interesting to me. He's been an interesting guy. I've always thought he was a nice guy. I think his book is amazing that he could write this book, and I watched him on the various shows and 90 percent of the shows he's defending the book. I don't get why he did it. But he's obviously got a love affair going with Adolf Hitler, and I just can't imagine that being very popular at this time and date and place.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Well, let me read the quote actually from Buchanan's book. He says, Had Britain and France not given war guarantees to Poland
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That's on the assumption that you think that Hitler would have really stopped, and Hitler was a mad man. Hitler wouldn't have stopped. Hitler would have gone through Europe, he would have gone through Russia. He would have come and gotten us just like he would have done one at a time. And, frankly, his biggest problem was he wanted the whole world at one time. And I watched his rationale, and he said, 'Hitler wouldn't have come after us' and 'He wouldn't have come after this and that.' And he was assuming that Hitler's like a sane man. Hitler was a mad man. I -- I just couldn't believe it. And I couldn't believe he'd write the book at that time.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Do you think he's an anti-Semite?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so based on what I've heard, and based on the fact that a lot of Jewish friends of mine -- and, in fact, certain columnists came up to me and said he's written things over the years that are unbelievable. So I think so, probably, but you'd have to ask him that question.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> That's Pat Buchanan. Let's go through the other Reform Party personalities. Ross Perot, do you think he's a nut job?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, he's done a great job in that he did create a party and I think that's going to be the legacy, not his wealth or anything else. I mean, he created a party. It'll be very interesting to see whether or not he runs. I don't think he's going to run, but it will be certainly interesting. But his legacy is he's done a great job in creating a third party, an alternative.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> Unlike Buchanan who is going to have a very tough time in the first stage of an independent candidacy just because it's going to take millions of dollars, Ross Perot could almost match you dollar for dollar, could he not?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He could. He could spend a lot of money and he would spend a lot of money. The problem is that his -- his numbers have gone down so drastically from election to election.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it'll be just -- to me, I'm really waiting to see what he's going to do. I mean, I watched Governor Lamm, who I don't know at all, and he was really -- I mean, I felt sorry for the lamb, because the lamb was led to slaughter. What happened there was that he thought he was going to have the support of Ross Perot, and he went in and he was all psyched and then all of a sudden Ross Perot decided to run.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It could be that Ross Perot decides again to run, and certainly it'll be interesting. But, you know, if -- if you're going to win the election -- I would only do this if you could win. If I thought I couldn't win -- if I was going to get 21 percent or 24 percent or 25 percent of the vote in the three-way race and not win, I wouldn't do it, Geraldo. It wouldn't be worth it. I'll be back -- I'll take one day, I'll say what a great job I did, and then I'll be back at my office at Trump Tower. I'm not into that. If I could win -- and that's what really more than anything else I'm studying -- if I could win, I'd do it. Not just to get the Reform Party.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Is Jesse Ventura's success in Minnesota a role model for you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it is. I had dinner with him the other night. He's a great guy. You know, he's a very commonsense, basic, very smart guy. And we had a lot of fun the other night. And I think it is. He is very popular out there. He took a little hit because of a Playboy interview that maybe wasn't very accurate. We all take hits with those Playboy interviews. I don't know what happens.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> No, no.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we loosen up or something, but I'm not so sure that Jesse really said, if you read it carefully, really said what they say he said. But he's a spectacular guy, and, you know, he's just somebody that likes what I'm doing.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> Would there be a place for Jesse Ventura in the Trump government?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, there certainly would be, but I'm sure he wouldn't want that perhaps. I mean, he's got his hands full. I hear he's doing a great job. He's very popular out in Minnesota, and he'll continue to do a great job. I think he's going to be a force for a long time.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> You don't see it as bizarre that a man you met in WrestleMania and a billionaire might be conceivably running the country?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think he's a terrific guy. I think he's very smart. He speaks plainly and the truth and boom. And I -- I just think that Jesse has made an impact on the country. And, you know, you love to cover him, and other people love to cover him, and he also gets big ratings, and, therefore, you guys like us. I mean, until -- as I told you before, if I come up with a cure to cancer, if I don't get ratings, I'm not going to be on your show. We know that. All right? And the same goes for Jesse. It's one of those things. I think he's going to be around for a long time, and I think he's going to be very successful.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> So you're really doing this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm really looking at it, and I'm looking at it very seriously.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> My guest for the hour, Donald Trump. This is Donald's spread on Fifth Avenue, on top of a building that, of course, is named after Donald. Stay tuned. Unedited Donald Trump. [Announcements]
<Warren Beatty> <Negative> [Clip]If I didn't think they were completely nuts, it'd make no difference to me whether that person had become well-known as a basketball player or a businessman or an actor or a wrestler or a grocery store clerk or a drum majorette. I'd say to that person, I'd say, 'Look,' drum majorette, 'there's no harm in thinking about this, however unlikely it may be, but whatever you do, go ahead and speak up. Speak up for the people nobody speaks for.'
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> What's your take on Warren Beatty?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I only met him once. I met him at a place around 2:30 in the morning, Mumba, which is a hot spot that I'm sure you know of, unfortunately for you perhaps.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Oh, thank you again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it's a hot spot in New York, and it's great, and I thought he was terrific. I mean, we both should not have been there, and we were, and that wasn't so long ago. But my take on him is he's -- he's a wonderful guy and a won...
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> But what I'm saying, did -- did you talk politics to him when -- you didn't?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We really didn't. No, we really didn't. You know, I think he's wonderful one on one, but he's very uncomfortable in front of a camera. And I've watched him being interviewed a couple of times on your friend David Letterman's show and others and he was just very, very uncomfortable. He was very uncomfortable making the speech. So I was more watching how uncomfortable he was perhaps than what he was saying, which is unfortunate. It shouldn't be that way.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> A pal of mine, Professor Alan Dershowitz, says that all third party candidates are inherently dangerous. That he wants politicians to be professional politicians, not amateurs. What's your response?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I know Alan quite well and I respect Alan's opinion, and there's a little truth to that, I suspect. I think that the Reform Party or a third party has a big disadvantage for one thing because you've had years and -- you know, hundreds of years of ceding to the other two parties. I think that if the right man gets in, or person gets in, or woman gets in, it could be spectacular for the country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I also think it could be negative. But you can truly say that about anybody. I mean, if you get the wrong person, it could be negative depending.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I guess what he's really saying is that the politicians have been out there for a long time, they've been tested for a long time, and you may not like them, and they may not be very good and they may not be very bright, but at least you know what you're getting. But that's not really the way to get the finest.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> Do you think people are disenchanted, really, truly, with the political process?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think they're disenchanted with not the process, but the people in the process. You look at some of the people today. I mean, Bill Bradley is an example.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Bill Bradley goes as this great moralist. He was going to get defeated in New Jersey. He was going to lose badly in New Jersey, so he dropped out on the basis that, 'the Senate is a terrible place and the world is a terrible place and I'm too good for everybody,' and the fact is he quit.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He quit the race. And I don't know how he does. I -- I think that, you know, I used to say Gore is underrated. I think I'm still saying that. But I watched him jumping around the other night on the stage trying to be dynamic, and you can't do it. You have to be you. And if you're not going to be you, that's a little bit scary. So we'll see what happens there. But, yeah, people -- people are disenchanted with the people that are running, in my opinion.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Grade them from A to F, if you want to? George W. Bush as a candidate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I like him. I didn't love his answer on drugs. It wasn't very reassuring. But I like him, I think he's going to be a good candidate. I think McCain is coming up fairly strongly. We'll have to see. It looked like it was a one man -- man race. Maybe it won't be. But, certainly, so far he's made a very good showing. He's raised more money than anybody else, and -- other than me I guess, he's raised more money.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Is that an indication of his ability to serve as a good president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's an indication of -- of management. I think management is important, and he's managed thus far a good campaign. I mean, Al Gore spent a lot of money and given it to a lot of political consultants from all over the place, and I can understand. He's vice president and everybody that has an idea they comes in, and you just hire 'em, hire 'em, hire 'em because you're the Democrat, you're the vice president, you're going to have plenty of money and all of a sudden you have this big bureaucracy and you can't move. And he has to really just loosen up and just become Al Gore. I mean, he got to be vice president by being Al Gore, not by being this false guy that he's pretending to be.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> So what's he get? A, B, C, D, E, F?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think he's a very good guy. I really think he is. I think he's done a terrible job in the campaign, and I really believe that if he's on his game he's gonna get one of his senator friends to run also so they'll have a three way race and he wins easily. I mean, Bradley is not luring anybody. What Bradley's doing is he just happens to be an alternative. So if I were Gore I'd say, 'Gee, do me a favor, Senator So and So. Run against me and take some of that vote away.'
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> You were quoted in The New York Times of saying that, you know, you build -- you're the biggest developer by far in New York. You've managed to -- to understand and manage bureaucracies. You've got thousands, if not tens of thousands of employees. But is it really the same? Is being a real estate tycoon really the same skills you would need as president of the United States?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I deal with much tougher people, being a real estate tycoon, as you call it, in New York, than you deal with in terms of politicians of other nations and heads of other nations, other than perhaps a couple of dictators who are pretty tough cookies. I mean, I deal with the toughest, smartest people in the world in New York. And I -- I -- excuse me, but I know everybod -- I mean, virtually every politician.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Who don't I know? And I -- you know, I don't know if I should be saying it, but I'm certainly one of the largest contributors, so who really would know more about campaign finance reform than Donald Trump? I'm at the top of list. I'm maxed out every year. I know the politicians.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I know some are very good and very talented, and some are really a bunch of stiffs and bad and not even honest, and, you know, I know a lot about politics and a lot about the politicians.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> How much are you worth anyway? I -- I get different -- I mean, Forbes says you're only worth $ 1,500,000,000. Fortune and some of the others say upwards of $ 4 billion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have no idea what I'm worth. I mean, they say from $ 1,600,000,000 in Forbes to $ 6 billion. I have no idea. It doesn't matter. I mean, what's the General Motors building worth? What's Trump Tower worth? What's 40 Wall Street worth? I have no idea. In this market, they're worth a lot. In a year from now they might not be worth too much. Who knows? I mean, the -- the economy is changing, and it's perhaps changing rapidly, and I hope that's not a bad -- you know, I not gonna -- I don't want to speak against myself, but I hope the economy is going to stray -- stay long -- very, very strong for a very, very long period of time, but it may not.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Donald Trump on the economy, and what we can expect. You know, the stock market has been very volatile lately. Stay tuned. Be right back. [Announcements]
<Pat Buchanan> <Negative> If they got another billionaire, and the guys that have fixed the Republican Party nomination are now going to work with Mr. Ventura to fix the Reform Party nomination with a billionaire, and I -- I can't beat a guy with a billion dollars. I -- I -- I won three out of four races in 1996 with all of -- these people had more money than I did. But when you're talking $ 100 million in a campaign, or $ 1 billion, I think it becomes a plutocracy and...
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> OK.
<Pat Buchanan> <Negative> ...and outsiders don't have a chance.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Is he right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He can't beat me for other reasons. He can't beat me because he just wrote a book espousing Adolph Hitler. I mean, Pat Buchanan was run out of the Republican Party. Now they did it very nicely, which I don't understand. I don't know why Bush didn't say get the hell out of here after what he read. But, you know, I don't know that I'm going to run, but if I run, I'm going to beat him. But it's not going to be because of the money.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> You know, if Buchanan runs, the -- you know, the folklore or the common wisdom is that he'll take votes away from the Republican Candidate, probably George W. Bush. If you run, where will your votes come from?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I would help the Republicans, believe it or not. The people that like me most are the workers, the taxicab driver, the construction worker. The people that dislike me -- and you've heard me say this before. The rich people don't necessarily like me, other than the ones that know me. I know a lot of them, but the rich people hate Donald Trump for whatever reason.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> You -- you build big buildings in front of their view. That's why.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't know. Well, I block out their views and little things like that, but the rich people aren't big fans of Donald Trump. The working people love Donald Trump. I mean, I go down the street and it's like bedlam, and it's great. I love it. I think it's wonderful. But those are the people that would vote for me. So I think I would hurt the Democrats much more than I would hurt the Republicans. I think that George W. Bush loses the election if Pat Buchanan becomes the Reform Party candidate.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> So you think it's going to be that profound if...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think it's big...
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> ...if Buchanan takes that many people?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...which doesn't help the the Republicans, doesn't help the Reform Party, because most of the Reform Party people would go for George W. Bush as their second choice, let's say. So what do they do? They end up getting their third choice, which is the Democratic candidate.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> We didn't talk about the economy. I don't want to give it short shrift, but you can give me one minute before the commercial break. Are we headed for a crash? Are we headed -- do you hear the bears galloping across Central Park?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I hope not, and I think not, but I will say this: The Reform Party nominee will have a lot better chance if there is a crash, and it could -- you know, something pretty catastrophic could happen. I don't think so. I hope it's going to go on. We've taken a pretty good blip over the last couple of weeks, but I'll tell you what. The third party candidate is really strong and becomes really strong if the economy changes. Because the one thing that Clinton has going is the good economy. Everything else is a disaster in his administration. But the one thing he has got going is a good economy. If that goes, it's going to be a very depressing place.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> So are you torn then? Are you rooting on the one hand for a great economy as a businessman and as a...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm actually rooting for a great economy. I -- I have to tell you. I -- if I have my choice -- you mean, do I get more votes? I'd like to see the economy stay. Too many people get hurt the other way.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Yes or no. Quick before the break. You keep Alan Greenspan as the chairman of the Fed?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's been terrif -- he's a friend of mine. He's been terrific. He's been great.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> OK. I'm going to ask Donald about some of these other issues that have come up, especially what the Oval Office or the Lincoln Bedroom will be like in a Trump administration. Obviously, he's a man seldom seen without a beautiful lady on his arm. Who's going to be with him in the White House? Stay tuned. Be right back. [Announcements]
<Bill Clinton> <Negative> [Clip] I want to say one thing to the American people. I want you to listen to me. I'm going to say this again. I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie, not a single time, never. These allegations are false, and I need to go back to work for the American people. Thank you.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> Here's a quote from The Daily News, David Saltonstall, on the 10th of October. Would anyone even be talking about Trump
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't lie about it. I'm very open. I go -- as -- as I have said many times, I've never had a drug in my life. I don't take drugs. I don't take alcohol. I've never had a glass of alcohol in my life. I've never had a cup of coffee or a cigarette. But I do love women. But I don't lie about it. That was the disaster, that statement. It turned out to be a disaster for the president, like a total disaster. Probably ruinous to his administration, despite the good economy and everything else. I don't lie about it.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> What did Clinton do wrong? Was it being with Monica in the Oval Office, or was it attempting to wiggle out of it, lie?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, obviously, it was wrong being with Monica for a lot of reasons. But it was wrong being with Monica. And, you know, there are those that say if he were with a supermodel -- of course, I would never say such a thing.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But if he were with a supermodel instead of Monica, he would have been just fine. He would have been everybody's hero. Now I can't imagine why they'd say that, but there is a group that would say that and has said that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So the Monica thing was wrong. Monica was wrong. It's -- and it's not only Monica.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, Monica looks perfectly nice in many other respects, but, you know, you go to -- to Paula Jones and Linda Tripp, who's, to me, the worst of all. I mean, I look at Linda Tripp, and she's revolting. if you look at her, you say, 'Oh.' And to me, it all starts with Linda Tripp.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She's just -- there was just so many bad characters in this little event. But it was the lying that really was the problem. It was very, very terrible.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then on top of it -- and I've watched politicians in New York, in particular, have a great career by saying, 'I don't discuss my personal life.' And, I mean, they're in every bedroom in New York. And yet they just say, 'I don't discuss my personal life.' He could have gotten away with that. He could have said it. I mean, you know, these New York guys are pretty tough, and the New York press is as tough as it gets. These guys have made a career, a great career for many, many years. 'I don't discuss my personal life.' Why did he have to go and do this?
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> But he was accused of adultery. We -- you and I certainly have -- have sinned ourselves in that area. Should the American people forgive all of us?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You more so than me?
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Oh, we can't ever -- we can't ever tally that one now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, yes, yes.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> But I -- I definitely accept responsibility for my sins.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> But should the people forgive us?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think they forgive, but I don't think they forgive lying. The lying is just -- in this case, it was -- it was pretty bad. And, you know, when I -- and I like Clinton, I really do. I hope he's going to join my golf club. I'm building a beautiful golf club up in Westchester, and he's having a hard time because of what he did getting into the right club. And my club is going to be spectacular. And I -- I hope he's...
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> I'm sure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it will be the best, and I hope he's going to come in. And, you know, he's moving only three minutes away from where I'm building it in Westchester. So...
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> So that's an open invitation to the president.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's an open invitation. I'd be honored to have him.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> And what's it called, Trump?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But isn't it sad -- it's called Trump National Golf Course.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> Of course.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, why not? But isn't it sad that the president of the United States can't get into a golf club in Westchester? Now it's tough to get into a club. But you think the president -- without that scandal, he would have been in every club.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> What are you going to do about women in the Trump administration? Are you going to get married before you're, you know, administered the oath of office and ...[Inaudible]?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I guess I'll go and say what I just said. I'd, you know, rather not discuss my personal life, etc., etc., although it's a -- pretty much of an open book because every time I walk outside...
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Your's is. Why -- why not now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Every -- every time I walk outside, it's an open book. But, you know, there -- there are -- there are things that you just don't like to discuss. I'd love not to discuss it if possible, but I have a spectacular woman right now who I think people would really like and, you know, she's very upstanding.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> Are you saying that you will propose marriage?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, let's put it this way. I could get married very quickly if that were an obstacle to somebody that's very good. But I don't think that's an obstacle nowadays. I will say this. I think...
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> Being a bachelor?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Being a bachelor. In fact, perhaps it would be refreshing. I think Clinton should be a bachelor, to be honest. And I think Hillary is a lovely lady, although I think Rudy is going to win the race and I think he should win the race because he's done a great job as mayor. But Clinton's got to be a bachelor. I mean, I imag -- I can't imagine what's going to happen after he's out of the office and he's -- you know, wants to go out and have some fun. What's he going to do? He's the ex-president of the United States. Is he going to go to Moomba with us?
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> But you're a playboy, Donald. How can you be a settled man, even in a building as protected...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm a very solid person. But I'm a very solid person.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> Businesswise, you are.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, I mean, I'm single. I'm allowed to be a playboy. I'm a single -- I'm a single person. And, you know, I'm allowed to be a playboy. And somebody said the other day that the women I go out with are much more beautiful than the women that Warren goes out with -- I guess, went out with or goes out with. I'm not sure how they put it. But I'm allowed to do that. As a single person, I can do what I want to do.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> But after Marla Maples and 'the best sex I ever had,' do you really want your private life scrutinized in that excruciating detail again?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that was a great compliment when she said that. Didn't she say that on your show?
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> Oh, well, she said -- in the Post first, but later on my show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, I was -- I was very complimented. It was -- it was -- I wasn't sure if it was a great compliment or it shouldn't be a compliment, to be honest. I never figured that one out. But, you know, it's just that the press covers...
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> See, a Puerto Rican man wouldn't be conflicted about that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, no. You'd just say you'll take it, right? But I think a lot of the press that I get is because I do great things -- I do great things, in terms of business. Trump Tower is a spectacular building. It's a great landmark building. Trump World Tower, right opposite the United Nations, is going to be a -- a truly -- it's the tallest residential tower in the world. It's going to be a truly spectacular building. I mean, if -- if I was doing a 22-story building like other people, you know, just not spectacular stuff, I don't think I'd be doing an interview. I -- I really think it's what I do in business that makes me more spectacular.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> You don't think -- you don't think people live vicariously through your exploits?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, perhaps...
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> Sexual as well as financial?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Perhaps they do, but I -- again, I think a lot of that is really what I do in business. The General Motors Building, having a great partner, Conseco's Steve Hilbert. We bought the General Motors Building together, and it's been a tremendous success. The land under the Empire State Building; 40 Wall Street, turning it around from a nothing building -- a great building, but a -- a building in total disrepair with no tenants, into probably the most successful real estate deal made in New York in the last 10 years. But if...
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> But -- but labeling...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...if I didn't do all of that, if I didn't have those big successes, I don't think I'd be sitting with you right now.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> But the labeling some people find offensive, putting your name in big gold or brass letters on everything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that's only because you read The New York Times this morning.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Oh, I doubt that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But -- but -- but I will say that it -- as you know, they come out with a report, the Cochran Report. I get the highest rents in New York, I get the highest sales prices in New York. If I didn't have the name Trump on the building, I wouldn't get it. It's purely business. You know, it started off as ego when I named Trump Tower. That was my first one on 57th and Fifth, Trump Tower, a big success.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> When you announced it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now it's really -- it's really become business. It's -- if -- if I was building the building opposite the United Nations without my name on it, I would get hundreds of dollars a square foot less than I'm getting now. I'm selling at a record clip. People are buying apartments living in Germany and Europe and Asia, all over the world. They don't even know what the building looks like, and they're buying it because it's Trump. And, you know, it's a compliment, but it's not ego. It's dollars.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> So it's not ego. It would not affect the Trump presidency?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I think...
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> You wouldn't change the White House?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, yeah. I guess, we all have ego, but I've never met a person who was a success that didn't have ego. I don't think I have excessive ego...
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> I agree.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ...but I've never met a person who was successful who didn't have ego.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> Do you think it translates into politics?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it does. I think that you have to have a pretty tough skin. I have a friend who's a very rich man.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He calls me up. He says, 'Donald, how do you take all that publicity, the good, the bad, the women, all that stuff? How do you take it? It hate it.' And this is a very rich man. And I said -- he said, 'I wouldn't have that for anything.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I wouldn't want to be like that. I wouldn't have it.' And then he says, 'By the way, Donald, could you call up and get me a reservation at Le Cirque tonight? I can't get a reservation.' So that's the way it is. And then I say to myself, 'Well, you know.' But I really think it's the accomplishments and the things I do and the spectacular nature of those things that puts me before the camera more than anything else.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> We have -- we have to take a commercial break. But here's a question I pose now, and we'll -- we'll answer on -- on the other side. It's obvious that you are brilliant when it comes to business and would be a terrific Commerce secretary, let's say.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> You'd be terrific in, you know, bilateral, multilateral negotiations with the World Trade Organization or if you wanted to make another NAFTA accord. Whether you like it or not, I don't know. But what about critical situations like war? Here you have India and Pakistan, as an example, two nuclear powers, at odds, almost went to war a couple of months ago.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Now one of them has just had a coup -- a -- a -- a military coup, overthrowing the democratically elected government. What would a Trump administration do about India, Pakistan, about North Korea, about Cuba? Let's review that with The Donald right after this. [Announcements]
<Rudy Giuliani> <Negative> [Clip] I've never lived in f -- Arkansas. I've never worked in Arkansas. I've never been to Arkansas. But I love Arkansas. In fact, I love it so much, I'm going to be running for the Senate.
<Hillary Clinton> <Negative> [Clip] Now I suppose the questions on everyone's mind is: Why the Senate and why New York and why me? And all I can say is that I care deeply about the issues that are important in this state.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> You've said you prefer Rudy to Hillary. And yet there are a lot of people who think Rudy Giuliani has done a job that has alienated many minorities and that his -- his -- his lack of humor, his anger, his -- his vengeful side is a dark side that wouldn't play well in the Senate.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think he has a lack of humor. I think he's a -- a -- a tremendous mayor. Crime is way down.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The city is -- I can tell you, I've been here in good times and bad times. And I've suffered through bad times in New York, and the city has never been stronger. It's the hottest place in the world right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I used to say the hottest in the United States, but with the downfall of Asia, which truly has happened, which is starting to come back -- New York City right now is the hottest city in the world. Crime is way down, the -- the life, the whole thing. It's just a -- a vibrant place. And people are moving back that left years ago. They're moving back. They moved out to California, they moved to other locations. They're moving back to New York. He's been a great mayor.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> But maybe he's much better as an executive than in the Legislature.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that, to be honest...
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Hillary's got some good experience.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...if I had my choice, I'd love to see Rudy be the mayor for a longer period of time, but you can't do that with term limits. I just think it's unfair. And I think she's a very nice lady. I wish she was running someplace else. I'd support her. But I think it's very unfair when you have somebody that's done as spectacular of a job as Rudy Giuliani to say, 'Well, that's great. Good job. Thanks a lot. You can't go on to the next position,' or whatever. I don't know if he's going to like the Senate. I think he'll probably be effective there, like he was in New York City as the mayor. But he has done such a great job as mayor that I think he's entitled to go to the next step.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> And Hillary -- you think she's a carpet bagger?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I -- I don't view it as that. I actually think she's a very, very nice lady. I -- I -- I met her a number of times. I met her with my son. She couldn't have been nicer. I think she's a very, very good person. I think she's -- she's had a very tough life the last few years. I mean, what could be tougher than that? I mean, can you imagine those evenings when he's just being lambasted by this crazy Ken Starr, who is a total wacko? There's the guy. I mean, he is totally off his rocker. And can you imagine being lambasted like that all day and then saying, 'Darling, what are we having for dinner?' It's got to be pretty tough.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> All right. You're in the White House. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff comes to you and says, 'Pakistan is about to launch a missile with a nuclear tip at India.' What do you do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I surround myself with the best people. I know the best people. You mentioned Alan Greenspan before.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And Rubin was such -- I mean, great. Some of these guys have been terrific. And it's interesting, the business guys have been terrific, and that's where we're strongest.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I surround myself with the best people and I give people spirit. And I'll tell you what, very, very -- with very few exceptions, New York City is a much tougher environment than a world environment, and you know that better than anybody. And making money and becoming very, very rich in New York City, I'm dealing with a lot tougher characters than the people we see. But I surround myself with great people. I'm very much into the whole thing with the armed forces and with defense. I'm totally against the -- you know, what they almost signed and maybe they will at some point.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> You're against the nuclear non-test?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I -- I'm against -- because nobody is going to follow it. We're going to follow it because we're nice people. We're going to follow it. Do you think China is going to follow it? Do you think North Korea is going to follow it? Do you think other countries are going to be following it? They're going to testing all over the place, and we're not going to know it or we're -- we're going to have ideas. But I believe that the people -- and the kind of people -- and my history has -- has proven this. I surround myself with the best people. And I would be better at negotiating out something like that peacefully than anybody else I can think of.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> North Korea, you've called for a Qaddafi-like strike.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well...
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Do you really mean that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ...North Korea is out of control. Everybody knows it, and nobody wants to say it. They're developing weapons of every kind, of every shape and form.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're going to have to go in there, at some point, and talk to them very reasonably. Say, 'Folks, we don't want to have you in five years on our plate. If we have you, we want to have you now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We don't want to have you in five years. Now let's negotiate something out, but really something, not as we have been in the past.' You know, we're all petrified of dealing with these people. What's it going to be like in five years from now when they really have what they're trying to develop? I think, to me, the biggest single problem in the world today is the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This treaty doesn't do a thing about that because the treaty says -- the words are wonderful, but the bad guys, as I say, having to do with gun control -- because it's almost just a bigger analogy. The bad guys are going to develop and they're going to do whatever they want to do. And we're just going to be in a stagnant, weak position.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But if you're going to have a problem with them -- and you won't have the problem now. If you're going to have the problem, it will be totally negotiated out now. In five years, you'll be incapable of negotiating out the problem.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> So you want a pre-emptive strike against them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't want -- I don't want a pre-emptive strike. I don't want that. Certainly, last, last choice.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you have to talk to these people now. What they're doing is very, very scary. I mean, they're going to have a nuclear arsenal bigger than ours.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to be going in there on our -- on our knees saying, 'Please.' And right now we don't have to do that. And our weak politicians are too afraid to do anything. They come up with these phony treaties that don't mean a damn thing. And North Korea's going to town. I mean, you talk about Pakistan and India. But North Korea, I think, is the bigger problem at this moment. I mean, one thing with Pakistan and India, the missiles are pointed in those two directions. North Korea is a big problem. And so is Pakistan and so is India and so is China, but it's going to be a much bigger problem in two or three or four years from now. And you better start talking fast.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Two topics could not be more related -- or more unrelated, I should say. Fidel Castro, on the one hand, and then I want you to give me a quick walking tour of your apartment here for the fans of something less than catastrophic world policy.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> OK.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Be right back. Donald Trump our guest. [Announcements]
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> In December, you're releasing your book, The America We Deserve. I've read
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he's been a disaster, and I don't think just because time goes by that we should reward him. How much longer is he going to be around anyway, in all fairness? You look at him now, he's an old man. He looks like an old man. He's been beaten up. He's been amazing in that he's been such a strong guy. I mean, you know, say what you want, in a volatile part of the world, he survived for many, many years. But I don't think you have to reward somebody just because it's the easy way. He's going to be gone. He's going to be gone fairly soon. Cuba is a total mess, and I think that it will get straightened out, but I don't think we should reward that system.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> But you're calling for his arrest a la Pinochet, the way Pinochet has been dealt with.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Absolutely. Oh, absolutely. Look, he's killed so many people. You go down to Miami -- and I'm in Miami a lot -- and you see the Cubans -- and really you could say refugees because that's what they are. And it's very, very sad what's happened. And the spirit the Cuban people have is amazing. I've never seen anything like it -- quite like it. The spirit they have, and the hatred they have for Castro even tops that. So I just don't think we should reward him for having done what he's done over the years.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> You seem -- and -- and forgive me if I'm wrong about this -- almost schizophrenic, in a sense. On -- on the one hand, I believe you to be liberal in terms of social kinds of issues...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> True. True.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> You are -- you are pro-abortion or at least not pro-life or whatever.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, as I said, I -- I hate it, but I am pro-choice.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> OK. And on other issues of that sort. And yet you are as staunchly conservative as Jesse Helms, in some ways, on these foreign policy issues.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm very liberal, quite liberal, when it comes to social and health issues. And I believe that I'm quite conservative -- I wouldn't say Jesse Helms conservative, but I'm quite conservative when it co -- when it comes to the military and our defense and our enemies. I mean, look at our trade deficits.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You look at what Japan has done to us over the years and continues to do. It's just incredible. Now they're not the whipping boy they used to be because they're not doing so well now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because even though they've been ripping us off left and right, something went wrong with their system. And we all know what it is. But the fact is that you look at what countries have done to us. Now I'm all in favor of free trade, and I believe -- but it has to be fair trade, and it hasn't been fair.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> Oprah, after saying that she was flattered, turned you down as a prospective vice presidential running mate. Any other ideas?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I mean, Oprah was thrown out, just as somebody great. She's a friend of mine. She's great. I -- I really like her a lot.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Me, too.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, you know, truth, she'd be fantastic. I think it would be a great ticket. But I'm considering certain people, and if I decide to run, I'll let you know. And I'll give it to you very early. I can't say scoop, but I'll give it to you early.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> Give me the first letter of the first name. No. All right. How much is this place worth, this spread?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's three floors on the top of Trump Tower, with a park on the roof. And I've never figured out what it's worth because I built it and I own it and I have it. So I've never really thought in terms of what's it worth, but guess it's worth the ultimate Manhattan apartment.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> And you live here all by yourself?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I live here by myself sometimes in my lonelier periods and -- and sometimes, you know, with others. And the kids are here, and they spend a lot of time here. My -- I have four children, and they -- they spend a lot of time in the apartment. So it's actually a very warm place. It's very big, but it's very warm.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Neutral> What are the ages of the children?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a -- a son 21, who just graduated. He's graduating from the Wharton School of Finance. And then I have a 17-year-old Ivanka and 15-year-old Eric and just five-year-old -- just turned five Tiffany.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> How do you get along with your exes?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I get along very well. I get along very well. They, I believe, like me. They should. I mean, I was certainly, you know, a generous guy, and in many respects, a very good husband.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> And you're still a firm believer in prenuptual agreements?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would not get married without a prenuptual agreement. I mean, if you're a person of wealth, you have no choice. I mean, you just have no choice. I hate prenuptial agreements. I hate what they stand for. I hate what they represent. I mean, it's pretty tough to go -- you're in love with someone and you go up and you say, 'Darling, I'm in love with you and we're getting married. By the way, sign on the dotted line.' I mean, because really -- you're really saying you give up -- and, in fact, I read a statistic that people that sign them, while protected, they tend to get divorced more easily than people that don't have them, for obvious reasons.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Negative> Our guest for the hour has been Donald Trump. So November 1st, you're going in California to do your filing under the Reform Party. You're taking it at least that far. California and Ohio?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's correct.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> OK. Well, good luck, Donald.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Geraldo Rivera> <Positive> And thank you very much for being here. He did it again. See? Twice. See you tomorrow. Bye.
