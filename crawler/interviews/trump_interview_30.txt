<Donald Trump> <Positive> Special guy here, getting that kind of good treatment.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Christopher Sign> <Positive> We try, Mr. President. Welcome to Alabama. Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Christopher Sign> <Neutral> This is a state that is filled with manufacturing: Mercedes
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Christopher Sign> <Positive> -- Honda, Hyundai and, of course, soybean farmers as well.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Christopher Sign> <Negative> When you talk China and trade and the economy, what do you say to the many people, many of them in the stadium, right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'll say that we're doing really well. You know, China started to buy again. They're paying -- it's billions and billions of dollars a year in tariffs. They're eating it. We're not paying, they're paying, because they devalue their currency, and they're putting up a lot of money. We're very close to a great deal with China.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's got to be perfect. The farmers have been so incredible, the manufacturers in our country have been so incredible. They know I'm doing the right thing. It should have been done 20 years ago. It's being done now. But China is having the worst year they've had in 57 years. We're having the best year we've ever had, and, as you know, I paid $28 billion over the last two years to the farmers, because that's the amount of money that the farmers were targeted, and we had a lot of money left over after that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So the farmers are very happy, and the manufacturers are very happy, and this is a great state.
<Christopher Sign> <Negative> Mr. President, Jeff Sessions wants his old job back in this state, and he's entering a very crowded field. Will you support him? Will you support somebody else? Your thoughts, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we're asking a lot of questions. We're looking at a lot of different people. It's going to be a pretty hard primary, from what I understand, it is indeed a great st -- state and, as you know, I think I won by, I don't know, a lot. Was it 42 points, or something like that. We won by a lot, whatever it may be. But, we had a tremendous victory in Alabama, and we're gonna to continue to have -- we're going to make a decision at some point during the -- during the [Inaudible], we'll make that decision, reasonably quickly I think.
<Christopher Sign> <Positive> Yes sir, and the importance of the south and the southeast for you -- you've been to Louisiana, going back to Louisiana, you've been to Mississippi, of course here, in Alabama --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, well, it's been very important. We have a big race going on right now, it's an interesting game, right, with LSU and Alabama. But we have a big race, a really terrific, Eddie Rispone is going, as you know, and I think he's going to be your next Governor of Louisiana, and we've backed him very strongly against the current governor, who has not done a very good job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we have a big thing going right now in Louisiana with the governor's race, and I guess they'll have that next Saturday. So it'll be very interesting to see what happens. I think the Republican has a really good chance to win.
<Christopher Sign> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well thank you very much. Great --
<Christopher Sign> <Positive> Yes, sir very nice to meet you, sir. Thank you very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good man.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Yes, he is.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He broke a big story, right?
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Yes, he did.
<Christopher Sign> <Positive> Yes sir, the tarmac.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He broke a biggie. That was a big one
<Christopher Sign> <Positive> The secret meeting on the tarmac, yes sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You take care. We'll do another one, okay.
<Christopher Sign> <Positive> Thank you, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. Thank you.
<Christopher Sign> <Positive> Appreciate your time very much.
<Melania Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Christopher Sign> <Positive> I bought you a hat. An Alabama hat, ma'am. Yes.
<Melania Trump> <Positive> Oh, thank you. [Inaudible]
<Christopher Sign> <Positive> Thank you very much, nice to meet you.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> [Inaudible] you have a picture?
<Christopher Sign> <Negative> Uhh...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A picture. He was so nice. Come here, take a picture. White House photographer.
<Christopher Sign> <Positive> I would love one, Mr. President. Thank you so very much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great. Our great, very expensive White House photographer.
<Christopher Sign> <Positive> Yes sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You want to have one. If you make me look good I'll give you a picture, okay?
<Christopher Sign> <Positive> That is very kind of you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He is actually more important than Chris.
<Christopher Sign> <Positive> He is, yes sir, he is. Very much so.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Excellent, thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> You'll send them, okay?
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Christopher Sign> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you very much. Thank you.
<Ryan Elijah> <Positive> First of all, Mr. President, thank you for the time. I want -- I want to get your thoughts on Congress in a second, but let's start -- you're back in Florida for the first time --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Ryan Elijah> <Positive> -- since this summer's announcement. Health care is what you're talking about today.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Right.
<Ryan Elijah> <Neutral> How big of an issue will that be going forward?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> To me, it's a very big issue, and when you look at all we've done for health care and getting rid of the individual mandate, which was a disaster for people, and just not affordable -- doing all of the things -- we are we are really focused on health care, and I don't think anybody could do it like we're doing it, and we're saving Medicare.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> If you look at what the Democrats wanted, they wanted to destroy Medicare. We're saving Medicare. So, to me, it's right up there with the top.
<Ryan Elijah> <Positive> You've had some strong words this week about the whistleblower process and moving forward, so, to Floridians: how do you want to see this process play forward by -- based on what they find out about the whistleblower, and also the process that you protect the whistleblower?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's a political witch hunt. The whistleblower got me totally wrong, because the whistleblower never saw what I said to the Ukrainian president, which was literally a perfect, beautiful, nice conversation. He also said, by the way, there was no pressure put on him whatsoever, et cetera, et cetera. He said that the United Nations.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So the whistleblower, they didn't think -- meaning shifty Schiff and that whole group -- they didn't think I'd put out my telephone conversation, which was done by professional stenographers. They didn't think it would be put out. When I saw what the whistleblower said and heard rumors -- I said well, we're going to put it out, and we've got approval from Ukraine, and we put it out, and everyone now is panicking because they said, what they said and what the whistleblowers said, bears no resemblance even, to what took place in the phone call ,which was a perfect call.
<Ryan Elijah> <Positive> When you look forward, I mean, certainly it's a situation where you were an outsider coming in. Your expectations of the White House, basis what you've seen: how different are they?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I knew it would be a little bit tough. And I I just never thought I'd see the kind of cheating and lying that you see. I never thought the press would be as bad as they were. I've met with the press -- I used to get good press, when I was private. Probably, it's one of the reasons I'm here, right, I got good press.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I had no idea the press would be as dishonest, as fake. You know we call it fake -- not you, of course. But it's really fake news. It's unbelievable. You'll have a story, a big success, like in California, they sued to get me off the ballot. I won the suit. It was a huge story. I won the suit. Nobody even covers it. So, I never thought I'd see that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But overall, I have to say I'm happy, and the reason I'm happy -- no administration has ever done so much for people in its first two and a half years, and we're here for now even more than two and a half years, and we've done so much whether it's choice for the vets -- you know they were trying to get it for 50 years -- they never got it. Regulations, tax cuts, the big tax cuts, getting rid of certain things.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll tell you a very, very important are now you can use medicines as they get developed, if you're terminally ill. They call it the Right to Try. Right to Try. If somebody's terminally ill, they have to go to other countries, or just literally die. And we have the best scientists, we have the best doctors in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have great things, but they're in a pipeline, you couldn't use them, and we have now the right to try. So somebody can sign a piece of paper and they have the right to use that medicine, and you would be -- you wouldn't believe how successful it's been.
<Ryan Elijah> <Negative> Final question, I hear them cheering inside there. Fighting the issues that need to be done in this country: how do you move forward dealing with what you have to deal with in Congress?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I have a very -- I called them the do nothing Democrats. They just don't do anything. I mean, it's unbelievable. All they do is they focus on trying to win the election in 2020, which is all this is about, and it's too bad. But we're doing a lot of things. We're doing a lot on gun safety, and we're working with the NRA, and we're working -- you know, we tried to work with a Democrats, but frankly, they don't even want to meet.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They they don't have time to meet, because all they do is focus on one thing. And, you know, the word do nothing -- the words do nothing, I think, are very important. They just can't get it done. But we're doing a lot. Nobody's done what we've done, and I think we can have some really good -- one of the things, very important, that we can do it without them, is we've already had the first year in 51 years where drug prices have come down, and we're going to get drug prices much lower -- prescription drug prices.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So we're doing a real job, and I love doing it.
<Ryan Elijah> <Positive> How big is Florida? There are a lot of things that are going well here.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's my home, and it's a place where I spend a lot of time, maybe the most time, in a certain way, certainly over the last couple of years. It's a special pla -- It's really, you have a great governor, Ron DeSantis. I'm very happy -- I was with him right from the beginning, and he's doing a fantastic job, and together, we're working on doing a fantastic job, and he's going to have some big news very soon on prescription drug prices, because we're going to be buying from certain people, in certain areas of the world, at -- the same product exactly for a much lower price.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, a lot of great things are happening. I love Florida. Florida is very good to me. I want it fairly easily, and I think now, after what we've accomplished, we are going to run it -- you know -- run it right through. We're going to win it by an even by a bigger number.
<Ryan Elijah> <Positive> Mr. President, thanks for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Very nice. Thank you.
<David Webb> <Positive> The Opportunity Zones have grown in this country. The nu -- The latest number 8,761 last opened in Spokane, Washington. Many more to go. Most people wouldn't think of Spokane, Washington, when you talk about as you have done on the campaign trail, Mr. President, those that have been left behind and think of urban centers.
<David Webb> <Negative> Would you have looked at the country as a whole and for someone who was attacked so much for being not for the black community, not for women, not for whatever community, and the identity politics world, you've delivered and you've put people in place to deliver for the American people. So let's respond to them first.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, first of all, I really appreciate your statement and your question and to be honest it's all about the country. It's -- whether it's Spokane whether it's Brooklyn, New York, it doesn't make any difference. We have thousands of places now that nobody would have touched. They've been forgotten. I talked about the forgotten men and women in the last campaign.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The whole thing with how forgotten they were. Well, the inner cities have been forgotten. And a lot of African-American people, Hispanic people, have been totally forgotten and we have changed this around. And by the way, your friend, Tim Scott, has been a great help. He is really somebody that when it came to Opportunity Zones he was right there he fought all the way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the results are far greater than we thought. You see that. I mean, the numbers are incredible. We have the best unemployment numbers now in the country the best we've ever had. We have the most people working in the country than we've ever had. We have almost 160 million people working and we have a lot of people going into opportunity zones.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And it's -- it's terrific. It's areas that they would not have -- You know, we have money going in we have investments going in. We have people going in hiring other people. Salaries are up 8% at a minimum in the Opportunities Zones right now from what they were more than any other place in the country is --
<David Webb> <Positive> In a place where poverty is typically double the rate. Plus you've literally you know put a team together. This is a what the American people understand a workshop and a results-oriented approach to tackling these issues not helicoptering in government to do the job.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's private people going and spending a tremendous amount of money. It emanates from the tax cuts because we've got the largest tax cuts for the people of the country in history. But a lot of the money is going into Opportunity Zones, these are people that were never given a chance. And they really it's it's I talk about it and nobody really thought I was going to do it, and I've had great help from certain senators and certain others.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Tim is one I mentioned but from from many of the senators, Republican senators, we've had tremendous, tremendous help but we have it approved we have it done and it's up and operating and it's far more successful than we ever thought possible.
<David Webb> <Negative> You know so many people in America said, "What are you going to do when you say, you, know, what have you got to lose?" And I'll leave that up to the rest of them. But you also haven't left out anyone including tribal governments, the local partnerships that have been made, we don't often hear about that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know it's interesting because you say, "What do you -- What do you got to lose?" I was doing OK but not great with the African-American community. And I was reading I was doing a speech a lot of African-Americans in the audience and we were talking about crime rates, and education rates, and poverty rates, and homeownership percentages and they were like last and everything it was so bad, and it was so unfortunate and I'm reading it and I just said, "Listen, you've been with the Democrats, always it was automatic, for 100 years." You know, for over 100 years they've been with the Democrats who led the cities and led them into bad situations.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said, "What the hell do you have to lose?" Sometimes I use, "What the hell." And sometimes I just say, "What do you have to lose?" But it was always much more exciting when I say, "What the hell do you have to lose by going with me?" And you know that increased my poll numbers incredibly with the African-American community to a point that was -- I mean, many times what I was getting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I couldn't believe what I was getting and we did very well, we did -- Now I'd like to do much better. But as a Republican, it's not easy. And we did very well as you know. And now we have the unemployment rates of the lowest in history for African-American, for Hispanic, for Asian, for women. Women are 61 years, soon to be historic.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, historic, meaning in history, and and that'll be great. But it's been -- it's been incredible. The biggest numbers that we have more people working today than ever in the history of our country, almost 160 million. So when you hear that, and then you couple it with the Opportunity Zones, where -- and this is very much in city stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is -- this -- these are places that would they were languishing for decades, and decades, decades, you know this, and I know you have a lot of fans in those communities and so the way, I think. But I think I have a lot more now than I had maybe even at the election because we've really -- were putting people to work that never were going to -- It was never going to happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They never really were given that chance and now we're putting people to work. So a lot of people, a lot of friends of mine that are African-Americans that "I can't believe you're the guy that did this.", I said, "Well, you know me." And they go, "Yeah, I do and I'm not that surprised." But the fact is that this is something that's gonna be great for the black community.
<David Webb> <Negative> One of the attacks clearly coming from someone who hopes to be president, Bernie Sanders, has been going after you on this on a number of issues you also stood up and said we are not and we will not be a socialist country and I'm paraphrasing, I can never quote you but I will paraphrase for you. What do you say to Bernie Sanders and the "socialist democrats" in the field and the response to the attacks against you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, you look at Venezuela you look at these socialist countries they're all failing or failed and most of them are just like a total disaster and that's pure socialism. And with Bernie's, you know, they want to take the wealth that all of the people have made, 401(k)s you have 401(k)s, we all have 401(k)s and they're at record levels, they've done better than they've ever done, they want to just dissipated.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know socialism is easier, just easier so when you're -- the country's doing incredibly well. In 10 years this country would be destroyed if we ever went that way. It would be absolutely destroyed. You could forget about Opportunity Zones, you could forget about your ownership in companies because a lot of people own stock and the big companies.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know the big companies are really companies owned by lots of people and whether they have stock or whether they have funds. I mean, they're all -- that's really goes right down to people that are small-time investors and big-time investors. But our country is doing so well and if we ever went socialistic, if we became a socialist country you could write off this country, this country would go down so fast and I hear what Bernie says and I hope I get an opportunity to run against him because it'll be so easy to show whether it's his health care that's a disaster, it's a disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Interestingly they tried to do it in Vermont and the governor of Vermont who was -- I mean, he'd do anything Bernie told him to do. They couldn't -- Not only couldn't they make it work. It was -- I think it was more money than the whole state took in the cost. And basically, it's socialized medicine. If you think about it it's socialized medicine.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we'll have our chance I think to debate. I think I put out yesterday could be Bernie and it could be Biden. And I think Sleepy Joe is going to have a hard time. He's, you know, 1% Joe, I don't think he's going to make it. And I don't -- I don't know that Bernie -- maybe Bernie has the most spirit over there right now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Could be the mayor from Indiana, I think I'd like running against him too. But it'll be interesting to see it unfold. It'll be very interesting a lot of times you can't tell as you know better than anybody, you're a great pro, and by the way, you have been so nice to me and I appreciate it very much. Hence, I'm doing an interview with you and we're not doing it with too many people but it'll be interesting to see it unfold, you never know what happens.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And being in politics for me has been a lot of fun.
<David Webb> <Positive> It is a lot of fun to watch it all play out but we've got serious business for the country, and Mr. President, thank you for your time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, thank you and you are a professional and you're just as good in television and I don't know, I think maybe better if you want to know the truth. You have a face that was made for television.
<David Webb> <Negative> I don't think I can trust the guy who knows television just a little bit.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, but you know you do great and you've been -- you've been my friend and I appreciate it very much. Thank you.
<David Webb> <Positive> Thank you.
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> Happy New Year to you, sir. Thank you, thank you so much for joining Fox News Channel All-American New Year. Ah, we're live in Times Square. Wish you could be here as well, but we know you're in Washington, D.C. America wants to know, Mr. President, what are your plans here tonight on New Year's Eve?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm sort of in the White House right now. I'm talking to you and uh it's -- I think moving along well. We need border security, everybody knows it, we need a lot of people approved that we can't get through the senate. We can't get them through Chuck Schumer and the group -- we have 360 people that want to join the administration-- ambassadors and lawyers and lots of other people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We cannot get them approved because - I guess you could call it obstruction, if you think about it, it's pure obstruction -- and we have a lot of other things, but we have probably done more, Pete, than any administration in its first two years in history, according to most.
<Pete Hegseth> <Negative> And we want to get to looking back a little bit at 2018, but let me stay on the topic of that shutdown, Mr. President. You stayed in Washington, D.C. through Christmas, through New Year's; we've seen Nancy Pelosi in Hawaii -- Democrats not willing to come back. A lot of your supporters, to be honest, Mr. President, are hoping that you will stand firm on that five billion dollar marker, something big for the wall.
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> Are you willing to continue the shutdown, if that money does not come?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we are, we have no choice. We have to have border security and a wall is part of border security. You know, I hear so much about the wall is old fashioned. No, the wall is not old-fashioned, the wall is 100 percent foolproof. The -- you look at a wheel -- well, I guess they'd say the wheel is old-fashioned, but it's been around for a long time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The wall is the only way to do it -- and technology, nobody knows more about technology than me, but technology are just the bells and whistles on the wall. If you don't have the wall, you're going to have people coming in. And my border patrol people, they do a fantastic job. But you know, they need the backup of the wall and they're the ones that want it more than anybody, Pete.
<Pete Hegseth> <Neutral> So how far are you willing to go, Mr. President? When do you anticipate talks with Chuck and Nancy, as you say, sir?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I assume when they get back. I'm in Washington; I'm ready, willing and able, I'm in the White House, I'm ready to go. They can come over right now, they could have come over any time. I spent Christmas in the White House. I spent New Year's Eve now in the White House and you know, I'm here. I'm ready to go. It's very important.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A lot of people are looking to get their paycheck, and so I'm ready to go anytime they want. No, we are not giving up. We have to have border security and the wall is a big part of border security; the biggest part.
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> Absolutely. Mr. President, another piece of news; recently Senator Lindsey Graham emerged from the White House. He had been very critical of your decision to withdraw troops from Syria, but he emerged saying, "Now I support the president's decision," a lot of people – he's famously more hawkish on American troops and intervention abroad.
<Pete Hegseth> <Neutral> What was said to him? What did you relay inside the White House that changed the mind of Lindsey Graham?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't think too much, except that I said, you know, I never said that I'm gonna rush out. We're going to get out. We're getting out of Syria; we're bringing our young, great troops home after so many years. You know, we were supposed to be in Syria for three to four months and that was four or five years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And it's time. We have to bring them home. And we're going to do it in a very good way and frankly -- and you know this better than anybody, Pete, ISIS was all over the place when I took over. It was a total mess in Syria. We've almost eradicated all of them. We think all of them will be gone by the time we get out, but we're heading back and we're also fighting.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We -- you can do two things at once. Plus, as you know, we have other bases in the general area. In particular, we have one in Iraq and nobody said anything about that. But you know, we're fighting these endless wars; I campaigned on getting out of the endless wars and frankly, I've done more than I said, because not only did I -- and am I able to get out, but I've also won.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at what I've done. We've really, largely eradicated ISIS. Now that doesn't mean we don't totally finish the job, but that's going to be a very short period of time. We have to bring our troops back home. It's time.
<Pete Hegseth> <Negative> Certainly an accomplishment -- the destruction of ISIS that has not gotten enough notice, no doubt, Mr. President. I want to transition to -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They don't want to talk about it, Pete. [Crosstalk]
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> -- just a little bit. [Crosstalk] They really don't, they really don't -- and if Lindsey Graham's onboard with a plan like that, that's a good sign. I want to transition to presidential politics. Everyone thought 2019 would be the year that Democrats come on to try to win the primary to take you on in 2020, sir.
<Pete Hegseth> <Negative> It turns out one of them jumped the gun, just news recently that Elizabeth Warren, one of your favorite senators, will be announcing an exploratory committee -- your reaction to your first opponent on the Democratic side, Mr. President?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm happy about it. I think she'll be wonderful. I hope she maybe gets the nomination. That will be a wonderful thing for me. But the only reason the Democrats, as an example, aren't approving all of these people, that wanted to come in -- want to come into government -- and they really do, they want to come in -- we really need people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We need lawyers. We need ambassadors. We need all these 360 people that the Democrats won't approve. Or if you look at not approving the wall, where they say walls don't work when they work 100 percent, I mean when they're so good, it's because of the 2020 election. They think I'm going to win. I think based on record I'm going to win also.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think we're going to win big. And they figure by obstructing they can do this. Elizabeth Warren will be the first. She did very badly in proving that she was of Indian heritage. That didn't work out too well. I think you have more than she does, and maybe I do too, and I have nothing. So you know, we'll see how she does.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I wish her well. I hope she does well. I'd love to run against her.
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> She says she's in the fight all the way, Mr. President. Do you really think she believes she can win?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well that I don't know. You'd have to ask her psychiatrist. But honestly, I just, you know -- [Laughter] I mean, if it's her or somebody else, you know, based on our record, Pete, when you look at what we've done, when you look at the regulation cuts, when you look at the massive tax cuts, when you look at what we've done for the vets and what we've done for the military -- you know, with the vets, we have choice and now, as you know better than almost anybody I can speak to, that was phase one of choice.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to phase two and then ultimately to phase three. We're doing it in steps. When you look at all of the things we've done for building up our military and all of the things, I don't think, if you go just based on the record, I don't see how anybody wins. We've done a lot. If you look at unemployment, we're at a 50-year low.
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> Absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> For African Americans and for Hispanics and for Asians, we're at an all-time historic low, the history of our country low. And I don't know if somebody could do better than that -- good luck, but it just doesn't seem that based on the record, somebody's going to do real well.
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> That's a fair point, Mr. President. And on New Year's Eve, tonight, a lot of our viewers, it's a time for reflection. You look back on 2018, you look forward to 2019. If I could, Mr. President, on a lighter note, your winners and losers from 2018 -- who are the big winners and who are the big losers in the last year?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think the winners are the American people, because we've gotten them tax cuts and we've gotten them jobs, jobs like they've never had before. We've taken care of our military, we've rebuilt large portions and very shortly all of our military, which was totally depleted under the previous administration -- so I really think that the big winners are -- are the people of this country, the people of our country, and that makes me very happy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The one that has lost, you know, I don't want to really say, but you have certainly a lot of people that wanted to do things that it didn't work out. I think that when you look at some of the candidates that are announcing right now, I think they will end up being the losers. You've got a lot of people, 32 people they say, could be with the Democrats; let's see what happens.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I only -- I'm really more interested in the winners and the winners are the people of the United States.
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> Absolutely. Sir, exit question here, 2019, any resolutions from you, Mr. President, in this new year? Or any predictions in the new year? Or both?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think we're going to have a great form of wealth. We've created a lot of wealth for our country. And that's very important, because that means jobs, that means prosperity, it means we can afford to do what we're doing with the military. We're working on tremendous trade deals, where other countries have taken advantage of us so badly and I mean, I campaigned on all this stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And really, I'm producing better than I actually said even during the campaign that I would, if you look at what we've done. So I really think we're going to have tremendous success with trade deals. I think we're going to have a tremendously rebuilt military for strength and hopefully we'll never have to use our military; it will be so strong that we'll never have to use it and that would be a good thing.
<Pete Hegseth> <Negative> Mr. President, I shouldn't say this, but last year my resolution was to tweet more; it's the first resolution I've actually kept. Do you have -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good.
<Pete Hegseth> <Neutral> -- any resolutions for 2019, sir? Any resolutions?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Just success and prosperity and health for our country. That's all I want.
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> Absolutely. Well, Mr. President, thank you so much for joining us. I do have to say, my co-host, Kennedy, wanted to say thank you and she loves the tax cuts as do so many Americans -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Oh, good. Well -- [Crosstalk]
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> So thank you Mr. President for joining us and Happy... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's terrific. [Crosstalk]
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> She's terrific. Have a great New Year's in Washington, D.C. and we hope to see you soon in the New Year. Thank you, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much. I really appreciate it, Pete. Have a great year. Thank you, Pete. [Crosstalk]
<Pete Hegseth> <Neutral> You, too, sir. You, too, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Pete Hegseth> <Positive> Thank you.
<Dan Rather> <Positive> If there would be a poster boy to represent America at the turn of the millennium -- the celebration of celebrity, the rich almost reeking of prosperity, continuing proof that the American dream exists -- then Donald Trump's picture might best fill the frame. His name is on buildings. His face is in magazines and newspapers; both are on the covers of three previous books -- all best-sellers -- and now he's coming out with a fourth.
<Dan Rather> <Positive> But this time he's not talking only about his prowess to make millions of dollars; now he is also talking about his hope to win millions of voters. That's right. New York City developer Donald Trump says he wants to be president of the United States.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> [Pre-recorded video] Happy new year!
<Dan Rather> <Neutral> [Voiceover]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I am absolutely serious about conceivably running for the office of president. And if I run and if I won, I think I'd be a really good president.
<Dan Rather> <Positive> Prepared to take that roll out of your pocket, take the rubber band off of it, start counting out real money?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, as I've said, I'd be prepared to spend $100 million on the race, if necessary.
<Dan Rather> <Positive> [Voiceover] Spending that money would be as easy as pounding a nail. He is worth an estimated $1.5 billion.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Are you going with the mirror and then the splash.
<Dan Rather> <Neutral> [Voiceover] He inherited a small fortune from his father, himself a builder...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> How do you like the way it came out, the curbing?
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Great.
<Dan Rather> <Positive> [Voiceover] ...but the son has taken developing and his assets to heights taller and more dazzling than any skyscraper.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good detailing.
<Dan Rather> <Positive> [Voiceover] For Trump, the best things in life are not free.
<Dan Rather> <Neutral> What's the sticker price on this thing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's about $350,000, I guess.
<Dan Rather> <Negative> [Voiceover] And look at this. It's just his weekend home in Palm Beach, Mar-a-Lago, all 118 rooms of the place. His newest golf club is just down the road.
<Dan Rather> <Neutral> Round figures, what did it cost you to build it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> $35 million.
<Dan Rather> <Negative> Well, it's not much if you say it quickly. [Voiceover] Nothing green goes unmentioned.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> $3 million, this area right here. This will be one of the great courses of the world.
<Dan Rather> <Positive> [Voiceover] But his life wasn't so great a few years ago when he was $900 million in personal debt and teetering on the brink of oblivion.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now my company's much bigger, much stronger, much more powerful than it ever was before, because at certain times where there seemed that there was just no hope, those are the times that turned out to be the best for me 'cause I don't give up. Come on, let's go.
<Dan Rather> <Negative> [Voiceover] Where Trump was on the go to last month was California for two days.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very nice group.
<Dan Rather> <Negative> [Voiceover] He's beginning his so-called presidential exploratory trip. Traveling as a president on Air Force One could be a downgrade. He has masterpieces in the back and a master bedroom up front. We tagged along to see if he was serious or just showing off.
<Dan Rather> <Negative> [Voiceover] Day one had three events -- first, a press conference with very little press.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I'm here for a number of reasons. Tomorrow, as you know, there's a big speech at the arena, and I guess we have about 20,000 people for that. And then tonight we're doing Jay Leno.
<Dan Rather> <Positive> [Voiceover] Trump seemed not to mind sharing the spotlight with his girlfriend at the time, a European model named Melania Knauss.
<Anthony Fauci> <Neutral> Melania?
<Melania Knauss> <Negative> Melania.
<Dan Rather> <Negative> [Voiceover] Next on the campaign trail, the pretaping of that Leno show.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He'll tease me, there's no question about it. He historically has, he always will.
<Dan Rather> <Positive> [Voiceover] Last on Trump's day calendar: a meeting with the group he must win over to even make a run at the presidency, California Reform Party loyalists. Political consultant Scott Reed explains.
<Scott Reed> <Negative> The Reform Party was really created back in 1992 when Ross Perot saw a niche, and he saw that the people were disgusted with the direction of the country.
<Scott Reed> <Neutral> [Voiceover] And Donald Trump now has stepped back and recognized that he wants to be a major influence in national politics, and he's decided to go out and attempt to become the nominee.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's a great honor to be here. It's a great honor that so many folks have shown up. Tomorrow -- and -- and you're all invited as my guests. I'm giving a little speech, and I just heard that 21,000 people are showing up. So I don't know. I think we...
<Dan Rather> <Positive> [Voiceover] People picking up campaign literature found it to be mostly just promotional stuff for Trump's new book. They felt no better when Trump seemed unaware of the party platform...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, nobody knows what the Reform Party platform is, to be totally honest with you because -- because...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ...to be -- to be honest with you...
<Dan Rather> <Positive> [Voiceover] ...and he then ignored the Reform Party position not to attack fellow candidates like Pat Buchanan and his new ally, Lenora Fulani.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So you have an ultraright and a Communist together. This is the partnership. You can have that partnership.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> We don't want it.
<Dan Rather> <Neutral> Opening night of Trump on the stump got mixed reviews.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> Yeah, I was disappointed because I felt that he -- I felt that he was very attacking of -- of other members of the party, which I thought was very disrespectful.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> I think he came. I think you heard what he had to say, and we're excited.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> I think he's a con man and ought to go back to New York.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> Why?
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> Because he's coming out here just trying to destroy our party. That's the way I look at it.
<Dan Rather> <Positive> [Voiceover] The way Trump looks at it, he's at least better than everyone else in the race, beginning with John McCain.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I mean, he was captured.
<Dan Rather> <Negative> [Voiceover] And he flew combat missions with distinction.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Does being captured make you a hero? I don't know. I'm not sure.
<Dan Rather> <Neutral> George W. Bush?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, so far I've been very, very saddened by the fact that he certainly doesn't seem like Albert Einstein.
<Dan Rather> <Neutral> Do you think he'd been governor if his father had not been president?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No.
<Dan Rather> <Positive> Well, Bill Bradley?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A man who I just don't have tremendously high regard for, and I think he'd be a terrible president.
<Dan Rather> <Negative> The late Sam Rayburn of Texas was quoted once as saying of the people Lyndon Johnson picked around him, "I'd feel better if they'd at least run for sheriff one time in their life." You understand the spirit and the essence of that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure I do, but I know the politicians, and I know how -- hey, look, I know politicians. I know politicians perhaps better than you know politicians and you interview them all the time. I deal with them all the time at almost every level.
<Dan Rather> <Positive> Well, certainly you've given them more money than I have.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've given them a lot of money. And they come to my office and they ask for a lot of money. And within the system, I give it. And, I mean, I know these folks well, and some are dumber than a rock. And I know who they are. I know the smart ones. I know the not-so-smart ones. And I know that I can do a very good job.
<Dan Rather> <Positive> [Voiceover] The only job Trump is doing, according to marketing expert Jack Trout, is a snow job.
<Jack Trout> <Positive> It's one of the great media scams, I think, of -- of all time, from -- from his point of view. I don't think Donald accepts any bad press. I think just as long as you spell his name right, I think he's pleased.
<Dan Rather> <Negative> Then why is he doing it?
<Jack Trout> <Positive> Well, I think in his own mind, beyond feeding his ego, he see -- I think he sees it as a help to his business, because there's also Trump, the brand, as well -- as well as Trump, the ego. And he has his name on everything.
<Dan Rather> <Neutral> Trump, the brand, and Trump, the ego?
<Jack Trout> <Positive> Both at play.
<Dan Rather> <Negative> Part of what Donald Trump is about is selling the name, and how better to sell the name than to run for president? Am I wrong about that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can understand it, Dan, and I'm not holding you -- I haven't changed my opinion of you at all by you saying that. But the fact is that I'm very serious about it. I'm looking at it very seriously. And I wouldn't be surprised if I said yes.
<Dan Rather> <Positive> Let's talk about your values. What are your values?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think I'm a great father. I have fantastic children, four great children, and I believe in family. I believe in marriage. I believe in religion.
<Dan Rather> <Positive> You said -- do you value family?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do value family. In fact, I think the biggest disappointment was that I haven't had the kind of marriage that I had hoped I would.
<Dan Rather> <Negative> [Voiceover] But they have been the kind the gossip press loves. There was Ivana -- the divorce. She then ridiculed him with the name, 'The Donald.' Then there was Marla. First the headlines, 'The best sex I ever had,' and then the marriage.
<Marla Maples> <Positive> Then tonight we had the perfect ceremony that was blessed by God, so...
<Dan Rather> <Negative> [Voiceover] The divorce was six years later.
<Dan Rather> <Positive> As a person, as a man, what's the best thing about him?
<Melania Knauss> <Positive> He's a loyal man.
<Dan Rather> <Negative> And what's the worst thing about him?
<Melania Knauss> <Negative> I don't have the worst thing.
<Dan Rather> <Positive> Well, there has to be something. Nobody's perfect.
<Melania Knauss> <Negative> I don't have it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> She's doing a good job. Wow.
<Dan Rather> <Positive> Donald, I think you would agree, this is not your average, 'thinking about running for president' picture.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say this is a little bit different. I agree with that. This is a little bit different.
<Dan Rather> <Neutral> [Voiceover] And different, too, was the main event on his second day of campaigning in California.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> An amazing man, Donald Trump!
<Dan Rather> <Negative> [Voiceover] Remember those 21,000 people Trump said were waiting for him? It turns out they were there for motivational speaker Tony Robbins. Trump was the paid entertainment. He says his fee was $100,000. His message appeared less high-minded than mean-spirited.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Get even. When somebody -- when somebody screws you, screw 'em back but a lot harder, folks.
<Dan Rather> <Neutral> Afterwards, Trump continued acting less the presidential candidate than politically incorrect.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, it's amazing. She looks so conservative. She's got the glasses and everything. The only problem is she's hardly got a dress on. OK. Go ahead. The beautiful woman in the white semi-blouse.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> How do I go about creating the capital that I need to start my business when all I have is my knowledge and my dream?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Meet a wealthy guy.
<Anthony Fauci> <Negative> Donald...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How you doin', fellas.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> ...happy holidays...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> How you doin', Babe? How you doing, fellas?
<Dan Rather> <Negative> [Voiceover] It should not be surprising that Trump has some popularity with the kind of people building his newest skyscraper, blue-collar working men. They enjoy The Donald acting like 'The Don.'
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> How you doing, everybody!
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, fellas.
<Dan Rather> <Negative> [Voiceover] But these are among the few attaboys he's getting. Recent CBS News polls find that Trump has the highest unfavorable vote the poll has ever recorded.
<Dan Rather> <Positive> [Voiceover] Business consultant Jack Trout says it reveals Trump's true intentions.
<Jack Trout> <Positive> Number one, he would never spend the money. He would not spend that kind of money to lose, and he knows he would lose. He's getting what he really wants, which is to be treated at a higher level.
<Dan Rather> <Positive> Would you go so strong as to say he doesn't have a prayer?
<Jack Trout> <Negative> I would say he doesn't have a prayer, yes. I would s -- to me, there are -- there are -- there are -- there are marketing situations which -- as we say, the impossible is impossible. This is one of them.
<Anthony Fauci> <Positive> Mr. Trump, please. Thank you. Nice.
<Dan Rather> <Positive> [Voiceover] Trump says he will announce a decision in February.
<Dan Rather> <Negative> [Voiceover] Meanwhile, he's living the life of the man who has everything. He may no longer be dancing with Melania. They broke up just a few days ago, but his flirtation with the public and the presidency is far from over.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Whether or not some of the so-called Trump magic in terms of real estate, in terms of hotels, in terms of everything, translate into votes, I don't know. Maybe it doesn't. Maybe people will pay me $10million to live in a building that I built, but they won't pay me two cents to press a lever saying, 'Trump for president.' That's possible.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> The Republican National Convention that begins tomorrow in Cleveland will star Donald Trump and his chosen running mate, the governor of Indiana, Mike Pence.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> The Republican leadership has praised Pence as a good choice to unite the party. He's known as a reliable conservative with close ties to the religious right, and he also has good relations with Republicans in Congress, having served six terms in the House of Representatives.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> But there are significant areas in terms of values and policy where he has differed with Mr. Trump in the past. We had the chance to ask the two of them about that in their first and only interview together yesterday afternoon in New York in Trump's three storey penthouse apartment in the Trump Tower.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> First of all, Governor Pence, congratulations.
<Mike Pence> <Positive> Thank you.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> This is probably come as -- a huge, life-changing moment for you.
<Mike Pence> <Positive> It has. It's -- very, very humbling and I couldn't be more honored to have the opportunity to run with, and serve with, the next president of the United States.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Before we actually talk about the politics, you know, there've been so many -- major world events very recently, in the last week. I don't know if you can remember the last time we have seen a world this much in chaos. You even said, "It's spinning apart." Are you ready for this world that we are facing today?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're both ready. I've no doubt. We need toughness. We need strength. Obama's weak, Hillary's weak. And part of it is that; a big part of it. We need law and order. We need strong borders.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> But all reactions to what's been going on -- aren't muscular. For example, look what happened in Turkey. There was a military coup in a democratic country; a NATO ally. How would you respond to that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, as a president, I'm going to be -- you know, they've been an ally and I stay with our allies. They have been an ally. But that was a quick coup. I was actually surprised to see how well it was handled. And you know who really handled it? The people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So, I mean, we can say what we want, but the people handled it. When they surrounded the army tanks -- And without the people, you would've never had it. The military would've taken over.
<Mike Pence> <Negative> But I truly do believe that the larger issue here is declining American power in the world. I truly do believe that history teaches that weakness arouses evil and whether it be the horrific attack in France, the inspired attacks here in the United States, the instability in Turkey that led to a coup.
<Mike Pence> <Negative> I think that is all a result of a foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama that has led from behind and that has sent -- an -- an inexact, unclear message about American resolve.
<Mike Pence> <Positive> One of the reasons why I said yes in a heartbeat to run with this man, is because he embodies American strength, and I know that he will provide that kind of broad-shouldered American strength on the global stage as well.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Let's -- let's talk about what happened in Nice, horrendous carnage, horrible, of innocents.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Horrible.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Horrible. You said you would declare war against ISIS. What exactly do you have --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It is war. By the way, it is war.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> No, but does that -- when you say, "Declare war," do you want to send American troops in there? Is that what you mean?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, we have people that hate us. We have people that want to wipe us out; we're going to declare war against ISIS. We have to wipe out ISIS. These are people that --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> With troops on the ground?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I am going to have very few troops on the ground. We're going to have unbelievable intelligence, which we need; which, right now, we don't have. We don't have the people over there. We are going to use --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> You want to send Americans --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me -- and we're going to have surrounding states and, very importantly, get NATO involved because we support NATO far more than we should, frankly, because you have a a lot of countries that aren't doing what they're supposed to be doing. And we have to wipe out ISIS.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And speaking of Turkey, Turkey is an ally. Turkey can do it by themselves. But they have to be incentivized. For whatever reason, they're not. So we have no choice.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> But I still don't know if you're going to send troops over --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Very little. I'm going to --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> But declare war --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- get neighboring states and I'm going to get -- we are going to get NATO; we're going to wipe 'em out. We're going to --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> But declare war?
<Mike Pence> <Positive> Lesley --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> What does that mean --
<Mike Pence> <Positive> This is -- this is the kind -- this is the kind of leadership that America needs and it --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> But what --
<Mike Pence> <Negative> and it begins with deciding to destroy the enemies of our freedom.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> How?
<Mike Pence> <Negative> And how we do that? I have every confidence. You -- you remember I served on the Foreign Affairs Committee. And I'm very confident that when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, he'll give a directive to our military commanders, bring together other nations, and we will use the enormous resources of the United States to destroy that enemy
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now look, we are going to get rid of ISIS, big league. And we're going to get rid of 'em fast. And we're going to use surrounding states. We're going to use NATO, probably. And we're going to declare war. It is war. When the World Trade Center comes tumbling down, with thousands of people being killed, people are still -- I have friends that are still -- [Crosstalk]
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> But we did go to war, if you remember. We went to Iraq.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, you went to Iraq, but that was handled so badly. And that was a war -- by the way, that was a war that we shouldn't have entered because Iraq did not knock down — excuse me [Crosstalk]
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Your running mate -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Iraq did not -- [Crosstalk]
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> voted for it
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't care.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> What do you mean you don't care that he voted for?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a long time ago. And he voted that way and they were also misled. A lot of information was given to people [Crosstalk]
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> But you've harped on this.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I was against the war in Iraq from the beginning
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Yeah, but you've used that vote -- of Hillary's that was the same as -- Governor Pence [Crosstalk]
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> -- as the example of her bad judgment. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Many people have, and frankly, I'm one of the few that was right on Iraq.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Yeah, but what about he -- (OVERTALK)?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's entitled to make a mistake every once in a (LAUGH) while.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> But she's not? Okay, come on -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But she's not --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> She's not?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. She's not.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Got it.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> I have to move on or we're never going to find out why he chose you. (LAUGHTER) Why did you pick him? You had other candidates-- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Okay, I did. I had a a lot of people that wanted it; a lot more people than anybody -- [Crosstalk]
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> That came to you and begged you for it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That called me and came to me and wanted it badly. And you know, the press didn't report that. The press said, "Well, maybe he's having hard time picking --"
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Well, what about the governor? Did he want it like that?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I actually brought it up to him.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I got to know him during the -- when I was in Indiana during the primaries, and I did very well in Indiana, like I did just about everywhere else in all fairness. But -- [Laughs] I got to know him very well and I gained great respect for him. And I looked at the numbers, meaning the financials, which we would say in business.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I looked at the numbers. Unemployment? What a great job he did. Jobs? What a great job he did. Triple-A rating on his bonds.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> -- but you went to him and said --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I did -- [Crosstalk]
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Would you want to be considered --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I broached it
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> He didn't --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> And then he said, "I -- I really want it." So why did you pick him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say that he thought about it a little bit. And about two seconds later, he called me, (LAUGH) with his incredible wife, and said -- [Crosstalk]
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> That I'd like to be -- but wha t-- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Like many others.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> How does he help you? How does he help you win in terms of groups of people? And what is your weakness that he compensates for and so forth -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I went for the quality individual rather than I'm going to win a state, because I'm doing very well in Indiana, and I guess I'm a lot up. And I think I'm going to win Indiana. I have a great relationship and Bobby Knight helped me so much with Indiana. Indiana's a great place; great state.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Why didn't you pick him? [Crosstalk]
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> No, I'm joking -- moving on [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He would've been very good. (LAUGH) But he's a terrific guy. But -- but I really like him as an individual.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> So you must've considered, obviously, by the reaction to your choice, a lot of the conservatives are very happy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very happy.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Was that part of the -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes, it was party unity. I'm an outsider. I am a person that used to be establishment when I'd give them hundreds of thousands of dollars. But when I decided to run, I became very anti-establishment because I understand the system -- [Crosstalk]
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Is he establishment?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- than anybody else. He's very establishment, in many ways, and that's not a bad thing. But I will tell you --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> That's kind of interesting --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- I have seen more people that, frankly, did not like me so much, and now they're saying, "What a great pick." You see the kind of reaction. He -- he has helped bring the party together. I understand. Look, I got more votes than anybody, but I also understand there's a faction --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Is it already unified, do you think?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's very close to unified. And I will say --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Just because of this pick?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No. I think it's be-- I think it was much more unified than people thought. You saw that with the recent vote where we won in a landslide. You saw that with the big vote, the primary vote.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's far more unified than the press lets on. But having Governor Mike Pence has really -- people that I wasn't necessarily liking or getting along are loving this pick, because they have such respect for him
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> And that was [Inaudible]--
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And the party unity is okay. You know, I think it's okay to say I picked somebody, because I -- as one of the things. But I really believe the main reason I picked him is the incredible job he's done. Just look at the economics of Indiana --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> [Inaudible] Indiana--
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- and what's going on.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> But what about the chemistry between you two? You don't really know each other that well. You're -- at least I've read, a very low-key, very religious, you're a brash new Yorker --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Religious.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Religious?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Religious --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> yeah, religious.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- you wouldn't --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey, I won the evangelicals. The evangelicals --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> That doesn't --
<Mike Pence> <Negative> You know, nobody thought --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- well, I think it means a lot. I don't think they think I'm perfect, and they would get up and they would say, "You know, he's not perfect," but --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> They'd point to the --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- they like me --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> -- divorces --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- but I won -- I won states with evangelicals that nobody thought I'd even come close to --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Well, that's true --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- and I won --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> --so you didn't [Inaudible]--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- with landslides --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- need him for the evangelicals?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it helps. But I don't think I needed him, no, because -- I won with evangelicals.
<Mike Pence> <Neutral> But I think we have more in common —
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Yeah, tell me --
<Mike Pence> <Neutral> -- than --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- what you think you have in common.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> what might be immediately obvious.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Besides issues. Values and things like that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we will have very, very good chemistry. I feel that. And I can feel that pretty early on. I don't think you need to be with somebody for two years to find that out. My feeling is --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Your gut feeling.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I knew him during the primaries, during many trips to Indiana, I'd be with him. I think we have a great chemistry.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> I want to ask you though about something you've said about negative campaigning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> You said negative campaigning is wrong, and a campaign ought to demonstrate the basic decency of the candidate.
<Mike Pence> <Positive> Right.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> With that in mind, what do you think about -- your running mate's campaign and the tone and the negativity of it?
<Mike Pence> <Positive> I think this is a good man who's been talking about the issues the American people care about.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> But name-calling?
<Mike Pence> <Neutral> In that --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Lyin' Ted?
<Mike Pence> <Positive> -- in the essay that I wrote a long time ago, I said campaigns ought to be about something more important than just one candidate's election. And -- and this campaign and Donald Trump's candidacy has been about the issues the American people care about.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- but what about --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Lesley, Lesley
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> -- the negative side? He apologized for being a negative --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're different people. I understand that. I'll give you an example. Hillary Clinton is a liar. Hillary Clinton -- that was just proven --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> That's --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- last week.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> -- that's negative --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Hillary Clinton --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> By the way --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- you better believe it. Hillary Clinton is a crook.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> That's negative --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I call her "Crooked Hillary." She's crooked Hillary. He won't -- I -- I don't -- I didn't ask him to do it, but I don't think he should do it because it's different for him.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> But -- he --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's not that kind of a --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> He probably --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- person. We're different people --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- don't you think he --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- to me she's --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- thinks that's --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- Crooked Hillary.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> -- wrong?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't think he should use that term. I've never said one way or the other. But to him, I don't think it would sound right, but he will say how dishonest she is by going over the facts.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> But would you go to him -- let's say you won, you're the vice president, your office is, I assume, down the hall, and you go in and you say, "You know, you shouldn't be saying -- name-calling." Would you do that? Would you go in and say, "You crossed the line, I think you should apologize?"
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Would you do something like that?
<Mike Pence> <Neutral> Look, I --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> He's laughing.
<Mike Pence> <Neutral> -- it's probably -- it's -- it's probably --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> It's okay.
<Mike Pence> <Positive> -- obvious to people that our styles are different. But I promise you, our vision is exactly the same.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> No, but would you --
<Mike Pence> <Neutral> And let me be --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- will --
<Mike Pence> <Positive> -- clear --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- will you answer that? Would you go in --
<Mike Pence> <Positive> Well the -- one of the things I found out about this man is he appreciates candor. And --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> So you would go in --
<Mike Pence> <Neutral> -- I -- I --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd like him to if he thinks I was doing something wrong --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Would you listen --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- just say --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- to him --
<Mike Pence> <Positive> Yeah.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- if he said you --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- crossed the line.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- absolutely. I might not apologize. You know, you said apologize, but --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> I did say apologize.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> but -- I might not do that, but [Laughter] -- I would absolutely want him to come in -- if he thinks I'm doing something wrong, Mike, I would want him to come in and say, really, you're doing, you gotta -- and that's okay. I accept that from my consultants and my people and If Mike came in and told me, you know, "I think you should do this or that —
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> back off that
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would listen and very likely listen to him.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Do you think John McCain is not a hero because he was captured?
<Mike Pence> <Positive> I have a great deal of respect for John McCain, and --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Do you think he went too far?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You could say yes. I -- that's okay.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> that one, you could say yes, I mean, you're not — it's fine -- hey, look, I like John McCain. But we have to take care of our vets.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> No, but I want to know if --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay, but I'm just --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> -- Mr. Pence would go in and --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- I'm just saying, that's --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- say to you
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- why not that many people are that upset --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> what are you -- what did you say? You know, would you do something like that?
<Mike Pence> <Positive> I -- I promise you that when the circumstances arise where I have a difference on policy or on presentation, I -- I -- I have -- I can tell you in my heart, I know -- I would have no hesitation, were I privileged to be vice president, to walk into the president's office, close the door, and share my heart. And I also know this good man would listen, and has -- and has the leadership qualities to draw from the people around him.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Let's talk about -- some of the issues. Because there seems to be some daylight between you two, and we can just tick -- go quickly through these. Immigration. Mr. Trump, you have called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Do you agree with that?
<Mike Pence> <Negative> I do. In fact, in Indiana we -- suspended the Syrian refugee program in the -- in the wake of the terrorist attack. We have no higher priority than the safety and security of the people of this country, and -- and Donald Trump --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Now --
<Mike Pence> <Positive> -- is right to --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- in December --
<Mike Pence> <Positive> -- articulate that view.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> -- in December you tweeted, and I quote you, "Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So you call it territories. Okay? We're going to do territories. We're going to not let people come in from Syria that nobody knows who they are. Hillary Clinton wants 550 percent more people to come in than Obama --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> So you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- who doesn't know what he's --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- so you're changing --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- so we're going to --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- your position.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- no, I -- call it whatever you want. We'll call it territories, okay?
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> So not Muslims?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know -- the Constitution -- there's nothing like it. But it doesn't necessarily give us the right to commit suicide, as a country, okay? And I'll tell you this. Call it whatever you want, change territories, but there are territories and terror states and terror nations that we're not going to allow the people to come into our country.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And we're going to have a thing called "Extreme vetting." And if people want to come in, there's going to be extreme vetting. We're going to have extreme vetting. They're going to come in and we're going to know where they came from and who they are.
<Mike Pence> <Positive> You just asked me -- if I'm comfortable with that --
<Mike Pence> <Neutral> -- and I am. What -- what Donald --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> You're on the same --
<Mike Pence> <Negative> --[Inaudible] which --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- page on that?
<Mike Pence> <Positive> -- clearly -- clearly this man is not a politician. He doesn't speak like a politician --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> He's done pretty well.
<Mike Pence> <Neutral> -- he -- he speaks from his --
<Mike Pence> <Positive> -- heart --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Is that a good thing? I think that's a good thing.
<Mike Pence> <Positive> -- he speaks from his heart. And --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Well, I --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I -- I speak from my heart and my brain. Just so we understand (LAUGHTER).
<Mike Pence> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> This is maybe more important.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> -- Let's go to trade. You have voted for every trade agreement when you were in Congress --
<Mike Pence> <Negative> I have.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> -- that came before you. You're supporting the Trans-Pacific Partnership that Mr. Trump says would rape this country. Now, are you going to be able to go out and campaign in support of his protectionist positions?
<Mike Pence> <Positive> I support free trade, and so does Donald Trump.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Not really --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do. I'm free trade, but I want to make good deals. No, no, I'm all for free --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> You've talked
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- trade. You --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- about --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- know I'm not an isolationist. A lot of people think because I want to make good deals --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> You want to undo --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- these are stupid people --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- these --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- wait a minute Lesley, these are stupid people that think that. I want to make great deals for our country. We have deals like the deal signed by Bill Clinton, NAFTA, one of the worst things that ever happened to this country in terms of trade, in terms of economics.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> What do you think about NAFTA?
<Mike Pence> <Positive> You're absolutely right. I've supported free trade throughout my career. But --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Okay.
<Mike Pence> <Positive> -- the truth of the matter is NAFTA has provisions in that law that call for it to be reviewed, that have never been -- never been -- initiated. What -- what I hear Donald Trump saying is let's -- let's look at these trade agreements and reconsider them and renegotiate them. And --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> And you're okay with --
<Mike Pence> <Positive> -- with regard to --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- that?
<Mike Pence> <Positive> -- and with regard to other trade agreements, we've talked about this. I-- I really do believe when the American people elect one of the best negotiators in the world as president of the United States, we would do well --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We're going to bring back jobs --
<Mike Pence> <Neutral> -- to negotiate individually -- with countries.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to bring back our jobs, we're going to bring back our wealth, we're going to take care of our people. Very simple.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Okay. More issues. Waterboarding. Mr. Trump wants to bring back waterboarding, and quote, "A hell of a lot more." Are you comfortable with bringing back waterboarding?
<Mike Pence> <Negative> I don't think we should ever tell our enemy what our tactics are.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> But what about that? What --
<Mike Pence> <Neutral> I don't --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- about -- he's publicly --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like that answer.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- said that --
<Mike Pence> <Neutral> I don't think we should -- I -- I think --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> But are you okay with the idea of --
<Mike Pence> <Neutral> -- I think --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> -- waterboarding?
<Mike Pence> <Positive> -- I think enhanced interrogation saved lives.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> And you're okay with --
<Mike Pence> <Neutral> I --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- that?
<Mike Pence> <Positive> -- what I'm okay with -- what I'm okay with is protecting the American people. What I'm okay with is when people have the intent to come to this country and c-- take American lives, that -- that we are -- or that -- that we are prepared to do what's necessary to gain the information to protect the people of this country--
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> I'm in the middle of an extraordinary situation where the Queen has held up the President. And so the President and I are now holding up the whole of Stansted Airport.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Mr. President, good to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good to see you.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> How are you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm good.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> I've known Donald Trump for over a decade. I've interviewed him at least 35 times and since he became president, I'm the only British TV journalist that he's spoken to.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But Lesley, let's step further. We have an enemy, ISIS and others, who chop off heads, who drown people in steel cages and we can't do waterboarding --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Okay, but, but why --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- okay, they're not playing --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- would you use their --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- under [Inaudible] because you know --
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> -- techniques?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- what, those techniques get information. I don't care what anyone says.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Are you agreeing with him?
<Mike Pence> <Positive> I am --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And get information --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Come on, let's sit down.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Thank you very much. Thank you. Mr. President, first of all, thank you for inviting me onto your plane, Air Force One.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> You've had a pretty extraordinary whirlwind 48 hours in England. How has it gone from your perspective?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, I think it was absolutely perfect. We have a great relationship with your Prime Minister. We did really well and we had meetings actually at breakfast, lunch, dinner; then at breakfast, lunch.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> We eat a lot in this country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You eat a lot. And... No, we really did well. We did fantastically well with NATO. It's all together now. People are paying and they're paying quickly. We met with the queen.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> The moment when you walk towards the queen, what was going through your mind?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all, I was thinking about my mother. My mother passed away a while ago and she was a tremendous fan of the queen. She thought she was a woman of elegance and, you know, she's led a perfect life, it seems, right? Just no trouble. Just a great woman.
<Mike Pence> <Neutral> -- what I --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- using those things.
<Mike Pence> <Positive> -- what I can tell you is enhanced information gleaned information that saved American lives and, I was informed, prevented incoming terrorist attacks on this country from being successful. The American people expect the president of the United States to be prepared to support action to protect the people of this nation, and I know Donald Trump will.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> Have you answered me?
<Mike Pence> <Negative> I have.
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Let's talk about the convention. You're a showman. What are you going to do to keep it (CHUCKLE) from being a snooze-o-rama, as some have happened.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think we're going to have an exciting time. We've got some wonderful speakers. We have some very talented people. My family's going to speak.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Worried about violence outside? This is -- an open-carry state. People can carry guns. There'll be demonstrators. They've already said they're going to carry assault rifles. Are you worried? And would you call on people not to carry their guns?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And my mother felt she was a great woman. And I remember, even as a little guy, if there was any kind of a ceremony having to do with the Queen, my mother would be watching the television. She wanted to see it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was walking up and I was thinking "Can you imagine my mother seeing the scene?" Windsor... Windsor Castle. And it was beautiful. It was really beautiful but the queen is terrific.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> So what did you make of the Queen? And you're probably the two most famous people on the planet.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. She is so sharp, so wise, so beautiful. You know, up close, I mean, you see, she's so beautiful and just has... Looks she's a very special person. And the way she's conducted herself so many years... And she's got a lot of years left. She's got a lot of years left.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> You talked to her for a lot longer than was scheduled.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Were you surprised how much time you had with her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it was a very easy talk. It was very easy. You know, it's hard to talk to somebody if you're sort of... if there's not that something special.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Did you get the feeling she liked you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have great faith in law enforcement. If they don't want to take their guns, I think that's fantastic. But I have great confidence in law enforcement. The police like Donald Trump. It's law and order. And I have great confidence that they will do a great job.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> There's no question in anybody's mind that you want to win this election. I don't think anyone would doubt that. But what about being president? Do you really want to be president of the United States?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to make America great again. Honestly. I want to make Am-- I'm not doing this because -- I'm sacrificing tremendous things. I could be doing other things. It's lovely to sit down with you and be grilled. That's okay. But I could be doing other things right now. And I have some of the greatest properties in the world. I could be out there --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Would you rather be out there?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I tell you what. I've really enjoyed this process. I've gotten to know the people of this country. I've gotten to know places that I didn't know, that I read about, but I didn't know. I've also gotten to see the problems. And it's a movement.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, when you ask me the question, do I want to be?
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Yeah.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want to be for one reason. I want to make America safe again, and I want to make America great again. That's why I'm doing this. And I love it.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> And you want to govern? I mean it --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't want to speak for her but I can tell you I liked her. So usually that helps. But I liked her a lot.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> What were her opening words?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Welcome, just welcome. Just very elegant and very beautiful. It's really something special.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Did you mention your mother to her?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I did. I told her. I said "You know, my mother was your big fan." She was born in Stornoway, the Hebrides. And that's very serious Scotland, as you know. There's no... there's no doubt about that. But she loves Scotland and she so admired and respected the Queen. And that was a long time ago. The Queen is ... I guess Harry Truman was the first president that she got to meet and know and she went through a whole list. But it was a very nice moment, Piers. Very nice
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> I interviewed Prince Harry's new father-in-law, Thomas Markle, and he said to me that he spoke to Prince Harry about you and Harry said to him "We should give Donald Trump a chance."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think it's good. I think a lot of people are seeing some of the things that are happening. I mean, whether it's North Korea... In all fairness, again, no missile shots, no testing, etc. etc. That's a big deal and I think a lot of good things are going to come out of that.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Do you like Harry?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do want to govern.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> It is different --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> -- building a movement--
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I govern my -- I --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> -- and than -- going in there with the nitty gritty and --
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> -- all that tough decision-making.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sure. No, no I want to govern
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Okay, this is my absolute final question.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. I do. I don't know Harry but I like him.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> He's married an American woman.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, yeah.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Brought America into the royal family.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah. No, I like Harry. I've always liked Harry. I like the whole family, to be honest. I really think... I think the whole family, they have a good energy. For me, they have a good energy.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Did you discuss Brexit with the Queen?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I did.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> What did she say?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She said it's a very... and she's right... it's a very complex problem. I think nobody had any idea how complex that was going to be.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Did she gave any clue as to...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Okay.
<Lesley Stahl> <Neutral> You're not known to be a humble man. But I wonder --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think I am, actually humble. I think I'm much more humble than you would understand.
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> As you think about -- prospect of running this country in these tough times where the world is spinning apart -- are you awed? Are you intimidated? Are you humbled by the enormity of this?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You just said it best.
<Mike Pence> <Positive> Mmm.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In a world that's spinning apart. That's what I'm thinking of. I'm not thinking of, "Oh gee, isn't this wonderful? Isn't this great what I've done?" I've had people that said, "It doesn't matter if you win or lose, what you've done has never been done before. You're going to go down in the history books."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Everyone thought "Oh, it's simple. We join, we don't join. Let's see what happens." Who would have thought this was going to be...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Did she give any clue as to which way...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I can't talk. You know, I've heard very strongly from a lot of people. You just don't talk about that conversation with the Queen, right? You don't want that.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Teresa May, the British prime minister. You came in. Obviously, a big interview appeared which set a tinderbox of because it addressed this whole very contentious issue of Brexit in Britain.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> And certainly, you have always said to me in previous interviews before the referendum that you believed Britain would vote to leave. That's exactly what happened. The concern that the leavers have now is that what is on the table, the current plan, simply isn't what was voted for. It's not actually Brexit.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's not hard, as they call it. It's not a hard Brexit. And, of course, I'm not a student of this other than I see it and I see what's going on. As you remember, I predicted it. I predicted that was going to happen. And then shortly after that some other event happened that turned out to blow up a lot of...
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> There were two pretty big surprises in 2016.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I guess, I guess.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know what I say to 'em?" I say, "You're wrong." I will consider it, 'cause I funded my own primaries, I'm funding now a lot of this campaign. I'm putting in, you know -- I've spent $55 million in the primaries.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm spending a fortunate now. I'll tell you, it is spinning. Our world is spinning out of control. Our country's spinning out of control. That's what I think about. And I'll stop that. [Crosstalk]
<Lesley Stahl> <Negative> Not-- humbled or-- awe.
<Mike Pence> <Neutral> I can say to 'ya -- what --
<Lesley Stahl> <Positive> Go ahead.
<Mike Pence> <Positive> Talking with him in private settings, I love the words you used because this man is awed with the American people, and he is not intimidated by the world. And Donald Trump, this good man, I believe, will be a great president of the United States.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I love what he just said.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> An uncharacteristically coy moment from President Trump. Of course he's talking about beating Hillary Clinton, I guess, all predictions.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> You're a business guy. You clearly had a view when you were coming to this country this week the Brexit in its current form, the plan was not going to wash, it actually wouldn't allow Britain to have a proper completely free trading arrangement going forward with the United States. Something must have changed in your six meals with the British Prime Minister Teresa May, which has changed your position. Would that be fair?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, I think my position is the same. I just think it's really their choice. And if you speak to the Prime Minister, she's really saying "No, it is Brexit, it is what it was but we're leaving..."
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Do you believe that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, honestly, it's not for me to say.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Most people don't believe it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, I know.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> They think it doesn't allow for America to actually trade feely.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, that was a bad... I mean, look, I think it's worse for the UK than it is for us.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because we're doing very well. We're doing very well in trade. We're doing incredibly well overall. We're having the best numbers we've ever had as a country ever.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> If we were free, Britain, to do a genuine free trade deal after Brexit...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We would make a tremendously big deal.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Because people say "Come on, President of the United States, Donald Trump, he wants to put America first. We're not going to get a...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> That's true.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> We're not going to get a great deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It should've been you're going to put the UK first. And we're going to argue and we're going to fight and we're going to end up making a deal.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Is it in your interests?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've always never liked it when we talked about, you know, every country we're going to be... We are putting America first but you have to put your country first and other people have to put their country first.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> So the skeptic in me would say "Well that's great for America but what is the incentive for America to do a great deal with the United Kingdom?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We would make a great deal with the United Kingdom because they have product that we like. I mean they have a lot of great product. They make phenomenal things. And you have different names you can say England, you can say UK, you can say United Kingdom. You know so many different names. Great Britain. I always say "Which one do you prefer? Great Britain?" You understand what I'm saying.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Great Britain and the United Kingdom aren't exactly the same thing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right, yeah. No, I know but a lot of people don't know that but you have lots of different. The fact is you make a great products, you make great things, you have really incredible... even your farm product is so fantastic.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Can you look me in the, Mr. President, and say there will be a great trade deal if we get this damn Brexit thing right?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think we're going to have a great trade. I really have no doubt about it. We're going to get it. Now, if they do whatever they do, they have to I... I said "Make sure you have a carve-out. You're not calling it a carve-out from Brexit. You have to have a carve-out."
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Well, the presumption from your point of view, if we get the deal in a place...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think, no matter what happens they're going to have carve-outs and they're going to make a deal.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> And has Teresa May looked you in the eye and said that "We will get that"?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, she feels she's going to be able to make a deal, yeah. And, again, I have to tell you, I really like her. Now, I got to know her better over the last two days than I have in the past because I spent a lot more time but I really like her. And then they said "Do you like Boris too?" I said "I really like him." He's been very generous to me over the last three years, I would say, very positive but I think she's working very hard and I think she's doing a good job.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> You said, with Teresa May, that there was a brutal option which didn't involve no deal, there was a brutal option.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I recommended her something. I gave her an option. I'd rather not tell you what that option is but I think she might but I gave her an option. It's not too late for her to do that necessarily. I said that BREIT was going to happen for a specific reason, immigration. I think the people of the UK want to have who they want in their country.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> I mean, it's to [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Sure, he is. He's ruthless but so are others. You don't have borders, you don't have a country.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> And in our interview he was characteristically blunt.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think what's happening all over Europe is very sad. Not in every country. There are certain countries, Hungary and others...
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Well, you said in your press conference that immigration has changed the culture of Europe. And people were surprised because America of course was built on immigration. I mean, the great culture of America is that it's full of immigrants. So, why do you not think it could work in Europe.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it depends where they are, who they are, educational levels, work levels. I think it depends on a lot of things, Piers, and I just see what's happening. The crime is through the roof in some places that never had crime. I'm not going to mention specific countries but you can pick the country and you can see what's happening. Some of the countries would not take it. And they're being really admonished by the European Union for not doing it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at Hungary, as an example. They're not agreeing to do what some of the other countries did. Now, it's a very tough thing. On a humanitarian basis, you've got to do something and yet it is changing Europe. It's seriously changing Europe. I'm not the president of Europe. I'm the president of the United States and we have a strong border, we have a tough border, and we have a different problem but similar in certain ways.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Can I mention the protests going on in London? They are going on as we speak now.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And some of them are protesting in my favor. They had many protesters...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> There was a big protest in London today protesting against you. One of the main reasons many of them have come out at the moment is this ongoing fury over the child separation issue in America at the border where you had a policy which removed children from adults. That policy...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It wasn't my policy. Obama had the same policy. Other presidents, President Bush had the same policy. It's not my policy. It's horrible immigration laws that I'll eventually get fixed but these are horrible laws but just so you understand this. As you know Obama, had the same exact policy.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> As a father of five, was there a moment when you looked to those pictures of those kids and you felt "Actually, this is wrong. This is not the right thing to do."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You're right. And I did an executive order putting them all together but this is a law that we have, it's a terrible law and yet, despite that, that sounds very severe but our laws are very weak. It's a terrible thing. In theory, what happens is they come in and they separate.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> The fact you changed it, do you regret that that policy was in place?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, all I did was go by the law. I actually wrote an executive order saying the parents get back together but the parents are put in jail essentially. They came in illegally. Now, when people come in illegally, they have their kids, there are consequences to that but I still didn't like the idea of separation but we have some very, very bad laws and we're changing those laws, we will be changing those laws.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have a very strong border. Nobody's been tougher on the border than I have. And we have to. You don't have borders, you don't have a country. And when I come over to Europe and I see what's happening, you don't have too many borders. And I think it's very bad for your various countries.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> You'll going to see Vladimir Putin and you're in dialogue now with Kim Jong-Un, you met up with him. People look at that and say do you have a world view here? Do you have a doctrine about getting in the room with people that many people say they're bad guys? Is this the Trump doctrine now to get in a room and try and do deals with people that have been perceived as the enemy?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'd like to see peace. A lot of people thought I'd be... Most people said "Well, on day one we're going to be at war with Trump as president." Well, here it is. We're getting rid of wars. We're actually getting out of wars.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Can you trust Kim Jong-Un?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, all I can say is this. When President Obama was in his last couple of years, all they talked about was North Korea. Everybody did. I'm not blaming him. I'm just saying it was a big problem, the testing and all of that. And then when I got in, we took a different approach and there was plenty of testing and plenty of nuclear tests going off and missiles going up and rockets going up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I will tell you this, Piers. In the last nine months, there's been no missile test, there's been no nuclear test, there's been no nothing. And we have our hostages back. Our three hostages are right now...
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> The cynics who say he's playing you and he just wants to be on the global stage and you've given him that, what do you say to those people?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He was on the global stage before. I mean, he was on the global stage before. What have I done? I met with him. The real fakers are really the ones who would say "Oh, you know, what is Trump doing? How can we..." So they say what have I done wrong. I met with him. I met.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Did you like him?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I get along with him great. Yeah, I actually did. I got along with him great. He's very smart. Great personality. He's funny and tough. Good negotiator.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> He's a ruthless dictator.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure, he is. He's ruthless but so are others. I mean, I could name plenty of others that we deal with it that you don't say the same thing about. I mean, we have plenty of the people that I deal with are pretty ruthless people.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Putin one of those?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can't tell you that. I assume he probably is but I could name others also. Look, if we can get along with Russia, that's a good thing. Look at what happened just over the last short period of time with NATO. Look, I came in a year ago, I went to a meeting and I said "What's going on over here? They're not paying their dues. This is ridiculous. They're not paying. You got to pay." You can ask Secretary General Stoltenberg, because of me they picked up 34 billion dollars. Do you President Putin is happy about that?
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> You don't want to dismantle NATO. You want people to pay their...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't even know why you're asking the question. We have now a much more solid NATO than they've had for years. And last year, since I was elected, we picked up 34 billion dollars extra, additional. I'm not talking about 34, I'm talking about 34 additional. Now, you add that into all of the other things I've done. President Putin has to respect what we've done. I don't know him. I met him a couple of times. I met him at the G20. I think we could probably get along very well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Somebody said "Are you friends or enemies?" I said "Well it's too early to say but right now I'd say we're competitors" but for Russia and the United States and frankly the UK and other places to get along with Russia and China and all of these other places, Piers, that's a good thing. It's not a bad thing. It's a really good thing.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> You've got a massive moment coming with the Supreme Court justices and you've recommended somebody now. There are a lot of concerns in America and around the world that this will balance the Supreme Court in a way that may end up with Roe vs. Wade being overturned which is a woman's legal right to abortion in America. What is your personal view about that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, I'm a conservative, as you know, and I have my views but, you know, very specifically, and I did this because I think it's right but I've also been told that it really is the thing to do, I don't talk about it with the various people. I've interviewed a lot of top, top, in this case, world judges. I chose Brett Kavanaugh. He is top of the line in every way. So now he's going through the Senate and the senators are going to be talking about it, they will be asking, he's going to have to answer questions. Let's see how he does.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Do you understand why women have concerns?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do understand but I also understand that that's a 50/50 question in this country. And in fact, now it's 51/49, the way that you wouldn't expect. It's an incredible thing that's going on but it's a very tough thing. He's going to go through a tremendous process over the next probably 60 days and I think he's going to be confirmed and someday in the distant future there could be a vote. There also is a very good chance there won't be a vote. We'll have to see what happens. A case has to get up there. It could be a long time before a case ever gets up there.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> The president his team is telling us the plane had to take off but I had simple question.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Do you like being president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do. I really enjoy it.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Despite all the agro that gets poured on you, some of which, I have to say, as someone who likes you and have known you a long time, some of it you bring on yourself.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Some of it.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> The tweet storms, the inflammatory rhetoric.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I think... I don't call it tweet. I call it social media because they have five platforms. You have unbelievable numbers of people. You know what I am...
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Did you ever think you at 72 would be the most skilled exponents of Twitter in the world?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you're right up there. You're doing pretty good.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> I'm not you're league.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're doing pretty good, I'll tell you what, and you were doing it before me. I just find that I think you can... To me, it's a modern day form of communication. I'll see something where somebody says something wrong or says something right and rather than sitting around doing nothing, I'll be able to put out something or in some cases call and say "Put this exact statement out."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm very exact [Inaudible]. I have so many followers. You know, I have five different platforms you add it all up and it's like over 150 million people. That's a tremendous amount of people. You get the word out. You can really protect yourself from the lies and all of the things that are being said.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> We're sitting on Air Force One here, which is the most elite airplane in the world.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It is pretty good.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> And the most famous and the safest and everything else, right? You're probably the only president who actually took a bit of a downgrade [Inaudible].
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I have a good plane. We have a good plane.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> What's the coolest thing about this plane? When you first get on it, you go around, this is your plane, right?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've known great planes but this is Air Force One. I think the coolest thing of this plane is it's Air Force One. Now, the best telecommunications I've ever seen in my life. We have defense systems. We have all sorts of things but the coolest thing is it's Air Force One. This is it.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> There's rumors that you are planning a big refurb of Air Force One.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, not a refurb. I actually ordered a new Air Force One and it's not for me but no president had the courage to do it because a lot of people don't like...
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> You said not for you. Who is it for?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it'll be a long time. It takes a long time to do it. So, hopefully, we'll get some of that at some point.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> Is there any doubt that you'll run again in 2020?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you never know what happens with health and other things. I mean, let's face it.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> You look fit.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I feel good.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> I saw your menu tonight. You [Inaudible] pretty health stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I hope so.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> No KFC there.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that is true.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> That's very health, [Inaudible] lemon cherry salmon.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I look forward to it. I mean, I look forward to it.
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> In 2020 you're going to run? You're going to go again?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I fully intend to. It seems like...
<Piers Morgan> <Neutral> Do you see any Democrat who can possibly...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I don't see anybody. I know them all. I don't see anybody.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> The Liberals could be facing not two more years of you but potentially 6 or 7.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I know many of them, I've seen them, I've dealt with them and so far they do not have the right candidate.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Final question about your wife, the First Lady, Melania. I had the pleasure of just seeing her again after a few years. She does an amazing job. I mean, all the stresses, all the pressure, all the headlines and so on.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> She does.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Would you like to say about Melania?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm very proud of her. She does an incredible job. And you know, she's very popular.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> She's popular.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And she's not a big waver and lets... She's very...
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> She's more popular than you, Mr. President.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> As you could very well...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She never runs against... But, no, she's done a fantastic job. She really has. And I think the people are liking the job that I'm doing. You see what's happening with the polls. You look at the Republican Party polls. It's the highest ever, I think. It's the highest ever.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Your final thoughts. As you leave England and you fly to Scotland for the weekend, your final thoughts about your first proper trip as president to my country.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, special people, just an incredible place, really, really have loved it. All of my life I have loved it. I think being here in this capacity is something incredible. I'm helping the cause because we work together militarily, we work on terrorism together, we work on so many different things together and I think I'm really helping the cause. We have a very special relationship.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> Mr. President, thank you very much indeed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Piers Morgan> <Positive> It's good to see you again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you, Piers.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> That really is the end of the interview but with Donald Trump there's always time for a photo-op and I did a little [Inaudible] for the President.
<Piers Morgan> <Negative> As the crew began their final checks, an off-mic and off-message Trump had one last thing to say. It was very Harrison Ford.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, Piers, get the hell of the plane.
