<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Well, here's the presidential seal. There is the White House and inside the White House is the President of the United States, Donald Trump.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> And why would you be bringing that up, Ainsley?
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> He joins us now by phone. Thank you so much for being with us, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, good morning, and I picked a very, very special day because it's Melania's birthday, so I said let's do it on Melania's birthday. So, happy birthday to Melania.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> All right. Hopefully, they'll be visits in between but have you decided on or do you want to tell us what you got her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I better not get into that because I may get in trouble. Maybe I didn't get her so much.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'll tell you what. She has done -- a got her a beautiful card. You know, I'm very busy --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> At this point --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- to be running out looking for presents, OK? But I got her a beautiful card and some beautiful flowers.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And she did a fantastic job with France. I'll tell you what, the people of France are just -- were spellbound by what happened with their great president who just left, Emmanuel, and he is a wonderful guy and --
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> You guys really got along great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- with a wonderful wife.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we did and --
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> You guys got along great.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We did and, you know, they are both terrific people. And, Brigitte -- and we had a fantastic time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And much more importantly, we accomplished a lot. We really accomplished a lot. More than anybody knows. You'll be seeing what we accomplished.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Well, give us a hint. Give us a hint.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think we really came to recognize the -- you know, I can say it from my standpoint but he is viewing, I believe, Iran a lot differently than he did before he walked into the Oval Office and I think that's important.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He understands where I'm coming from with respect to Iran. Iran is a real problem for this country. The president made a horrible deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When I say the president, I'm talking about past administration made a horrible deal giving $150 billion, giving $1.8 billion in cash -- in actual cash carried out in barrels and in boxes from airplanes. It's inconceivable -- $1.8 billion.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And all they do is scream death to America, death to America. And by the way, they're not screaming it so much anymore. They were screaming it with him. They don't scream it with me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We haven't seen their little boats circling our ships in the ocean lately because they know if they do circle the ships they're not going to be there very longer.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> All right, I want to come back to that a little later because we do want to see if that -- because you have a big deadline coming up with the Iranian agreement.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> But --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> -- when it comes to Ronny --
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Your call.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> -- Jackson, the word came out from John Roberts --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> -- now confirmed that he is no longer going to be a candidate to lead the V.A.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> In his statement is this. The allegations against me are completely false and fabricated. If they had any merit, I would not have been selected, promoted, and trusted to serve in such a sensitive and important role as physician to three presidents over 12 years.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> In my role as a doctor, I have tirelessly worked to provide excellent care for all my patients. In doing so, I have always adhered to the highest ethical standards.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Last night the report was you had a huddle. Is that what you decided last night? Is that what all of you decided?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I even told him a day or two ago. I saw where this was going.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, you know, they're very upset because Mike Pompeo who was again, first in his class at West Point, top in his class at Harvard Law School. A brilliant guy, a great guy, and somebody I get along with very well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, Mike got through and they thought they had him stopped.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Democrats are obstructionists. It's horrible what they're doing. They're not approving people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They're taking them out to the maximum 30 hours. That's a lot of time -- 30 hours -- to interview people that are going to be approved. I mean, they go 30 hours and then people will vote, and it's a disgrace.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In fact, they had a report the other day that at this rate it will be nine years before --
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> It's unbelievable.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- they're allowed to come into government.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So you have that have given up everything. They've given up their jobs. Top-line people -- brilliant people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They want to come in and help us in government and Chuck Schumer and the group take, you know, years to approve them -- years. We have judges that are waiting. Top of the line people. The best people in our country and --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And by the way, they're going to be approved but they take them out until the very, very end. And they said over nine years before they get approved --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- because they're using every little trick in the book.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> -- Mitch McConnell could keep them seven days a week until they reach their 30 hours and make them, these men and women, stay until this gets done. Why won't he do that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he should be doing that and I think he will be doing that. And he should be doing that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Honestly, the Republicans -- look, we have some absolute warriors. We have -- when I -- I just watched your show. Jim Jordan, and Mark Meadows, and Matt Gaetz, and DeSantis, and so many -- Corey Lewandowski.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have people -- Diamond and Silk are warriors, by the way. How about Diamond and Silk? They've become amazing.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, that started off like somebody was talking about them on the Internet. They were these two women -- these two beautiful, wonderful, women.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I said well, let me check it out. It took me about two seconds to say start them -- it's incredible. So, Diamond and Silk, these are all warriors.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have great people in the Republican Party and I think that, in one way, it's showing how bad, how obstructionist these Democrats are. It's a disgrace what's happening.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Do you think the obstructionist window -- as Dr. Jackson says, these allegations are baseless and they're just attacking him? This is not true, he served our country but yet, he's still withdrawing his name.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> So does the obstructionist win when your nominees don't fight back?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I could say yes. I can also say no because Doc Ronny -- you know, we call him Doc Ronny, we call him Admiral Ronny. He's an admiral, highly respected, a real leader.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I watched what Jon Tester of Montana, a state that I won by like over 20 points. You know, really, they love me and I love them. And I want to tell you that Jon Tester -- I think this is going to cause him a lot of problems in his state.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He took a man who was just an incredible man -- an incredible man respected by President Obama. He gave him his highest rating. You saw what President Obama said.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> President Bush -- he was the doctor to President Bush, to President Obama and the family. He's been my doctor.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he runs a fantastic operation. You know, they have many doctors and they run a fantastic operation.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And honestly, I said it to him. He didn't come to me. I said, you know, Doc, you run a great operation. How do you think you'd do at the V.A.?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Now, we can talk about experience but the V.A. -- when you think about 13 million people --
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- you could take the head of the biggest hospital corporation of the world and it's peanuts compared to the V.A., so nobody has experience, you know. It's a big monster.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I'm really proud of the job we've done for the V.A. because we got -- we're working right now on Choice and really big -- but we got rid of so many rules and regulations that made it impossible and we're really doing great at the V.A.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I want somebody that's going to be great. He would've done a great job --
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Did --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's got a tremendous heart.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Any idea who you might --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, these are all false accusations that were made. These are false and they're trying to destroy a man.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> By the way, I did say welcome to Washington. Welcome to the swamp. Welcome to the world of politics.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But for Jon Tester to start bringing up stuff like candy man and the kind of things he was saying, and then say well, you know, these are just statements that are made.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's no proof of this.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And he has a perfect record. He's got this beautiful record unblemished.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> His son is a wonderful boy. Goes to Annapolis, at the top of his class. One of the finest cadets.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> For him to be doing this to this man and this family, I think Jon Tester has to have a big price to pay in Montana because I don't think people in Montana -- the admiral is the kind of person that they respect and admire and they don't like seeing what's happened to him.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Well, the admiral has officially thrown in the towel.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Any idea who you might nominate next?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do, actually, but I better not give it. Maybe we'll do it on my next call. I do -- I think we're going to have somebody great.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Somebody that's more -- you know, look, the admiral is not a politician which is what I liked, by the way.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Is your nominee somebody in politics right now?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Somebody with political capability, yes.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> All right.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Meanwhile, let's talk a little bit about your former FBI director James Comey, who you fired.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> He was on T.V. last night. He said --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I did a great thing for the American people by firing him.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Well, he says he's not a leaker. He disputed what Anderson Cooper had said.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> But what's interesting is we've learned through Catherine Herridge's reporting is that apparently the guy he gave the secret memos to, Dr. Richman at Columbia University -- he had this special government employee status where he had -- you know, he could look at secrets. He had a badge to the building.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> And also, apparently, the memos were leaked to a wider group of people or at least two, maybe three, including former U.S. attorney Patrick Fitzgerald.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Your opinion on what Mr. Comey is doing on his book tour and the fact that he had a special friend at Columbia University with an FBI badge.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, Comey is a leaker and he's a liar and not only on this stuff. He's been leaking for years.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's probably been using his friend, the so-called professor who now turns out to have FBI clearance, which he never said. He even lied about that because he never said that in Congress.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He said he gave it to a friend and he gave it to a friend to leak classified information. It's all classified. It was totally classified.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So illegally -- he did an illegal act and he said it himself in order to get a special counsel against me. So the special counsel -- and by the way, and Intelligence Committee and everybody else has found no collusion. There's no collusion with me and the Russians.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody's been tougher to Russia --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- than I am. You can ask President Putin about that. There's been nobody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Between the military and the oil and all of the other things that I've done -- the aluminum tax. They send us a lot of aluminum and I put tariffs on aluminum coming in. The 60 people that we sent out -- the 60 so-called diplomats.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Nobody's been tougher. Nobody's even been close to as tough as me and we hear this nonsense. So there's no collusion whatsoever.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, Comey -- what he did, Brian, was terrible. He leaked classified information in order to try and get a special counsel --
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> He says it wasn't classified, Mr. President. He says it wasn't classified.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, it's -- well, it's totally classified. And he also leaked the memos which are classified. Nobody unclassified them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And those memos were about me and they're phony memos. He didn't write those memos accurately. He put a lot of phony stuff.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> For instance, I went to Russia for a day or so -- a day or two because I own the Miss Universe pageant. So, I went there to watch it because it was near Moscow.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> So I go to Russia -- now, I did go there -- everybody knows. The locks are there, the planes are there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He said I didn't stay there a night. Of course, I stayed there. I stayed there a very short period of time but, of course, I stayed.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, his memo said I left immediately. I never said that. I never said I left immediately.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So he said -- and you know, the funny thing, he does these memos and then fake news CNN who's a total fake -- you know, they give Hillary Clinton the questions to the debate and nobody -- can you imagine, by the way, if you gave me the questions to a debate? They would have you out of business --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- and they'd have me -- you better get out of this campaign. They don't even bring it up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, CNN - fake news CNN actually gave the questions to the --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Yes, but don't worry about them.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> I want to ask you --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no -- no, no, but think of it. How bad is that?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So anyway -- so Comey leaked and, by the way, also what he did with CNN in order to placate them, you saw that whole scenario. This is a big mistake, this book.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He is guilty of crimes and if we had a Justice Department that was doing their job instead of spending $8 million trying to find --
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> It's your Justice Department. Mr. President -- Mr. President, you're the Republican in charge --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're right, yes, you're right.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> You've got a Republican running it.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But here's what -- I answer this all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because of the fact that they have this witch hunt going on with people in the Justice Department that shouldn't be there -- they have a witch hunt against the President of the United States going on -- I've taken the position -- and I don't have to take this position and maybe I'll change -- that I will not be involved with the Justice Department. I will wait until this is over.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a total -- it's all lies and it's a horrible thing that's going on.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A horrible thing and yet, I've accomplished, with all of this going on, more than any president in the first year in our history. And everybody --
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Even the enemies and the haters admit that.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have accomplished more than any president in the first year, by far. If you look at regulations, and the big tax cuts, and Judge Gorsuch -- so many things -- and many other judges.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the big thing -- the tax cuts, the regulations -- nobody's done what we've done -- what I've done despite what's going on.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I'm very disappointed in my Justice Department but because of the fact that it's going under, and I think you'll understand this, I have decided that I won't be involved. I may change my mind at some point because what's going on is a disgrace. It's an absolute --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- disgrace.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the way, the only collusion is the collusion with the Democrats and the Russians. You take a look at what's going on there. They wouldn't even give their server -- the DNC, Democratic National Committee, wouldn't even give its server to the FBI.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So what kind of an FBI -- they break down doors for Paul Manafort early in the morning. His wife is in bed like at five or six in the morning. And they undo the lock for Michael Cohen early in the morning.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And yet, they walk into the DNC and they won't give them the server. They said we're not giving you the server. Oh, OK, we'll leave.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's not the FBI. That's a fix.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Let's talk about Michael Cohen.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Yesterday, through his attorney, he's going to be taking the Fifth. What's your reaction to that being that you worked with him for a couple of decades --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I did. He --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> -- as your attorney.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a good person. He's a great guy.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> What's at stake for you, Mr. President?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Brian, you know Michael. Michael's been on your show, I'm sure, a lot. You know, Michael --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> We know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- is a good person.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me just tell you that Michael is in business. He's really a businessman at fairly big businesses, I understand. And I don't know his business but this doesn't have to do with me.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Michael is a businessman. He's got a business. He also practices law.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say probably the big thing is his business and they're looking at something having to do with his business. I have nothing to do with his business.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I can tell you he's a good guy. He sometimes --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> But isn't your business -- isn't his business your attorney, Mr. President?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have many, many -- just so you understand, I have many attorneys. I have attorneys -- sadly, I have so many attorneys you wouldn't even believe it.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> How many -- how much of your -- Mr. President, how much of your legal work was handled by Michael Cohen?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, he has a percentage of my overall legal work -- a tiny, tiny little fraction. But, Michael would represent me and represent me on some things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He represents me -- like with this crazy Stormy Daniels deal he represented me. And, you know, from what I see he did absolutely nothing wrong. There were no campaign funds going into this --
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> Then why is he pleading the Fifth?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- which would have been a problem.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Because he's got other things. He's got businesses and from what I understand they're looking at his businesses, and I hope he's in great shape.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But he's got businesses and his lawyers probably told him to do that.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I'm not involved and I'm not involved -- and I've been told I'm not involved.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right, Mr. --
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That just came out of the newspapers.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've been told I'm not involved in that.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> We want to get to Kanye West. He tweeted that he loves you, that you're his brother, and --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's got good taste.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Negative> -- the left goes ballistic.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> What's your reaction?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes. Well, they do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, I have known Kanye a little bit and I get along with Kanye. I get along with a lot of people, frankly.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But Kanye looks and he sees black unemployment at the lowest it's been in the history of our country, OK? He sees Hispanic unemployment at the lowest it's been in the history of our country. He sees, by the way, female unemployment -- women unemployment the lowest it's been in now almost 19 years.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He sees that stuff and he's smart. And he says you know what, Trump is doing a much better job than the Democrats did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And by the way, if they ever got in and started putting back all these rules and regulations where you can't breathe, where businesses go out of business, our country would be in big trouble.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And had I not gotten elected, Hillary would have come in. She would have added more rules and regulations. We would have been out of business because you saw what was happening. We were going down.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Yes, and a couple of things on top of that. There's a bigger picture.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Kanye West comes out. Regardless of what he says he doesn't have anything personally against you. He likes you even if he doesn't agree with everything.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Then he has other people in the black community. Like, Chance the Rapper comes out and says black people don't have to be Democrats.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> Have Republicans done a bad job ignoring the black community up until now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You know, I think it was just a custom. People don't realize, you know, if you go back to the Civil War it was the Republicans that really did the thing. Lincoln was a Republican.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, somehow it changed over the years and I will say I really believe it's changing back. Remember, I was going to get no black votes?
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was going to get none? Well, I got a lot. I got a lot of support, you know, and I should have gotten much more.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now -- in fact, I used to go around saying what do you have to lose? I'd say that at speeches, remember? I'd go into a stadium. I'd talk about the African-American vote.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said the education is not good. The -- obviously, the law enforcement that your community -- the crime is at levels that nobody's ever seen before. You know, I'd go through like seven, 10 stats.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'd say vote for me. What do you have to lose?
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So now they've voted for me crime is way down and really importantly, the unemployment picture --
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- is the best it's been in the history of our country for African-Americans.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Mr. President, what does it say though about the political discourse in this country that when somebody comes out and says I like Donald Trump, suddenly the political left goes out and destroys them?
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Shania Twain was asked a couple of days ago about well, if you could've voted for Donald Trump would you have? And she said yes, I would have. And then she got so destroyed online she had to come out and apologize.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> And then yesterday, the same thing with Kanye West. Suddenly, people are saying the guy's out of his mind because he supports you.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> What happened to being able to have a different point of view?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right, I'll tell you what happened.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Shania, who I think is terrific but she made a mistake by sort of saying I wish I didn't, you know, go public with it, but we know how she feels.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But people have done that and they're amazed at what happens to their business because we have tremendous support. We have tremendous fans. If I ever called for a rally in Washington, D.C. we'd have millions of people coming into Washington because they love what's happening.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So when I see a Kanye sticking to his guns or when I see others, and there are plenty of others, sticking to their guns and coming out and saying that you have a young lady who's been very much in the news in the last three or four days --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Candace Owens.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- because she is -- she is fantastic. She's like the hottest thing out there now. If you have people do that they become much more popular.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Remember, we won the election and we won it easily. You know, a lot of people say oh, it was close.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And by the way, they also like to always talk about Electoral College. Well, it's an election based on the Electoral College. I would rather have a popular election but it's a totally different campaign.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's as though you're running -- if you're a runner you're practicing for the 100-yard dash as opposed to the one-mile. The Electoral College is different.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I would rather have the popular vote because it's -- to me, it's much easier to win.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Yes, it's a totally different set of goals as opposed to the Electoral College.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, but we have an Electoral College --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I got 306 and she got what, 223. So, remember --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- there was no way to break 270.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I heard that on CBS, and NBC, and ABC. They're all fake news.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> So --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I heard that for so long -- and CNN. But I heard that for so long. There is no way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So what they're trying to do is suppress the vote. Everyone goes home and says you know, I really like Donald Trump but I've watched on the news -- and they don't know it's fake news. I've taught them it's fake news.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I've watched on the news that he can't win, so let's go to a movie, darling, and then we'll come home and we'll watch --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> And you'll find out in the midterms whether they go with the darling home or they go to the movies.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I think that --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Let's talk about --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think he'll do better than people think in the midterms.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Did you know it's very --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The economy is so strong and jobs are so good that I think we're going to surprise -- you know, we won an election yesterday in Arizona.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Nobody talks about it. They had these massive booths set up for CNN and everybody. They had these big booths set up because they were hoping -- you know, they spent a fortune on the Democrat and the Republican won -- Lesko.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you know what, nobody talks about it.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> All right. But, Mr. President, you can argue -- you can argue that the midterms are going to be decided on big things like a meeting that you're going to have one-one-one with Kim Jong Un.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> How much are you looking at the summit that starts tomorrow with South Korea to look at what you're going to be doing when you sit down with North Korea?
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> And on top of that, we know this is confidential but can you give us any more information on the one-on-one that Mike Pompeo had with Kim Jong Un? A lot of people are hungry for some details.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I can.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> First of all, we're doing very well with North Korea and we'll see how it all comes out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Again, Brian, I'm not like Obama where you go in and you have a Kerry, who's the worst negotiator I've ever seen. He goes in for the Iran deal, he never leaves.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He should've left. He should've just left. He would have -- could have made a much better deal.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But -- so it could be that I walk out quickly -- with respect, but it could be. It could be that maybe the meeting doesn't even take place. Who knows? But I can tell you right now they want to meet.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They wanted to go to the Olympics.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, it was very, very nasty with Little Rocket Man and with the buttons -- and, you know, my button's bigger than -- everybody said this guy's going to get us into nuclear war.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Let me tell you. The nuclear war would have happened if you had weak people. We had weak people.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This should have been settled long before I came into office. This is a much different ballgame than if they did it five or 10 or 20 years ago. This is a much more dangerous ballgame now.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I will tell you it's going very well.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Mike Pompeo did go there. He wasn't supposed to meet with Kim Jong Un but he did. He -- you know, they arranged, actually while he was there, to say hello.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We have incredible pictures of the two talking and meeting which I'd love to release. If we can I'll do that, actually. It's not a bad idea.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> So it was just a hello, Mr. President?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, it was more than a hello. They got along. They were with each other for, you know, more than an hour.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They spoke and he also spoke with his counterparts in North Korea. They had a great meeting. He then left.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was very, very secret -- very, very quiet. They had a great meeting -- he left.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, you know, when I watch -- liked I watched sleepy eyes Chuck Todd the other day saying why is the president giving up so much and North Korea's giving up nothing? This was at the beginning of Meet the Press, which, I mean, this guy shouldn't even be --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- on the show.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I said to myself well, wait a minute, I'm seeing it just the opposite. I haven't given up anything. I haven't even talked about it. I haven't given up anything. We're not giving up much.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> When are you going to meet with him?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm not giving up much.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> They've given up denuclearization, testing, research. We're going to close different sites.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm saying to myself, wait a minute. All of these things he's given up and we haven't even really that much asked them because we would have asked them but they gave it before I even asked.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I have this guy, fake news -- he's on television saying why am I giving up something? I never gave up anything.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The people have to understand how dishonest the news is. And in all fairness to Fox, you guys don't always treat me great but you treat me fairly. You know, it's not like Fox is perfect for me. They're not -- they're tough but at least it's fair.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When you look at some of the others -- you look at like a CNN, they'll have a council of seven people and of the seven people every one of them is against me. I'm saying, where do we -- where do they even find these people?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I appreciate the --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> I'm not your doctor, Mr. President, but I would -- I would recommend you watch less of them.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't watch them at all. I watched last night.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Well, that makes it easy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll tell you what. I watched leaking, lying Comey last night and I did -- I did -- I hated to do it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, one of the reasons people say you're still looking good, Mr. President. How do you do it?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, one of the things I've been able to do, which is something I never thought I had the ability -- I would always watch when I was -- now, frankly, I don't have time for two reasons. There's too much and I don't have time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I would watch -- whether it's good or bad, I'd always watch.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have an ability -- I don't watch NBC anymore. They're as bad as CNN.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't -- and by the way, I made them a fortune with THE APPRENTICE. Think of that one. I made them -- and I did 19 episodes.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Your alma mater.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, but I made them a fortune.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You would think that these guys would treat me great. I made them a fortune. So they treat me horribly --
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- and they treat me falsely.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But just one thing. I don't watch things now. I can put it out of my mind and I never, ever thought that that would be possible.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you know what that does? It keeps you on the ball. It keeps you -- you keep your sanity and it works very well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But last night I did watch --
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Neutral> Mr. President, I have one question.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I did watch a liar-leaker and his performance, by the way, was horrible. And I will say this. Anderson Cooper was surprisingly tough and he did a good job.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> He did.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Mr. President, real quickly, have you decided on a date to meet with Kim Jong Un?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We have a decision to be made. We have three or four dates and that includes --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- locations. We have five locations --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- and that will all be narrowed down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I can only say this. When I came into office people thought we were going into nuclear war, OK, and now they're saying wow --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- it looks like that's going to be taken care.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Mr. President --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think we're doing very well. Let's see what happens.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> OK. We're running out of time but when we came down after your first month in office and we did that big famous now interview in the East Room --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> -- Ainsley asked you a question to grade your first month in office.
<Steve Doocy> <Negative> Now, fast-forward. You've been in office over a year. Last year, you said in the first month I give myself an A for effort and a C for messaging because you were having trouble -- the White House was -- explaining what you were doing.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> How would you grade yourself now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, I'm fighting a battle against a horrible group of deep-seated people -- drained the swamp -- that are coming up with all sorts of phony charges against me, and they're not bringing up real charges against the other side.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So we have a phony deal going on and it's a cloud over my head. And I've been able to do -- to really escape that cloud because the message now everyone knows -- it's a fix, OK. It's a witch hunt and they know that and I've been able to message it.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would give myself an A+. Nobody has done --
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> Right.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- what I've been able to do and I did it despite the fact that I have a phony cloud over my head that doesn't exist.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It was what the Democrats used to try and make an excuse for their loss of an election -- for their loss of the Electoral College that they should never lose because the Electoral College is set up perfectly for the Democrats and this was an absolute total beating in the Electoral College.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They should never lose the Electoral College and they did --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> But --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- and they got thwamped.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> But does it make you want to talk to Mueller and put an end to it? Does it make you want to talk to him because that's what Rudy Giuliani --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, if I can. The problem is that it's such a -- it's such -- if you take a look they're so conflicted. The people that are doing the investigation -- you have 13 people that are Democrats.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have Hillary Clinton people. You have people that worked on Hillary Clinton's foundation. They're all -- I don't mean Democrats, I mean like the real deal.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then you look at the phony Lisa Page and Strzok and the memos back and forth, and the FBI. And by the way, you take a poll at the FBI. I love the FBI, the FBI loves me.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the top people in the FBI, headed by Comey, were crooked.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You look at McCabe where he takes $700,000 from somebody supporting Hillary Clinton. He takes $700,000 for his wife's campaign. And by the way, didn't even spend that money. They kept some of it because under that law you're -- he took seven.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He took $700,000 from a group headed by Terry McAuliffe who was under investigation by McCabe and the FBI and that investigation disappeared. He took $700,000.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And you look at the corruption at the top of the FBI. It's a disgrace.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And our Justice Department, which I try and stay away from, but at some point I won't.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Our Justice Department should be looking at that kind of stuff, not the nonsense of collusion with Russia. There is no collusion with me --
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> All right.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> All right.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> -- and Russia, and everyone knows it.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Everyone. We could talk to you all day but it looks like --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sure.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> -- you have a million things to do.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you could have --
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> But I hope you can join us again, Mr. President.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Thank you so much for much for being with us.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And, Ainsley, good luck with your book. It's going to be a winner.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Thank you. Thank you so much.
<Steve Doocy> <Positive> And happy birthday to Melania.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Negative> We'll see you next Thursday, Mr. President.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, thank you.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Neutral> The phone line's open.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Sounds OK.
<Steve Doocy> <Neutral> Call in again some time.
<Ainsley Earhardt> <Positive> Thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good. Thank you, bye.
<Brian Kilmeade> <Positive> Very nice of you to call in.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Positive> So we -- we did want to thank you very much for taking the time for us...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's OK.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> So much has happened. We have a lot of ground to cover...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> A little bit has happened, yeah... [Laughter]
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Positive> Well, it's a forward-looking interview. Your first hundred days are...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Positive> ... are behind, so we -- we wanted to take a look with you at -- at things to come.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, good.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Positive> The spending deal, will you sign it? Are you sure you're going to sign it?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Which one?
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> The spending deal on the -- on the budget, on the -- you know... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, assuming it's like we agreed. You know, we're getting a billion and a half for border security, which is very important to me. We're already down 63 percent of crossings, which is at a record. There's never been a record like that. I'm sorry, 73 percent as of this morning, 73. It was actually reported last week at 73. It's going to go up this week too, so it's going to -- you know, so we're doing very well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Some people say, "Oh, you're doing so well, maybe you don't need the wall." We do need the wall, for drugs. We need the wall for human trafficking, which is a problem that you should write something about at some point. You know, unrelated to me, but the human trafficking problem is probably worse than it ever was in history, if you think about it. You know, you think about 400 years ago or something but if -- human trafficking is an unbelievable problem, a worldwide problem, so we need the wall. But no, we have a billion and a half for -- for border security. You saw that.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Positive> Yes. So you sound confident.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, we're very happy with it. And I think it's important that we keep moving along. I think both sides are happy. Excuse me?
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Positive> You were -- you're going to sign it you think? I mean, you're pretty...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have to see what the final is. But yeah, if it's -- if it's as we discussed, the answer's yes.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> OK. I mean, it doesn't have some -- you know, your $18 billion in cuts. It does fund Planned Parenthood...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Well, you have to remember, this is all coming due again in September, October, and we're going to have another round of discussions.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Positive> OK. So for -- for now, it sounds like it is a good deal to you?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I think it's a deal that is -- look, the Democrats are obstructionists; that's all they can do is obstruct. They have no leadership. And we have to agree, and I think both -- both sides agree, we have to keep government going, we don't want to shut government. So -- so we're -- we'll have more of these to discuss in the future.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Positive> Wanted to jump to health care.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> There's been a lot of discussion about what the health care bill that the House is -- poised to sign off on will or won't do. This notion of pre-existing conditions is obviously of tremendous concern...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, we're having pre-existing conditions. That's it. Plus, we're having the pool, we're doing a lot of things. And the best thing that is happening with the health care is premiums will come down. We'll have tremendous competition; you know, we're getting rid of the border state lines, and we're going to have tremendous competition. We're going to have insurance companies fighting, like life insurance. You know, we -- life insurance, you have these companies that are like -- like going all over the place. We're going to have a tremendous -- tremendously competitive market and health care costs are going to be forced down.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The one thing people don't say is how bad Obamacare is doing. You know, I was in Tennessee, where half of the state has lost its insurance and the other half is going in two months. That means Tennessee has no carriers. That means they have no insurance. Kentucky is going to be pulled out.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're pulling out of many states. And people don't report the fact that Obamacare is dead. It's not like -- it's not like, "Oh, gee" -- like for instance, when they want to compare -- first of all, we're going to have lower premiums. We're going to have lower deductibles. We're going to have much better health care. But they like to try and compare things, the ideal situation to Obamacare. But there is no Obamacare. Obamacare is -- is dead. You -- you understand what I mean by -- it can't survive.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> I do hear you. [Crosstalk]
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> ... this House bill says that it would allow insurers to charge sick people more than healthy people. So, that's what I'm wondering is, would you sign a bill, if it does include... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm going to look -- I'll look at every provision. I tell you what. If people are going to -- first of all, this bill is much better for people than Obamacare. And it's a repeal -- it in the -- in its final form will be a full -- you know, will be a repeal and replacement of Obamacare. But -- and -- and -- and one other thing. It was a little misunderstood. I wish they didn't set a line -- you know, approve it by two weeks ago. Because all this is is a continuation of -- of a negotiation that started a month ago -- a month and a half ago. Obamacare took 17 months to get approved. We're now on our sixth week of -- you know, of health care. The end result is going to be a really good bill if we get it -- if we get it approved.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> Do you... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And -- and it'll be good -- knowing that you have Republicans, Democrats. But even with the Republicans, you have conservatives, you have moderates. You have many different factions. And all good people, and they all want something different. You know, it's -- it's something that's very interesting. I think the -- the -- I know that the end result will be very good, and...
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> Might not be good for sick people, though. It might not.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> What's that?
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> It might not be good for sick people. If sick people have to pay more because they have a pre-existing condition...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I want it to be good for sick people, Jen. Well, you know it's not in its final form right now.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> I guess that's -- I think that's what we want to go to is that would -- do you support the passage of a House bill that has a fairly large loophole that may end up...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll be looking into that... [Crosstalk]
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> ... putting sick people in a bad place?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'll be looking at it very closely. But we have -- in terms of exactly what you're talking about, it will be better than Obamacare.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> Is it OK then to pass a House bill that may not protect pre-existing conditions because of the states loophole.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, we are protecting pre-existing conditions. And it'll be every good -- bit as good on pre-existing conditions as Obamacare.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> OK, OK. That's -- that's the key focal point, I think. Taxes, if you don't mind.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And Obamacare -- just so you know, Obamacare's terrible on pre-existing conditions. You know why?
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because you're not going to have it. It's folding. It's gone. If -- if I don't do anything -- you know my famous statement that I really believe in to this day. Don't do anything for a year, let Obamacare go out of business, and then come up with a new plan. So, Obamacare doesn't cover pre-existing conditions because it's not going to be here. It -- it can't... [Crosstalk]
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> But when you say it'll be every bit as good as Obamacare on pre-existing conditions...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, but...
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> ... you mean... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But -- but I -- I do... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do. But I'm just telling you, Obamacare doesn't cover pre-existing conditions because it won't be here. I -- I would mind that quote.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> OK, I got it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's a risque quote. But it's true.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> But you are -- you are guaranteeing that you will not sign a health care bill...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What I want to do -- I want it to be a great deal for the people. I do. And if it's not going to be good, I'm not going to sign it. [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, if it's not going to be good, I'm not going to sign it.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> OK. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But it's going to be... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'm -- I'm [Inaudible].
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> ... people will want to hear you say that because if they already have cancer or something É [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no. I want -- I want -- I want people to be taken care of...
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... properly. And they're not being taken care of now.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> If your tax cuts end up being temporary because of the cost, does that take some of the juice out of it? I mean, I just know...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I'd like them to be permanent. You're -- you're talking about if they make it like a four-year deal or something?
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Positive> Correct.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> Because if they're so expensive and they can't get... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I know. I -- I'd like it to be permanent. Don't forget -- OK, so here's something very important. So we're doing a very big tax cut. We need it. The economy's growing at 1 -- not growing, it's not growing at all. It's a GDP of 1 percent. That's really bad, and the first quarter, second quarter really isn't my quarter. That's really a leftover from -- in all fairness, I just got here.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So -- so you're growing at 1 percent or less in the country. So we need something -- we need a stimulus. But when you talk about putting money back in, my new trade deals are going to bring a lot of money back in, my cost savings are going to bring a lot of money back in. I'll give you an example. So, nobody wrote -- wrote this story, but maybe somebody should. The F-35 fighter jet -- I saved -- I got involved in the negotiation. It's 2,500 jets. I negotiated for 90 planes, lot 10. I got $725 million off the price. Probably, if I -- if I added up the entire time I -- I worked on it, it was like an hour, but I got $725 million off the price. There's so many things we can save on. There's so much.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> Little bits and pieces here and there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Including health care. We're going to end up with better health care at a lower price. People are going to pay less and they're going to have a lower deductible. You know, the biggest -- the second biggest problem, other than premiums, with Obamacare is the deductibles. They're so high, nobody's going to get to use them.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Positive> Gas tax -- let me ask you about the federal gas tax. To pay for your infrastructure plan, would you be willing to consider increasing the federal gas tax if the money went -- if you had a dedicated revenue stream for your infrastructure plan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I'll tell you what's -- what was very interesting. The truckers came to see me. And I have very good relationships with the truckers. I have one friend who's a big trucker and he's -- he's like -- said, "I've never seen anything like it," you know, with the roads -- you've heard this story -- with the roads, and his trucks are all being destroyed, and he's going to start buying cheap equipment now. Yeah, the roads are in bad shape. But I've -- I've -- had the truckers come to see me, that if we earmarked money toward the highways that they would -- that they would not mind a tax -- you know, gas tax or some form of tax.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So I haven't -- I haven't made a commitment. But they would like it, because they say the roads are in such bad condition.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> Can I... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We can't allow that.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> Can I report that you're open to raising the gas tax? Would that be fair?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> The truckers have said that they want me to do something, as long as that money is earmarked to highways.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> For infrastructure.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You could say that I had that meeting.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's something that I would certainly consider, that -- because they've asked me to consider it.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> It sounds -- it seems like it could be an opening, potentially, for some negotiations with Democrats as well -- maybe the only area that I can think of where you would...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, on infrastructure...
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Positive> ... consider a revenue increase.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Democrats want infrastructure, they want a trillion-dollar bill, and I'm totally open to that. We are in agreement there. I think where I'm in most -- best agreement with the Democrats are that and trade. You know, I had -- Jennifer, you reported this once. I had a lot of Bernie Sanders voters for me.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> You did.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People don't realize how many. And it was all because of trade, because the one thing that I agreed with him on -- not much -- but the one thing was trade. Because he knows the United States is being ripped off on trade. He's the only one that got it. And nobody's tougher on trade than I am.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Positive> One really quick question -- go back to your tax reform plan.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yeah.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> Is it a starting point? Like, you're a negotiator, so is this tax reform plan...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, everything...
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Positive> ... a starting point...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... honestly, Jennifer...
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> ... or are you going to insist on everything?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Everything's a starting point. Look...
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> OK.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Obviously, you can't just say, you know, I'm living with -- everything's a starting point. But hopefully, I don't have to change it very much, and maybe I won't have to change it at all, but everything's a starting point.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> Is there anything you think you could lose? Is there anything you could shed from that plan?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's always something you can lose.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> Are there a couple things you can't lose on that plan... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, there are a couple of things but I can't tell you what they are. [Laughter]
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> Oh, give us one please. Please.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would like to keep it as low as possible. But we're going to bring a lot of money in on trade. We're going to bring a lot of money on reciprocal. You know, as an example, when you have countries with a big tax and we get nothing for the same product and we're paying -- our companies are paying 100 percent tax in some countries and if they send their product to us we pay nothing. Doesn't make sense. I'm a big believer in a reciprocal tax. Now, this is trade we're talking about, not... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you know -- because I actually think the border tax -- the concept of border tax is more of a trade issue than it is a -- so when we talk about income coming in, I believe border tax in its form, if we use that, reciprocal tax is a tax that I really love because basically nobody can fight it. If a country's charging us 52 percent and we're charging them nothing for the same product going back and forth, nobody can fight. I've even said to other countries -- I've said, "Listen, you're charging us a lot. We're going to charge you the same thing." They shrug their shoulders.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> They can't fight it. But if you say you're going to put a 10 percent tax on -- everyone says, "Oh, you're taxing. You're taxing." I love a reciprocal tax. Nobody can fight it, it's fair and it's something that we are working on very strongly. But a lot of the taxes in terms of income coming in are taxes that I'm viewing more in the trade tax than I am in the other. Like you've heard me say that when somebody -- when a big car company -- you saw they're moving back into Michigan.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're moving big league back into Michigan. I mean, I don't want to say it, because I don't want to anger the Mexicans any more than they're already angered. But, you know, a couple of companies started building plants and they actually stopped and now they're expanding in Michigan and they're moving back in into Ohio and different states. They're moving back in because they think that I'm going to charge them 35 percent if they build their -- fire all their employees, go to Mexico, build a factory, build a car and put it -- or air conditioner or whatever it is -- and sell it back in. I tell them, "You're going to have a 35 percent tax to pay," or a very substantial tax.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And now, they're saying, "We're building in Michigan and we're building in Ohio." You see what's going on with the car companies. You ought to call Ford. Call Mr. Fields, the head of Ford. Call Mary Barra, head of General Motors. You could call Fiat. You know, you could call Fiat. You could call -- we had that meeting. They're all talking about building in the United States because of me.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> How would you sell...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By the way, if my opponent won, you would have -- the companies would be fleeing right now. Now, couple of things. They love the tax cut, OK? They love my regulation cuts, which are going to be -- I think they're -- personally, it's a big thing. I think the regulation cuts are going to have an even bigger impact than the massive tax cuts. And this is the biggest tax cut in history. This is bigger than Reagan. Remember we used to say, "The biggest since Reagan"? I used to say that. This is actually bigger than Reagan tax cuts. But what they are is the biggest regulation cuts in history by far.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> I'd like to ask you about North Korea. But very quickly on the gas tax question, if that is something that ultimately you decide you'd like to support, how would you sell the Republicans on this? Because no tax increase... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, when the industry comes to me, when the trucking industry comes to me and says that the highways are so bad that their trucks are being destroyed, you know, badly hurt, badly -- really badly hurt, damaged from New York to California, and that truckers want to buy crummy equipment now because they -- you know, I mean, this guy used to always pride himself on buying the best.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He said, "I get -- I go from New York to California and we got -- our tires are all beat up and" -- because, you know, they're running over potholes, they're running over gravel, they're running over bad roads, you know, the roads are worn out so it wears out the rubber. And the -- the stuff goes and splatters all over the -- you know, the bottom of the trucks and they're all beat to hell.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> It's bad for business?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he said it would never -- I said, "How has it been?" He's -- 40 years he's been in business. I said, "How has it been?" He said, "It's never been like this."
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> And on the reciprocal tax, you think you could get that through Congress as well?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm just telling you, I -- I haven't even mentioned this to anybody. I mean, I'm giving you something first. I find that people are very open to the reciprocal tax. Because it's just all we're doing is saying, "Whatever you're doing, we're doing." It's -- it's -- I love the reciprocal tax.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, in theory -- if they're charging 50 percent and we're charging nothing, in theory what they should do is say, "OK, we'll all charge nothing." But either way, it's -- you know, it's -- it's a great tax. And it's a very free trade tax if you think about it, because, you know, depending on the amount and the volumes and everything else, in theory they should bring it down to nothing or whatever they get, we get.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> On North Korea...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So you could do the reciprocal tax is something that's very important to me. So we're going to have a lot of money coming in. But it comes in through trade and it comes in through renegotiating NAFTA. Now, just -- and by the way you've been to plenty of my speeches. I would always say, "We will renegotiate NAFTA or terminate it, right?" I never said, "We'll terminate it."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I said we'll [Inaudible] it. So -- and just so we put it finally on the record, I think you saw me do the little quick interview there on the NAFTA because it's very simple. I was getting ready to terminate NAFTA, I got a call from Mexico and he said, "I would appreciate you not doing that." I got a call, amazingly, within 20 minutes from Justin, from Canada -- and I have a good relationship with both; I like them both a lot. And they said, "Could we negotiate instead of you terminating?" I said, "Yes." I was going to terminate on Saturday. I had the papers. Is it true? The papers were ready -- the termination papers were ready.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> Are you any further along the road on knowing what you want to change... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, the biggest problem I have is this -- this fast start or whatever they call...
<Unidentified Speaker> <Positive> Fast-track.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Fast-track. It's a horrible situation. We put our papers in 60 days ago for fast-track. We still haven't been approved, because the Democrats are holding them up. So I want to start negotiating and is it a 90- or 100-day period, what is it?
<Unidentified Speaker> <Positive> Ninety days.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Ninety-day period. So I put my papers in 60 days ago to renegotiate NAFTA and I can't -- I still don't have them approved. That means in theory, we can't negotiate until they're approved. The Democrats are holding them up. Wyden.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> Is there anything you want to change for Mexico and for Canada at this point...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> A lot.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> Is there anything you can tell us...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yeah, a lot. Oh, it's got to be -- it's very unfair.
<Unidentified Speaker> <Negative> [Inaudible] go back to...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have massive deficits with Mexico. You know, we're losing -- we have a trade deficit with Mexico of almost $70 billion. We have a trade deficit with Canada of approximately $15 billion. The lumber coming in from Canada is -- is killing us -- is killing us. The dairy that's not going into Canada from Wisconsin, a state that I happen to love, is absolutely unfair.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> So I'd love any clues on what you would change in NAFTA. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, we'll change a lot in NAFTA. But -- but you have to understand, I have a problem with Congress. They won't approve to start. So this is supposed to be fast-track, but it has to be approved. You put your papers in, and they're tying it into my trade negotiator. They're saying, "It doesn't start until your trade negotiator's approved." Well, they're holding him up. The law -- it says, you know, the trade -- your trade representative, which is Lighthizer.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Which -- by the way, which is very unfair. You understand that. So I'm trying to get -- because Mexico wants to start now and so does Canada. They're all set. And I've got to keep waiting for Congress? Our system is archaic.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The biggest thing -- and they don't talk about it. But the biggest beneficiaries are going to be the middle class, of the tax cut, and we're going to keep it that way. When you say, "Is there anything you won't change?" that's something I won't change. And also...
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> How do you figure? How are they the biggest beneficiaries?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because they're going down to 10 percent. They're going down to 10 percent. And don't...
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Positive> You have put, throughout your career, a great emphasis on forging personal relationships -- and that's true in the White House also -- and your ability to make deals, in part based on those personal relationships. So what I want to ask you is, have you thought about this: Would you be willing to meet with Kim Jong Un personally to try to reach a...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I had a feeling she was getting there.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> It was a slow wind-up. Sorry.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Breaking -- we have breaking news. Is this going to be breaking news, Jennifer? [Laughter]
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> Depends on what you say.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK. So, we have a potentially very bad situation that we will meet in the toughest of all manners if we have to do that. If it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would absolutely -- I would be honored to do it. If it's under the -- again, under the right circumstances. But I would -- I would do that. Hey, look, I'm meeting with Abbas on Wednesday, the leader of Palestine.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You think that's slightly smaller, right? I'm meeting with Abbas on Wednesday. And people are saying that's a very good thing to do, because I'd like to see peace in the Middle East and I'd like to see the Palestinians and the Israelis come together and Israel come together and have peace. Now -- so under the right circumstances, I -- under the right circumstances, I would be.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> Do you think these are the right circumstances now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think he is -- look, we have tremendous power over there and we cannot allow him to do what he's doing. We cannot allow him to say what he's saying. He's making very provocative statements. We cannot allow that. We have tremendous --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So, we cannot let a situation happen where -- under any circumstances where he can launch missiles into the United States. Plus we happen to have great allies in that area and I feel very strongly toward those allies. So, yes, under the right circumstances, I would absolutely meet with him.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> And your thinking -- are you thinking...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, most political people would never say that. But I'm telling you, under the right circumstances, I would meet with him. We have breaking news.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> You did make a little bit there, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, no.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Positive> Quick staffing question. In a month or two, Bannon, Priebus, do you think that they'll be in their exact same roles in a month or two, six months from now?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think so. You know, the one thing -- and I think you see it -- we have a lot of people that really do get along... Seriously, we have a lot of people.
<Unidentified Speaker> <Negative> [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Jared is a very brilliant young guy. Bannon has -- has, you know, I like him a lot.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's actually a very good guy. Sometimes, I call him alt-left, OK? I mean, he's a...
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> What's that mean?
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> Why?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Bannon's more of a libertarian than anything else, if you want to know the truth, OK? He's really -- you know, they give him a -- a bad rap. Bannon is a very decent guy who feels very strongly about the country. Likewise, Jared. And they're getting along fine. We have a -- they're getting along well. We have -- we have a lot of people that are getting along well. Although, it's coming out better now than it was, you know, for a while. And for a while it was a little testy, I guess for some of them, but I said, 'You've got to get your acts together.' You know, they're very competitive. We have very competitive people in this administration.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> Kellyanne and Sean are in the room, too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, well, they're not competitors...
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Positive> Same vote of confidence?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> He's become the biggest star on television now, you know?
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> So you're going to keep Kellyanne and Sean?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's getting more than the "Bold and the Beautiful" guys, those handsome guys that they pay a fortune, right?
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Positive> Are you happy with the job both of them are doing also? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, I am. I'm happy with everybody. I am.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> So no one is -- is moving at all in the near future?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I don't expect to see it. Now, I will tell you, probably people are going to get job offers. You know, things happen. But -- but I'm very happy with our group. We're doing very well. I think we're -- and you know, it's interesting. I think I'm getting very high marks on foreign policy. I noticed that over the last couple of days. I don't think of it as much, but we're getting very, very high marks on foreign policy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Great relationship with China. Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily. Enter your email Sign Up I mean, I'll give you an example of currency manipulation. First of all, since I started running, they haven't increased their -- you know, they have not manipulated their currency. I think that was out of respect to me and the campaign. But literally, since when I -- when it looked like I was starting to win the Republican primaries, which was actually pretty early, but they -- they haven't been.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But here's -- assuming they were and they're helping me with North Korea, I'm going to say -- "By the way, how are you doing with North Korea?" "Well, blah, blah, blah." "Well, listen. We're going to name you a currency manipulator." Think of it. "I'm naming you a currency manipulator. How are you doing with North Korea?" I guess you could put it that way [Inaudible].
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> You've -- you've invited...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Do you understand? So -- so ridiculous, but nobody ever says that. They'll say, "Donald Trump did not come through with his thing on currency manipulation." You can't be having them help us on something where millions and millions of lives are at stake and then say, "We're going to name you a currency manipulator," right?
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> You mentioned...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I like to tie them -- they never like to tie them together.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> You mentioned the meeting with Mr. -- you mentioned the meeting with Mr. Abbas. You've also invited Mr. Duterte to the White House.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> There's been a lot of criticism or concern about his human rights record in his own country. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Philippines is very important to me.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> You've mentioned the importance of North Korea. Is that -- does that take precedence over concerns about extrajudicial killings in the Philippines? And will you -- like, how do you balance those? How do you explain to people why...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The Philippines is very important to me strategically and militarily. And I've had numerous conversations with the leader of the Philippines and -- and he's got a big problem. He's got a massive drug problem. He's been very, very tough on that drug problem, but he has a massive drug problem.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> Do you think he's...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He is very popular in the Philippines. He has a very high approval rating in the Philippines. But he's very popular in the Philippines. I -- yes, I -- I look forward to meeting him. If he comes to the White House, that's fine. I look forward to meeting him. The Philippines are a very important -- I have many, many friends from the Philippines. They're great people. The Philippines strategically is very important to us. I think we'll have a great relationship with the Philippines. I think it's strategically very important to do so.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Positive> Should we break up the big banks? Do you support that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm looking at that right -- I didn't know this one was going to be brought up. But we are looking at that. There are -- you know, some people that want to go back to the old system, right? So we're going to look at that. We're going to -- we're looking at it right now as we speak. And Dodd-Frank is -- is going to be very, very seriously changed so the banks can go back to loaning money.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> How long on GOP bounce back?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Listen to you. You'll -- you'll start seeing things happen. You'll start seeing things happen. Right now, this is the end of the Obama era.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> A year to get to 4 percent? Eighteen months? [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't like to put -- you know, guidelines on it. I can say this. You know, everyone talks about the 3 percent, 3 percent. I think we can do far more than 3 percent. And I think we can do more than 4 percent, eventually. Take time to get there. We've been more about -- we've been a country that has had such horrible rules and regulations. And there have been -- we've been stifled. We've been artificially stifled for so long. But I really think we can go higher than 4 percent, eventually.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Positive> Is Melania still going to move here with Barron? Do you think it's a good place for Barron to live? You still -- you still think he should come live here?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so, I think great. He's all set.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> OK.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> You must miss him.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do. Well, they come down on the weekends. She just left. She's coming back down later.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> So you talked about it being a cocoon. So you think it's OK for a 10-year-old to be here, though?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's a cocoon.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> But they'll -- they'll -- they'll come full time? You still plan -- you think...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yeah, they're -- they're already set. In fact, we just got him into a good school.
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> Would -- would you share with us?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I won't tell you. [Crosstalk]
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Negative> In D.C., though? But within D.C.? [Crosstalk]
<Jennifer Jacobs / Margaret Talev> <Neutral> OK.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> OK we have someone on the phone. He's just kind of a last minute thing because I guess we're hoping he's here tomorrow, but joining us by phone, Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump. Good to have you on the phone this morning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning. I loved listening to Chris. That was great. He is a talented guy. Now he's more talented than I thought, but he's great. Thank you, Chris, very much.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Thank you, Donald, for that.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> So, Donald, you have a lot of people wearing Donald Trump buttons here who would like you very much to be here tomorrow morning in person, so we hope to see you here tomorrow morning but I know this is a last second thing. So I want -- a couple of things. Mika asked people to do word association games and said your name. Chris Christie said.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Jeb Bush -- Jeb Bush went in an opposite direction, he said, Loser. What's your response?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Here is the story, I mean, we got to say it like it is. He'll say that I said things and that I never said. I never called John McCain a loser. You know that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I like John McCain. He's a nice guy. I never called him a loser. The other man I supposedly called a loser, I don't even know who it is, I never -- I don't know who the man is.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Jeb is mixing things up. Here is the story on Jeb. He is a stiff who you wouldn't hire in private enterprise. This is a stiff.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is a guy that, if he came looking for a job, you'd say no thank you. And that's the way it is. He used -- he used -- just so you understand, he talks about eminent domain. He doesn't even know what the words mean.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Eminent domain -- his family used eminent domain privately on the stadium in Texas that just came out this morning. He forgot to tell you. He probably didn't know because he is probably not that involved with his family. In fact, he doesn't even use the last name Bush.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Which is a mistake. But Jeb Bush is -- he will spend $100 million on ads, spent $25 million on negative ads on me and every time he does a negative ad, my poll numbers go up. It's a weird thing. But the guy's a total stiff.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He's not going to win. Remember this, for the voters, he wants Common Core and he's very weak on immigration. Remember they came in for love. Remember the act of love, he said. They come to our country for the act of love. Jeb is weak on immigration and Common Core. He wants it 100 percent. And just those two items he can't do very well. But he's got to go around and stop lying because I never called John McCain a loser. Really, really sad when you have to say that.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So let me ask you what is your message to the voters of New Hampshire going into tomorrow? What are the issues that they should decide on you, to vote for or against you on?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, let me just tell you New Hampshire is a special place, I've known it long before the electoral process. You know, I have a lot of friends up here and I come here a lot and it's a beautiful place. The thing that most surprises me all the time that I get, and it's surprising because it's so beautiful, is the heroin problem and the drug problem that they have up here. So many people bring that up.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You don't think of New Hampshire as having that problem. It's a massive problem up here. And I'm going to stop the borders -- and no politician can do what I do. I'm going to stop the border, I'm going to build a real wall, not a toy wall, I'm going to build a real wall.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're not going to have drugs pouring through the border because most of the drugs up here come from the southern border. And we're going to clean it up and we're going to help the people that are badly addicted. But the drugs that come in so easily that the cost of heroin and cost of the drugs are so cheap it's like buying bubble gum. And many, many people up here -- more than any other place -- it's a strange thing, but they have a huge drug problem.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're going to clean it up. We're going to strengthen the borders, we're going to strengthen our military, we're going to take care of the vets, we're going to do a real job, we're going to get rid of Obamacare, replace Obamacare with something that's so much better and so much less expensive. I don't know -- Chris knows this, because I know Chris and I differ on a few things but I have a lot of respect for Chris. But, Chris, you know, the Obamacare -- I don't know if you have seen the costs, what, costs are going up 35 and 45 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> People are just getting killed with it. And even the supporters of Obamacare are saying it's really gotten out of control. And, you know, they're up about 35, 45 percent, the premiums. And the deductible is so high that unless you're hit with a steam roller, you're not going to be able to use it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, the deductible is through the roof. So something has to be done with healthcare because it's really -- I mean, really, really out of control. And we have so many other things to do. And, you know, the bottom line is we have to rebuild our country because the infrastructure -- and who can do better than me with that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Building, nobody can do building like I do building. And even the builders in New York about tell you Trump builds the best. So I know how to do these things.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> All right, Willie.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Hey, Donald, good morning. It's Willie.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi, Willie. Hi.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> We could go this time on the day before Iowa, you were leading in the polls, you were 7, 8 points, depending on which poll you looked at. You're up big here in New Hampshire. The polls in Iowa were wrong about you and I think you were a little surprised about the result in Iowa. Why is New Hampshire different?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, actually the polls in Iowa were right, they said I was up 5. And what happened is the caucus system and people would go into a room and a lot of people couldn't get away. They were -- it's a weird thing. The caucus system is very complex.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And then of course thousands of people were taken away from Ben Carson, which was very sad, and they were put over. So if you really look, I came a very strong second. Don't forget I've never done this before, that was my first race ever [Inaudible]. But it's the first time I have ever done this and I came in second.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What I did find and what Chuck -- you know, what a couple of us have sort of laughed at over the last little while is that I came in a strong second, I was much more than 2,000 votes past Rubio. He came in third. He was 2,000 -- more than 2,000 votes behind. And he was like this modern day hero, and I was like, oh, gee, he came in second.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I never quite understood that. Now, here, it's -- the polls are much stronger, here I have very big leads. But I hope the snow doesn't affect it. You guys are going to have to tell me, we have a sort of snowstorm coming up and I hope that doesn't happen.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I think we're going to do very well in New Hampshire. I think. Who knows? But I think we are.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right, Chris Matthews.
<Chris Matthews> <Positive> Well, I think up here, Donald, that the voters vote because they're citizens first and you vote.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Like my parents voted. They didn't sit around who they were passionate about, they never talked about it. They went out and voted like Americans and then on the way to -- thinking about vote, they decided who to vote for. That's how normal people behave, by the way.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Out in Iowa you have to have this big passionate thing and carry around a poster for a while and find, oh, I guess I will go to this caucus thing. It's not a normal way to vote.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Chris, why do -- I know --
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Normal people vote, they don't going to caucuses. [Crosstalk]
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> I know this is an interview with Donald, but really quickly, why is Iowa first and why do we have that strange bizarre caucus system?
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> I guess people like North By Northwest. I don't know. It's a flat place you can see everywhere anywhere. It's a strange state. You can look around and see Iowa. It's a strange situation.
<Chris Matthews> <Negative> Jimmy Carter went out there twice, he established the place, an the first guy to ever win out there, beat Teddy out there, Teddy Kennedy, and then it became this place to go. But I've studied this thing. New Hampshire is the place. This is where Eisenhower came from, this is where Kennedy came from. [Applause] [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> The people are so great. And it's nice -- it's ice when you have a vote, Chris, you like somebody, you walk in, and you pull the trigger, you vote, and you go home, as opposed to sitting around for hours and hours and discussing things. You know, it's a little bit -- the whole caucus system is a little bit strange. But, you know, it's one of those things.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But, hey, look, I did really well in Iowa and I got the most votes in the history of a caucus for Republicans in the primary. And, you know, we got 46,000 votes which is more than anybody -- other than the one, and the one was artificially inflated. But I don't talk about that because I'm into New Hampshire now.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right. And by the way, we love Iowa and we love the people of Iowa, especially Java Joes, but the caucus system, the caucus system, I -- they need to clean that up, especially on the Democratic side.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I agree.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> It seems archaic.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Mark Halperin.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> Good morning, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi Mark.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> You're on the eve of potentially winning the New Hampshire primary. That would be an historic achievement. I'm wondering if you are at all sentimental about that prospect and how you think a win here would affect your prospects in South Carolina?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you know, I went to South Carolina two nights ago, Mark. You saw that I had a stadium. We had -- on four days' notice, they had four days and they filled it. It was 12,000 people came in and it was an amazing feeling.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we're doing tremendously down in South Carolina. Some people -- I think I heard Joe say that maybe he thinks that's going to be one of my strongest states. And so I think we're going to do really well down there. I hope we're going to do really well in New Hampshire.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have a great bonding with the people in New Hampshire. They know what I'm going to do. You know, because, you know, they have a big vet problem up here, the veterans, a tremendous veteran problem, and they know how I am with the vets and nobody knows what I do with the vets. So they understand it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> So I think I'm going to do well here and I think I -- I will do well in South Carolina, too. I think I'm going to do well in the SEC generally.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> What would a win in New Hampshire, though, mean to you personally? That achievement?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, it would mean a lot. And that's why I hate -- I don't know if the snow comes and I don't even know what it means if it comes. You know, what does it mean? Does it mean people don't go out and vote? I guess maybe some people won't. But I don't care -- it's got to be very bad.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But I'd love to have a great win up here. I've been friendly with this area for many years and, you know, the relationships I have. And all of my friends say you're going to have a tremendous night, but we will see what happens. Who knows.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I mean, I just assume you have to keep working -- we're having an event tonight, we're going to have 4,000 or 5,000 people over at the Verizon arena. And just sort of a lot -- we're going to have a lot of fun tonight, we're going to have a little bit of a rally tonight. But I think we will have 4,000 or 5,000 people tonight and it's going to be very exciting.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> John Heilemann.
<John Heilemann> <Neutral> Yes, Donald, it's Heilemann here. After all these months of campaigning, all these debates, the Iowa caucuses now almost the New Hampshire primary. Who do you -- when you look around the stage at the rivals that you're facing -- who do you think is the most formidable of your competitors purely in terms of political skill?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't like saying it, John, but I mean, I can talk about it a little bit. Because I think Jeb is a bad debater. I think he's a -- Jeb as an example, you know, always talks, oh, I went after Donald Trump, I said bad things about Donald Trump, aren't I brave? He's a stiff. Jeb is weak.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say that others are -- I mean, you have some pretty good debaters. I've been a little bit surprised -- Cruz is supposed to be a championship debater. And you saw the Time magazine poll where they polled who did the best. I had 70 percent and everybody else had 5 and 6 percent.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I won the debate. And I never debated before.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> What do you think about Marco Rubio's performance? What does that tell you about Marco Rubio?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I was standing next to him, it was an amazing thing, and, you know, I have a good memory and I'm listening and I heard him make the statement. And then -- and that was fine. And then he made it a second time and that was sort of fine, you know, it was OK. But then he made it a third time, fourth time and fifth time and I'm saying am I hearing things? What's going on over here? [Laughter] And I like Marco, but Marco -- you know, I like Marco, but Marco has a tendency to sweat, like perhaps on a record setting level.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I was watching him make these statements five times and he was really hot. He was sweating. And I say -- you know, I'm up there, I want to do my only thing, but I'm saying what's going on? I don't know what kind of an impact that has. H's a nice guy, too, by the way.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He really is. I think he's a good guy. But I think it could have a pretty big impact on him, I just don't know what.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right. Donald Trump.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> We hope to see you here tomorrow.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Yes, come on back tomorrow. [Applause]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I will, I'll come in.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> All right, I love it. [Crosstalk]
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Thank you.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Donald Trump, thank you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hey Chris, thank you very much, Chris. I appreciate it.
<Chris Matthews> <Neutral> Hardball tonight, sir.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> OK, good. You have a deal.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> So joining us by phone, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Donald?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> [On the Phone] Good morning.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Good morning. How are you doing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Neutral> So what's up in Iowa?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I don't get it. I'm going there actually today and I have tremendous crowds and tremendous love in the room and, you know, we seem to have hit a chord. But some of these polls coming out, I don't quite get it. I was No. 1 pretty much in Iowa from the beginning, and I would say we're doing very well there. So I'm a little bit surprised. The other polls, as you know, in other states are extraordinary, actually. This one I on the quite get. I would have thought we were doing much better. I think we are doing much better, actually.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> So Donald, if the polls keep going in this direction in Iowa, do you write it off like a lot of other candidates write Iowa off as a state where candidates like Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum and Pat Robertson do well and then sort of fade away?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I love Iowa, I love the people of Iowa. I've had a great relationship with the people of Iowa. I made a lot of friends there. No, I wouldn't write it off at all. I would fight for it. I'll fight right to the end for it. And if I don't win it, I understand that can happen, but I will be fighting for Iowa.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Donald, good morning it's Willie. We sat around this table and a lot of people have sat around many tables on shows like this and tried to explain the phenomenon in Iowa that's Ben Carson. As you guys sit in strategy meetings, how do you explain his rise in that state?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I don't get it, you know, to be honest with you. You look at different things having to do with Ben and there's a lot of contradiction and a lot of questions. We'll have to see. One thing I know about a frontrunner, you get analyzed 15 different ways from China. A lot of things will come out. You know, like Ben was pro abortion not so long ago as everybody has told me. I don't know it personally, but that's what I'm told -- I've been told and all of a sudden he's so hard on abortion under no circumstance, virtually, can there be exceptions.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And you say, well, how does that happen where you were pro and not long ago, by the way, and then all of a sudden you can't even have exceptions. So that's an unusual stance and I think people will look at that and they will look at lots of other things including what happened in hospitals and what he was working on and a lot of things I hear, I just don't actually get it. But I give credit, but I don't get it.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So Donald, we've had several polls that we just showed where your tally and Ben Carson's tally adds up to 50 percent. And that's 50 percent of the Republican voting bloc wants to elect somebody without any experience in politics. Why is that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I have a lot of experience in politics. You were alluding to it before. All my life I've been involved. Every deal I've done practically has been political in some form, including many deals I've done outside because I'm all over the world. I'm doing many deals right now all over the world. I deal with prime ministers and heads of country. I've always been very political.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> This is the only time I've bean a so-called politician. Four months ago I became a politician which is hard to believe, actually, if you think about it from my standpoint. This is something I never saw happening for myself. I've been a very political person for many years. I do think this, that people are extremely unhappy with their politicians, including the president, including Congress, you look what's going on there, it's a mess. And I think that people are disgusted with politicians.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> So look at these numbers that just crossed. This is CBS News/New York Times" poll. Ben Carson at 26 percent. And you at 22. Within the margin of error. Marco Rubio at eight. Is that -- so look at these numbers that just crossed. This is CBS News/New York Times poll. Ben Carson at 26 percent. And you at 22. Look at these numbers that just crossed. This is CBS News
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Nationally.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> This is a national poll. Nationally. And Marco Rubio is at eight, Carly Fiorina at seven, Jeb Bush at seven.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> It looks right now, Donald, and this is within the margin of error, but it looks right now in the middle of October like a two-person race between you and Ben Carson. Why should Republican voters vote for you instead of Ben Carson?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Because I will make the best trade deals, I will be strongest and best on the military. I will get rid of Obamacare. Ben wants to knock out Medicare. I heard that over the weekend. He wants to abolish Medicare. And I think, you know, abolishing Medicare, I don't think you'll get away with that one. It's actually a program that's worked. It's a program that some people love, actually. So if you look at what is going on with our country, if you take a look at the horrible deals that we've made, including the Iran deal, including even you take a look on a different subject, Sergeant Bergdahl.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We get Bergdahl, they get five killers they wanted for a long period of time. The whole thing is ridiculous. That's why people are unhappy. I'll make some of the great trade deals. I'll bring -- I will bring our jobs back. I'll bring our money back. I'll bring our manufacturing back. Ben can't do that.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> You know, I may be a Carson denier. I have been accusing people of being Trump deniers. But I still think this campaign at the end probably, if I had to bet my own money, would come dome between you and Jeb Bush. You had some tough words for Jeb Bush this weekend. Do you think Jeb has what it takes to be president?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't know. We'll find out. Let's see what happens. I mean so far his campaign has not been good. He spent a lot of money hiring people. He spent tremendous amount -- This is what I mean by negotiating. I've spent the least amount of money of anybody and I have the best result because in every poll, other than these Iowa polls, I'm No. 1. But now I see this new one. But I've spend the least amount of money. Now, you know, you can make the case. I am willing to spend whatever it takes. I have more money than anybody by far. Somebody was saying somebody has $12 million in the bank.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Take a look at how much it costs them to raise money too where Ben has $20 million but it cost him $11 million to raise it and you take that out so you deduct the 11 from the 20. It's unbelievable the amount of money they spend to raise the money. Now in my case I have the money and I'm willing, at the right time, you have to wait for the right time, but at the right time I'm willing to spend whatever is necessary.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Mark Halperin.
<Mark Halperin> <Positive> Good morning, Mr. Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good morning.
<Mark Halperin> <Negative> I want to ask you -- I'm trying to settle once and for all your relationship with polls. When you're ahead in the polls, you cite them. You act like they're scientific gospel. When we see polls where you're behind, sometimes you'll challenge the pollster, the organization, the methodology, the legitimacy of the poll. How do you determine which -- how do you justify or explain attacking polls where you're behind but celebrating polls where you're ahead?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I think you have to understand polls and when I was at school, when I was at Wharton we actually had a case on polls. We had a one month study on polls. I believe in polls. I generally believe in polls. The thing with these polls, they're all so different. They are coming from all over the lot where one guy is up here, somebody else is up there, you see swings of 10 and 12 points and immediately even the same day. So right now its not very scientific. I think it's very hard when you have this many. But overall, Mark, I'm a believer in polls. I think they say something. At least they spot a trend.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Doris.
<Doris Kearns Goodwin> <Positive> As somebody who studied presidents my whole life, just a couple of questions from leadership. One of the them is that one of the things that's attractive about you for many people is that you're not needing money and can you do it on your own. If you were to become president, would you support Citizens United being undone, would you support campaign finance so somebody else can do what you're doing without being a billionaire?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well I think that the whole thing of PACs is a disgrace. I think it's a scam. I think it's a disgrace. I had nine or 11 or some huge number of PACs set up for me by people I don't know. People set them up. I see them on television all the time talking about -- and some are saying, you know, they are all saying sort of good things about me. I have no idea what they will do with the money. They raise money and spend money. But a worse trend has taken -- Because that, you can almost say is the way it's supposed to be. I But if you look at Ben Carson, his PAC is running his Iowa campaign and it's not supposed to be done like that. You look at Jeb Bush where he has his office near his PAC, you know, it's supposed to be totally independent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In theory they are not supposed to be talking to each other and now all of a sudden -- in fact, there was an article yesterday in The Wall Street Journal" where they've just about given up and they're practically taking over the campaigns So the PACs now are totally out of control and those are the people that are like puppets, they're controlling the candidate. I'm the only one that's not -- I disavowed all PACs. I'm the only one that's self-funding. I don't know if I get credit for that --
<Doris Kearns Goodwin> <Positive> I hope you can get it. You keep making this --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In a way I feel foolish. [Crosstalk] But these PACs have totally taken over.
<Doris Kearns Goodwin> <Negative> No, I agree. I agree. Here's the other question. From the guys that I've studied, FDR, Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, LBJ, one of their greatest traits is their ability when they make a mistake to learn from the mistake, acknowledge it and grow. What would you say is the biggest mistake you've made and what you've learned from it that will help you now to become a president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that I have learned that it's -- I want to be extremely cautious with words because you can say one word that you think is great in an audience. You may be in a local audience in New Hampshire, where I have such a great feel and such great friendships in New Hampshire, and you may say something, one word and you know it's a little bit controversial but you're in this audience, and the next day it's the front page of a newspaper. So you do have to be very careful with your language. There's no question about it.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> You said also when you were asked about a month ago what you would do differently, seems like you said that again, you would guard your words a bit more carefully.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think so. You know, it works well in a room with, you know, 1,000 people or 2,000 people and you're all having a lot fun together. But in the meantime, Mark Halperin sitting in the back of the room with his notebook, and it ends up being a somewhat catastrophic word. So everyone is laughing, everyone is having a good time until the next day when I say, you know, I shouldn't have said that. So you have to be very careful with your words.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> So Donald, I'm going to follow up on this because I always ask people, whether I'm asking about a job or whether I'm interviewing them, what the low point in their life is. Not trying to be Oprah or anything, but what was your biggest setback, what did you learn from that, and how did you get off the mat and become a better person because of that?
<Mika Brzezinski> <Negative> Anything.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> What, for you, what was the low point of your life and how did you become a better person by walking through that personal hell?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would say, you know, the loss of my parents. I lost my father and my mother and that was very difficult because I had great parents. But that is something that people go through and it's sort of, that's the way it's supposed to be in the chain of events, but I would say that the loss of my brother. I had a brother, Fred, and he taught me a lot and he was a terrific guy and when I lost him -- because that is not according to the way it's supposed to work -- a long time ago. And I was able to, you know, it was a very tough thing. I was able to get off the mat. But I had a wonderful brother, Fred, who was very instructive and taught me a lot.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> How did that change you? How did that make you a better person, the loss of your brother?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I just think that the fact that I was able to recover from it. He was very instructive. He was able to give me great advice over the years as to alcohol, as to smoking, as to -- you know -- drugs weren't prevalent, I guess, in those days. But it would have been that too. But he gave me great advice over the years. I would say because that's not the chain of events that you expect. That was something that was very tough.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Is that why you don't drink alcohol?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Yes, totally.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Because of his death?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Who knows, if I did, who knows if I'd even be talking to you right now. You know. I do have that type of personality. I may not be on the phone with you right now. So you know, that was actually -- he was a great teacher, in a sense.
<Joe Scarborough> <Neutral> Mike Barnicle.
<Mike Barnicle> <Negative> Donald, in your business career you've assessed the field, your competition and you've almost invariably won. You've beaten them. As you assess the political field in this primary season, who do you think is your biggest opposition and how do you deal with the opposition with that person? Who is the candidate who is the biggest opposition to you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well I thought, just by the normal chain of events, I thought and by, you know, history, it would be Jeb Bush and I guess that's why people said boy, you've really hit him hard -- Because I -- you know, everybody was saying, well he's going to ascend to the throne like we're dealing with thrones in this country, and so far -- I'm not sure what will happen. Who knows what will happen, Mike.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But so far that certainly has been the case. And so I went after him. I'm surprised at Ben Carson, but I go after Ben Carson. Whatever happens, happens. I mean, somebody would say -- oh, you go -- I don't know. That's my whole life. If somebody is an opponent, I want to win. Ben Carson is now doing well and I think Ben Carson has a lot of problems with his record, if you look at his record, including going back in past and, you know, those problems are going to start to come out. It's an amazing -- It's almost like -- When you're in first place, it's like a cleansing action.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Some of it is very unfair cleansing. But it really is like a cleansing action. A lot of things will come out now and we'll see how he holds up to the scrutiny. I've been there for I guess 100 and some odd days and we'll see how it all, you know, how Ben holds up to the scrutiny. But Ben has a lot of things in his past that we'll see. I mean, we'll see how he holds up.
<Joe Scarborough> <Negative> Gene Robinson.
<Eugene Robinson> <Positive> Donald, good morning.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Hi, Gene.
<Eugene Robinson> <Negative> Hi. Listen, there are a lot of people in the Republican establishment I would guess who right now are high-fiving each other because of that CBS poll, because of a poll showing Carson ahead of you, because their theory is that you are just a front-runner, that you won't round from behind, that f you're not ahead and if you can't say that you're ahead in your campaign speeches and rallies, that you will fade, that you will even lose interest, that you don't -- that the one thing you could never stand would be to lose a primary or to not be in first place. Are they right? Are -- does this sort of dampen your enthusiasm for this whole enterprise?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, they're wrong, Gene. You know, I was called by a person that you would know very well, highly, highly respected journalist, and called me about a month ago and said how does it feel? I said how does what feel? How does it feel to do what you've done? This is the summer of Trump. And it's amazing what's happened. How does it feel? And I said, well, it doesn't feel anything I haven't won.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He said, yes, you have. You've done something that nobody has done ever in politics the way you've dominated. And I said, well, I don't consider that dominating because unless you win -- and he said, no, you've already won. And I disagree with him. By the way, somebody you all know very well, a very, very smart guy, who I don't know, but he -- I mean I don't know him well. He just called out of the blue and I don't know, he was going to do a story or is doing a story. The fact is that I consider -- you have to win. I'm in it to the end. Now I think if I don't make it, which, of course, now people say oh, he said he -- but it's certainly a possibility that I won't make it -- I'll still be proud of my effort because I think I've done very well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I'm not a politician. I've run so far a great race. I will continue to run a great race. What happens, Gene, I can't tell you what happens. Who knows. But I think I've done a very commendable job according to almost everybody.
<Willie Geist> <Negative> Donald, one of the big arguments for your campaign has been that you're going to bring the jobs back. They're coming back to America. And you said something yesterday at our town hall that you badgered Ford Motor so much that now they've canceled plans to open a plant in Mexico, bring those jobs back to the United States. Ford came out yesterday after that and said that's just not true. We're still investing in Mexico, not opening any new plants. And John Kasich jumped on it and said the case you're talking about was because of his work and it was in 2011. So did you misspeak about that story yesterday?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No. I just -- I'm saying I've been hitting Ford because they're building this massive plant in Mexico and they should be building it here. And they are bringing jobs back now and I think one of the reasons that they're bringing the jobs back is because I've been hitting Ford very hard in a lot of speeches. And not only Ford, I've been hitting Nabisco -- you know, Nabisco is moving out of Chicago into Mexico.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Many, many -- they're moving a big plant. Many, many companies are moving into Mexico. You know, Mexico's going to be the new China if you want to know the truth. And I've been hitting Ford very hard and they're bringing back -- and I give credit to Kasich, I give credit to everybody. We should be fighting that this shouldn't happen. And he has fought for that. But I'm really saying I think I put a lot of pressure on Ford to make decisions and get things going faster. Now they shouldn't build that plant, they shouldn't have been allowed to build the plant in the first place. We should've kept it here but we didn't that have leaders that could do that, Willie.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> All right, Donald Trump, thank you so much.
<Mika Brzezinski> <Positive> Thank you, Donald.
<Willie Geist> <Positive> Thanks, Donald.
<Joe Scarborough> <Positive> Greatly appreciate it as always.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I would never do that. But they said it's a great plan, and it's certainly a plan to reduce taxes and especially for the middle class. [Begin Clip] The Democrats are too far left, the Republicans are too far right, and I don't think anybody is hitting the cord not the cord that I want to hear and not the cord that other people want to hear. And I've seen it... [End Clip]
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> New York City real estate developer Donald Trump has joined the Reform Party and is actively considering a run for the White House. I sat down with Trump in his New York City office to discuss the campaign, his potential opponents and the likelihood he'll actually run for office. Donald Trump, thanks for joining us on Late Edition.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> Are you running for president?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'm looking at it very seriously, Wolf. It's been a time now. We're getting very encouraged by certain polls and certain numbers that we're seeing. I'll be making a decision in February. It's really a decision as to whether or not I can win the whole thing. I think we can get the Reform Party, but can you win from the Reform Party the whole thing? So we'll make that decision some time in February.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> Well how do you decide if you can win the whole thing?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, it's really instinct and it's going to be some polling numbers that we're doing internally and some other things. And if I think I can win the whole thing, we will probably decide come February to run.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> Will you wait until after the New Hampshire primary in February to decide? Will that be one of the factors that will influence your decision?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't really think so. I think the fact that it looks to me like it's going to be Bush and it certainly seems like Gore is picking up a little bit lately. Bradley has lost some steam. We'll see what happens. But I don't think I'm looking at so much at those primaries. I'm really looking at myself, the polls, the numbers, and how I do how I stack up against various other candidates.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> At this point, are you ready to make a statement as Mrs. Clinton made here in New York this past week? She said she's going to run. She'll make an official announcement after the new year. Are you willing to go that far at this point?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I wouldn't go that far. I mean, I'm looking at it very seriously. I thought her statement was very unusual, to say the least. I was watching it. I said: Gee, what does that mean? She said she's running, but she won't announce for another period of time, and that's a strange statement. I don't want to really partake in that. I want to just look at it very carefully, see, and if I think I can win the whole thing, then come February we'll maybe surprise a lot of people.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> As you know, Russ Verney, the outgoing chairman of the Reform Party, he says that it's a very complicated process to get on these ballots, to get the access. Almost every day that you're not officially in this race, you're losing ground, you're wasting time, you could be doing what you have to do to get on these ballots.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But we are doing certain things, and it's not like we're standing still. Just in the on the case that we do run, we are very much looking at the ballots. We are we're meeting with the various leaders. And I think we'll be in very good shape come February if I decide to run.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> I asked this question of Pat Buchanan a few weeks ago. As you know, he's the only announced candidate for the Reform Party nomination right now. I asked him and I'll ask you: Are you committed to the Reform Party at this point committed enough to say that whoever the Reform Party candidate will be, you will support?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, I'm not. Absolutely not. If Pat Buchanan gets the nomination, I'd have some real problems. I mean, he's an anti-semite or so it seems, and he is certainly somebody that's got a love affair going with Adolf Hitler. He's against blacks, it would seem to me. He's got too many problems. And I don't think I mean, perhaps I lose some points with the Reform Party and that would be fine, but I could not support Pat Buchanan.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> Is that enough of a reason in and of itself, though, for you to challenge him for the Reform Party nomination, to try to prevent his capturing it?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well a lot of people are thinking that I'm running to stop Pat Buchanan, and I'm not. I mean, Pat Buchanan's going to stop himself. And Pat Buchanan can't get elected.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have to remember look, I mean, we're all kidding ourselves. Pat Buchanan is not going to be president of the United States. So there's no fear tactic.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> There's no fear that gee whiz, he's anti-semitic or he's anti-black and he's going to be our president. He has zero chance of being president. So from that standpoint, all you do is stop him from getting the Reform Party nomination ultimately that's not going to mean... I will say this: I think Pat Buchanan could elect a Democrat, because I think a lot of the votes that he gets in the general election would come from Bush or whoever it is that's the Republican, but in particular from Bush. So I mean you look at the polls and you just see what happens. Bush gets decimated if Pat Buchanan runs. A Democrat very likely could win.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> Especially if he gets that $13 million that the Reform Party the matching funds nearly $13 million that would be made available.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Pat Buchanan cannot win, but the Democrat can very much win if Pat Buchanan gets it. And I think otherwise the Democratic candidate's going to have a hard time winning.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> You know, your critics you've heard this your critics say well Donald Trump is not going to be the next president of the United States. He can't get elected either.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, you never know. I mean, it's very interesting. I'd spend the money that's necessary.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> How much money?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> On your show, as an example, I get the highest ratings. I've done very well in polls. I'm way above Pat Buchanan in the polls. I start off higher. I haven't campaigned yet. I haven't even announced that I'm running yet and if I do Larry King Show, if I do Dateline, if I do the various shows we get the highest ratings and they get the highest ratings, and hence I'm on your show today, as a matter of fact, because I suspect that if I came up with a cure for cancer and if I didn't get ratings, you wouldn't put me on. So you, know, no, I don't hate ratings...
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> If you came up with a cure for cancer, I would put you on.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I hope you would, OK. But perhaps you wouldn't.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> But so basically you're convinced that you could be president of the United States if you decide to run?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> If I decide to run, I would spend close to $100 million for my campaign.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> Of your own money?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Of my own money. And I guess you have $13 million sitting in the Reform Party, whatever it is. But a total of about $100 million, which you'd have to spend to win.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And very few other people can do that. I mean, I would do it if necessary. I think that when you look at the kitty that the Republicans or the Democrats have, you're going to have to do that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, Pat Buchanan has no money. He's not going to be able to do it. He's going to be back on "Crossfire" in a number of months, I assume, if he can get the job back. I think that you are going to have to spend a great deal of money in order to get elected, especially coming out of the Reform Party, which has a big disadvantage, because it hasn't been there very long. I mean, the Democrats and the Republicans have been there forever, the Reform Party hasn't. So a lot of money is going to have to be spent. If I spend the money, I think I could win.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> You've heard the talk that if it's Pat Buchanan versus Donald Trump for the Reform Party nomination, the founder of the Reform Party, Ross Perot, might decide, hey, between these two guys, I'm not going to let them take my party. I've spent he probably spent $100 million building up that party, and then would then throw his hat into the ring.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, he may or may not. I mean, his legacy is going to be that he did start a third party, and the third party's going to be a very viable party. If I ran and spent the money and do what I do, I think I could do at least very, very well. But if I thought I could only do very well and get like 20 or 21 percent of the vote and have the record for most independent votes gotten in an election, I would not run on that basis. I'd only run if I thought I could win. Now, nothing's guaranteed in life.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> Sure.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But if I thought I could win, I would spend the money and I would run.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> Well, you're a gambler. So you would have you'd look at the odds and make a decision.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I'd have to look at the odds.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> If it were a three-man race Al Gore, George W. Bush, Donald Trump do you think you'd take more votes away from the Democrat or the Republican?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think the Democrat. And I think that our internal polls show that. But I think the Democrat. I think Pat Buchanan would very, very severely, almost exclusively hurt the Republicans. I think I'd take more votes away. I'd take them from both, but I'd take more votes away from the Democrats.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> I know you've suggested that Oprah Winfrey would be a pretty good vice presidential running mate for you. She says she's not interested. Who else would be a good potential vice presidential running mate?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I really hate to say too many names, because I haven't spoken to anybody about it. It's very premature. But there are lots of people.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, you take somebody like a Jack Welch out of General Electric, who's retiring very shortly. He's done probably the greatest corporate leader in history of a major company. He's a great man, a great guy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Somebody like that would be absolutely incredible. You could get politically, you could get other people. I guess Colin Powell wouldn't do it, certain other people wouldn't do it. Some people would do it. And maybe even Oprah would do it. Who knows? I mean, if I get the nomination, I will have sort of an interesting time. And I think a lot of people that people wouldn't think about and wouldn't think would do it would actually do it if I asked them.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> Have you given some thought to a potential Trump Cabinet?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have thought about it, and I mean, I could give you some names of some very, very rough...
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> Give me some names, because the people are interested in this kind of...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, let's go like HUD. I think Charlie Rangel is a terrific guy. He's a congressman from New York. He has been a powerful guy. Now the Democrats are not in power, but I think he'd be terrific at HUD. Secretary of state, you'd love to see again, you'd like to see a Colin Powell perhaps. Treasury, I'd love to see Jack Welch. I think Jack Welch as treasury would be fantastic. I happened to think Rubin was terrific, and he did an amazing job.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> Secretary of defense?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Secretary of defense I haven't really it's such a tough call, secretary of defense. But there's four or five candidates that I think would be absolutely outstanding.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> Someone like John McCain you'd look at?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, John McCain might be a very interesting candidate.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> For secretary of defense?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> For that.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> All right, let's move on. You're a New Yorker. There's another big race here in New York Mrs. Clinton, Rudy Giuliani not official yet, but everything is indicating that that is going to be a fierce contest. If you were taking a look at that race right now, who would you support?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I support Rudy for one very simple reason: He's been the best mayor in the history of the city of New York, including LaGuardia. And I think Rudy Rudy's just done a great job.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> Does that automatically translate into being a great senator?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, it doesn't. But you know what? If somebody's done something really well and wants to go to another level, I think that person should be supported. He's been a New Yorker. He's done an incredible job. The city is the hottest place in the world right now. New York City is the single hottest city in the world. Hottest meaning great place to be. It's the hottest city in the world...
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> In your book...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Crime is down, everything is down. Rudy has done a great job, he's been a great mayor. And I think if he runs for the Senate he's going to be very formidable, he's going to be very hard only for one reason: because he's been a great mayor.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> But you like Mrs. Clinton too. I mean, in your book, "The Art of the Comeback," you say of Mrs. Clinton, she's a wonderful woman who has handled pressure incredibly well.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I agree with that. I think she's gone through terrible times. I think she's been through more than any woman should have to bear everything public. I mean, women go through this on a private basis and can't take it she's on the front page of every newspaper every week with what went on in Washington. I think she's a wonderful woman, and frankly...
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> Is she qualified to be senator?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think she is. I mean, I think frankly that if she ran from another state I think I'd support her because she's really a very terrific woman. I know her. She stays in Trump Tower when she's in New York. I mean, she stays in Trump Tower. Not because of me, but because of somebody else, she has an apartment in Trump Towers, so at least she has good taste.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> If you had to bet right now who would win that, it's going to be a close contest. Who would win?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's going to be close, but I think ultimately Rudy's going to win because he has done a terrific job. And ultimately people reward what's right. They reward what a man has done or a woman has done. And Rudy has been a great mayor.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> We have to take a quick break. When we return: from Chechnya to North Korea to China, I'll ask Donald Trump what he would do if he were commander-in-chief. Stay with us. [Commercial Break] Welcome back to Late Edition. Now more of my conversation with Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> All right, let's go through some names, very quickly. I'll give you the name, give me a sentence or two what you think about this person and we'll move on. Bill Clinton. Well, I think he could have gone down as a very good and almost great president, primarily because of the economy. And he'll go down as something less than that because of the scandal and that's unfortunate.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> Al Gore.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I always said he was very, very underrated. If his campaign doesn't get into gear, I'll have to take that apart and take that away. But I think he's starting to get it together, and if you look at the numbers, he's starting to make some good headway.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> So you think he'll still be the nominee.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think he'll be. I think he's got hey, look, it's pretty hard as a sitting vice president of the United States not to be the nominee. OK? It's pretty hard. And I think he's going to find a way to pull it off.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> Bill Bradley.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I know him very well. I'm the largest or one of the largest employers in the state of New Jersey, and I know him pretty well.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> When he was a senator.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When he was a senator he was he was a terrible senator. He did a terrible job, very little legislation. The 1986 tax law, as you know, was a disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He destroyed a lot of businesses with that law, and nobody benefited by it except the government had to raise taxes, frankly, to get the money to pay for it. But I think the one thing about Bradley that's interesting is that he would have lost. He dropped out of the Senate race.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He said: I'm not going to run anymore you know, the big moral thing as a great statesman. The fact is, he would have lost. His polls were way down. He almost lost the election before. Christie Whitman who at that time was unheard of and now she's had a great career at that time she was unheard of. She lost by like a half a percent. He would have lost the race and people don't realize that. Now, he's done very well against Gore, but it will be interesting to see. I think that it would be very, very bad to have Bill Bradley as a president. He's almost Marxist in his leanings.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> Two more names Bill Gates.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, you have to say he's tremendous. He's got a vision that's amazing. I hate to see them ripping his company apart.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> All right. Finally, Boris Yeltsin. Donald Trump It's unbelievable.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> I mean, you know, you hear Russia's such a tough place, you see this guy can hardly stand up. He's obviously got a major alcohol problem, among other problems, including his health, but probably caused to a certain extent by alcohol. And he continues to stay.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> So I would say this, he's got to be one tough hombre, but certainly he can't be there very much longer. Would you be handling the if you were president right now the situation in Chechnya differently? As you know, the Clinton administration got involved in Kosovo because of alleged atrocities the Serbs were committing. Yet it's there's a much different policy as far as the Chechnya situation is concerned, despite the allegations, but the Russian troops are engaged in atrocities as well.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think they are engaged in atrocities, and maybe the atrocities are both ways, but they're launching missiles right into the middle of Chechnya and it's terrible. I think with Russia look, Russia's out of control. It's got a leader that, you know, is a disaster. The whole place is a disaster. And we're giving huge billions and billions of dollars to Russian aid. And I think really that would probably stop if it were me, until they straightened out their act.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> Except they still have a lot of nuclear warheads.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have nuclear. And you know what? They'll use this money they're using it on developing more nuclear. Look, as far as nuclear is concerned, in this country us we need a shield, because Russia's unstable and North Korea is unstable.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> A strategic defense system?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We need a missile defense shield, and if we don't have one and if we don't start developing and now, you know, people used to criticize Reagan the fact is now it's very developable. And we need a shield.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> If you want to build this strategic defense shield to prevent against missiles, you have to go ahead and negotiate with the Russians a change in the 1972 ABM the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. What if the Russians say no? No can do?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, look, you just said it a change in 1972. A treaty that was made in 1972. Who knew what was going to happen in terms of technology? It's time for a change and we have to sit down with the Russians and many others. Look at North Korea. North Korea is developing missiles like nobody has ever seen. And we better do something rather quickly with them, hopefully through negotiations. But we better do something rather quickly with them. Russia is...
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> What is I'm a North Korean what if the North Koreans don't play ball, develop a nuclear capability, go forward with their missile development. Does the United States act unilaterally?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Excuse me. If spoken to correctly correctly they will play ball. Look on another front what happened recently where Clinton has asked our trade our so-called trade partners to come so we can renegotiate some fairness into trade, right? They don't show up. They say: We're not coming. Why would Germany show up? Why would France show up? Why would Japan show up? They've been ripping us off for years. So why would they come here? It's ridiculous. So it shows a lack of respect for the United States when you ask for a meeting a summit and nobody shows. Pretty sad, Wolf.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> But is there something the United States should be thinking about doing as far as North Korea's potential nuclear development that is not...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Absolutely. They should be thinking about it, and frankly...
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> Like what? Give me an example.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I'll say this: You go and you start negotiating, and if you don't stop them from doing you will have to take rather drastic actions because if you don't take them now, you're going to be in awfully big trouble in five years from now when they have more missiles than we do. We're a bunch of saps. There's no question that North Korea is developing missiles.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We give them nuclear power plants. We give them tremendous aid because we thought we could bribe them into stop developing. Well, they're developing, so much so that South Korea is now developing their own missile systems in order to protect.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I'm really not sure I can blame them. But North Korea is totally out of control. And would you rather have a very, very serious chat with them now? And if necessary you might have to do something fairly drastic? Or would you rather have to go after them in five years when they have more nuclear warheads and missiles than we do?
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> When you say "something fairly drastic" that sounds like you're suggesting a potential Israeli-like unilateral strike against the Osirak reactor in Iraq in the '80s.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You can never rule it out. What Israel did was fantastic and you can never rule it out. And you know what: If you ruled it out, you couldn't talk to them. Why would they the only thing they're afraid of is exactly what you just said. That's what they're afraid of. That's what they're concerned with. You'll most likely with that attitude be able to make a deal. But if you can't, you have to react. And let me tell you something: Don't react in five years, because if you react in five years, nothing's going to be left. You don't have to worry about your Social Security system anymore.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> All right. Let's talk briefly about your plan to do away with the national debt. People who have a net worth of $10 million would have to play a one-time 14.25 percent tax.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Correct.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> A lot of people have been have been trashing that plan as you well know.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well a lot of rich people aren't in love with it. I'm not in love with it from my standpoint because I'm going to have to write a check. But the fact is...
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> You would have to write a huge check.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I would have to write a very large check. I would have to write a very large check.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> You'd have to liquidate a lot of your assets probably to do that.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Probably I'd have to sell some things, and that's OK. And a lot of people would probably make good deals on those things. But I think that lots of good things would happen.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You'd lower the tax rate for the middle-income workers and the people that really need it the most. You'd be lowering the hell out of the tax rate. You'd get rid of the inheritance tax, which is a 55 percent tax, which is a total disaster.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And interestingly, I've had a lot of people come up to me and tell me that they love the plan rich people  because they cannot figure how to give their businesses to their children. How do we get the businesses out  the farms, the this, the that to the children without losing it? And you'd also save Social Security, which is going to be bankrupt you'll save Social Security. You'd save $200 billion a year and you'd give that back in the form of saving Social Security and tax breaks.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> We have to take another quick break. When we return: If Donald Trump is a man of the people, why won't he shake your hand? We'll find out when we come back. Stay with us.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> [Commercial Break] Does Donald Trump have what it takes to connect with the voters? In the concluding moments of our interview, he tells us. Let's go through a couple of little snippets from your book, "The Art of the Comeback." I just reread it. I'll read a quote from the book.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> Tell me if you still think that this is an accurate quote something you still would stand by. "The problem is I think I'm too honest and perhaps too controversial to be a politician. Honesty causes controversy, and therefore, despite all the polls that say I should run, I would probably not be a very successful politician."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, that may very well be true. I mean, I'm very honest. I'm very straightforward. Actually, you know, I'm so well- known that the American people really at least they know what they're getting. I think I'm a very honest guy, and in fact may be too honest to be a politician.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> And related to that, another quote from this book which came out in 1997...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> ... I believe. "One of the curses of American society is the simple act of shaking hands, and the more successful and famous one becomes the worse this terrible custom seems to get. I happen to be a clean hands freak. I feel much better after I thoroughly wash my hands, which I do as much as possible."
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I certainly haven't changed. I mean look, the concept of the other day a man comes up he's walking at me he sneezes. He grabs his nose. He sneezes. And he sees he grabs "Mr. Trump, how are you?" Now, I'm supposed to shake his hand and be happy with it? The guy's got a terrible cold.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> If you're a politician at the rope line, you've got no choice.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I guess if you're a politician, so maybe therefore who knows. Look, I do the shaking hands. I think it's a terrible custom.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I think it's a very, very terrible custom. A lot of people are agreeing with me. I have more letters on that one subject than anything, where they're saying you're right about shaking hands.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Who needs to do it? But I do it. I do it sometimes begrudgingly. I mean, I've had many cases you're eating dinner and you see some nice gentleman come out of the bathroom and he comes over to you, and he grabs  Oh, Mr. Trump, I want to... Now, the good news is you don't eat that roll. You just keep it away. [Laughter] But the fact is it's almost barbaric in a certain way, and especially nowadays. I don't think it's good, but I do it.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> And scientists say, a lot of germs are passed along colds and other diseases.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I've had a lot of good reviews on that. I mean, I think you're maybe trying to be a little bit critical of that in terms of politics, but I've had a lot of good reviews. They've done a lot of stories on my little statement about shaking hands. And a lot of scientists have come out and said, you know, I don't know if it's a nice thing to say, but Trump happens to be right. A lot of germs are passed. So if we can avoid it, we can avoid it.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> And related, this is a self-serving question there's chapter headline in the book entitled "The Press and Other Germs."
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> You don't like the press?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, I think some of the press are extremely talented and honorable and honest people. I think some of the press is total scum. I mean, I know people very well for many years and I deal with the press and I've dealt with them all my life. And I've met some really fine characters and I've met some terrible, terrible human beings that are very, very dishonest.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> All right. That's pretty fair. Let's move on and finally wrap it up. If you were president of the United States, who would you look to as an example of a past president that you would want to emulate?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think just to go into the recent past. I think Ronald Reagan was a great president because he really was a wonderful example maybe more look, he was conservative and I'm conservative. He was this  he was... But he was more than anything else he was a great example for this country in so many different ways. It was relatively a scandal- free administration. But he was just a fine man and a fine example. So I think probably, at least in the reasonable recent past, I'd have to go with Ronald Reagan.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> And when you say it was a scandal-free administration, there was Iran-Contra.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> There was...
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> But there were no personal scandals.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But it was yes. He was just a very very upstanding kind of guy.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Negative> But you have to admit that the Clinton-Lewinsky affair and the, you know, the country seems to be sick of the whole personal scandal. Donald Trump, he brings to if you were the president of the United States there's a well-documented record out there. Would that be a distraction, as president, though?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't take drugs. I've never had drugs in my life. I've never had a glass of alcohol. I've never had a cup of coffee and I've never had a cigarette. I do love women, but I'm single and I'm allowed to do that, I guess. But I respect women. I admire women. And if that's supposed to be bad, then I'm guilty.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Neutral> And you want a woman to be your running mate, maybe?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's very possible. I have great respect for women.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> Thanks for joining us on Late Edition.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Wolf Blitzer> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Congratulations. Last night you -- now you're -- is it -- is it sinking in? Is it getting real?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Very, very close. Well, we're very, very close. We're -- we're very close with the delegates. And the thing that makes me most happy, in the history of the Republican Party, nobody has ever gotten this many votes. So...
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You still have a lot of states to go.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we have a lot to go. So it's been such an honor. It's been a lot of fun. And it must be because I do your show. I think that might be it.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> I think that's a big part of it. That's what I... [Laughter]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I agree with you on that part.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have a feeling.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Today was a very big day. You have a list of names.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And you had talked to me for a while now about releasing these names, your judicial philosophy. You said you wanted originalists. You said you wanted people like Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's true.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Tell us about this list of names.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I've been having a lot of feedback from a lot of different people. And I've had, as you know, tremendous endorsements. And I'm a conservative. And I may have different views on different things, and I think I'm extremely conservative, as an example, on trade. But a conservative would say I'm not because I don't necessarily believe only in free trade.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know what I believe on trade is good deals for the United States.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Fair trade.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, somebody said to me, what do you -- what is your view on trade? I said my view is good deals for the United States. It's a very simple view.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if you can call it conservative, call it whatever you want -- but so with the judges, they were saying, Well, what happens if he appoints the wrong judges? And what we did -- and I -- I just have it -- we just took a list of judges... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> ... and I thought what I would do is put this forward, and this would be the list that I would either choose from or pick people very close in terms of the spirit and the meaning of what they represent. And of course, Justice Scalia is mentioned in here as -- right up front as being just one of our great judges and one of our great justices.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I came up with a list. The Federalist Society was very much involved. Various people were involved. As you know, Jeff Sessions is, to me, somebody that I have great respect for.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> It's gotten...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He endorsed me.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> It's gotten very good reviews.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's gotten great reviews.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> [Inaudible] immediate release and...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's gotten great reviews, the people that have seen it have given it. So if you want, I will...
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I will do it now, if you'd like me to read them. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I don't -- I hope your people aren't going to fall asleep as I read them...
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> No, it'll take a second. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Highly respected conservative people, again, Federalist -- Federalist Society and others -- and others with the input.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Steven Colloton of Iowa, a man who is really an amazing person. Allison Eid of Colorado, Raymond Gruender. And Raymond is from Missouri. Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania. Raymond Kethledge -- Raymond Kethledge of Michigan. Joan Larsen, also of Michigan, where I think I'm going to do very well, by the way, in the general election. I think we're going to do very well. Thomas Lee of Utah. William Pryor...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> By the way, Thomas Lee of Utah is related to Mike Lee.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Brother.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Brother.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right. And Mike Lee is a -- a great guy. And his brother is highly respected. William H. Pryor of Alabama, David Stras of -- and somebody that a -- a friend of mine who is a -- a great lawyer, said is -- this is a fantastic man. David Stras of Minnesota. Diane Sykes of Wisconsin. Don Willett of Texas.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And that's your list. And we're going to either choose from this list or people very close to it in terms of their...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> So this is your judicial philosophy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> You...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That's right.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> ... you know, one of the things I think people have questioned - - I have interviewed you a lot during this process, and you gave me very specific things. And one of the top things I would ask you often is your judicial philosophy. You mentioned, as I said, Scalia and Thomas. They are what we call originalists.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Constitutionalists.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Correct.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You are a constitutionalist.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Correct. Correct. And I'm also -- I want high intellect. I want great intellect. These people are all of very high, high intellect. They're pro-life. And -- so that's my list.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And we are going to choose from, most likely, from this list. But at a minimum, we will keep people within this general realm. And again, I have a lot of people that are conservative that really like me, love everything I stand for, but they really would like to know my view because perhaps outside of the defense of our country, perhaps the single most important thing the next president is going to have to do is pick Supreme Court justices.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> This will have an impact for generations to come.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, generations. And I will say, if Hillary Clinton, who's doing very poorly in this whole rigged system that...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> We'll get into that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... that Sanders happens to be in...
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... but if Hillary Clinton, for some reason, wins, your country will never be the same because she's going to put disasters on the Supreme Court. So these are -- these are the names.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> This is interesting because I think there might have been some people -- I -- I've talked to people on the radio show. And some people said, well, Donald Trump's a recent covert to conservatism. And I asked you very specific question. For example, you know, you say -- do you want a balanced budget?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> I do.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You actually told me once it's immoral to steal from our kids.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I do want a balanced budget. We could do it a lot quicker. I mean, I've heard people say we'll balance the budget within 20 years. I'm saying, 20 years, what are you talking about?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I do want a balanced budget. And you have to understand, I was born in New York, and I really started my business -- you know, I was in Brooklyn and Queens with my father, but I moved to Manhattan and I started doing very, very well in Manhattan.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And if you look at the statistics on Manhattan, whether you, you know, like them or don't like them, it's very liberal. It's very Democrat. And I think that, you know, probably a lot of people feel because I come from essentially Manhattan, I would be that way.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I wanted to put this list out because I wanted to quell any fears that people may have. I mean this is a list of people that I got them from people I most respect, very conservative people.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> And you vetted each one. You -- you almost did it like a job interview.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I really -- I vetted, but to a much greater extent, the Federalist Society vetted and -- and has tremendous respect. Heritage has looked at it, who I have great, great respect for. And I know Senator Sessions has brought the names around to different people in the Senate.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And people have seen the list. I mean, people have seen the list. But you're the first one that's seen it publicly.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes. You know, this is, I think, the most important thing, as you now transition to the general election. You talked about very specific things. And I think when you look at all the exit polls and 65 percent of Republicans feel betrayed by the Republican Party that they haven't kept their promises...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I felt betrayed.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I felt betrayed, too.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> One of the reasons I'm doing this.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I mean, I had a very nice life. I had a very simple life. I have this great company. I have a wonderful family. I complicated my life, that I can tell you, although I'm having a good time doing it. But no, I'm having a good time...
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> [Inaudible] bottom line. I noticed your financial statement. You're still doing OK financially.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We're doing well. We -- we put in our financials two days ago, and people are seeing you -- I've built a great company. That's why -- so people say, Why are you doing this? You know, you're at a point where you can just take it nice and easy and go to Turnberry in Scotland and go to Doral and do all these things that you want to do.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I'm doing it by -- you know, I'm putting back -- I want to put back.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You want to give back?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I -- I want to give back, put back. I want to -- I want to -- what I want to do is make America great again. You know, the theme is such a great theme. And I didn't even realize it was that good until I started really getting out there. And I add to it. And it's called America first.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We're going to put America first. On trade deals, it's like we make deals, they're so bad. They're so inconceivably bad. And I said, No, no, we want you all to do well. This is America first.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> When China is ripping us to -- you know, you look at trade deficits of $500 billion a year, who's negotiating this deal?
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You want fair trade. You're not a protectionist. You want better deals.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want fair trade.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The problem with fair trade -- the people we have now are incompetent. Our president is -- you know, he -- he used a word the other day, not a nice word, but he's an ignorant president. He's an ignorant president. He doesn't know what's going on, in my opinion, OK, and the opinion of plenty of other people.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Well, statistics also speak. Millions more in poverty, millions more on food stamps, median income down thousands of dollars. He has taken on more debt than every other president [Inaudible] ...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You're right, but it's not only that.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> By the way... [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> One in five American families don't have a single member of the family working today.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> OK. And so much more. Look, so much more. And you say that and - - and I hear you say that, but so much more. We're losing... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... our jobs. They're moving to Mexico. Listen, our jobs -- you look at Carrier, you look at Ford, you look at all these companies, Nabisco. They're moving plants to Mexico. We're losing our jobs. We're losing our money. We have -- we're not making things. Pretty soon, we're not going to make anything anymore.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I just felt I had an obligation to do this. You look at our trade deals, I will make those deals so good so fast. And you know what? We'll have great relationships with these countries. We don't have a good relationship with China. China's building a massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea, OK?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And yet they're ripping money from us left and right. We rebuilt China single-handedly. What they've taken out of our country -- we have rebuilt China.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have -- they have railroads and trains that go 250 miles an hour. We have the Long Island Railroad that chugs out to Long Island, Chug, chug, chug.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I've been on it many times.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> We don't have anything. We're like -- we've become a third World country. I'll tell you what...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> We're becoming one.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... a lot of the technology is our technology. I mean, we're selling technology to the world, and we don't have it ourselves because we've spent $4 trillion plus in the Middle East. We're in worse shape now than we were 15 years ago.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Fifteen years ago, if we wouldn't have done anything, we would have been much better. You wouldn't have had the migration. You would have had a couple of dictators, killers. They call them strongmen. They can call them whatever they want. And they were good at one thing, killing terrorists.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And right now, you look at Iraq, that's like Harvard for terrorism.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I want to stay on this focus, though, because you made a promise to release the names so people would know your judicial philosophy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You're making a promise to balance the budget. You're making a promise to build the wall. You made a promise you're going to repeal "Obama care'...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A hundred percent.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> ... and replace it with...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We have no choice.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Replace it with?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By the way, you don't even have to repeal it. We're going to do it before it happens.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> It's falling [Inaudible]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> In '17, it's going to implode. And in fact, on November 1st, new numbers are coming out, right before the election. They're trying to change the date. They want to make it after the election. And it's going to show the increase necessary to sustain "Obama care." And it's going to be massive. Everyone's talking about it.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Are these promises...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Don't let anybody change that date.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> And you want to replace it with health savings?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh...
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Accounts maybe?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Yes. But there's so many other things. Just so you understand, once we get competition going with free enterprise, where the insurance companies actually have to go and compete instead of having states as a monopoly, you get rid of the borders, you get rid of the lines, right, where they can't go outside.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Once we get rid of that -- and they almost had it this time. They could have had it this time. And you would have seen such competition. There will be plans -- health care plans -- that you never even heard about that haven't even been thought about right now. There will be such competition, it will be a beautiful thing.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The numbers will go way down. First of all, "Obama care" is no good. The -- the premiums are through the roof. But have you looked at deductibles lately?
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> It's huge.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Unless you're dead...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Five thousand...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Unless you're dead or in the process of almost death, you can't use it.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> What I'm trying to get to is, is with the release of this -- these names -- that was a big promise. Balancing the budget is a big promise. Building a wall is a big promise. Repealing "Obama Care" is a big promise. I understand you're giving a speech next week on energy independence.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> That's a big promise.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> In North Dakota.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Building our military, taking care of our vets, those are big promises. Ending Common Core.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> So my question is, on those agenda items that you have told me about in our interviews, how rock solid are -- are those promises for the people that may be on the fence that want to know you're going to do those things?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I want to get it all done.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You want to get it all done.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Look, our military -- I saw a show the other day, perhaps not even on your -- on the great FOX -- but I saw a show the other day where our fighter planes are so old that they go to junkyards to get parts. They call them graveyard, airplane graveyards -- to take parts off old planes that haven't been flown in 25 years. They're taking parts off these planes and trying to put them on and fix them on our fighter jets.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We are really in trouble. Our military is so depleted.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> We got to take a break. We'll come back. We're with Donald Trump. We'll talk about Hillary Clinton, The New York Times and all the other issues that are now facing the country as we continue with Donald Trump for the hour from what I guess is the Trump war room, straight ahead. [Commercial Break]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Donald Trump is with us for the hour. I watched your daughter, Ivanka, this morning, and she had to say, My dad is not a groper. Now, this is referring to a New York Times hit piece.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I have, in the last three days, interviewed three people that know you well, two that were featured prominently in that piece. We have Rowanne Brewer Lane...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> ... Carrie Prejean and a woman that actually came from war-torn Bosnia that worked for you and ran a lot of -- was a vice president...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> ... for you, Sunnata Assam.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Three women. They were absolutely livid at The New York Times piece. We now discover that this particular writer had been tweeting negative things about you. This is supposed to be the paper of record. Twenty pages, and it's now been completely debunked!
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Does that anger you?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, first of all, I have to thank those women, Rowanne and Carrie and all of them...
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... because they were written about and they were furious...
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> [Inaudible] girl from Utah, too.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And, you know, usually -- and the girl from Utah who's just -- she's -- they made -- they said I kissed her on the lips, I guess in front of her parents with thousands of people. And now she's come out and said this is crazy.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> By the way, you know, it's not like the worst thing because, OK, you look at what Clinton's has gone through with all of the problems and all of the things that he's done.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the -- it was so -- to -- to read this piece on the front page of The New York Times, which was, I think, their most read story in the last year, according to what they say, and to read it -- and to have these young women come out and say, That didn't happen, that's not what we said, that's not what we -- it was the intent.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And I was so furious at that story because there's nobody that respects women more than I do, Sean. You know that. And I treat women with respect. And I have -- we all have fun. We all have good times. We say - - but -- and I'm also in the entertainment business and certain things -- as an example, they have me making a statement about we're going to essentially stop them or we're going to say something very nasty. I was talking about either China or Mexico. I was talking about one of the countries because they've been ripping us off.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> That was their punch line for this commercial, this phony commercial, paid for by Wall Street, by the way, I have to tell you, paid for out of a super-PAC. And they put a commercial on about the women...
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> I think they spent $130 million.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, yes. But just so you understand, the main punch line wasn't about women. So they put it in, like it was about women, you know, with a blank. They put it in like it was about women. Now I guess they have to do a retraction.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> These are dishonest people. These are really dishonest people. Nobody respects women...
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Are you demanding a retraction...
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> ... more than I do.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> ... from The New York Times?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> We are already talking to The New York Times. The New York Times is very upset because it turned out to be a total con job. The piece was a con job. And you know, it's one thing, it's inside the paper, because that happens to me all the time, especially with The Times, and frankly, I could mention plenty of others.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But you know, if you're a Republican conservative, it's very, very hard to get good press, that I can tell you.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> I speak from experience.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> You are -- you are shunned. No, no, I'm telling you...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> I know! [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's really -- it's really unfair. But this was a con job. And -- but just think of it. These women, instead of just saying, Oh, that's too bad, who cares, they were incensed that they were portrayed the way they were portrayed.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And all of them got up and said, We respect Donald Trump. We really like Donald Trump.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> [Inaudible] what they said, though?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He did absolutely nothing wrong. And they're writing -- now, here's the thing. Anybody reading that story, Sean, they make me look back.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> But Carrie and -- and particularly Rowanne both said they purposefully manipulated what they were saying and that they did it on purpose because they had said just the opposite.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I thought it was so amazing because I saw -- I saw Carrie on your show and Rowanne has been all over. And she -- and I didn't speak to her specifically, OK, because I didn't think it would be good if I called her to thank her. I didn't want to do that and let this go by and -- I will absolutely.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> But I will tell you, to -- to think what they did -- they put themselves out on the line to do this for me. For me. And I haven't spoken to them...
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> [Inaudible] .
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- in many years. So I -- I just have such respect for them. But it just shows you -- I'll tell you, it's been a disaster for The New York Times because The New York Times is a whole big con job.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> But this is going to be the campaign. This will -- the Clintons...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Oh, I know.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> ... are known for being very dirty.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the good thing about this, this sets the table. You know, this sort of sets the stage. People have seen this. People have seen Carrie. They've seen Rowanne. They've seen others now that are coming forward that were mentioned in that story, which, frankly, wasn't even that bad, if you want to know the truth. It's not like I -- I hope that people that haven't read it...
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> [Inaudible] 20 pages printed!
<Donald Trump> <Negative> No, no, but I mean -- in one case -- I don't know -- it's, like, minor stuff. I said to one of the women, I said, don't eat -- you shouldn't have a piece of candy, OK? [Laughter]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> That was...
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I tell my kid that all the time.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> How do you compare that against Clinton, OK, what Clinton has done?
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> What about what Clinton's done? How big an issue should that be in the campaign? For example, I looked at The New York Times. Are they going to interview Juanita Broderick? Are they going to interview Paula Jones? Are they going to interview Kathleen Willey?
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> In one case, it's about exposure. In another case, it's about groping and fondling and touching against a woman's will.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And rape.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And rape.
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> And big settlements, massive settlements.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars for Paula Jones.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And lots of other things. And impeachment for lying.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Smearing, besmirchment of women.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And losing your law license. And he lost his law license, OK, couldn't practice law. And [Inaudible] read about this on Clinton.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Let me ask you...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now -- now The New York Times, and if you look at Stephanopoulos, these are like the pipe organs for Hillary Clinton. Stephanopoulos, I get on his show the other day. It started -- I -- I couldn't believe it. And I actually said to him, Look, obviously, you're representing -- you're, you know, privy -- he gave a lot of money to the foundation, he did a lot of -- he never told anybody. Never told anybody.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you look at some of the people, the dishonesty. I'll tell you what. I'm in a pretty tough business, real estate. I meet some tough people. But I have never seen lies and deception like I see in not only with the people and not only with the politicians, but when you're in politics, it is a deceiving -- it's really a pretty rough profession. And I will say this, the political press -- worse than anything else is the political press... [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> ... dishonest.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Well, they're talking to us right now, so we'll see what happens.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right, we'll take...
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But they know. They -- the -- I think The Times actually -- look, they got caught in a very bad situation.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> When we come back, we'll continue from Trump Tower and the Trump war room, political war room. It's Hannity. [Commercial Break]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You are getting very close. These polls are neck and neck with Hillary Clinton. Now, Hillary Clinton lost West Virginia 51-36. You have talked about the system on the Democratic side being rigged.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> OK, so Bernie Sanders wins 18 delegates, she wins 11. But then you have the superdelegates. He won 51-36. He got 19 delegates, Hillary got 18.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's a rigged system.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> That's corrupt!
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I have to say, it was rigged on the Republican side. The only way I could win was winning in landslides. And I had so many landslides that, you know, I ended up winning. But if I didn't, if I was winning close races, there was no way I could have won.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, the Republican actually was more sophisticated because they don't do the superdelegates. With the Democrats, they do superdelegates. It's so obvious.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> West Virginia is very interesting because Hillary Clinton -- no miner or no steelworker could ever vote for Hillary Clinton. She said she's going to put the mines out of business and she's going to put the miners out of business. She's going to put them out. She's going to get rid of the -- and then -- that was a week before. I know -- I don't know what happened to her, how she says a thing like that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But she said we're going to put the miners and the mines out of business. And then she goes into West Virginia and she gets killed. She gets actually...
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> And she got half the delegates.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And she got half the delegates. I saw that. She got, like, almost half the delegates or maybe half the delegates. And if you add the supers on, it's more than that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So it's a rigged system. And I'm no fan of Bernie, but I will tell you he is not being treated fairly.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You're going to give this speech on energy. I think energy independence is a key to jobs, and I don't want to be dependent on countries that hate our guts for oil.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> A hundred percent.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Is it going to be coal, fracking?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's going to be coal. It's going to be fracking.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Drilling, nuclear?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> It's going to be everything. [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> It's going to be everything. It's going to be everything.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right, let me ask you this question. Obama has been taking shots at you. He took a shot at a commencement speech this weekend.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> What do you say back to him in terms of the job that he's done, in your opinion?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You know, it's interesting. I have somebody that knows him very well. And four years ago, I was thinking about running. And my friend said he was obsessed with Donald Trump running, that he thought it was going to be -- he just was obsessed with the fact that Trump -- and I -- ultimately, I decided not to do it and I decided to do it this time.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I don't know if that was a good decision or a bad decision. I think it was actually -- I think we're going to do great this time. I think I would have beaten him last time, frankly, had I decided to run.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But he is now, I'm -- I'm definitely on his mind. I mean every time he speaks, he mentions my name...
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> [Inaudible] .
<Donald Trump> <Positive> -- which is an honor. I think it's probably not a bad thing.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Let me go to Hillary. She keeps saying -- I know you released your financial statements again.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> She wants your tax returns.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You have talked about her connection to Wall Street and big banks. She has given speeches where she has made, in one hour, more than what Americans -- the average American will make in five years...
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> ... economically. She won't release her speeches.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, they've just announced they made, like. $7 million just now...
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- just from making some speeches. Look, first, my tax return. I'm under a very routine audit, and it's a -- and you saw my tax returns. They're -- I mean, they're -- I mean they're -- if you put them on the floor, they're up to here -- a very complicated, but a routine audit.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> And I have -- for 15 years, I have been audited. It's very unfair. I mean, I'll -- I'll be honest because I have very rich friends that never get audited. So it's just -- and I hope it's going to be before the election. I hope. I won't do it. But no lawyer -- in fact, I was interviewed by Greta, who you know very well. She's a lawyer.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> She's a friend.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Supposed to be a very good lawyer. She said, Well, I happen to agree, there's no way anybody that's under audit -- routine audit's a standard -- and you know, with the IRS, but there's no way that anybody under audit could release them until the audit is finished. Greta said that.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Here's the thing. Hillary, now I understand, they're missing 30,000 e- mails -- 30,000! She said they had to do with the wedding, OK.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And she said yoga, a wedding, a funeral and e-mails to Bill, but Bill doesn't e-mail.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So for her to be talking about tax returns, where, by the way, you learn nothing. [Crosstalk]
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> ... should release them?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think the speeches should be released, but I don't know, you know, what she's doing. I -- I know what you're probably going to see is really, really negative statements having to do with who's she's running against right now, Bernie, because I would imagine she made very positive statements toward Goldman Sachs and all the people that paid her all this money.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> She wanted their money.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> She wants their money. I mean, she wants this money. And she doesn't want people to see those speeches because if you listen to her, you know, she's going to protect everybody from the big bad banks and the investment bankers. And then if you see the speeches, they'll say, Wow, she's not protecting us at all.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But listen, how can she be asking for anything when they're missing right now 30,000 e-mails, when she's under FBI investigation for being essentially a very dishonest person? I don't even know how she can run.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Honestly, people have been destroyed, their lives have been destroyed for doing a tiny fraction, Sean, of what she's done.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You know, look at David Petraeus.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look at Petraeus. Look at many others. And it looks -- by the way, it looks like she's being protected by the Democrats. I mean, it looks like she's being totally protected.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Well, I don't know when this is ever going to end. This is the longest investigation ever.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It looks like it will never end.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Let me ask you about Mitt Romney, Ben Sasse, Bill Kristol, and then to a lesser extent Jeb Bush and -- and Lindsey Graham, who didn't keep their promise to -- to support the nominee. But those three in particular, Romney and Sasse and Kristol, keep talking about a third party. Wouldn't that elect Hillary?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the judges that I just went over with you will never be on the Supreme Court, that I can tell you. And with me, they will be on the Supreme Court. And, you know, we could get three to five. It could even be five. Somebody said probably three, it could be four. It could be, actually, five.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You will never see judges like I just got, the Federalist Society, great, everybody respects it. The list has gotten rave reviews. I don't know if you've seen that, but it's gotten rave reviews. Those judges, you can forget that. They'll never be on the Supreme Court or judges like them, never be on the Supreme Court.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Now, Sasse, I don't know. But I had a huge victory in Nebraska recently. You saw that.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> He was --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I won everything. And he was just condemned by the party --
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> -- in Nebraska. But I had a huge victory in Nebraska. I don't know him. I never met him. He might be a very nice guy. But I watched him on television. The level of hatred was incredible. I never met the guy.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But very important, Mitt Romney, look, he lost last time and he should have won. When he was going to run, I was very tough on him. I said, look, he choked. He's a choker. He choked. And I said very loud and clear, you can't let him run again, he should have beaten Obama. That was an easier race, in my opinion, than this race, OK.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> It's all about electoral votes now. You need to get to 270. You've been through all of these states now. What states will Donald Trump put in play that maybe somebody else wouldn't?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> So if I run, we're going to have a lot of additional states. If let's say Ted Cruz. I say it with respect, but let's say Ted Cruz or somebody else got the nomination, they had a little tiny group of states --
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Thread the needle.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> And if they lose one of those states, it's over, right? They have to win Florida. They have to win Pennsylvania. They have to win Iowa. And any little movement, any -- you lose, you have two votes go the wrong direction, it's over.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The fact is, and a lot of people don't understand this, but the people that are in the world of politics fully understand it. It's a much tougher road for a Republican to win the presidency. Now, you can run for the Senate, you can run for governor, fine. Everything is -- but for -- to -- for a Republican to win, it is a very tough road, the presidency. OK, Michigan is in play. I think New York might be in play. Can you imagine if I won New York?
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> New York and New Jersey.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think New York might be in play. New Jersey, I think I'm going to do great in New Jersey. These are states that other Republicans wouldn't even go to.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You said something last night. You said if I didn't fight as hard as I fight, I wouldn't be here today.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I think that's true.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Is that the same for the general?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> No, I think that's true.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> You'll fight that hard.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's the same. Look --
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> It has to be.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> You have to be true to yourself. I mean you're -- I was a good student. I'm like a smart person. And, you know, you listen to things, it's so tough. If you're a Republican, especially if you're a conservative Republican, what you go through is incredible. I even talk about my uncle was a professor at MIT, just a highly, highly respected intellect. I mean, I come from a very smart family.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Yes.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I like to talk about it because conservatives are abused. They're abused by the media, falsely abused, but really abused by the media. But I put so many states into play, Michigan being one, Illinois. States -- I'll tell you what, the state of Washington, I was in Washington last week, the state of Washington. We had crowds that were the biggest they've ever had. They've never had crowds like that. They said it was like an Elton John came and we broke that record. Oregon, nobody would even think about Oregon. I'm going to campaign there. These are states that are locks for the Democrats.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> It almost reminds me a little bit, the crowd size, enthusiasm of Obama in 08. Do you -- do you feel --
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I do. I went to California. Everyone said California, give it up. I'm not going to give it up. I'm going to play California. Now, maybe I won't win and I know the odds are against me and all that. We went to Costa Mesa last -- two weeks ago. We had 31,000 people. It was a record for this incredible amphitheater. We had 31,000 people. Nobody has ever seen anything like that.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> We've got to take a break, though.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Good.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> I'm going to hold you right there. We'll come back. We're with Donald Trump as we continue from Trump Tower. [Commercial Break]
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Everyone is wondering who's -- who's on Donald -- Donald Trump's short list for V.P. You've got to give us a hint. Give us something.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Look, I have five or six people I really like, I respect. I've gotten along with them. I think it's very important that we get along. But I don't want to mention any names. It's too soon. I'm going to announce, in terms of vice president, we'll announce at the convention. I really hope to be able to keep it secret. I know you'll be calling every day trying to find out.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> That's my job.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> But that's your job. But -- and you do it well. But I really have a group of great people.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Is there one or two that really are in your mind --
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> Or three maybe.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Maybe three --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes, yes, three that I really think a lot of.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> And you want somebody that's, you said, connected to Washington.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I want probably -- and we have a couple of other alternatives. But I want somebody ideally who's very political, who's very strong with getting legislation passed. I'll be -- I'll do great with our trade deals and with our business and with a lot of that. And we're going to make our country rich again. We're going to make our country strong again.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But I want somebody that can deal with Congress, can deal with the Senate, can deal with our Congress people so that we can get something passed. You know, Obama signs his executive orders all day long because he can't get along with anybody. It's not the way it's supposed to work, as you understand.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> You're not a conventional candidate. This has not been a conventional campaign in any way. I asked you the last time you were on about potential key rivals. Look at the people that are supporting you -- Rudy Giuliani, Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, Ben Carson, Rick Perry endorsed you on my show.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Right.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> Bobby Jindal, Jan Brewer. What about announcing some other positions, secretary of state, secretary of defense?
<Donald Trump> <Neutral> We may do that and --
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Homeland Security.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Some of the people on that list, not all of the people, but some of the people on that list I really like and I think will be fantastic when given the right. I mean I've seen Rudy. Rudy has been a fan for a long time. I think Newt has been incredible. I just spoke to Newt, actually, about something, and he has great ideas. I'll tell you what, there's no -- there's no lack of ideas coming out of Newt Gingrich.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Funny, they come 24-7.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> He's a great guy.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> All right, let me go through the scandals, because you said about Hillary, she's totally controlled by Wall Street. You got the Clinton Global Initiative literally that they're funneling money to a friend. That broke. You obviously have the email server scandal. You've got the Benghazi scandal. You have the abuse of women scandal. She said that she is going to appoint Bill Clinton to --
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Yes.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> -- run the economy. Isn't that the job of the president.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Well, first of all, Bill Clinton is the one that signed NAFTA. In the history of our country, that's been the worst trade deal ever.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Isn't that her job?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> What that has done to this country -- that has cleaned out our factories. I mean I go -- hey, look, I've just gone through New York. We won in landslides, New York and Maryland and Pennsylvania and Connecticut and all of these places. And I've toured them because, you know, I wanted their votes and they were all great.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They have been cleaned out, 50 percent down with manufacturing, almost every one of them, 45 to 50 percent down. These -- these companies have moved to Mexico, they've moved to different places. NAFTA is a disaster. It was Bill Clinton's deal. He's the one that signed it. And for him to be involved with the economy is -- is a joke, OK. It's a joke.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Now, people didn't see the effects until later, because NAFTA took effect a little bit later, after he was gone. NAFTA is probably the worst -- one of the worst deals we've ever signed in this country from the standpoint of economic development or jobs.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> It seems like she almost wants to run with him.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> But let me ask a more important question. The Clinton Foundation, beyond funneling money to a friend labeled by the Secret Service "Energizer," a special friend of Bill's, but a more important issue. You talk about abuse of women. You talked about their personal lives. You talked about the smears, slander, besmirchment.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Here's a bigger question. The Clinton Foundation took all this money from Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia doesn't let women drive. They can't vote. They can't go out in public without a male relative. They have to get permission to go to school or work, and women are told what to wear. Now, I've never been able to find a quote of Hillary -- the Clinton Foundation took millions from the Saudis -- of her criticizing the mistreatment of women there.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But you have other cases and you have many other cases in there. And, you know, they talk about women and the abuse of women and forget about abuse by him directly. Look at what's going on and look at who gave them a lot of their money. So -- and what did all of these -- [Crosstalk]
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What did all of these places where they give millions of dollars for speeches, what did they get? And they got a lot. And you know that and everybody knows that.
<Sean Hannity> <Neutral> So in other words, they're buying influence.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, the press isn't covering it. I mean, to me, that's possibly, I don't know, the email to me, this -- you know, when you talk about national security, that's about as clear as it can get.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Well, it certainly bought their silence.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> What did all of these countries and others get in return for paying millions of dollars for speeches? They got a lot.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> We'll take a break. We'll come back. More with Donald Trump, when we come back. [Commercial Break]
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> All right, so there's a bill that passed unanimously because we have these 28 redacted pages from the Commission report on 9/11. And it appears that the Saudis had connections to and may have financially assisted those people that attacked our country. Now, they said they passed a vote unanimously. The president won't sign it. Shouldn't America have the right to see those pages, and should those families have the right to sue? And what would you do if you were president?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> The answer is yes, they should. And, you know, we got into a war in Iraq that I was totally opposed to. But Iraq did not knock down the World Trade Center, Sean. So we fought -- and they didn't have weapons of mass destruction either, by the way. And you look at what's happened since then and it's been a disaster. And the way Obama got out was a total catastrophe. And just look at what's happening.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But the answer is yes, we have to get to the bottom of it. And everybody wants to keep it quiet. Everybody wants to keep it secret. I don't -- I think most people know pretty much what's on those papers, but people do have the right to sue and they should have the right to sue. They lost their loved ones --
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Why do they protect the Saudis. The Saudis have been duplicitous -- I understand they're Sunni and we've got to battle them against the Iranian Shia. I understand that. But don't we need to hold them accountable a little more than they've been held accountable?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Well, I look at it also differently. We protect the Saudis, we protect many countries. We are -- we're the military for many countries, and they don't pay us. And they don't pay us what they should be paying us. Do you know what the difference they -- of our -- of our country, if somebody like me can go in and very nicely say folks, you've got to pay up, because the Saudis wouldn't be there for two weeks if we weren't there protecting them.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> And they're tear driving the prices of our energy down to drive our fracking business out of business.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> Or whatever. Maybe they are. I really don't know that for a fact. A lot of people think that. I will say this. We are spending billions and billions and billions of dollars protecting nations all over the world, and many of them aren't paying up. If I get them to pay up, just fair, fair, if I get them to pay up, our country is already a different place.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Republicans have said that Ben Rhodes who now has admitted he manipulated, he lied, he used propaganda to sell that bad Iranian deal and manipulating people in the media in particular, he also, by the way, if you go back to the "Wall Street Journal," the whole you tube video narrative as it relates to Benghazi, he started that lie. Should he be fired?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> He should be fired, maybe more than fired. First of all, the Iranian deal is one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated. I'm not talking about countries. I'm talking about one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> But think back. How about Obamacare? How about the architect of Obamacare? He had a meeting with some of his friends, and I guess they got him on tape or something and he's talking about what a con job Obamacare was. People forgot about that. It's totally forgotten about. Well, Ben Rhodes is the same kind of a thing. Obama has been truly, you could say one of, but I think you could almost say I think he has now superseded Jimmy Carter as the worst president in the history of this country.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Here's I think, and I'm going to give you all the latitude you want. You understand the Clintons. You know their tactics. You know they set up a war room. You know that they will say anything and they've got the media. How does Donald Trump strategize the tactics that you are going to use? How do you defeat her?
<Donald Trump> <Negative> I think the public is very smart. And I have beaten a lot of people over the last year, you know. Many of them are friends of yours. And 66,000 negative ads, and the public got it. They understood. They knew a lot of them were false. Most of them were false. Some not so bad. But many of them were false, and I won Florida in a landslide. You've never seen so many ads.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> I won Florida, I won so many places, landslides, all of them landslides. Indiana, landslide. If you went to Indiana there was nothing but negative ads on Donald Trump.
<Donald Trump> <Negative> They're going to go after me, I'm going to go after them. If she gets in, I think our country will never recover. I'm not only talking about Supreme Court justices. I'm talking about the whole -- and honestly, she can't negotiate with the Chinese. She can't negotiate with Japan, she can't negotiate with Vietnam. It's not her thing. It's not her thing. Number one, she won't want to do it. And number two, I don't know if she knows it's a real problem. And it will basically be four more years of Obama and maybe worse. I think that is why I think I should win.
<Sean Hannity> <Negative> Has it sunk in, you can now be the president of the United States? Are you ready for that?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> It's such a responsibility. Somebody just left my office, actually, and said do you have any idea what going on here where it's such an incredible responsibility. And it is. I have a great responsibility and I'm doing this with the people. We have a movement going on. I go and make a speech in California or wherever I go, Illinois.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Who is going to build the wall?
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Who is going to build the wall? We're going to build, believe, and Mexico is going to pay for the wall. But it is a movement and a beautiful thing to see. These people, the people love this country.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Mr. Trump, thank you very much. Good to see you.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thank you very much.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> Thank you, appreciate it.
<Donald Trump> <Positive> Thanks.
<Sean Hannity> <Positive> That is all the time we have left from Trump Tower tonight. Thank you for being with us. We'll see you back here tomorrow night.
